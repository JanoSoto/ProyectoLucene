It's amazing how Eastwood got his rep as a director when so many of his films are so lazy, flaccid and lacking in pace.

So as soon as I saw the DVD, I bought it, even though it was obviously another Warner Bros. rush-it-out, never-mind-the-extras job.       The movie isn't as good as I remembered -- it's better.

I've seen comments here suggesting that Ned Beatty doesn't show enough reaction after being brutally raped.  Huh?  He's stunned for ten minutes, then tries to attack Bill McKinney's >corpse<.  He's still rattled the last time we see him in the movie, when he tells Jon Voight that they won't be seeing each other for a while.  (Which clearly means forever.)  Beatty's life has been changed; he'll never get over it.     So has Voight's, but in a different way.  For the first time, I noticed that >three< people get into the tow truck when Reynolds hires those brothers to drive their cars to the canoeist's destination.  Sure, that's logical -- there are three vehicles to drive initially, after all.  But why does Boorman take pains to avoid showing us the face of the third person in the tow truck, but does show him fingering the gun in the rear window of the truck?       Could it be because this guy turns up later?  Is he Bill McKinney's character?  Or the Toothless guy?  Or the guy Voight kills?  Which of course raises the most important questions in the movie WAS Ronny Cox shot?  And if he was, was the guy Voight kills the one who shot him?  (And was Voight's victim the Toothless guy?)

But then what about the man we later learn has gone hunting but who hasn't returned?  Why is Voight so shocked when he looks into the mouth of his victim?  Boorman and Dickey give great weight to the scene in which Voight fails to kill a deer.  (Even if he had, it would have been a foolish, wasteful act.)  The interplay between Voight and Reynolds is also very interesting; Voight clearly admires Reynolds on some levels, while finding him disgusting on others.        Dickey is primarily a poet, secondarily a novelist; it's not hard to believe that he intended all four men to represent different aspects of the human condition.  DELIVERANCE is one of the most intricately ambiguous movies of its type ever made; it cannot be pulled apart into easily-understood sections, and where our sympathies should lie is never obvious.  Even the sheriff, played by Dickey himself, has darker shadings that are partly inexplicable.  And there is that shot of the removal of the graves; it's not in there by chance or for local color.

Did we really watch stuff like The Magnificent Seven four decades ago?An intellectually unambitious film, it's hugely dated with corny dialogue and incidental music so loud and over the top it could burst your eardrums. But the real reason why the audience were sheep is that a truly magnificent film, Shichinin no Samurai (8 &#150; not Kurosawa's best, that distinction lies with my favourite film of all, Rashomon, but still an outstanding achievement) was already made. It's depth, poignancy and superb direction were watered down. The powerful black and white cinematography by probably the finest director the world has ever seen was transferred into bland colour, the honourable seven samurais (actually six samurais and a ronin, but seven samurais was a better title) transformed into mercenaries. The samurais defended a village for honour and food. The gunmen do it for cash and glory. All the subtlety and ambiguity is drained from the film, and, considering the original is 203 minutes long (often cut for western video releases, I was lucky enough to catch a version that ran for 190), it never fails to engage. The Magnificent Seven, is, I have to say, boring. A western audience had to have a classic stripped of subtitles and plunged into dumb macho formula, any trace of density or literary merit stamped out. Only then could they accept it.The film's leaning towards pretension gives us some laughable moments of would-be meaningful dialogue. Delivered by most of the seven &#150; Brynner particularly &#150; it can be carried, and by Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera. But when one of the supporting cast, who really aren't that impressive, deliver a line, it becomes laughable. Charles Bronson, too, is guilty of a cringe-making scene where he lectures some of the village children on the bravery of responsibility. There were some interesting additions to the script, such as the village rejecting the seven after their initial failure, and their capture by the bandits. In the seven samurai, failure on such a large scale is non-existent. I also like the way the bandit leader's role is beefed up, though his degree of honour does have the unfortunate distinction of making him more likeable than the seven heroes. Behind the scenes, things were less amiable. Steve McQueen was leading a revolt against Brynner's starring role (a role which was minimal in the original, but built-up for the name actor), and also against Horst Buchholz who had the pretty boy part which McQueen had assumed would go to him. Though many laugh off this revolt, which amounted to no more than McQueen trying to upstage his co-stars, Buchholz can still be quoted as saying I couldn't take his guts. Legal fights also went on for producer and writer credits, squabbles over what is alleged to be the second most played film on American television.Three sequels were inevitably made. Return of the Seven (5) is, in many senses, an improvement on the first film, if only because it's shorter. The dynamic is stronger, with a seven who don't really like each other all that much and a mystery to solve. Rather than waiting for the many men with guns to arrive, here the seven have to track them down. Shichinin no Samurai is again referenced, this time with mills, rain and blockades. Two of the original seven return, though only one of them is played by the same actor, a Yul Brynner who looks tired without the competition of a Charles Brosnan or a Steve McQueen. What stops Return from bettering it's predecessor is the lack of occasion; it has cheap cash-in sequel put together in a hurry written all the way through it. Worst of all, it has a cringe-making stinker of a last line as Chris (Brynner) exclaims I'll be damned. I doubt that, he is told, I doubt that very much.Another flimsy piece of would-be meaningful dialogue marks out the third film in the series, Guns of the Magnificent Seven (6). When a Mexican is asked why his people have such long names, he replies. I don't know. I guess it's because we always have such short lives. What does that mean??? It has no meaning whatsoever, it's complete gibberish! Yet two of the seven look on as if in understanding. For this instalment the original cast have all jumped ship, and George Kennedy is the new Chris. I wonder how he managed to grow all that hair between films? And what sort of name is Chris for a tough cowboy anyway? Lugubrious, less masculine and more ineffectual than Brynner, it's fortunate that Kennedy is backed up by the most interesting seven of the series. Though it could smack of tokenism, we get a cowboy suffering from a severe chest infection, a one-armed cowboy and Bernie Casey as Cassie, the series' only black addition. Though as Cassie is a silent strongman stereotype only there to have racial taunts bounced off him, it's perhaps not that great a feat. There are also some editing problems, white flashes clearly visible for some of the jump cuts. Yet even though the fated members of the seven still struggle on after being shot several times, their enemies getting felled by a single bullet, this is still the best of the sequels. The recruitment vignettes have a more unusual air than before, and Chris finally gets to learn about real honour.Lee Van Cleef was probably the most experienced for the role of Chris when he took on the role for the only 70s outing, The Magnificent Seven Ride! (6). He'd already appeared in 68 prior films, including notable westerns such as High Noon and Bunfight at the O.K. Corral. Chris is now married, bitter and with dubious morality. His role on the right side of the law as a Marshall is interesting in this thoughtful fourth instalment which was different enough from the others to maintain interest. However, while Cleef's Chris is arguably the most exciting interpretation of the character, the rest of the seven are the blandest of all. Most notable is the fact that they've all become two-armed, two-legged Caucasians once more, supporting Hollywood's Persil Policy (Persil Policy, c. my mate Griff). It might have been nice to have a devastating end chapter, but this one closes pretty much the same as the prior outings, though does at least allow Chris to find happiness.And the original? For my money, Guns beats it into second place, though neither are anything outstanding. I do admire the western genre, though it's base manifestation &#150; men with guns kill each other &#150; means it can, be default, be uninvolved. Though it's tiny touches of character &#150; such as Robert Vaughan rueing that he would have been able to catch three flies in his youth, not just one &#150; that elevate it to somewhere near a 6.

Return of the Seven (5) is, in many senses, an improvement on the first film, if only because it's shorter. The dynamic is stronger, with a seven who don't really like each other all that much and a mystery to solve. Rather than waiting for the many men with guns to arrive, here the seven have to track them down. Shichinin no Samurai is again referenced, this time with mills, rain and blockades. Two of the original seven return, though only one of them is played by the same actor, a Yul Brynner who looks tired without the competition of a Charles Brosnan or a Steve McQueen. What stops Return from bettering it's predecessor is the lack of occasion; it has cheap cash-in sequel put together in a hurry written all the way through it. Worst of all, it has a cringe-making stinker of a last line as Chris (Brynner) exclaims I'll be damned. I doubt that, he is told, I doubt that very much.Another flimsy piece of would-be meaningful dialogue marks out the third film in the series, Guns of the Magnificent Seven (6). When a Mexican is asked why his people have such long names, he replies. I don't know. I guess it's because we always have such short lives. What does that mean??? It has no meaning whatsoever, it's complete gibberish! Yet two of the seven look on as if in understanding. For this instalment the original cast have all jumped ship, and George Kennedy is the new Chris. I wonder how he managed to grow all that hair between films? And what sort of name is Chris for a tough cowboy anyway? Lugubrious, less masculine and more ineffectual than Brynner, it's fortunate that Kennedy is backed up by the most interesting seven of the series. Though it could smack of tokenism, we get a cowboy suffering from a severe chest infection, a one-armed cowboy and Bernie Casey as Cassie, the series' only black addition. Though as Cassie is a silent strongman stereotype only there to have racial taunts bounced off him, it's perhaps not that great a feat. There are also some editing problems, white flashes clearly visible for some of the jump cuts. Yet even though the fated members of the seven still struggle on after being shot several times, their enemies getting felled by a single bullet, this is still the best of the sequels. The recruitment vignettes have a more unusual air than before, and Chris finally gets to learn about real honour.Lee Van Cleef was probably the most experienced for the role of Chris when he took on the role for the only 70s outing, The Magnificent Seven Ride! (6). He'd already appeared in 68 prior films, including notable westerns such as High Noon and Bunfight at the O.K. Corral. Chris is now married, bitter and with dubious morality. His role on the right side of the law as a Marshall is interesting in this thoughtful fourth instalment which was different enough from the others to maintain interest. However, while Cleef's Chris is arguably the most exciting interpretation of the character, the rest of the seven are the blandest of all. Most notable is the fact that they've all become two-armed, two-legged Caucasians once more, supporting Hollywood's Persil Policy (Persil Policy, c. my mate Griff). It might have been nice to have a devastating end chapter, but this one closes pretty much the same as the prior outings, though does at least allow Chris to find happiness.And the original? For my money, Guns beats it into second place, though neither are anything outstanding. I do admire the western genre, though it's base manifestation &#150; men with guns kill each other &#150; means it can, be default, be uninvolved.

Did we really watch stuff like The Magnificent Seven four decades ago?An intellectually unambitious film, it's hugely dated with corny dialogue and incidental music so loud and over the top it could burst your eardrums. But the real reason why the audience were sheep is that a truly magnificent film, Shichinin no Samurai (8 &#150; not Kurosawa's best, that distinction lies with my favourite film of all, Rashomon, but still an outstanding achievement) was already made. It's depth, poignancy and superb direction were watered down. The powerful black and white cinematography by probably the finest director the world has ever seen was transferred into bland colour, the honourable seven samurais (actually six samurais and a ronin, but seven samurais was a better title) transformed into mercenaries. The samurais defended a village for honour and food. The gunmen do it for cash and glory. All the subtlety and ambiguity is drained from the film, and, considering the original is 203 minutes long (often cut for western video releases, I was lucky enough to catch a version that ran for 190), it never fails to engage. The Magnificent Seven, is, I have to say, boring. A western audience had to have a classic stripped of subtitles and plunged into dumb macho formula, any trace of density or literary merit stamped out. Only then could they accept it.The film's leaning towards pretension gives us some laughable moments of would-be meaningful dialogue. Delivered by most of the seven &#150; Brynner particularly &#150; it can be carried, and by Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera. But when one of the supporting cast, who really aren't that impressive, deliver a line, it becomes laughable. Charles Bronson, too, is guilty of a cringe-making scene where he lectures some of the village children on the bravery of responsibility. There were some interesting additions to the script, such as the village rejecting the seven after their initial failure, and their capture by the bandits. In the seven samurai, failure on such a large scale is non-existent. I also like the way the bandit leader's role is beefed up, though his degree of honour does have the unfortunate distinction of making him more likeable than the seven heroes. Behind the scenes, things were less amiable. Steve McQueen was leading a revolt against Brynner's starring role (a role which was minimal in the original, but built-up for the name actor), and also against Horst Buchholz who had the pretty boy part which McQueen had assumed would go to him. Though many laugh off this revolt, which amounted to no more than McQueen trying to upstage his co-stars, Buchholz can still be quoted as saying I couldn't take his guts.

Before it eventually spins out of control, this provocative film audaciously confronts a disturbing, but truly pertinent anthropological issue  in a society that, for purposes of its own survival, actively discourages violent behavior, is it possible for a man, conditioned by eons of innate but ever increasingly repressed `hunter\/gatherer' instincts, to ever cut himself loose and be true to his real nature?  And if he doesn't, can he be said to ever be a `real man,' or is he simply a hollow shell allowing society to determine what he values and how he lives?Edward Norton stars as Jack, a man so softened by the amenities of a modern technological culture that he has even replaced pornography with the IKIA catalogue.  As far from his barbaric ancestral roots as any man worthy of the label can be, Jack has turned to haunting feel-good support groups to fill the void his empty life devoted to meaningless culture-driven values has created for him.  Suddenly, into his life walks Tyler (Brad Pitt), a sardonic, tough talking thug, the total antithesis to Jack and a man completely in touch with his male-based instinctive need for simple hand-to-hand physical confrontation.  Together, the two set up an underground club designed to give men like Jack the opportunity to beat the living crud out of each other and therein find their way back to their true primordial selves.Not only does `Fight Club' explore a fascinating and long-overdue theme, it insidiously lures us in to the glamorous excitement of the fight scenes themselves.  Much as we may resist their pull, we are so appalled by the alternative we are shown in the form of Jack's drearily routine office environment, the stifling conformity of his decorator-influenced, perfectly coordinated apartment and the self-aggrandizing emotionalism of the many support groups he visits that we feel as liberated as he does by the simple physical aggression of the unregulated bouts.  This is the genius of the film  it makes us just as cognizant of the compromises we ourselves routinely make to social norms as it does Jack.  What is most impressive is that the film could easily have turned into just another cautionary tale, a violent tract warning us of the dangers of allowing these instincts to run amok.  Instead, the filmmakers have been careful to keep most of the activity in the realm of self-contained mano-a-mano confrontations.  In fact, the club members do not employ guns, and, for the most part, scrupulously avoid hurting innocent bystanders or killing anyone.

Although there are a few steps taken by the group in the direction of involving outsiders in provoked fights and eventually detonating some empty buildings &#150; these are, by the way, the least authentic sections of the film - the violence really doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the club itself. Thus we are spared the tiresome moralizing one might expect from a film exploring this theme.Where, then, does the film ultimately come out on this issue?  Is `Fight Club' a socially irresponsible call for the unfettered use of violence to create societal chaos, or is it a sly black comic vision of a world gone crazy intended to highlight the dangers of just such a situation?  The answer to that question is really not an easy one to come by, for the film itself loses its way in its final half hour.  Having set up this fascinating premise, `Fight Club' decides, rather inexplicably, to go the sci-fi route, setting up a Jekyll and Hyde situation that both undercuts the seriousness of the theme and spells the message out in far too simplistic terms.

Those are the best films out there and EXTREME PREJUDICE into that category.  Walter Hill has long since been revered as a great director by Hollywood insiders and those that know his work.  But if you are a casual fan of film, then you probably have no idea who is and what he has done. But just know this, the man has had a hand in films like all of the Aliens, 48 Hrs and Brewster's Millions.  He is quite versatile in his genres and in his propensity to switch his duties on a film.  He directs, writes, produces and even executive produces.  And in all of that, I believe this is his best film.  Aliens is a great film but that has to be more attributed to Cameron because he directed it.  But this was Walter's from the beginning.  And what we have here is typical Walter Hill brilliance.  It is testosterone laden, a little sexist and filled with colourful characters.Nick Nolte gives, what I think, is the best performance of his career.  He was great in Prince of Tides but he is amazing here.  He plays an incredibly stoic Texas Ranger whose job is plain and simple.  Keep the peace and keep the drugs out of Texas.  It is the latter that gives him a bit of trouble as his best childhood friend, Cash Bailey, played with complete evil smugness by Powers Boothe, is now a major drug influence on the Mexican side of the border.  But stoicism, honour and duty win over comrarderie and memories of years past.  This is the first part of the story.The second part involves the love interest of both men.  Her name is Cerita ( Maria Conchita Alonso ) and both men have loved her for a long time. The issue here is, does Cerita have enough love to stay with Jack and his average life or does she want to sacrifice love and go for wealth and power with Cash?The third part of the film is the best part and it is the story that involves a covert military team of supposedly dead war heroes.  Every one of the team, when put into the computer, shows up as dead.  One died while difusing a bomb, the other in a helicopter crash and so on.  This supporting cast is one of the great casting jobs and as another reviewer said, one of the best ensembles put together, including Reservoir Dogs.  Clancy Brown plays Larry McRose, Michael Ironside plays Major Paul Hackett and William Forsythe plays Buck Atwater.  Forsythe has the best performance in the film and this is a film that is rich with great performances.  I think the only reason that he got overlooked in 1987 was because this was a litttle scene film and Carolco was still in it's infant stages as a studio.  But if Mario Kassar or Andrew Vajna released this picture now it might get a better look and more respect, but that is a different story.This covert team is apparently in Texas to get some documents that are in Cash Bailey's possession.  But what they are really there for, no one knows, and that includes all of the team except for Hackett.  So somehow, all three stories and all of the individuals are going to cross paths until you have the final gunfight.  Now I am not an expert at gunfights nor have I seen every film out there that has great gunfights, but this has to be up there as one of the best.  It goes on for about fifteen minutes and there are some really great shots of people dying and blood spraying and such.Extreme Prejudice is a tour de force in direction and it is a great script. All of the actors give some of the best performances of their career and if you can give this film a chance ( it seems kind of slow at first ) you will be rewarded.There are only a few reasons why you are reading this review.  One of them is that you have seen the film and you want to see what other people think about it.  Another is that you are checking out Nick Nolte's filmography and this is one the films you haven't seen or the same could be said for the other people involved in the film.  I'm sure there are other reasons but if the reason I just mentioned is why you are here, then let me just tell you this.Rent this film, please.  You will be very surprised and if you like intriguing characters and a great script with one of the best gunfights in film, then this is one film that you should see.  It is now 13 years old but it hasn't aged at all.  I watch it about twice a year and I still get a kick out of it.10 out of 10A true hidden treasure.  And with lines like  Hey as long as I got a face, you got a place to sit, and  Jack Benteen, Texas Ranger, big son of bitch ain't he? and my favourite,  (Brown)Strange. (Ironside) What is?

And haunting.See, Three Kings is not about heroes or enemies, but about something as pure and honest as doing the right thing. This media labelled `war movie' is about overcoming adversity, finding a purpose and belief in life and making the right decision.Today the distance from actual reality to any given human being is larger than ever. One would think that with all the abundant technology and knowledge available, that it would lead to a more rational, united and focused contribution by those who have &#150; to those who have not. Cultures clash and financial interests clearly determine which way the wind blows. So it's sometimes hard to keep a straight face and just chew the popcorn. The world of consumerism &#150; from cellular phones to online grocery shopping &#150; seems awkwardly pitiful and tragicomic when there are countries plagued by hunger, famine, natural disasters and war.  Russell's Three Kings manages to address all these issues indirectly as the first real Gulf War movie of substance. At the same time; it's probably the best that'll ever surface.  The amazing workmanship lays the groundwork. Russell has a firm grip on evocative story-telling and throughout the movie presides a grungy, alternative and hip feel to the proceedings with his use of hazy and grainy cinematography (by Tom Sigel). There's also an acute awareness of motion picture coloration. Scenery is shot in watery beiges and greys giving the sun-scorched desert a feel all of its own. The time period is also perfectly depicted. There's a genuine sense of being back in the chaos and confusion of an Allied army camp during the 1991 Gulf War.  `Are we shooting or what,' a US soldier asks his comrades as he stands in the desolate desert, confused, bewildered and boyishly intoxicated by the whole hype of being in actual war for the first time. Iraqi forces are surrendering left and right, so who knows when to shoot or not? He doesn't know and he doesn't get an answer. So he shoots. The victim is killed, huffing and puffing to a slow and cruel death. He was waving a flag and surrendering. But who could tell?The shooter is young Sergeant Troy Barlow as played by Mark Wahlberg. The former singer and rap artist, today a fine actor of grounded realism. It seems to come natural to him. I always considered Wahlberg to be a grittier long lost brother to the more rigid Matt Damon.   Another key scene shows us Barlow in agonising pain as he is being tortured in captivity by Iraqi soldiers. One of many scenes that define the triumph of Russell's coyly manipulative movie-making. We now see a man who is starting to understand a little more about the politics of war. It's a tough scene, and one where the audience is sure to have turbo-charged ambivalent emotions racing inside.  The sergeant is just one of many richly-textured characters. George Clooney is charismatic and totally embodies the role of Major Archie Gates &#150; a  man of high intelligence and questionable moral but also of a charming blue-collar loyalty. Spike Jonze as redneck hick Conrad Vig and Ice Cube as the philosophical African-American Chief Elgin exchange punches and hugs and are both compelling, while Nora Dunn bears a striking resemblance in etiquette to an actual CNN broadcaster of the time.  Säid Taghmaoui brings life, reason and compassion to the most difficult role the Iraqi interrogator. Taghmaoui is scintillating. Russell's characters are first and foremost human beings and not Hollywood stereotypes. That's the essence of Three Kings; his story-telling is gutsy and reflective throughout.From the craziness and moody lunacy of the whole Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the subsequent CNN-covered liberation by US, Canadian and European forces, Three Kings is brimming with razor-sharp wit and a genuine respect for all parties involved in the conflict. Former false modesties and nervous ironies of this horrible war are completely blown to smithereens in a clever and crude manner. History teaches us that in times of war all logic and reason heads for the nearest exit. When Barlow phones his pregnant wife from deep inside an Iraqi base on a stolen cell-phone amidst heaps of stolen electronic goods it's a logical move. The situation, however, is beyond sanity. Russell shrewdly shows us both.  The story of stealing gold bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold by taking advantage of the cease-fire agreement sounds like an old John Wayne movie. But Three Kings is formula the way that Kelly's Heroes was. And it goes a step further and becomes a very confident hybrid of movies like M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove. Fickle wartime policies are made out to ridicule but not necessarily overly judged. The breathtaking visual ingenuity is staggering (there's even a `bullet-cam') and works to effect. It helps intensify the complete insanity of it all.   Three Kings plays with our conscience and is both funny and absurd enough to keep us guessing until the very end.

Russell has a firm grip on evocative story-telling and throughout the movie presides a grungy, alternative and hip feel to the proceedings with his use of hazy and grainy cinematography (by Tom Sigel). There's also an acute awareness of motion picture coloration. Scenery is shot in watery beiges and greys giving the sun-scorched desert a feel all of its own. The time period is also perfectly depicted. There's a genuine sense of being back in the chaos and confusion of an Allied army camp during the 1991 Gulf War.  `Are we shooting or what,' a US soldier asks his comrades as he stands in the desolate desert, confused, bewildered and boyishly intoxicated by the whole hype of being in actual war for the first time. Iraqi forces are surrendering left and right, so who knows when to shoot or not? He doesn't know and he doesn't get an answer. So he shoots. The victim is killed, huffing and puffing to a slow and cruel death. He was waving a flag and surrendering. But who could tell?The shooter is young Sergeant Troy Barlow as played by Mark Wahlberg. The former singer and rap artist, today a fine actor of grounded realism. It seems to come natural to him. I always considered Wahlberg to be a grittier long lost brother to the more rigid Matt Damon.   Another key scene shows us Barlow in agonising pain as he is being tortured in captivity by Iraqi soldiers. One of many scenes that define the triumph of Russell's coyly manipulative movie-making. We now see a man who is starting to understand a little more about the politics of war. It's a tough scene, and one where the audience is sure to have turbo-charged ambivalent emotions racing inside.  The sergeant is just one of many richly-textured characters. George Clooney is charismatic and totally embodies the role of Major Archie Gates &#150; a  man of high intelligence and questionable moral but also of a charming blue-collar loyalty. Spike Jonze as redneck hick Conrad Vig and Ice Cube as the philosophical African-American Chief Elgin exchange punches and hugs and are both compelling, while Nora Dunn bears a striking resemblance in etiquette to an actual CNN broadcaster of the time.  Säid Taghmaoui brings life, reason and compassion to the most difficult role the Iraqi interrogator. Taghmaoui is scintillating. Russell's characters are first and foremost human beings and not Hollywood stereotypes. That's the essence of Three Kings; his story-telling is gutsy and reflective throughout.From the craziness and moody lunacy of the whole Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the subsequent CNN-covered liberation by US, Canadian and European forces, Three Kings is brimming with razor-sharp wit and a genuine respect for all parties involved in the conflict. Former false modesties and nervous ironies of this horrible war are completely blown to smithereens in a clever and crude manner. History teaches us that in times of war all logic and reason heads for the nearest exit. When Barlow phones his pregnant wife from deep inside an Iraqi base on a stolen cell-phone amidst heaps of stolen electronic goods it's a logical move. The situation, however, is beyond sanity. Russell shrewdly shows us both.  The story of stealing gold bullion out of an Iraqi stronghold by taking advantage of the cease-fire agreement sounds like an old John Wayne movie. But Three Kings is formula the way that Kelly's Heroes was. And it goes a step further and becomes a very confident hybrid of movies like M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove. Fickle wartime policies are made out to ridicule but not necessarily overly judged. The breathtaking visual ingenuity is staggering (there's even a `bullet-cam') and works to effect. It helps intensify the complete insanity of it all.   Three Kings plays with our conscience and is both funny and absurd enough to keep us guessing until the very end. The message being that bad intentions are sometimes a necessary vice to clarify what good intentions look like. Three Kings is original entertainment. It's enlightening and engaging as it reopens closed history books.   ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"4 June 2000","score":"","review":"  This film is Murray's best work to date.

The movie concentrates on Wilson (Stamps Character)seeking out Valentine and avenging himself of anybody who steps in his way. Excellent support given by Luis Guzman and Leslie Ann Warren. Stamp is so convincing in his role, and his dialogue is so cool! He should have been given at least an Academy Award nomination. Steven Soderbergh does a great job of directing and grafting in earlier cuts of a film made previously by Stamp. Credit should also go to the young hit man with the pony tail who gives a couple of hilarious monologues during the movie.The young actress who plays Peter Fonda's girlfriend is absolutely stunning.

Naturally he thinks he's probably losing it but soon afterwards he has a vision of a floodlit baseball field where the corn should be. Ray is haunted by the spectre of his late father (from whom he inherited the farm), & is afraid that at 36 he is becoming just like like him, a man who he only remembers as being old before his time, who `never did one spontaneous thing in all the time I knew him'. Motivated by this fear & also by his having grown up in the 60's with it's embracing of free & spontaneous living, he decides to go ahead, plow down some corn & build the field. Ray decides that the &#145;he' refers to a famous baseball player named &#145;Shoeless' Joe Jackson, who was part of a team who accepted money to lose the 1919 &#145;World' Series. Although he took the money it was very clear from the quality & manner of his play that he was not playing to lose, but, along with most of the team, he was banned for life anyway. Ray felt the field was to somehow give him a 2nd chance to take up the game he loved & was perhaps unfairly prevented from playing &#150; which is even more weird than building the field as Jackson died in 1951!

Eventually &#145;Shoeless' Joe, or at least his ghost, (Ray Liotta) does find his way onto the field, along with the rest of his team, & they are happily knocking the ball about. &#145;The Voice' however hasn't finished with Ray & he feels directed to go to Boston to meet seminal 1960's author & civil rights activist Terence Mann (James Earl Jones), & take him to a baseball game &#150; so off he goes.    Meanwhile the farm is in danger of repossession &  Ray is forced into making a decision&#133;I think it's important to point out that this is NOT a film about baseball, despite appearances, & despite the game receiving it's fair share of passionate eulogising. This should come as a relief to us Brits, & to most non-Americans, as baseball - & the quasi-religious passion it seems to generate in the States - makes about as much sense to most of us as the English game of cricket does to the average American. Instead baseball is used as a metaphor to highlight the film's major themes, & used to brilliant effect.Now, I like to think I'm not a particularly sentimental type of guy; however, I've now seen &#145;Field of Dreams' 3 times, & every time I found it to be the most powerfully, gut-wrenchingly moving film I have ever experienced. It's done in a completely non-sentimental & non-cliched way - yet there are scenes & situations here that if you aren't at least touched by then, to paraphrase Bette Davis, you probably need to &#145;put your VCR where your heart should be'. I'm not going to spoil the ending by giving away too much detail, but Costner beautifully delivers a line there that I think ranks alongside Rutger Hauer's `Time to die' in &#145;Blade Runner' as probably the most moving in cinema history &#150; made all the more so because of it's simplicity.  It's this simplicity that I think is one of the film's strengths; everything is beautifully understated & by this director Phil Alden Robinson allows the power of the story to create it's own impact. The dialogue is as you would expect from ordinary people talking in ordinary ways (albeit in an extraordinary context); the settings are banal; & the acting &#150; particularly Costner &#150; is beautifully understated to match. The cinematography is terrific & somehow manages to transform these very ordinary settings into magical places &#150; places `where dreams come true' - & running throughout the film is a simple but hauntingly beautiful musical theme which complements the magical atmosphere perfectly.The screenplay too is superb &#150; clever, politically astute, deeply moving & at times very funny. The scene where Ray 1st meets Terence Mann & tries to get him to come to a baseball game with him is one of the film's highpoints & is extremely funny & witty &#150; two Hollywood heavyweights in top form slugging it out brilliantly. All the acting is first rate Jones is as mesmerising as ever, Liotta is perfect as &#145;Shoeless' Joe, Madigan is ideal as the starry-eyed supportive wife, even Gaby Hoffman is terrific as their very young daughter, & there's an absolutely magical cameo by Burt Lancaster - but if ever anyone should doubt the star quality of Kevin Costner those doubts should be dispelled by his performance here. He is utterly convincing as an ordinary but open-minded guy dealing with heavy issues, & his performance is laid back & charming but at the same time charged with powerful emotional intensity.   One of the things that most struck me about this film is the perfect symmetry of it's structure the story unfolds at just the right pace, & is rounded off in a climax which takes us right back to the film's beginning, tying up loose ends & brilliantly forcing us to view the story in a quite different light.

They also become cartoon mice as well and end up in a 1940's detective crime drama. One scene I particularly love is when John Ritter transports himself to the Three's Company set, and screams when Krissie Snow and Janet ask Where have you been?!. best in-joke I've ever seen in a film. The acting is pretty decent for a low-budget film like this, although the Knable daughter and son are more wooden than a tree and Eugene Levy is very annoying as Crowley, Mr. Spike's assistant. I think the best part of this are the parodies of the TV shows. Rent this for a couple of laughs.

Chan knows himself and his movies, and he sticks to his strengths in Shanghai Noon, and produces a solid action-comedy, but one that doesn't really benefit from the big screen.Chan is Imperial Guard Chong Wang (say it aloud fast) who is the baggage carrier for a delegation sent from the Forbidden City to the American West to rescue a kidnapped princess. Early in the film, Wang is separated from the rest of the delegation and ends up unwillingly partnered with bumbling outlaw Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). As the two continue on to rescue the princess, much of Chan's signature fight scenes and comedic bumblings are spoon-fed to the audience.Chan knows his strengths are inventive fight scenes mixed with doses of humor. In an early fight with Crow Indians, Chan throws hatchets at the warriors, only to see them plucked out of the air and returned at him. The wide-eyed surprise on Chan's face, coupled with his hasty retreat, is funny material. Later, in the camp of friendly Indians, Chan gets high on a peace pipe, while the Indian leaders insult him in their native tongue.That was one of the many things that leant realism to this film. Costuming, historical depictions of the old West, and language all give this film a sense of having really happened. Chan liberally sprinkles Chinese and Native American among the English, using subtitles as appropriate. Except for one scene at the end of the film, no one uses English who should not be using English.And no one uses English better than Wilson. His inept cowboy doesn't even realize how bad he is; rather, he spends his time congratulating himself on how smarter he is than the run-of-the mill outlaw. Like Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, Wilson is the comedian to Chan's straight man. He keeps up a running patter throughout the film, but unlike Tucker, his patter is streamed in a low, soft voice with minimal use of profanity.Director Tom Dey shows a deft touch as he mostly stays out of Chan's way. He gives the martial arts star plenty of room to move and showcase the amazing stuntwork that has propelled Chan from Hong Kong to Hollywood. Chan uses traditional Chinese weaponry, evergreens, moose antlers and horseshoes with equal dexterity. The wild West gives Chan plenty of opportunity to showcase his creativity, and he takes every advantage.The only real downside to this film is that nothing is sized for theatrical release. The FX are minimal--the stars are Chan's stuntwork and Wilson's mouth, not the action. The scenery is mostly muted, and the Western vistas few and far between. This film will look much the same on video as it did on the big screen. Which is, when you think about it, fortunate. This is a film that you'll want to see many times over because Jackie Chan is always fresh, active and funny.
