Amadeus. The man. The music. The magic. The madness. The murder. The mystery. The motion picture. Anyway, this movie is very great. The acting is great, the music is great, the scenery is great. It is just one of those lovable classic films.So I guess from just the title of the movie, you can assume that this film is based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A biography if you may say. However, this movie is NOT a strict biography of Mozart's life. The movie is not a musical biography like Walk the Line or Ray. So if you were planning to learn all of the small details of Mozart's life, you ain't getting that in this movie. In fact, the background of the movie is based a lot on superstition and creative thinking with the relationship between Mozart and Salieri. We start off with Mozart's life in the movie with him proposing to Constanze, who is later known to be his wife and only wife. Before Mozart got married, there was so much more to his life as a child with the abuse of his father and having to travel all over Europe that could have supplemented his movie. Because in this movie, we learn that Mozart was not exactly a nice guy to be with. He was a social misfit, all because of a childhood he never had which was replaced by his father making him tour over Europe and showing off his musical abilities.The main premise in this movie is about Salieri and the whole idea that he might have killed Mozart. Salieri tells the story from his perspective to a priest in an asylum about Mozart. Salieri was the most famous composer in all of England, but once Mozart came about, Salieri became a has-been. This got Salieri angry and the growing jealously of Salieri got him to the point where he dedicated his whole life to destroying Mozart. And like I said before, we do not know if this is true that Salieri did kill Mozart.But enough with the negativity. I thought the acting was brilliant. Tom Hulce acts well as the unattractive and rowdy Mozart. F. Murray Abraham being Salieri was also just as great if not greater than Hulce. I mean they were both persuasive with their acting and used the material they were given for their characters and played it well. Also, there were scenes in the movie that you can tell required a lot of hard work to create because they either had a lot of men and women in the scene or because there was a great amount of sound editing going on. The director's cut clocks at three hours, but I guarantee you that you will be spell bounded for those three hours. Because although the movie does not have a fast pace, it still keeps you locked in.I would say that the movie did have some scenes were it felt kind of 80s such as Mozart's antics and sexual insinuation that was placed in the movie. But none the less, this is a great story and I am glad that it was not a strict biography, because to tell you the truth, after watching this film, I would prefer this film over a strict biography. The creativeness that Forman and Shaffer add to it makes the movie only more special.Low eight.

And then I kept looking at the DVD box that said that he won an award for it as well. Never really liked him as an actor, but I guess he has some strength in writing.So the film is about a young adult named Will Hunting. We see that he lives alone in a small house because his parents abandoned him, works as a janitor at MIT, and spends most of his nights with his friends at bars. But what we also learn in this movie is that Will Hunting is a genius; he has incredible strengths in the fields of not only mathematics, but in all other subjects as well. And when a professor finds out that it was Will Hunting that solved the two Algebraic graph theory problems that was supposed to be solve by a student, rather than a janitor right outside his hallway, the professor goes out to help Will. Under the professor's supervision, Will must educate himself more with Algebraic graph theory class with the professor and sees a therapist two times each week.The rest is just about him trying to find himself. This movie is great and nobody can doubt it. I mean, the message that the movie brings really entertains me because sometimes we can not judge others for just how they may act everyday. It also shows how there are many individuals out there in the world that may have really high IQs, but do not know how to apply it to daily life. And that is what Will Hunting exactly is.Now I have seen Robin Williams a lot in stand up comedy and he was really funny. And there were some parts in the movie that Robin Williams was funny. But I am telling you, the Juilliard studying really came out in this movie. He was persuasive with the character he was playing and had parts where he had to keep expression that many actors struggle to have. And those actors are not even comedians like Robin Williams. Matt Damon also acted well going from charismatic joking to deep depressing attitudes. However, I really did not care for Affleck or Driver's acting. It was alright. The thing was that once you saw Damon and Williams act, those two were okay.The only problem I had with this movie (and if it were not for this problem, I would be giving this film somewhere in the eight range), was that there was unneeded raunchy dialogue and cursing during the back and forth discussions with Will Hunting and his little entourage. I get it that the movie takes place in South Boston, a ghetto if you may say. But still, really? Cursing to make a movie sound good? I mean, I have seen movies where cursing is used a lot more than this film, but there were scenes in this film where you really wanted them to be poignant and because one of the character said the f-word in an incorrect spot during the dialogue, it ruins it. This goes for Damon, Affleck, Williams, and Driver.But this movie really tied up things great in the end. Everything that may have been confusing all comes down well in the end and you get a piece of reality once you finished this movie. I was going to give this movie a low seven as I watched it, but only when you finish this movie, I will have to give it now a high 7. Usually highly-recommended films would be eight or higher, but I say that this would be a nice movie to watch.

On his 11th birthday he learns that he's a wizard when he's invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Once he arrives at the paranormal prep school he becomes friends with the clever Hermione (Watson) and the courageous Ron (Grint). He also encounters the hilariously outlandish instructors (Harris, Smith, Rickman and Hart) and the gruff but gentle groundskeeper (Coltrane). While Harry and his friends compete with the other houses on campus, they are also drawn into an adventure involving a mysterious wizard who wants to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. The courage and cleverness of his friends rubs off on Harry and, as the movie ends, his life as a young wizard is... just beginning. REVIEW 3 1\/2 of 4 Java Mugs The movie version of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has been long awaited by young readers and their parents, and they won't be disappointed. The screenplay is quite faithful to the book and is fascinating enough to hold any audience's attention despite the 2 1\/2 hour length. Episodes are strung together without much transition or explanation but this is a minor fault, since it allows that much more of the story to reach the screen. The dialogue is fast paced and witty, with plenty of high-spirited humor.Some of the movie's best lines come from Coltrane's character who keeps amazing himself by revealing secrets he is supposed to keep. Radcliffe admirably inhabits Harry's trademark eyeglasses and closely matches the visual image that has emerged from the buzz around book series. As the character closest to normal, he is our guide into the movie's weird and wonderful world. Watson and Grint are also delightful as his cohorts in conjuring. The witches and wizards who run the arcane academy are played with enormous relish by some of the best British actors at work today, led by Harris, Rickman, Hart and Smith (who, like Jean Brodie, seems forever in her prime).There are wizards off-screen, too -- those in charge of bringing key episodes to life. Lavish cinematography and imaginative set design capture the central images of the book, including the high-flying Quidditch match (played on turbo-powered broomsticks) and the crucial Wizard's chess match. Computer visuals are combined with actual locations to give the setting a sort of realistic unreality. John Williams' superb score further enlivens many of the key scenes. And there's more to come. Kloves has already written the screenplay for the second installment and is currently adapting the third novel, while Rowling is about to publish her fifth book in the series.

On his 11th birthday he learns that he's a wizard when he's invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Once he arrives at the paranormal prep school he becomes friends with the clever Hermione (Watson) and the courageous Ron (Grint). He also encounters the hilariously outlandish instructors (Harris, Smith, Rickman and Hart) and the gruff but gentle groundskeeper (Coltrane). While Harry and his friends compete with the other houses on campus, they are also drawn into an adventure involving a mysterious wizard who wants to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. The courage and cleverness of his friends rubs off on Harry and, as the movie ends, his life as a young wizard is... just beginning. REVIEW 3 1\/2 of 4 Java Mugs The movie version of J. K.
