[{"date":"21 November 2012","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" One could be right in saying that the crossover period between 1999 and 2000 Mel Gibson spent in front of the camera was epitomised by all of the desire for revenge; the need to challenge a ruling patriarchy and the ill-witting stumbling into a situation wherein encouraging people to stand up and believe in a burning desire for liberation is key to his presence. In Brian Helegeland's 1999 remake of Point Blank, entitled Payback, Gibson played out the role of angered lowlife striving for a bloody revenge on a man who wronged him before further still taking on a dominant ruling force and finding love where he didn't expect it. In Nick Park's Aardman clay figurine driven animation Chicken Run, he voices a rooster who quite literally crash lands into a chicken farm and whose desire to be free of the restraints of the scattered coops did not match their owners lust for them to produce eggs. It was here Gibson's character, through one means or another, became an idolised beacon of hope prefigured by those in desperate need of leadership. Where both films clock in at about a hundred odd minutes in length and get the job done, Roland Emmerich's The Patriot just doesn't quite make the grade. It isn't as much fun and nor is it about as substantial, in spite of the fact it is the length of both these movies put together and allows for its lead (Gibson) to wade through similar content.For sure, the film is that of Gibson's - in spite of the fact a handful of characters not limited to that of his eldest son Gabriel (Ledger) and a true to life British General named Cornwallis (Wilkinson), often strike us as going through plights that are more interesting. The project will eventually come to form one of those often tired circular journeys which begin on the homely sanctuary of a farm before ending on one after all the chaos; skirting with an enemy and experiencing life and such has played out. Along the way, the lead will be faced with the opportunity to bury the grief he has for a deceased spouse as well as discover the chance to rid himself of the post-traumatic stress disorder he has carried with him when specific wartime acts many-a year ago left him in startled awe at what he was capable of on a battlefield. The film has been branded as being about the dangers of pacifism, and it is a credit to the makers for addressing the crux of such a matter without indeed glorifying warfare.The lead is Benjamin Martin, a widower, and he lives on a South Carolina plantation in 1776 where the African Americans are paid; his youngest kids run through corn fields with warm smiles on their faces and the maid bakes pies for supper (although mercifully, she does not leave them on the sill to cool). Trouble is brewing, and war with the English (only later referred to as the British) over control of these East Coast states not limited to New York and Massachusetts is desired by most of the local council. Martin, troubled by what he experienced himself in the Franco-Indian wars, rejects the idea but is largely ignored when a crucial vote passes. Through one thing or another, he is dragged into the conflict when it quite literally arrives on his front door step and his family is befallen a tragedy; a tragedy instigated by a snarling villainous British Colonel named Tavington (Isaacs), who kills one of his sons and burns down the farm.From here, Emmerich launches the piece into a post-Last of the Mohicans; sub-Braveheart (with splashes of Saving Private Ryan on account of the Robert Rodat screen writing credit) wartime thriller as that of the British Empire crush the American infantry before tables are turned through the sole help of Martin and his guerrilla troops with whom he had previously fought. Along the way, Emmerich will, in equal measure, stall as well as kick things on; there is a lull to proceedings for about forty minutes as the second act tries to kick in and we await formal hostilities between that of Martin and Tavington to start, whereas attempts to touch on issues resembling that of Civil rights are more-so dolloped than subtly slid into proceedings to prop up the primary focus.There are things about the film one is able to admire, it provides us with a likable hero; a nasty antagonist and a number of supporting acts whose respective tales of romance and war time strife do well to just about justify the runtime. Emmerich resists depicting comically inclined British bad guys going up against brave, heart-on-the-sleeve Americans and allows for antagonism to transpire in both camps. Alas, it is an admirable failure. Granted, it falls into being one of those war films wherein the two key people, who are required to fight, are able to spot one another during the climactic battle wherein chaos and killing is all around them whilst they stand still and immune, but you go with it. The result is something fairly pedestrian, but not without merit.

Knocking around is the tarot reader Solitaire (Seymour), a girl whose own plight of independence and ascent into womanhood is just as interesting as Bond's investigative strand as she begins to clash with Kananga's established patriarchy. It is first established how her mother once worked for the same man doing the same thing, and that she lost her abilities, something that is later revealed to be more broadly linked to the of a finding a man and falling for them. The use of the word Solitaire to double up for Jane Seymour's character's name, traditionally speaking a card game one plays alone, infers degrees of individuality or being by one's self.

Indeed, Bond is torn from the world of espionage or the warring with the Soviets and instead placed into a domain that sees him go up against the illegal drug trade.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"21 November 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" To a personal extent, Star Trek Insurrection felt like a list of small, blank boxes on a plain piece of white paper gradually being filled out with a series of ticks. Let that not sound like a criticism, for it was not so much a film running through of any sort of formulae that induced this reaction; rather, it was the sense I got as to how distant it felt to that of the last entry 1996's wholly disappointing First Contact. For the record, First Contact was the first in this line of Star Trek films I did not especially take to, nor observe much therein to warrant a recommendation; but what director for that film and this one alike, Jonathan Frakes, has done is to correct each and all of both the problems and issues I had rear up in First Contact so as to allow for an enjoyable entry rich in mystery; adventure and that feeling one needs in films such as these that different worlds, times and the-like are actually being explored and engaged with.Granted, the opening sequence for this 1998 entry is straight out of Blue Velvet in tone and general aesthetic, but for all the meek complaints about how familiar it may or may not look, one cannot argue there is more of a sense of cinema at play in those opening few minutes than there was in the whole of 1996's aforementioned damp squib. Secondly, and where I was not at all fond of how Frakes created 2060's Planet Earth in First Contact (at no point did we get the feeling it was unfolding in an age of post-Nuclear War), amends have been made as to Insurrection's authenticity in that regard a genuine feeling that things are playing out on a planet we've never before seen featuring swaths of people undergoing their own cultural possessions authentically and defiantly. Gone too are the lousy Borg villains led by someone who looked more suited to being in Roger Vadim's sci-fi monstrosity Barberella, replaced by proper antagonists this time with principals; political motivations and actual menace. Like the best Star Trek films, this is about the adventures to worlds which exist within the minds of science fiction writers, although are quite fun to think might actually exist out there in the universe when we glance up at the sky on a clear night.The film depicts the on-going adventures of the new Generation of Enterprise commandeering folk, folk who took over from the crew that laid the foundation in the form of Shatner's Kirk et al. We begin with an appetiser featuring android of the series Data (Spiner) running amok during routine observation missions on a charted planet yet to fully bloom into a race of inter-planetary travelling people, events which will eventually lead to stalwart Picard flying out over there with his crew and check the place out. Initially, Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard is stuck in a procession of having to attend formal functions with other space creatures; forced into adhering to their strange cultures and coerced into being as polite as possible, even if it means donning odd clothing and having to learn alien languages he's never heard of. We used to be explorers, he mutters en route to yet another nullifying, humiliating evening of standing around and holding a glass of whatever in that way that's supposed to make you look cultured.In true Search for Spock fashion (still my favourite entry), after hearing of events involving his close non human-being counterpart that might very well affect their well-being on a grandiose scale, he slinks away illegally and off to the aforementioned planet to check things out. Once there, one of StarFleet's own in Anthony Zerbe's character says all the right things but leaves enough to be doubted, while F. Murray Abraham's bizarre creature Ru'afo reiterates said sensation out of the fact he just looks weird. Picard sticks around, and sure enough uncovers a fiendish plot to do with the eco-makeup of the planet which allows for certain fantastical things. Granted, the film has its roots in cinematic pop-culture (what with the scenes involving Picard and the natives striking us as Dances With Wolves-esque), while the overlying tract about certain people putting aside technological phobias and embracing machines too often reminds us of James Cameron's Terminator 2. Observe, if you will, the film's scenes between boy and machine and how they echo Furlong's own with Schwarzenegger's titular robot. Additionally, recall Sarah Connor's reaction to actually being granted the opportunity to destroy the allied T-800 in said film. Stopped by her own son, she comes to realise (epitomised by that handshake nearer the end) that there was indeed a place in their plight for this machine and that he served his purpose and served it well.In lining these up against First Contact's cinematic roots of inspiration (a sort of poor man's sci-fi Die Hard with a little bit of what constituted as an Alien sequel back then thrown in for bad measure), we observe plateaus of inspiration that are of an ilk requiring substance the bond between a man and a woman; the recognising of technology (or modernity) as an item one can fall back on, and not Grab the gun, run around, defeat the monsters. Frakes atones for the monstrosity that was First Contact with Insurrection, something he does so well that we forgive him for casting himself in a role that sees him get a spaceship dogfight manoeuvre named after him.

For the record, First Contact was the first in this line of Star Trek films I did not especially take to, nor observe much therein to warrant a recommendation; but what director for that film and this one alike, Jonathan Frakes, has done is to correct each and all of both the problems and issues I had rear up in First Contact so as to allow for an enjoyable entry rich in mystery; adventure and that feeling one needs in films such as these that different worlds, times and the-like are actually being explored and engaged with.Granted, the opening sequence for this 1998 entry is straight out of Blue Velvet in tone and general aesthetic, but for all the meek complaints about how familiar it may or may not look, one cannot argue there is more of a sense of cinema at play in those opening few minutes than there was in the whole of 1996's aforementioned damp squib.

We begin with an appetiser featuring android of the series Data (Spiner) running amok during routine observation missions on a charted planet yet to fully bloom into a race of inter-planetary travelling people, events which will eventually lead to stalwart Picard flying out over there with his crew and check the place out. Initially, Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard is stuck in a procession of having to attend formal functions with other space creatures; forced into adhering to their strange cultures and coerced into being as polite as possible, even if it means donning odd clothing and having to learn alien languages he's never heard of. We used to be explorers, he mutters en route to yet another nullifying, humiliating evening of standing around and holding a glass of whatever in that way that's supposed to make you look cultured.In true Search for Spock fashion (still my favourite entry), after hearing of events involving his close non human-being counterpart that might very well affect their well-being on a grandiose scale, he slinks away illegally and off to the aforementioned planet to check things out. Once there, one of StarFleet's own in Anthony Zerbe's character says all the right things but leaves enough to be doubted, while F. Murray Abraham's bizarre creature Ru'afo reiterates said sensation out of the fact he just looks weird. Picard sticks around, and sure enough uncovers a fiendish plot to do with the eco-makeup of the planet which allows for certain fantastical things. Granted, the film has its roots in cinematic pop-culture (what with the scenes involving Picard and the natives striking us as Dances With Wolves-esque), while the overlying tract about certain people putting aside technological phobias and embracing machines too often reminds us of James Cameron's Terminator 2. Observe, if you will, the film's scenes between boy and machine and how they echo Furlong's own with Schwarzenegger's titular robot. Additionally, recall Sarah Connor's reaction to actually being granted the opportunity to destroy the allied T-800 in said film. Stopped by her own son, she comes to realise (epitomised by that handshake nearer the end) that there was indeed a place in their plight for this machine and that he served his purpose and served it well.In lining these up against First Contact's cinematic roots of inspiration (a sort of poor man's sci-fi Die Hard with a little bit of what constituted as an Alien sequel back then thrown in for bad measure), we observe plateaus of inspiration that are of an ilk requiring substance the bond between a man and a woman; the recognising of technology (or modernity) as an item one can fall back on, and not Grab the gun, run around, defeat the monsters. Frakes atones for the monstrosity that was First Contact with Insurrection, something he does so well that we forgive him for casting himself in a role that sees him get a spaceship dogfight manoeuvre named after him.

I imagine a figure at the forefront of these investigations of immense patience, perhaps a rough but almost always methodical looking individual with the ability to sit and stare; to sit and watch; to ride the storm of sometimes absolutely nothing at all if it means wading out of the other end with something that'll help in the long run. Alas, 1993's Another Stakeout seems to think otherwise; an often loud, often brash and almost constantly unfunny movie dealing with the above like a Looney Tunes cartoon would the issue of hunting rabbits.The film is the sequel to a fun buddy comedy from a few years previously; a film entitled Stakeout, and, if like me, you use minimal effort to read into where the brainstorming started in order to come up with such a title for this second film, you'll probably deduce that a third entry would've read something like YET Another Stakeout. Such a title, albeit hypothetical to a film that does not exist, conjures up a sense of the laborious; of the necessary although undesirable, and therein we deduce the gradual arc of the nature of both where these films MAY have gone, and where we're at with this particular entry. At the core of it is this comedic black hole is a threesome consisting of Rosie O'Donnell; Emile Estevez and Richard Dreyfuss. Veterans of the first Stakeout film will identify two of the said three, Estevez and Dreyfuss, who respectively played police officers Bill Reimers and Chris Lecce. Veterans will also recall how well they combined in the middle of a tale which very gradually built into a menacing reality as Dreyfuss' character underwent a few changes in regards to his attitudes towards women and the true extent of their actual case blew wide open.These three are called upon to watch over a specific house in an easy-on-the-eye locale in the American city of Seattle; the reason being that it is home to a missing young woman named Luella Delano (Moriarty), whose testimony to an ugly recent incident involving innocents and police officers in Las Vegas caught up in a killing spree is paramount in nailing some crooks. In the meantime, however, the residence houses her parents Dennis Farina's Brian O'Hara and his wife Pam (Strassman). The set up is simple if she turns up at her family home, then the police have her and those who instigated the aforementioned Nevada chaos go down. But all of this is largely irrelevant for the duration of the film, as our leads slot into a facade of being the new next door neighbours and begin to engage in a series of wacky encounters built purely on the fact O'Donnell has brought her dog along with her and that Dreyfuss is a little miffed at being framed as his co-workers' husband\/son as cover. There is a moment where the pseudo family are invited over for dinner, in what should be a centrepiece of comedy running on binary opposition and falsified stories (from both sides) as the O'Hara's try to cover up their daughter's situation and our leads disguise their policing backgrounds. But it runs aground; it doesn't get going. It begins to rely on that sharp pain one gets in the head when one devours ice cream too quickly.Depressingly, the film goes on to undo all of the good work from the first. Gone are the lessons Dreyfuss learnt, his relationship with Madeleine Stowe's Maria character, of whom was central to the stakeout in the first, is on the brink of terminating and Dreyfuss comes across as all of a sudden obnoxious and unlikeable. Gone too is any sort of rapport between the leads, with the majority of it just three people in a room shouting at each other. Where things worked in the first film, things collapse two-fold here; the sense that these people are at all qualified police officers worthy of the job they're on is suddenly all-but-lost, while the producer's decision to throw in O'Donnell reeks of a panic whereby going bigger and better is suddenly the solution to a problem that never existed.If ever there was an opportunity for a film of this ilk to drive forward with drama and heightened tension, it would be in a situation whereby the restricted view of an area we're aware the importance of is at the forefront of proceedings. In this scenario, a sense of cinema relies on facial expressions; the image and, if anything, a LACK of dialogue so as to not distract from the ensuing drama. One's mind boggles at a certain scene whereby Estevez charts the bathroom habits of his newly acquired targets, talking to himself in the process and using specific buzzwords more broadly linked to these excretal activities. It is quite incredible that a fully grown adult was even responsible for the construction of the sequence. And so, the film is a rank failure; one of those rare instances whereby the psychopath who pops up at the end to kill everyone actually gets our vote of approval to just do away with everyone. 2007 German film The Lives of Others was a pinnacle of sorts in its depiction of this clandestine world of observing and reporting; of swimming through the trouble of a delicate scenario; of getting under the skin and into the heads of those directly involved in both the observer and the observed.

Although this movie only came out at the drive in, I love this movie, every time I watch it. I remember seeing the shorts, and from there I took a vested interest in it, and when it finally came to viewing time, I was in no way disappointed. James Spader is the rebel who gets on the wrong side of the Tuffs, the most feared gang in high school, led by Mick, a fantastic ferocious performance by Paul Mones who outdoes Spader in the acting league. He brings to the role a truly, scared, feared, pathetic, pitiable character. Even though it runs over two hours in running time, time just breezes past in this movie, that saw Robert Downey Junior in one of his first roles, as an out there student\/wannabe rocker, who befriends Spader. He brings that same Downey charm as he does in all his roles, even though he only has a small one. The movie opens up with a great soundtrack, as our rebel crusader, Spader, prevents a mugging from the Tuffs, which is how he ends up on the wrong side of them as they happen to attend the same school, that he's just started at. To make things worse Spader falls for the gang leader's woman, Frankie (Kim Richards in an impressive, dynamic, and very real performance, proving later on that's she's not as tough as she acts out. Spader is just average in his role, nothing special, where the older actors are better also. For an R rated movie, this one is quite tame, one scene involving a dead rat hanging in Spaders locker, it's blood dripping onto Spaders books. Sometimes it only takes one scene, but even for under eighteens (I was 16, 9 months when I saw it) this is one you should get your parents to go out and hire for ya. Let's face it, Silence of the Lambs would be much more disturbing than this. Some unexpected surprises arrive in this film too, with Spader and friends (and that includes, Mick's girl) crash a good club posing as members, skimming the huge buffet, smorgasboard, but funny too, is the way they blend in with the other folk, Downey always the comedian. And if this isn't a surprise enough, Spader gets Frankie up on the piano, and sings this beautiful song to her. This is one cool movie, it's climax a blockbuster, realistic as the whole movie is, with an optimistic ending that makes the whole viewing worth it. Fine quality drama, with great music tracks and believable characters. Anyone who disses a film like this needs a brain transplant, immediately.

The directing from Mel Gibson is decent. Not exactly perfect, but still good.

The Scotland setting and the england setting are amazing to look at not to mention it's beautiful costumes the actors had wore. James Horner's music score is powerfully emotional and tear-jerking which makes it by far his best work before his score for the later film Avatar from James Cameron.Overall, Braveheart may be flawed and I do understand that some people hated it, but I think that this is a great film that will always be recommended to die-hard Mel Gibson fans.

It's as stylish as anything he's done, and maintains a gritty, fairly sleazy atmosphere and a deliberate pace. Kathleen Turner is striking in the role of China Blue, a lady with a double life by day she's a fashion designer (real name Joanna Crane), by night she's a hooker. She fascinates two men, one of them an ordinary guy named Bobby Grady (John Laughlin), the other a fanatical, so-called preacher named Peter Shayne (Anthony Perkins) who claims to be out to save her. Bobby was hired by Joannas' boss to tail her, and she presents the young man with a fresh view of the world; his relationship with his uptight wife Amy (Annie Potts) has soured after years of marriage, and he's happy to meet somebody who doesn't have any hangups about being intimate. The movie is never quite as outrageous as some viewers may expect, but that doesn't mean that there isn't some explicit imagery here and there. Its few sex scenes are done in a surprisingly tasteful manner, but its dialogue is quite kinky, witty, and delicious; it's amazing to hear ever reliable Perkins, extremely well cast in one of his typical nutty roles, utter lots of obscenities. He's just fantastic as always, and the lovely Turner delivers a multi dimensional performance worthy of some respect. Laughlin and Potts are both fine, and the cast also features people such as Bruce Davison, Stephen Lee, Norman Burton, Peggy Feury, and Gerald S.

Working from a screenplay by producer Barry Sandler, Russell injects the film with plenty of humour; just the idea of Perkins carrying erotic paraphernalia around with him is a hoot.

It may require a bit of patience on the part of some viewers due to its unhurried nature, and of course some may find the subject matter a turn off.

Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror\/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare witch hunts of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.

A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror\/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams.

The film opens with a now iconic title sequence by Saul Bass, complete with a pulse pounding Bernard Herrmann score. The angular, diagonal lines of Bass' sequence then transition into a series of bustling New York City shots, followed by the brisk introduction of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a high flying advertising executive. Opening scenes stress Thronhill's past alcoholism and propensity for lying. This is the film's great boy who cried wolf joke the film's about an untrustworthy advertising executive (who lies for a living) being repeatedly ignored when telling the truth.Hitch started his movie career in 1919, designing graphics and cards for Lasky Studios. After three years as an assistant director he directed his first feature film, The Pleasure Garden, in Munich Germany. This was a British\/German co-production, a collaboration which led to the director slowing absorbing traits from the then burgeoning German Expressionist Movement, a movement which fed off a rise in existential philosophy and various post WW1 crises. Hitch would then direct a series of silent thrillers, in which he slowly evolved his own very distinct style. This style typically mixed a little expressionism with pop modernism, high fashion and early 20th century advertising\/graphic design. The demands of silent thrillers also instilled in Hitch a strong sense of pace, cutting and visual economy. At his best his films are clean, sleek and fast, whilst also oozing a gloriously operatic kind of BIG MELODRAMA, which runs almost counter to their machine-like dispassion.These conflicting traits are all found in North by Northwest. It's at once Hitchcock's most famous thriller, and his longest, most lazily paced. Its at once an expressionist nightmare, and a slapstick popcorn comedy built around Cary Grant's own slapstick past. Its at once a lean silent thriller, and a bloated big budget production. These contrasts lend the film an interesting quality, but would also negatively influence over a century of copycat Hollywood thrillers which trawl for demographics and try madly to be everything to everyone all at once. Every year Northwest is released a couple dozen times under a different name, some new running man wrongly accused of something whilst tracking down a McGuffin in an attempt to solve some completely arbitrary problem. In each case the objective is the same to construct a roller coaster plot which exists solely to facilitate action scenes.Francois Truffaut picked up on this decades ago The most appealing aspect of these sequences is that they're totally gratuitous. ... It's a scene that's been drained of all plausibility or even significance. But it's precisely that gratuity - which you're criticised for - that gives the scene all of its interest and strength. How can anyone object to gratuity when it's so clearly deliberate? Truffaut's talking about an audacious, drawn-out, near-silent crop duster sequence in Northwest, which Hitchcock elevates to something special. Today, though, with the rise of set-piece cinema, virtually everything's gratuitous. Still, you can't blame Hitch for his children. Northwest is itself less dumb action movie than some kind of ornate, pop-modernist artifact; it's more vase than movie. Hitchcock's lines are clean, his colour coordination superb, and everything seems oh so neatly arranged. The film's art director was Robert Boyle, who in collaboration with Hitchcock gave the film its distinct look, with Frank Lloyd Wright houses, some Beaux-Art and lots of early 20th century MidWestern architecture, complete with hipped roofs, horizontal bands and ornamental rock walls. Hitchcock's aesthetic captures a kind of early 20th century American optimism; faith in industry, modernism, technology, slick ergonomics, money, decor, furnishings, top Industrial Designers (Henry Dreyfuss) and finery, even if they thematically say something else.Hitchcock saw Northwest primarily as a comedy (To me it was one big joke. I practise absurdity religiously; I wanted Grant in Lincoln's nostril), Truffaut as a nightmare, to which Hithcock also agreed (I'm ill at ease with the ordinary). But the film's also very very sexy, thanks to screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write the ultimate Hitchcock thriller and who gives the film lots of risqué banter between Cary Grant and actress Eva Marie Saint.The film goes some interesting places, has some fabulous shots (an overhead, external shot of the United Nations Building kills you) and set pieces, but it's also mostly a bubblegum plot with a now dated finale, stiff\/old hero, bad rear-projection, corny jokes and some dull conversations. The film's title is a reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet I am but mad north-north-west, Hamlet says, epitomising Thronhill's own anxieties. Of course no north-northwest exists on the compass. It's a metaphor which implies that Thornhill, like Hamlet, is a little out of tune.Like The Man Who Knew Too Much, much of the film plays with identities, charades, performances and role playing; everyone's pretending to be someone else, unsure who they or others are and appearances are constantly deceptive. Cold War paranoia &#x96; the film's about foreign spies and US counterintelligence &#x96; infuses everything, the film portraying rotten government bodies who callously throw lives away and who nurse paranoia at the expense of ordinary civilians. This is all encapsulated by climactic scenes in which our heroes dangle from the stony, uncaring faces of Presidents (a return to the climax of Saboteur). As if to punctuate the point, Hitchcock slips into the cast, unbilled, several victims of the blacklist (Joseph Wiseman etc).All of Hitch's films have psycho-sexual weirdness. Here Eva's mid-film betrayal of Thronhill only echoes his own misogynistic past. She turns Thronhill's sarcasm and suspicions back on him, though they do eventually fall in love. Grant's character, incidentally, is constantly being mistaken for a federal agent. He played one in Hitchcock's Notorious. Maybe that explains it.8\/10 - Worth two viewings.

I really have seen many of movies which is inspirational,motivational and it is among one of best of them , another are A Beautiful Mind and The pursuit of Happiness.

The producers, admittedly, attempted to capitalize on the sci-fi bandwagon of the late 70s taking major liberties with the original story and rocketing James bond to space. On the cover of it all, indeed even the movie poster itself, this is a laughable scenario. But in practice, I'm not sure it's actually enough to doom this Bond outing. In my opinion, Moonraker is far from the worst Bond movie, and actually quite enjoyable.All Bond movies are a product of their time. All these movies are a great reflection and pulse of their respective contemporary popular culture. So while today it is easy to say Moonraker is a cheesy forgettable Bond movie, I'd say you never saw Live and Let Die or Octopussy. Essentially, you've already seen Moonraker. Just like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker is yet another re- working of You Only LIve Twice which was really just reworked from Thunderball. A water\/space craft is stolen and taken to an underwater\/outer space fortress to wreak havoc on the free world. That's pretty much it.So you think Moonraker is cheesy? Space Shuttle cheesy? Did nobody actually watch Goldfinger and the laser beams, razor Odd Job hat, or Thunderball jet pack? Jaws is a good guy cheesy? Well Lois Chiles' Goodhead is pretty laughable, but runner up to the raciest double entendre after Pussy Galore. There are no stupid poison tipped knife shoes. Bond does not build a helicopter from a briefcase or dress up as a clown. Moonraker is definitely riding the coattails of the near perfect success of The Spy Who Loved Me, one of the top two Bond movies ever in my book, and it's a great piece of entertainment with a nice, if nonsensical, title song. There is no perfect or reference Bond film. They are all just escapist entertainment with flaws keenly visible on any repeated viewings. Many people want to point to Goldfinger as the, er, gold standard, but it's cheesy as heck in every way. While Connery is easily the best 007, I think On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Goldeneye are the actual movie benchmarks. But don't fool yourself thinking Bond is anything more than a two hour fantasy. Even the really bad ones like Die Another Day, License to Kill or Live and LEt Die are watchable. Moonraker fits nicely in the middle. Don't be a snob, Moonraker isn't a comment on the human condition but it's fun and entertaining in a way the dour and stale Skyfall isn't. Cut it some slack. Space Camp from 1986 is much worse than this.

They took bits and pieces from at least four different books and threw them together, badly. They watered down V.I. (tho Turner did a hell of a job of working through it). The movie loses its way at the end. It's just a mess. The directing was half-hearted. And they never got much of the character of Chicago, which is a major part of V.I. herself.This could have been a great movie. V.I. is one of the great unsung female characters in mystery fiction. Chicago is one of the great cities of the world. And the stories in the series are full and complex. And this movie wasn't any of it.It's good for the hardcore Kathleen Turner fans.

The look and feel of the film is just outstanding, given when it was made it is a tremendous achievement! The film also proves that special effects are nothing new; just look at the robot transformation scene and tell me that would have been easy to do in 1927!

Just looking at the movie poster in combination with the title, it appeared to be some disgusting BDSM movie between a minor and a middle-aged man (barf). So while I was racking my brains trying to figure out why my mom would order such a movie, I read a couple reviews saying the title was misleading- it is. Kind of. I still felt like barfing in the end.Overall, this movie did not possess or enthrall me. I definitely think the plot had a lot of potential, but it wound up coming off as sappy and contrived. Personally, I didn't feel emotional at all during this film. I was expecting to be able to relate to Leelee Sobieski's character, and while I felt she gave a good performance, the actual writing made her too unbelievable, inconsistent, and at times just really unlikeable. It was hard to connect to her. Another problem I had was with the passage of time. It felt like things were happening too abruptly- before I could really become emotionally engaged. On a more positive note I will say, there are some gem moments in the script and cinematography that made it worth the watch. A couple scenes stood out to me as particularly memorable for their lines and stylistic execution. Not a horrible movie, but not one I would recommend to my friends.
