The result of that unusual requested visions happened to be a unique, interesting, and original movie. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction defines itself as a distinctive film that will amuse, shock, and hold the audience in suspense. Tarantino crafted his work in the mid- 90s, a time when originality was lacking in film industry, everything had a formula that had to followed to be considered a technically good movie. Roger Ebert claimed, there are film classes, computer programs, and websites telling exactly how a movie should be made. The result of that is losing the one thing that movies are supposed to about artistic expression. So what did Tarantino do? He showed the industry that every artist has their own voice. There shouldn't be collated, specific formula, because then the audience has the industry solved and rings out all magic is left to be discovered. In Pulp Fiction took three overplayed story lines and made us watch the awkward scenes. What we wouldn't see in other movies, the time in between the action. The meaningless conversations you and I have every day with our friends and family. That is another thing missing from movies back then, humanity! On top of the risky, futile dialogue driven scenes, Tarantino mixed up the chronological order of the picture. And on the cherry on top of Tarantino's sundae is the misfit, creepy characters he asks us to identify with. Yet, through all of that the movie manages to soar and define itself as reputable piece of art. And that's the simplest and best way to sum up Pulp Fiction is art. Not only through Tarantino's inventive screenplay, but through his delicately placed direction. Each shot is filled with something unique that'd driven by the motivation of the characters or the overall arc of the story. It's a masterfully directed piece. The direction is even more artistic than the screenplay. With the screenplay, as much work as Tarantino put into penning the words, the actors are in control of the success of those words being told. In the direction, Tarantino is in control and he never relinquishes that control making the audience really feel plunged into the idiotic situations the characters end up in. There are moments where Tarantino injects huge laughs, chiseling thrills, and always retaining the humanity of the story. The three stories are all different, they are their own piece, that all work toward the same goal of each other, however each section has it's own tone and exclusive arc, they all end with the same two things a saving of someone's life and a secret. I believe Tarantino intended for that to be a metaphor for a director\/writer in their creative world making their movies. To be successful they have to work to save the industry they are releasing their films to and they have to keep their own voice to themselves and be unique, so no one else can steal their style. Beyond Tarantino's creative efforts much lies behind the walls of Pulp Fiction. Tarantino adds to the film's statement of Hollywood by finding a way to inject movie references of some of the highest regarded motion pictures, including The Godfather. The film editing bounces off the screen, staying true to the characters at hand and the film's plot in the moment. It's tight, brisk, and entertaining, while still saying something. With such a strong effort from its direction and screen writing aspects, it's clearly stated that it's not going to be an actors movie, though the four principle actors deliver some great work. The standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson, his best works lies with the final scene of the movie. It's a heated scene and Jackson only adds to the intensity. Bruce Willis highlights his career with his role, while John Travola and Uma Thurma deliver fine acting jobs and line deliveries as well.The definition of Pulp is written on the screen for us before we meet any of the characters at the start of the picture, defined as a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter and a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.

As a result, the animated features that came out during that time, such as The Black Cauldron (1985), were significantly inferior both critically and financially to the films produced during the Golden Age of Disney Animation. The Little Mermaid is an important film for Disney in that it restored the Disney Studio's profitability and quality of their animated features. This film was responsible for starting the era known as the Disney Renaissance, a period from 1989 to 1999 which saw such landmark animated features as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). But aside from its importance to Disney, does The Little Mermaid stack up to the best Disney flicks? Let's take a closer look. We follow a teenage mermaid named Ariel who is fascinated with the human world and collects any random discoveries, such as forks and pipes, she finds that is related to life out of the ocean. One night, she saves the life of a human prince after his ship is destroyed and falls in love with him. There is one problem regarding Ariel being in love with this human. Her father King Triton hates humans and has told Ariel never to go to the surface again. But Ariel has already fallen completely in love with this human prince that she's willing to do anything to be with him, even if it means going to see the sea witch Ursula about it. Much has been said about the film's main character Ariel. While some critics and audiences praise Ariel for how independent she is compared to her predecessors, there are others who say that she isn't the best role model for young girls to look up to. Personally, I can see where both sides are coming from. Along with the main character from Alice in Wonderland (1951), Ariel was one of the first leading female Disney characters who didn't rely on any other creature or person to make decisions for her. In fact, she commits more than one rebellious action such as saving the life of a human prince and seeing the sea witch against her father's wishes. That's the first time we've seen a Disney princess do something like that. Whether you like her or not, at least give Ariel credit for being more assertive than all of the Disney princesses before her. But on the other hand, Ariel is considered a Disney princess which means little girls will look up to her as a role model. The problem with this of course is that she is a teenager who doesn't make the wisest decisions to say the least. That's not to say that she's a bad character by any means. It's just that her character may send the wrong messages to little children. Despite the unintentional flaws with her character, she still has good spirit. What surprised me is how well developed her father, King Triton was. It's rare to have a parental figure in a Disney animated fairy tale to be fully developed and have a dilemma of their own. I love how he has trouble figuring out what to do with Ariel and how he has a certain amount of guilt whenever he feels he was being too hard on her. Also equally awesome is the main villain Ursula. On top of her unique design and the obviously wrong advice she gives Ariel about what men really like about women, she's having a blast being evil. The fact that she's having fun with whatever she does makes her all the more enjoyable as a character. Of course, the music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman is phenomenal. We all know and love the songs particularly Under the Sea, Poor Unfortunate Souls (a great villain song for Ursula), Les Poissones (the chef in this song is hilarious), and Kiss the Girl. What makes these songs so good is that they keep the story moving along as good musical numbers should and they are all witty both in their lyrics and rhythm. The voice acting is well done except for whoever voiced the prince since it was really bland and monotone. The animation is a return to form for the Disney Studios. After a stretch of animated features with sketchy drawing lasting from 101 Dalmatians (1961) to Oliver & Company (1988), The Little Mermaid has much more detailed animation than anything that came out since Sleeping Beauty (1959). Come to think of it, almost everything about The Little Mermaid is a return to form for the Disney Studios, isn't it? From the animation to the music to the story to the characters, The Little Mermaid has enough terrific things about it that one can be willing to look past the flawed message the film provides and just enjoy it for what it is. This is a highly entertaining Disney animated fairy tale that would only be the beginning of an outstanding new era for Disney.

As a result, the animated features that came out during that time, such as The Black Cauldron (1985), were significantly inferior both critically and financially to the films produced during the Golden Age of Disney Animation. The Little Mermaid is an important film for Disney in that it restored the Disney Studio's profitability and quality of their animated features. This film was responsible for starting the era known as the Disney Renaissance, a period from 1989 to 1999 which saw such landmark animated features as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). But aside from its importance to Disney, does The Little Mermaid stack up to the best Disney flicks? Let's take a closer look. We follow a teenage mermaid named Ariel who is fascinated with the human world and collects any random discoveries, such as forks and pipes, she finds that is related to life out of the ocean. One night, she saves the life of a human prince after his ship is destroyed and falls in love with him. There is one problem regarding Ariel being in love with this human. Her father King Triton hates humans and has told Ariel never to go to the surface again. But Ariel has already fallen completely in love with this human prince that she's willing to do anything to be with him, even if it means going to see the sea witch Ursula about it. Much has been said about the film's main character Ariel. While some critics and audiences praise Ariel for how independent she is compared to her predecessors, there are others who say that she isn't the best role model for young girls to look up to. Personally, I can see where both sides are coming from. Along with the main character from Alice in Wonderland (1951), Ariel was one of the first leading female Disney characters who didn't rely on any other creature or person to make decisions for her. In fact, she commits more than one rebellious action such as saving the life of a human prince and seeing the sea witch against her father's wishes.

No. Rosebud was actually, in reality, Hearst's pet-name for his mistress's (Marion Davies) clitoris. (It's true.

During his years in Hollywood (beginning in 1926) he managed to make a lot of enemies and alienate scores of celebrities with his drunken antagonism, including the likes of William Hearst and Marion Davies.Mankiewicz died in 1953 at the age of 55 from cirrhosis of the liver (a disease caused by alcoholism).

Not exactly. Neither does the synopsis. Well guess what? It really isn't that exciting. Despite a good but not very big performance by Michael Caine, The Cider House Rules is a long, dull, slow moving drama with a story that doesn't really serve a purpose.Based off of the novel, the film revolves around an orphan named Homer (Tobey Maguire) who has spent his whole life in an orphanage. The doctor there (Michael Caine, carrying a strange but not that bad southern accent) has trained Homer, and Homer is sort of a doctor. But Homer wants to go out and see the world. So when a soldier and his girlfriend (Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron) show up one day, he goes with them to their orchard to work and see the world and fall in love and all that sappy crap.For starters, I don't like the main character. Homer leaves the orphanage, and immediately forgets about it. He grew up with them, they are his family, and he doesn't even care. Then, this nice couple invite him to go with them, and so he starts banging Charlize? Huh? What? It's wrong. Not only that, the movie is predictable, cliché, and hokey. It's as if director Lasse Hallstrom was begging for an Oscar. Well, he didn't get it.But for some reason, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, director, supporting actor (Caine, who won), and adapted screenplay (which also won, for some reason). Maybe on paper, this sounds like quite the film. But on screen, it sort of falls apart. I was sort of bored to death, waiting for more moments with Michael Caine.Caine won the Oscar over Tom Cruise in Magnolia. While watching this movie, I tried to wrap my head around just why he won. I'll tell you why Because he's Michael friggin' Caine. He's fantastic, and he's not bad in this movie, but he really didn't blow me away. He is in it for about twenty minutes. Okay, fine, more like forty. But it's not like he gets a scene worthy of an Oscar here. Cruise is amazing in Magnolia, and I know Caine is amazing, but Cruise is even more amazing in that movie.Overall, I just don't really like the movie.

After the first few minutes you get the idea that the producers are trying very hard to suck you into the story, and are passionate about the characters they have been tasked to portray. And I must say, they do a good job. I found myself fascinated by Edmond and his growing predicament. I felt his joy when he was about to become captain, and be married to Mercedes, and I got a good sense of his pain and loss when he was thrown into prison and tortured; just as I had when I read the book. Even if it was a cheap film, I liked it. A lot.Until....Pinning down the exact point at which the film went wrong is difficult for me. As Dontes emerges from prison I was greeted by a different picture than what was in the source material. Immediately characters were out of place, situations changed, and entire intrigues and subplots dropped. I was, needless to say, disappointed. However, I disregarded my feelings at this point, reminding myself that the book is stupefyingly long and probably wouldn't work well on film if shot in entirety. This excuse doesn't last, however.As we preceded further things got even more entangled and misplaced. I began to feel betrayed, in all honesty.

I tried to evaluate this movie as a standalone film, as I often do in book-to-movie scenarios. But when I did that, all that was left was a story about a man who gets wrongly imprisoned, escapes, gets rich, throws his rivals in prison, has sex with his long-lost girlfriend, and then kills someone.

Wallace, trained by his uncle Argyle Wallace (Brian Cox) after his father was killed holds nothing back in his vengeance on the English. Wallace does not see this fight as needing anyone else involved, but all of Scotland stands with him to rid Scotland of the English. Mel Gibson did a fantastic job taking the legend of William Wallace and adapting it to a modern day representation of what audiences want to see. Forbidden love, heart, honor, and action all rolled into one great movie portraying the underdog fighting back against a seemingly unstoppable foe. Braveheart has even more conflict than just that of Scotland and England. During Wallace's fight we also see King Edward fight with his son's choice of companionship as the attempt to produce an heir to the throne only causes more tension in the kingdom. Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) from France becomes the bride of Prince Philip (Stephan Billington) and finds herself in the middle of the conflict and does a wonderful job of dealing with Prince Philip, Wallace, and King Edward I. Conflict also ensues with Scotland's Nobles fighting with each other for rights to land and succession to the throne. Battle scenes were done quite well by my point of view. Whenever you have that many actors there is bound to be some mistakes, I didn't even notice them until most were pointed out to me. The editing of the battle scenes must have been a long and painstaking task on its own.

Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) from France becomes the bride of Prince Philip (Stephan Billington) and finds herself in the middle of the conflict and does a wonderful job of dealing with Prince Philip, Wallace, and King Edward I. Conflict also ensues with Scotland's Nobles fighting with each other for rights to land and succession to the throne. Battle scenes were done quite well by my point of view. Whenever you have that many actors there is bound to be some mistakes, I didn't even notice them until most were pointed out to me. The editing of the battle scenes must have been a long and painstaking task on its own. Matching emotion and lighting, blood stains and wounds, who had an arrow in their butt and who lost limbs, what a mess. Steven Rosenblum did a fantastic job with the editing. Mel Gibson seems to have a thing for the English, if you like Braveheart you need to also see The Patriot (2000). In this he also is wronged and sought out by the English, forcing him to fight back only to have all of colonial South Carolina stand behind him as he fights to protect his family. Braveheart is a great movie and very entertaining. As some reviewers and history buffs pointed out, there are many flaws compared to the original story and time line, but stories are written by those that want to entertain.

Cinema takes an obnoxious, bizarre and graphic form and results in the creation of one of the most scariest and shocking film experiences. It's hard to believe that this film had a very low budget and was shot with a 16 mm. All the elements such as the jaw-dropping stop motion effect, the incredible metallic soundtrack, the smart sound mixing, the extreme film editing, the black and white cinematography and an highly innovative story come together beautifully and prove that cinema, indeed, is limitless and low budget can never suppress a man's vision. At times, the film takes a (deliciously) surreal form but we never lose our grasp on understanding Tetsuo's story-line. This film is not, even for a millisecond, afraid of throwing the most bizarre and gut-wrenching images at it's audiences (Which are hardly pretentious, for the record). There is, supposedly, a metaphor hidden in Tetsuo that man has developed a 'fetish' for machines and has been consumed by it. The film graphically shows people transforming into hybrids of metal and flesh which was quite brilliantly filmed. The idea of recycling metallic scrap as props was a smart move!This film is, obviously, not for everyone. And whether you hate it or love it, Tetsuo still manages to rape your senses (I loved it!), giving you an experience that is totally new. I warn you again that this film is extremely bizarre and experimental so enter at your own will. A nightmarish near-masterpiece that easily beats David Lynch's Eraserhead, a film which had originally inspired Tetsuo.4.7\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2013","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Shinya Tsukamoto's cult classic Tetsuo the iron man (1988) simply is beyond words!

Apparently this thing started off as a higher-budget R-rated horror film but then the budget was slashed and they decided to aim at the kid market. Well, this here was obviously a mistake because what remains in the film is a semi-horror film that's too tame to go all the way yet at the same time there's really nothing here that would appeal to children. I think the producers forgot that they were trying to aim this at kids and instead us poor viewers were left to suffer. The story itself is a pretty silly one that takes way too long to get going. At just 82-minutes this film seems twice as long and this might be due to the fact that the actual ghoulies don't appear until around the forty-minute mark. Even when they do arrive they don't exactly bring any excitement with them as they're just not scary enough to have any impact. A lot of the violence is also off screen so gore fans aren't going to get any of that here. Even worse is that there are a couple sexual scenes here that have been toned down and in this condition they just really don't serve any purpose to the film. Of course, in a R-rated film they might have at least been used just to show off some cheap nudity. The performances are pretty much what you'd expect from a film like this. John Carl Buechler does a fine job with the special effects but sadly they're not used nearly enough. GHOULIES might appeal to those who enjoy bad 80s movies but the rest should just stay clear.

RE-ANIMATOR is certainly a film like nothing anyone had seen up to the point of its original release. Yes, there had been dozens of mad scientist movies but this one here manages to mix gore, sex, violence and comedy unlike any other film before and director Stuart Gordon deserves a lot of credit for taking all of those elements and making them work so well together. What I enjoyed most about the picture is the fact that you never quite know where it's going to go next. The film takes all sorts of wild turns as the doctor's experiments just grow more outlandish and dangerous and especially once another doctor gets put into the mix. This other doctor also has one of the most outstanding scenes in the film but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. However, once you've seen the film then you'll know what I'm talking about. Combs is perfect in his role as the crazed scientist and I really enjoyed how serious and how dark he played the character. Abbott is a lot more fun in his over-the-top style but the two actors work perfectly well together. Both David Gale and Robert Sampson are fun in their parts and Barbara Crampton is wonderfully charming as the girlfriend. RE-ANIMATOR is about as good as a film like this is going to get as all the elements work well and director Gordon perfectly pulls it together.
