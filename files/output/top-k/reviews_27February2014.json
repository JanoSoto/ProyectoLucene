Superman had a mature feel that was lacking in say the 60's Batman TV show and the serials of the 1940's but still had an innocent charm. Tim Burtons Batman at the time was dark and adult and ushered in the more serious take on superheros, popularised with the X Men and Spiderman films in the late 2000's. Batman however is more than just the beginning of a cultural phenomenon but an excellent movie to boot with a good cast, solid story, great set pieces and the best visual design of any comic book movie. First as usual the acting. Jack Nicholsons scene stealing performance of the Jokers remains my personal favourite. He handles the dark humour very well, with a particular highlights being the scene where he is coming out of surgery and when talking to the burnt corpse of one of his victims. These are classic Joker scenes that both creep the audience out while amusing them at the same time. The best scene however is the TV commercial which is so surreal its hilarious and Nicholson owns the role, even under his pretty cool make up. Michael Keatons casting had fanboys up in arms but fortunately they made the right choice in his casting. He remains the best live action batman, able to come across as tortured but not overdoing it. He also is menacing as Batman. You get the sense he is at times as mad as the villain hes fighting and thats a good thing-Batman is already a concept only a madman would dream up. The supporting cast is pretty good. Kim Basinger while a damsel in distress is a good enough actress to still give her character some personality. Both Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl are very likable as Alfred and Knox respectively while Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams are decent in his their role of crime boss Grissom and DA Harvey Dent (Am I the only one who wanted to see Billy Dee Williams in a sequel?). Tracy Walker is also memorable as Bob the Goon who is a good sidekick to the Joker. The role of Commissioner Gordan in this isn't very well written although Pat Hingle tries his best. The batmoblie, Batwing and Batsuit have never looked better. Compared with the chrome and flashy lights of Schmarcher and the super gritty military style of Nolans this is sleek, cool looking and faithful to the comics. The look of Gotham was done by Anton Furst who rightfully won an Oscar for his work-the Art Deco buildings, the surreal designs and the '30's clothing all fit in perfectly with the Batman aesthetic. Its clearly a comic book world and the film benefits all the more for it. Gotham has its own identity to it which makes the film all the more unique. Danny Elfmans score is not only the best of his career but also one of the best film scores ever, Every tune is memorable with Batmans and the Jokers themes being particular highlights. Tim Burton is a surprisingly serviceable action director. On their own the action is OK but Elfmans score makes it seem more impressive. The Batwing scene is the best in the movie along with the Axis chemical firefight and the confrontation at the Cathedral. The story echoes film noir and is very well told and paced. The themes of revenge are present but are not hammered in your face like the Nolan movies which in my opinion gives this film the edge-its more subtle in its delivery. While the story is far fetched the film builds a world where it doesn't matter. The Jokers plan is crazy, but so is the Joker. I like how this isn't an origin story but we still have some backstory. Many comic book stories often have the main character becoming their alter ego in the middle or at the end but here hes Batman from the start. I think overall I prefer this approach. Although the film maybe to heavily focuses on Joker I do think they develop Batman with his romance with Vicki Vale being decent enough. There's some humour here contrasty of Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. The only problem is the out of place and very dated Prince songs. While their not awful they could have easily been cut out. In recent years this films has had a negative backlash, probably from Nolan Bat-fans. I first saw this film after viewing the Dark Knight and would say to ignore them. Instead enter a comic book world of violence, romance, dark humour, revenge and action. Batman has aged well and continues to be not only the best Batman film but the best comic book film out there.

This is the truest depiction of gangland L.A. you'll ever see. Sometimes it's too close for comfort. Aging, veteran L.A cop, Duvall and his new hot headed partner Mcgavin, nickname Pacman (a great written character for Penn-suitably brilliant, one would say) are after a killer, Rocket (a young Don Cheadle before he moved into more serious straight arrow characters) who's smoked a homie from another gang. Violence shown is occasional, sometimes heavy, but really when only necessary. Penn and Duvall form a great team, part of a unit called CRASH, crimes only related to gangland. Unlike Riggs and Murtaugh, they're always disagreeing, or getting into some heated arguments. It was great, the family scene, where Duvall invited Penn and his new date over for lunch after a quite thrilling car chase, where their squad car has just upturned. But too, one of my favourite scenes, was Duvall lecturing Penn in his backyard, about the hang ups Penn's future has in law enforcement, where Penn defends himself, arguing his points, totally the opposite of Duvall, who's like the mediator of the duo. Penn's points about not buttering up these homies, and not getting respect is true, but then again you have to gain respect, where Penn's character would have zero tolerance on that one. When Penn goes too far, like a cop having a bad day with these nemesis's, Duvall's retaliation, knocking Penn back in line, was truly something unexpected. It then has Penn, balking. This was truly a powerful moment. Damon Wayans was a hoot as a gang member parading shirtless, in a stereo place, bunny uniform and all, until his act is brought to a standstill. The whole near two hour movie has our dynamic duo, and other enforcers, trying to track down Rocket, that lead to interrogations, where we take delight in watching Mr Macho Penn, do his thing, one scene I would love to acted out. Also we have a sub plot, an accidental shooting that puts one cop on the stand, but also in an earlier scene we have one full frontal beaver shot, after a place is raided, Penn just stilted by the beautiful sight. The tragic finale is memorable in a great slow zoom upward shot, where not every cop tale ends well. This film is no doubt Hopper's piece of resistance, an undying portrait of L.A. how it should of really been shown. I highly advise you to give this 88 pic a viewing over. It's reality will hit you in the face.

This is the truest depiction of gangland L.A. you'll ever see. Sometimes it's too close for comfort. Aging, veteran L.A cop, Duvall and his new hot headed partner Mcgavin, nickname Pacman (a great written character for Penn-suitably brilliant, one would say) are after a killer, Rocket (a young Don Cheadle before he moved into more serious straight arrow characters) who's smoked a homie from another gang. Violence shown is occasional, sometimes heavy, but really when only necessary. Penn and Duvall form a great team, part of a unit called CRASH, crimes only related to gangland. Unlike Riggs and Murtaugh, they're always disagreeing, or getting into some heated arguments. It was great, the family scene, where Duvall invited Penn and his new date over for lunch after a quite thrilling car chase, where their squad car has just upturned. But too, one of my favourite scenes, was Duvall lecturing Penn in his backyard, about the hang ups Penn's future has in law enforcement, where Penn defends himself, arguing his points, totally the opposite of Duvall, who's like the mediator of the duo. Penn's points about not buttering up these homies, and not getting respect is true, but then again you have to gain respect, where Penn's character would have zero tolerance on that one. When Penn goes too far, like a cop having a bad day with these nemesis's, Duvall's retaliation, knocking Penn back in line, was truly something unexpected. It then has Penn, balking.
