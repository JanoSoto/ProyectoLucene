Of these four movies, Anastasia is easily Bluth's most interesting and under-appreciated. But before I get to why that is, let's give a little run-down of what it's aboutAnastasia, much like DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt, is a modern retelling of an event in history. Just like The Prince of Egypt, it's a very liberal one. This means that it's not trying to be 100% accurate, but rather one meant to appeal to a larger audience while still showing respect to the source material. In this instance, Bluth is playing on the alleged rumour that Anastasia, the youngest of the Romanov daughters, may have actually survived the Russian Revolution that caused the Romanov family to be murdered. As Anastasia tries to escape with her grandmother, she's knocked out-cold, loses her memory, and is separated from her to not be seen again for a good decade.Fast-forward 10 years. Anastasia has been living all this time as Anya, an orphan brought up in a foster-home run by an irritating old woman. As Anya decides to make her way to the city and find a new job, she bumps into a con-man named Dimitri. Dimitri, along with a man named Vladimir, keep hiring women off the streets and training them in the ways of the Romanov family in an attempt to pass them off as Anastasia to her real grandmother and earn the reward for finding her. Anya, desperate to know who her real family was, goes along with it, but little do the three of them realize the irony of the situation and-ultimately-the dangers awaiting them from an old foe long-thought to be dead.Now that I've set that up, it's time for me to tackle the complaintsThe first issue that people have with this movie is that it's a cheap knock-off of Disney. It's not. It's actually an expensive one, costing over 50 million dollars to make. That being said, that's not exactly a bad thing; after all, The Prince of Egypt was also a knock-off of Disney, and yet it was still a well-executed one that surpassed The House of Mouse in many ways. In the case of Anastasia, it doesn't quite surpass Disney in quality, but it still has enough substance that it can work on its own. Not to mention that, when you compare it to the other movies that Bluth has made in the 90's, it seems like he's actually trying this time.Another complaint that keeps being made is how this movie is historically-inaccurate. Once again, it's not trying to be. It's based off of a rumour that suggests that Anastasia may have actually survived the slaughtering that took the lives of her father, mother and siblings. Of course, it's never been proved that she actually DID survive, but that's why it's called a rumour and not a fact.The third, and perhaps biggest, complaint involves that of the villain. People have called him the biggest insult to the real Grigori Rasputin, whose personality doesn't match that of the Rasputin in the movie in the slightest. Once again, I'd suggest not taking that too personally. Ramses in the The Prince of Egypt wasn't anything like the real Ramses II either, yet he was still a very fleshed-out and interesting character. While the Rasputin in Anastasia is disappointing in other ways (especially in his downfall,) he's still given enough character that it doesn't matter if he's not true to history. Besides, I hear very little complaints about Hades in Disney's Hercules, even though the original story had Hera in that role.In terms of the movie itself, it's a lot of fun to watch. The animation is still stunning by today's standards, the soundtrack is excellent (even though one of two songs aren't so memorable) and the voice-acting is top-notch. I was especially pleased that Dom DeLuise wasn't in this movie, as-despite having been a Bluth regular for quite some time-he's quite irritating and has almost-always gotten the role of obnoxious comic-relief during his career (he's been replaced by Hank Azaria, but that's only a minor nitpick.) Aside from having Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin and the ever-so-excellent Jim Cummings as his singing voice, the real highlight-for me, at least-is Meg Ryan as Anastasia. I don't recall her being in any animated film before or since, but I'd gladly go watch it if she is. The story in Anastasia isn't perfect-there's the odd flaw here and there-but I have to give Don Bluth credit for actually trying this time. And you should check it out too, as it's a great movie that encompasses just about everything that made Bluth one of the greatest animators of the 20th Century to begin with.Final Score 9\/10.
