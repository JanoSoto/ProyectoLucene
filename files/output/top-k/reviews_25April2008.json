Star Trek III was hardly brilliant, but it did allow Nimoy the chance to hone his craft and develop his skills. And put them to good use in Star Trek IV The Voyage Home.When examined closely, you can see where Star Trek IV is coming from. It was designed to jump on the then popular trend of time travel films begun with The Terminator and Back to the Future. That in itself isn't so strange. Time travel has been a common staple of the series since its conception. But the plot of the film is bound to make you do a double-take. Kirk & Co travel back to 20th Century Earth to rescue whales, and bring them back to the future.Its a concept so mind-boggling its a wonder Paramount ever greenlit the project. Its an idea that shouldn't even begin to work. And yet oddly enough it does. Leonard Nimoy directs it all with a deft hand, achieving a perfect balance between drama and comedy. Indeed Star Trek IV probably has wider appeal than any other film in the series. It was no doubt the huge success of the film that convinced Gene Roddenberry there was a larger audience for Star Trek, now more than ever. So the very next year, Star Trek The Next Generation came to our screens.Pt 4 is definitely much lighter in tone than the preceding three entries, or any other for that matter. It establishes that right from the beginning with the fanciful theme from Leonard Rosenmann. The film is a little slow to start. It begins on an intriguing note with a mysterious space probe arriving in orbit around the Earth. It transmits a signal that wreaks havoc with the Earth's oceans. This is all quite fascinating to watch, but the film has a bit of damage control to mop up first before it can get to the real thrust of the story.After the Enterprise was destroyed in the last film, the crew must return to Earth to face charges. I did admit to feeling a bit restless during the opening scenes on Vulcan. Because they have no real bearing on anything else in the film. But once it gets to the time-travel angle, the film takes off like a rocket.Nimoy cannily ensures the cast members are all given something to do. It avoids a trap that most TV series fall into once they arrive on the big screen. The format of feature film restricts the screen time actors are allowed in a TV series. And many film\/TV crossovers have failed at solving that seemingly impossible task.But Nimoy somehow gets everything right. The film derives much of its appeal from the culture clash between the people of the 23rd Century confronted with that of the 20th. Its a classic fish out of water scenario, and although the film is a bit predictable, it is very entertaining. It seldom puts a foot wrong.Kirk and Spock make a most wonderful double act. Whatever friction between them in the series, it doesn't seem apparent in the film. Everybody seems to be having a great deal of fun. Kirk is the brash man to Spock's straight man. And the screenplay gives them lots of witty exchanges. I'm especially partial to the scene in a pawn shop when they need money to get around. So Kirk has to pawn his spectaclesExcuse me Admiral. Weren't those a gift from Dr McCoy? And they will be again. That's the beauty of it.The film is made up of many different subplots. And each subplot is assigned to a different member of the cast so nobody is left out. While Kirk and Spock track down the whales, Scotty and Bones search for materials to build an aquarium to transport them. Chekov and Uhura search for nuclear materials aboard an aircraft carrier so they can make the return trip to the 23rd Century. And Sulu has 'borrowed' a helicopter to transport the aquarium for the whales to their hijacked Klingon Bird of Prey.The Voyage Home is a film that is consistently amusing. There are lots of fun things to be had from the film. William Shatner shows an early talent for comedy. Something that he would hone to perfection in his twilight years. Chekov searching for nuclear wessels is hilarious. The cute scene where Scotty tries to make a Macintosh computer work by talking into the mouse. Nimoy gets perfect comic timing out of everyone, including himself! The Star Trek cast make for a wonderful comic ensemble, and since they've worked together for so long, they know how to compliment each other.But its not just a Back to the Future clone of one generation confronted with another. I like the film's message of saving the whales. Kirk makes a particularly impassioned speech about them. When humanity was hunting them to extinction, they were inadvertently causing they're own. This space probe in the future can only communicate with whales that no longer exist. Since it won't get a response, its hectic signal will probably destroy Earth. You walk out of the film wanting to be just that little bit nicer to whales.If the film has any flaws, I was a little disappointed that we couldn't have learnt more about the probe. Once it speaks to the whales Kirk has brought back, it just goes on its merry way. Almost as if the writers couldn't think of a way to elaborate on it. And the whole tribunal at the end almost seems unnecessarily tacked on after all the fun beforehand. But The Voyage Home is still the funnest and most thought provoking time you'll ever have in a Star Trek film.

Today, we as audiences are more mature and more demanding, and as such significant portions of the movie have aged very, very badly. Nevertheless, it remains a decent picture - far better than many of its era and is worth seeing by those such as myself who enjoy high seas adventure. However, modern films such as Master and Commander and the updated Hornblower mini-series are infinitely better. Here are some random observations - the accents are laughably bad. The Duke of Wellington's daughter in the move has a pure American accent - and that's probably the best accent of them all since this meant that the actress didn't even try to fake a British accent - something many other roles in the film did--and did very very very badly. Perhaps the worst accents I have ever heard on film. I'm amazed - I'm guessing this was a Hollywood picture. Were there no Mexicans around somewhere nearby to at least show them a Spanish (or Mexican, which for the purposes of this movie would have been infinitely better) accent. Were we really so backwards of a people in 1951 that our actors simply felt that they could affect whatever accent they wanted by rolling their Rs in some random way?- Related to the above, there is a lot of ridiculous ethnic stereotyping and several characters that don't act as real humans do. This movie pretends to be serious, but, it was from 1951. The British are human and basically everybody else is a cartoon. This seems inappropriate, even for 1951. I can excuse the blackface as a technical necessity (of sorts), but the actual characterizations were insulting to anybody with half a brain.- The basic plot is sound, and could be updated. However, if this movie were done today, the character of Hornblower would need to be completely revamped. He's unrealistically flawless in this movie, and the characters spend a heck of a lot of time standing around saying things like Hornblower is flawless!.

Arriving at an isolated Italian villa owned by Il Marchese Di Fiore, (Vittorio De Sica) and his wife La Marchesa Di Fiore, (Maxime McKendry) the two claim they are trying to find a virgin to marry as his custom dictates, and they provide their daughters Perla, (Silvia Dionisio) Saphiria, (Dominique Darel) Rubinia, (Stefania Casini) and Esmeralda, (Milena Vukotic) for his bride. Deciding to stay, he begins to woo each of them, only to discover that they've been lying about being virgins, making him even sicker. Discovering that the local handyman Mario Balato, (Joe Dallesandro) is the one responsible for that, he tries to take him out, only instead revealing that he is a vampire out fr virgin blood, and forces him to protect the family from his bloodthirsty manners.The Good News This here is one of the best vampire films around. The fact that this one is so sleazy for a vampire film is something to enjoy, and is one of the film's best features. This offers up plenty of nudity in here, both male and female, which is always nice. From sex scenes that get quite graphic to bathing sequences and also having the women dress on-screen, this one throws the female nudity around with great abandon. That it even has throwaway sequences, such as the beginning where they disrobe for no reason other than to feature extra nudity makes for some real fun to be had. This also extends to the male nudity as well, since, unless most movies, this one takes the time to show that both participants are nude during the sex scenes and reveling in it the way that very few are comfortable with showing, means that this one is an equal opportunity when it comes to showing it off, and that's never a bad thing. The sleaze also extends away from the nudity, as it's got a lot with the sexual antics to deal with as well. Aside from the graphicness of the straight sex scenes, the fact that there's an incestuous lesbian couple in here that are involved in a couple of sequences alone seals the film of most of it's sleaze right there, and coupled with the insane amount of nudity and the continuous frank conversations about virginity and sexuality in here, this here is a really graphic and sleazy kind of film. What also works here is the really fun story, for the back-story and the reason for the journey away from Romania is great and manages to feel rather creative and a logical reason for a vampire film. That's really great for a film to be like that and feature something that unique and creative from a simple vampire film. The other part to this that works is the last half of the film, which here works wonders. This features a pretty nice selection of sleaze, the great realization scene where all the others realize what's going on, it's also where most of the violence comes in as well. The violence works here because it's a dry film up until then, and then to be inundated with tons of graphic violence and bloodshed ensures some remarkable feelings from the film's ending. From a complete and utter dismemberment of all the limbs to a knifing and a couple impalings through the chest with a wooden stake, leaving a lot of blood flowing, there's a lot from these sequences. Also using some fun through here is the great chase through the house, out into the garden and continuing, which injects a lot of excitement into the film and the fact that the dismembering is done along the way is really great with some more fun to be had. All these reasons make this one enjoyable.The Bad News This one here only had one flaw to it, and it's a little damaging but non-detrimental to the film. That is the fact that it plays fast and loose with conventional vampire story-telling. The vampire walks around in broad daylight only shielding his eyes but no other damage is done. Being able to bite his victims on the neck and draining blood to turn into vampires should work for all victims, yet here only virgins are turned. The others do fall under his spell, but he can't use his hypnotic powers on them otherwise. These here are quite different from usual vampire fare, yet it keeps the distaste for garlic, no reflection in the mirror and a wooden stake through the chest to finish it off are still here. That it mixes them around is something some hardcore fans are gonna get upset about, but otherwise that is the film's only flaw.The Final Verdict Perhaps one of the sleaziest films in the genre, this one here is one of the best all-time and really doesn't have a whole lot wrong with it. Highly recommended to extreme European horror fanatics, sleaze aficionados or vampire fans in general, while the weak-hearted should ignore this one altogether.Rated R Full Nudity, several sex scenes, Graphic Violence, Language and a rape ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Blood for Dracula is one of the genre's best and sleaziest efforts.**SPOILERS**Nearly dying in Romania, sickly Count Dracula, (Udo Kier) ans his servant Anton, (Arno Juerging) decide to leave it behind and head off to the country.

Arriving at an isolated Italian villa owned by Il Marchese Di Fiore, (Vittorio De Sica) and his wife La Marchesa Di Fiore, (Maxime McKendry) the two claim they are trying to find a virgin to marry as his custom dictates, and they provide their daughters Perla, (Silvia Dionisio) Saphiria, (Dominique Darel) Rubinia, (Stefania Casini) and Esmeralda, (Milena Vukotic) for his bride. Deciding to stay, he begins to woo each of them, only to discover that they've been lying about being virgins, making him even sicker. Discovering that the local handyman Mario Balato, (Joe Dallesandro) is the one responsible for that, he tries to take him out, only instead revealing that he is a vampire out fr virgin blood, and forces him to protect the family from his bloodthirsty manners.The Good News This here is one of the best vampire films around. The fact that this one is so sleazy for a vampire film is something to enjoy, and is one of the film's best features. This offers up plenty of nudity in here, both male and female, which is always nice. From sex scenes that get quite graphic to bathing sequences and also having the women dress on-screen, this one throws the female nudity around with great abandon. That it even has throwaway sequences, such as the beginning where they disrobe for no reason other than to feature extra nudity makes for some real fun to be had. This also extends to the male nudity as well, since, unless most movies, this one takes the time to show that both participants are nude during the sex scenes and reveling in it the way that very few are comfortable with showing, means that this one is an equal opportunity when it comes to showing it off, and that's never a bad thing. The sleaze also extends away from the nudity, as it's got a lot with the sexual antics to deal with as well. Aside from the graphicness of the straight sex scenes, the fact that there's an incestuous lesbian couple in here that are involved in a couple of sequences alone seals the film of most of it's sleaze right there, and coupled with the insane amount of nudity and the continuous frank conversations about virginity and sexuality in here, this here is a really graphic and sleazy kind of film. What also works here is the really fun story, for the back-story and the reason for the journey away from Romania is great and manages to feel rather creative and a logical reason for a vampire film. That's really great for a film to be like that and feature something that unique and creative from a simple vampire film. The other part to this that works is the last half of the film, which here works wonders. This features a pretty nice selection of sleaze, the great realization scene where all the others realize what's going on, it's also where most of the violence comes in as well. The violence works here because it's a dry film up until then, and then to be inundated with tons of graphic violence and bloodshed ensures some remarkable feelings from the film's ending. From a complete and utter dismemberment of all the limbs to a knifing and a couple impalings through the chest with a wooden stake, leaving a lot of blood flowing, there's a lot from these sequences. Also using some fun through here is the great chase through the house, out into the garden and continuing, which injects a lot of excitement into the film and the fact that the dismembering is done along the way is really great with some more fun to be had. All these reasons make this one enjoyable.The Bad News This one here only had one flaw to it, and it's a little damaging but non-detrimental to the film.

And while the first halve of the movie focuses mainly on Elias Koteas, the second halve is all about Christopher Walken, Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken. Not that I mind though, it just makes the storytelling pretty incoherent.On top of that it's not like the story itself is also actually much special. Like I said, it takes too long for things to finally really start off and when it does it's just mostly disappointing. I mean, it's about the second battle in heaven but yet all we get to see is Christopher Walken against occasionally a different angel.

I just can't believe how many fine actors there are in this movie. This is of course one big fun role from Christoper Walken, who plays the fallen angel Gabriel. It's a delicious fun villainous role, with which he obviously can go over the top with at times.

BUT..It had been done loathsomely this time, too loathsomely indeed, not only as a revolutionary move to shake things up a little, but also because the international taste wanted it eagerly at that very era.Look at movies like (The War of the Roses - 1989), (She-Devil - 1989), or even TV shows like (The Jerry Springer Show - 1991) and the time of their releases. Actually when vomit, excrement, semen, blood, along with bare old butts, ugly sex, etc.. became a reason to make you laugh, so this kind of works became a fashionable profitable thing to make ! Therefore it's not the desire to be different, it's the time when being polished turned into boring as well as unnecessary.After the end of the 1980s, bad taste established quite a personality in Hollywood to be assured branch of the comedy production, and a mode with fans all over the world. So instead of killing your parents or yourself, blowing up your home or else's, you go to watch problem child, man, bunch.. whatever the problem is ! At the 1990s and the 2000s, some movies took the revolution of the vomit to the next level, after adding some attractive factors to it as well; like good female nudity, sexual boldness, and forget about the drama, any drama; it's pure filth in glaring frame to have eventually examples like  Euro trip, American Pie, Kingpin, Freddy Got Fingered,.. (Refer to my comment about Euro Trip which entitled My List of The Most Disgusting Comic Movies Ever where I tried to analyze why we love this kind of movies even if we hated most of it !). I'm a screenwriter myself, and how I feel that making a toilet humor or any type of bad tasting is very much easier than anything else. Not because Hey it's the 2000s, and we're having very dirty minds already !, but ALSO because writing a comic movie which would make you think a bit became something not needed that much anymore those days ! So like (Problem Child)'s creed as one gifted god father of the genre; let's give them farts, let's give them nastiness, let's give them a child who extinguished the camp fire by the hard way.. And why not ? It's novel, distinct, and people will just empty their angry suppressed objections through it. In fact, the other sequels, especially number 3, reached the top of filth, and it's filth for the sake of filth more even for the sake of comedy sometimes ! Try to be reasonable.. OK. I loved the photo-montage of the birthday party's fiasco, the comic situation of (Jack Warden) telling the shocking truth unconsciously to all the TV viewers and his voters, the light parodies of (The Omen, The Shinning, Patton). But on the other hand, the performance was exaggerated, the laughs were violent and mean, the editing was nearly hysterical in a bad way, and the above-mentioned for sure..You can watch it as a turning point of the cinematic comedy, Hollywood thinking, as well as the international taste, or as a very important event according to the recent social anthropology. Or watch it to laugh and try to understand the real message of it  don't you ever think that much, otherwise you'll hate a lot of things, this movie could be one of them ! Or just don't watch it (I know that I won't do it again !).

Therefore it's not the desire to be different, it's the time when being polished turned into boring as well as unnecessary.After the end of the 1980s, bad taste established quite a personality in Hollywood to be assured branch of the comedy production, and a mode with fans all over the world. So instead of killing your parents or yourself, blowing up your home or else's, you go to watch problem child, man, bunch.. whatever the problem is ! At the 1990s and the 2000s, some movies took the revolution of the vomit to the next level, after adding some attractive factors to it as well; like good female nudity, sexual boldness, and forget about the drama, any drama; it's pure filth in glaring frame to have eventually examples like  Euro trip, American Pie, Kingpin, Freddy Got Fingered,.. (Refer to my comment about Euro Trip which entitled My List of The Most Disgusting Comic Movies Ever where I tried to analyze why we love this kind of movies even if we hated most of it !). I'm a screenwriter myself, and how I feel that making a toilet humor or any type of bad tasting is very much easier than anything else. Not because Hey it's the 2000s, and we're having very dirty minds already !, but ALSO because writing a comic movie which would make you think a bit became something not needed that much anymore those days ! So like (Problem Child)'s creed as one gifted god father of the genre; let's give them farts, let's give them nastiness, let's give them a child who extinguished the camp fire by the hard way.. And why not ? It's novel, distinct, and people will just empty their angry suppressed objections through it. In fact, the other sequels, especially number 3, reached the top of filth, and it's filth for the sake of filth more even for the sake of comedy sometimes ! Try to be reasonable.. OK. I loved the photo-montage of the birthday party's fiasco, the comic situation of (Jack Warden) telling the shocking truth unconsciously to all the TV viewers and his voters, the light parodies of (The Omen, The Shinning, Patton). But on the other hand, the performance was exaggerated, the laughs were violent and mean, the editing was nearly hysterical in a bad way, and the above-mentioned for sure..You can watch it as a turning point of the cinematic comedy, Hollywood thinking, as well as the international taste, or as a very important event according to the recent social anthropology. Or watch it to laugh and try to understand the real message of it  don't you ever think that much, otherwise you'll hate a lot of things, this movie could be one of them !

It's more than a comedy about underachievers realizing their potential. It's about the man who makes them realize their worth as human beings getting quite an education about life himself.Danny DeVito is that man in a role about as far removed as you can get from Louis DePalma in Taxi and Lawrence Garfield in Other People's Money. He's an advertising man who loses a couple of big clients while getting stuck in traffic and gets bounced from his job.Needing an income while looking for a job, the Michigan Unemployment Department gives him an interesting job, a civilian remedial education teacher for the United States Army. He's assigned to a class of eight trainees who might wash out if they don't shape up. It's their mental attitudes that need adjusting.A little trial and error and DeVito hits upon the idea to use Shakespeare, specifically Hamlet as a teaching tool. Interpreting and learning life's lesson from one of the greatest works of literature in the English language apparently works and in ways far beyond making these trainees get through basic training.This is my favorite film with Danny DeVito and he's not an easy fit into army life. Cliff Robertson, James Remar, and Gregory Hines are some of the army people he deals with.But the eight trainees are the heart of the film. Mark Wahlberg, Lillo Brancato, Kadeem Hardison, Richard Jones, Khalil Kain, Gregory Sporleto, Stacey Dash are seven of them. One of them doesn't make it through and ironically because of an act of kindness. But my favorite in the film is Peter Simmons who plays Private Brian Davis from Grand Forks, North Dakota. It's young men like him and his father before him in Vietnam who was killed in action who keep this country safe and secure. He gets the best recognition possible at the end of the film and you are guaranteed not to have a dry eye when you see it.Renaissance Man is a beautifully crafted film from Penny Marshall and should not be missed when broadcast.

It is filled with allegory, allusion, other metaphors and so much philosophy. The writing is exceptional as the screenplay is layered and the dialogues are very philosophical. It's a fantastic film to discuss with others as it ends on an ambiguous note and there is a lot of symbolism that is open to interpretation. Perhaps I too will be editing my comment after viewing it again.On the technical side, it looks amazing. The dark dazzling world is eerily real. It also reminds one of noir classics. It does not have the stop motion that CGI's of today's movies have. I loved the technology that was used in 80's movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Starwars', 'The Dark Crystal' and 'Labyrinth'. They made their worlds more real to me. And when I revisit those movies today, it brings a nostalgic feeling as I remember how much I enjoyed these films. In the more recent movies, it's quite easy to tell which scenes were done with CGI as there is a lack of authentic look about it. Back to 'Blade Runner', the special effects and cinematography are mindblowing and how can anyone overlook Vangelis's powerful score? And what makes us appreciate them more is that none of them are over-the-top to the extent that they compromise the story.I haven't seen all of Ridley Scott's film but so far I'd say 'Blade Runner' is his best. His direction is solid. This wasn't an easy film to make and Scott deserves all the credit he's gotten. The cast is also interesting as it includes (then) not-so-famous actors. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all fit the bill.Today if one looks at these new science fiction wannabe movies, there's a sadness about how science fiction has progressed in Hollywood. Even now when very enjoyable brilliant films like 'Matrix' and 'X-men' are made, there are always sequels that completely destroy the essence of the first movie. But we will always have classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'Starwars' trilogy to revisit. 'Blade Runner' is a profound movie.

As much as a man can be. And do you think there's a limit?* * Spoilers throughout, I'm afraid. * * Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), an impeccably eligible bachelor, adornment of New York's high society of the late nineteenth century, is startled to find himself actually caring, deeply, for something outside of the self-imposed strictures of his mapped-out life. How unfortunate, then, that the object is not his dull new fiancée, but his cousin, an altogether rarer creature &#150; and that their kindling mutual attachment sets them apart, threatening to make outcasts of them both. Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) was once plain old Ellen Mingott; now, fleeing her impossible foreign husband, impossibly exotic herself in the tiny, enclosed world of Old New York, she thinks she has found kind old friends and a home, but discovers that they are just another set of impossible shackles. But despite her whiff of the corrupt Old World, Ellen has fresh new ways of looking at and responding to the world around her that work on Newland immediately. Old New York is all style and no substance its rigours are morbid, obscene, hypocritical, as artificial and constricting as a corset. Nothing can be said or done, or worn, that is not sanctioned by the severe eyes of Society. In this charged atmosphere, in a world so controlled, tiny details (the colour of a flower, a woman's decision to walk across a room) take on depth and intensity (and, of course, have specific consequences). If you don't find the moment at theatre where Ellen refers to Newland's yellow roses unbearably sexually charged, I give you up. Your guide through this complicated world is Joanne Woodward's dry, elegant narrator, the authorial voice of the original novel by Edith Wharton. Themes of innocence are expertly spun throughout this story, no less so by Scorsese than by the book's author. Scorsese keeps his direction tight, subtle, in the background, so as not to swamp a large cast of characters, and a story that needs to be followed attentively. The art direction is brilliant; the costumes magnificent, and the various family homes around which the story centres perfectly reflect the characters of their inhabitants. Day Lewis brings marvellous life to Newland Archer. You feel the power &#150; and panic &#150; of his growing passion, as the predicament into which he has bound himself unfolds itself before him in ever more oppressive detail. Pfeiffer is immensely likable, really inhabiting the skin of the tarnished, elegant, headstrong Ellen. The effect of the chill upon her initiated by events in New York is that of corrupting her innocence. Even charmless Winona Ryder is, unfortunately for her, perfectly cast as May, the pretty, sporty, blank wife of Archer's old dreams, before his eyes were opened. Story and direction alike are really quite subversive they turn you and turn you, until you feel (don't you?) that true innocence lies in the hearts of the reluctant lovers, and that it is the surface 'innocence' of Old New York, with its prominent families, its subtle manoeuvrings, which is a sham, a corruption, unable to alter itself by so much as a whisker in its staid respectability. A less brave or passionate director would have made a colder, stuffier film, 'faithful' but dull (like May, Newland's fiancée). Scorsese finds the adventure, the emotional pull, the sarcasm and scathing criticism beneath the collected and 'proper' exterior. Wonderful, sad and beautiful, don't be put off by the 'period' label. Terence Davies' adaptation of Wharton's The House of Mirth is equal in excellence, its star Gillian Anderson a revelation.

Day Lewis brings marvellous life to Newland Archer.

A less brave or passionate director would have made a colder, stuffier film, 'faithful' but dull (like May, Newland's fiancée).

And do you think there's a limit?* * Spoilers throughout, I'm afraid. * * Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), an impeccably eligible bachelor, adornment of New York's high society of the late nineteenth century, is startled to find himself actually caring, deeply, for something outside of the self-imposed strictures of his mapped-out life. How unfortunate, then, that the object is not his dull new fiancée, but his cousin, an altogether rarer creature &#150; and that their kindling mutual attachment sets them apart, threatening to make outcasts of them both. Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) was once plain old Ellen Mingott; now, fleeing her impossible foreign husband, impossibly exotic herself in the tiny, enclosed world of Old New York, she thinks she has found kind old friends and a home, but discovers that they are just another set of impossible shackles. But despite her whiff of the corrupt Old World, Ellen has fresh new ways of looking at and responding to the world around her that work on Newland immediately. Old New York is all style and no substance its rigours are morbid, obscene, hypocritical, as artificial and constricting as a corset. Nothing can be said or done, or worn, that is not sanctioned by the severe eyes of Society. In this charged atmosphere, in a world so controlled, tiny details (the colour of a flower, a woman's decision to walk across a room) take on depth and intensity (and, of course, have specific consequences).

The story basically is about a son who eventually reaches some understanding concerning his father, who left the family years ago. The discovery and acceptance by the resentful Victor Joseph of his father's own unhappiness plays out in a road trip Victor and his friend, Thomas Builds-the-Fire, take from the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho where they live to Phoenix to pick up the father's ashes. This sort of story has been so often turgidly overplayed by film-makers searching for truth that it's a surprise to find just how touching and humorous Smoke Signals turns out to be. The story may be about a search of discovery, but it's played out against the friction of reservation life in a white world. The humor carries a lot of irony but the dialog and situations are so gentle and natural that the inherent messages don't slam us about. There's no victim card being played here, just some truths told with the kind of underplayed honesty that makes ethnic humor, delivered by those same ethnic people, work not just for them but for those in a white world who are overhearing. Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) is a big, good looking young man who barely gets along, plays basketball and carries a chip on his shoulder. Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) is a scrawny, glasses-wearing young man who tells stories and talks about almost everything. Thomas has been raised by his grandmother. A fire killed his parents and it was Victor's father, Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), who caught Thomas, just a baby, when Thomas was tossed from a second floor window. Arnold Joseph was a big man, quick to laugh and quick to hit, maybe not a drunk but close to it. He denied being a hero. One day, when Victor was about 12, Arnold Joseph picked up and left. Victor never forgave him. When word of Arnold's death reaches Victor's mother. Victor decides he must get the ashes, but he doesn't have enough money. Hey Victor! Thomas says, I'm sorry 'bout your dad. How'd you hear about it? Victor asks. I heard it on the wind, Thomas says, I heard it from the birds. I felt it in the sunlight. And your mom was just in here cryin'. Thomas has some money in a jar and offers it if he can come along. Off they go, hitchhiking, taking a bus, walking. Along the way, while Victor wrestles with his feelings about the father who left him, screenwriter Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre give us the kind of edgy smiles that are rare nowadays. You gotta look mean or people won't respect you, says Victor to Thomas on the bus to Phoenix. White people will run all over you if you don't look mean. You gotta look like a warrior! You gotta look like you just came back from killing a buffalo! But our tribe never hunted buffalo -- we were fishermen, says Thomas. What! says Victor, you want to look like you just came back from catching a fish? This ain't 'Dances With Salmon' you know! Yes, they return to the reservations with the ashes. Victor winds up learning a lot about himself as well as about his father. He learns a good deal about what Thomas reaches for with all the stories Thomas tells. We learn a lot about the value of a quiet movie with a fine screenplay and skillful direction. We learn about fry bread. And as Thomas says, when the going gets tough, Sometimes it's a good day to die, and sometimes it's a good day to have breakfast. All the actors do commendable jobs, but Evan Adams is a standout. When he closes his eyes and starts to spin one of Thomas' stories, you don't really want him to stop. Adams has the challenging job of bringing us to the movie's close, emotionally and thoughtfully. Do we forgive our fathers in our age or in theirs, or in their deaths, saying it to them, or not saying it? If we forgive our fathers...what is left?

Not only did he release 'Fail-Safe (1964),' one of the most gripping and haunting thrillers of the Cold War era, but he also directed Rod Steiger in 'The Pawnbroker (1964),' a gritty and powerful drama centred around an emotionless Holocaust survivor. Especially after watching the highly-theatrical '12 Angry Men (1957),' this film proves especially surprising, as, aesthetically, it represents a completely new era of Hollywood film-making. Predating the gritty, inner-city realism of 'Midnight Cowboy (1969)' and 'The French Connection (1971)' by half a decade, 'The Pawnbroker' sits at the crest of an American New Wave. Boris Kaufman's kinetic black-and-white cinematography is fresh and invigorating, presenting the squalid streets of Harlem in all their bleak and sinister glory.The Holocaust was still tentative subject matter during the early 1960s, and very few films had dealt directly with the persecution and extermination of the Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany. Likewise, while many pictures had followed the attempts of returned war veterans to assimilate back into normal society, rarely had anybody attempted to explore Holocaust survivors in a similar manner. Sol Nazerman (Rod Steiger) arrived in the United States a broken man, having lost his family in the concentration camps. The heartbreaking experience has left Sol with a cold resentment towards both himself and society, and, with a stubborn conviction that will ultimately hurt those close to him, he has unreservedly distanced himself from all emotion.Rather than offering Sol relief, the decadence and corruption of modern New York only fuels his pessimism towards life. Having bitterly accepted the centuries-old stereotype that he is a usurer, a man with secret resources, a witch, a pawnbroker, a sheenie, a mockery and a kike, Sol manages a small pawnshop, systematically robbing decrepit and grotesque individuals of their hope and livelihood with all the compassion of the Nazis who murdered his family. The shop itself is merely a front for the illegal underground dealings of Rodriguez (Brock Peters, displaying an exceedingly commanding presence); it's probably with a deliberate irony that it is an African American, delegated in the past to the bottom rung of society's ladder, who holds considerable authority over Steiger's tired, beaten Jew.Jaime Sánchez gives another of the film's excellent performances, playing Jesus Ortiz, a Latino youth who has decided to shun crime in favour of eventually owning an honest business. However, Sol callously rejects Jesus' attempts at redemption, crushing his energetic spirit and inevitably turning him back to a life of crime. Geraldine Fitzgerald is also very good as Marilyn Birchfield, a lonely widow who tries, without success, to form a friendship with Sol, not knowing that he has consciously barred himself from all meaningful human relationships. In his distressing attempts to end the pain of suffering, Sol has become a prisoner within himself; at the film's end, he pierces himself in the hand, a final masochistic act of desperation, just so he call feel&#133; something, anything.'The Pawnbroker' has a wonderful music soundtrack, which was performed by Quincy Jones. The upbeat and energetic jazz tunes are almost mocking in way in which they clash with the subject material, so completely unsuited to such a sombre story, and yet somehow more honest than a more traditional music composition could ever have been. It is almost as though the hustle-and-bustle of Manhattan, completely ignorant and indifferent to the troubles of one old man on a single street corner, has effectively swallowed up Sol and his painful memories. It's a telling metaphor for a society that too-often neglects the darkest chapter in recent human history.

The upbeat and energetic jazz tunes are almost mocking in way in which they clash with the subject material, so completely unsuited to such a sombre story, and yet somehow more honest than a more traditional music composition could ever have been. It is almost as though the hustle-and-bustle of Manhattan, completely ignorant and indifferent to the troubles of one old man on a single street corner, has effectively swallowed up Sol and his painful memories. It's a telling metaphor for a society that too-often neglects the darkest chapter in recent human history.

I am a Protestnat Christian and hence do not approve of lousy things, filthy and foul words, bad humor and attacks on my Savior, which SP creators often did. But as a person with vivid, and as I hope good sense of humor, I do like this Bigger, Better Uncut film. Why? I think, the movie is not about being rude, obscene or just foul. This is about such hard nut to crack as the freedom of speech. And with their typical wry and warped approach, the SP fathers do it well. The songs are deliciously great, and the plot is very funny. I am not sure if I recommend that to everyone but I think it is still very cool if you wanna have some colder slap in the face...

Interestingly, it was rated G - I would have given it a PG because, real or not, people did expire at times.With personal computers just entering peoples homes when this movie was released, the only people that had any real access to computers programmers and data entry operators that used computers in their every day life. The fact that this film didn't make the big dollars at the box office doesn't mean it wasn't a good concept, it just meant that people who didn't understand this new technological onslaught weren't about to shell out their hard earned money to see it.Yes, it certainly looks dated, but everything looks that way from the point of view of 20 odd years into the future but some of the tech we take for granted today was there - for example, Dillinger's touch screen desk shows some forward thinking in an age of chunky push buttons and knobs.Throughout the film, there seems to be a hidden message about the danger of allowing one all encompassing power to take control of smaller and weaker ones - an unintentional allusion to the dangers of a one world government perhaps. Was the MCP really the USA or USSR in disguise? Acting performances were generally good. David Warner played the sinister bad guy to great effect as he always has. Even at such a young(ish) age, he had a threatening aura about him. Bruce Boxleitner seemed to be a bit wasted considering his was the title role. His real world role was damaged by the ridiculous eye wear he had stuck to his head (I couldn't stop looking at the nerdy glasses he wore) and Jeff Bridges played the part of Jeff Bridges perfectly (I am sure that one day he'll play someone else).I see the movie is to be remade in 2010. I would hope that it is faithful to the spirit of this original version and that they don't go CGI mad on it. With the way computers are networked and Big Brother can see everything now days, a fun family film might not be on the cards there.

I haven't seen all of the films ever made in the world, therefore I couldn't make a decision but if the greatest film is out there and even slightly resembles Kane, it is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The intense Orson Welles, the mastermind of the film, was a perfectionist and it showed. He did not confine his film to the limits of the period it was made in and it helped to revolutionize the film industry with Kane. The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created.Charles Foster Kane played by Welles himself rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' because he thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper. Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing yellow journalism which, though frowned upon by most critics, proved immensely profitable.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large NO TREPASSING sign on the gate of Kane's Xanadu dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the vastness of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, Rosebud. With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. The remainder of the film is largely comprised of flashbacks.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien. There had never been a picture like Citizen Kane. It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique&#133; Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, Citizen Kane electrified a complacent industry&#133; Welles dominated Kane&#133; He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood&#133; Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941.Other than the acting and story part, what does it take to make a great movie, yup the cinematography and the editing. I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first. And yes Citizen Kane has it all great great photography and slick editing techniques used that too in those days. So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant.
