Unfortunately for her Julia (Clare Higgins) is back as well and after getting her skin back she sets out for Hell where we're going to have a battle. I know this film has a large group of fans but I'm certainly not one of them.

I think the biggest problem with the film is its screenplay as you never really can tell where the movie is headed or what it's trying to do.

What the film does have going for it are the gore scenes, which there are plenty of and especially if you watch the unrated version.

The highlight of the film has to be the sequence where Julia comes back from the dead but even this here isn't nearly as good as the sequence in the original with Frank. The performances are decent if nothing overly great and the same can be said about the direction. This is far from one of the worst movies ever made as there's some decent stuff here and there but in the end I couldn't help but feel no one knew where this movie was headed and why we were even bothering to get there.

It's funny, uproarious, because men who are big womanizers (they're musicians in 1929 prohibition-era Chicago after all) have to go in disguise as women so they aren't recognized as the men they are by mobsters who want to rub them out for several hits they witnessed. I loved seeing how the actors worked off of one another, especially because they had such wonderful dialog to work with. That is one part of it, and how steady the story actually is (it really never falters from being a classically told story for all of its wackiness that ensues), but it's just the repore of the stars, the power they exude on screen (that is, that Marilyn Monroe exudes) and how funny they are in playing it both serious and fun in a single beat.Now that that premise is out of the way, what else is funny about it? Where to start? For one thing just how Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have their reactions to how they look or who they are as 'women' (I'm more of a Daphnme, Lemmon's Jerry says), and how they both react in varied ways to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Her character admits that she's stupid, but is she really? She's playing this girl' in other movies before, and yet it's a little varied this time around; she'd love to find a rich man on a yacht, sure, but she'd also just like to find a man who would treat her right. It's here that the fun, and some hidden depth and incredible sexual innuendo, comes out of the relationship between 'Cary Grant' Joe (a great-bad imitation) and Sugar, especially the scene between the two on the Yacht and their meeting on the beach... which is almost all of their scenes. They're quite brilliant.Jack Lemmon also scores very highly here with his performance as Jerry\/Daphne. Any moment he has to react to Osgood is so funny because of how he reacts and how Joe E. Brown so consistently reacts to Daphne's expressions. It's surely one of the classic moments in movies at the end, but I perhaps loved even more just seeing how the two actors were in the tango scene (and Lemmon's reaction to that to Tony Curtis, the We're engaged! bit is one of the funniest scenes of its time, or any time). We get to see by Wilder's script and direction how men and women (or men as women or men as men) portray each other or react when trying to court. It's a sex farce that was somehow acceptable (I'm surprised some of the innuendo and dress got by with the censors at the time), but also has stayed fresh, maybe fresher, because of how precise it is in its observations on sex and relationships. It sort of goes between the very dark comedy of love in Sunset Blvd. with the lighthearted Hollywood stuff of Sabrina.The former may still be Wilder's best film, but Some Like it Hot finds him working at the peak of his powers with comic timing and sharp dialog for able and ready performers. Was Monroe ever funnier? Perhaps sexier in Seven Year Itch, or a technically better or deeper actress in Don't Bother to Knock. But she's on par with her male co-leads in delivering the goods as someone who gets how to do this comedy. It's rare for lightning to strike like this in comedy in general- The Producers, Duck Soup and His Girl Friday had it- and this is another example.

Flash forward when couple Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia (Clare Higgins) buy the house and after blood drops on the floor, Frank comes back to life only as a skinless monster. He convinces Julia that she should bring men back to the house so that he can drink their blood, which he hopes will return his flesh. This here is just the first half of the movie as things get a lot wilder in the second half when the box is opened yet again. As a kid I really didn't care for this movie because it wasn't like the more popular horror films out there at the time. With that said, seeing the film now one can enjoy it for the fact that it is unlike the slasher craze that was going on during this era. I found the movie to play out a lot like an EC comic as the story here is pretty far-fetched but it's an interesting one. Having a skinless man needing blood to bring his flesh back isn't anything ground breaking but it makes for an entertaining story. What helps even more is that all the characters are fully developed and this adds some nice drama to the mix as the good girl Julia soon finds herself doing acts that she's never think possible. The drama between her and husband Larry works just fine as does the drama built up when his daughter enters the film. Another major plus here are the special effects, which allows for some ooze and gore. I loved the look of Frank when we first see him and the design as more and more flesh begins to grow on his body looks incredible. The effect is rather simple but the way he oozes is enough to keep horror fans entertained.

The event The Soviet invasion on Afghanistan. The two sides fighting The Soviet Army versus the Mujahadeen supplied by the United States Army. Kevin Reynolds's The Beast tells the story of an Mujahadeen group with a mission to capture and destroy a Soviet war tank or as they call The Beast. And what these nomadic soldiers didn't expected was that an Soviet soldier would help them in this mission.The Soviet side is led by Daskal (George Dzundza in a non typical role of bad guy) an tyrannical commander leading a minor group of men in the desert trying to reach Kandahar. After a group of people of a small attack his tank he and his soldiers capture a man and kill him by running over with the tank. In his crew there's two noble souls an Afghan translator (Erick Avari) and the young soldier Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric). This last one realizes that his commander is totally out of control, and he knows that something very wrong can happen. Konstantin is a guy who play by the rule, even keeping notes over his colleagues bad behaviors. After many baseless suspicions of treason Daskal kills the translator making Konstantin very angered. As result the soldier is tied up on a rock as a punishment for being insubordinate to his commander. But luck is on his side and he's rescued by the Mujahadeen. Now even without speaking their language (he only knows a term of friendship that he learned with the translator) he finds new friends (or better saying allies) with one common goal destroy the tank. In short the old saying worked here The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Mujahadeen group is led by Taj (Steven Bauer, excellent performance, he speaks in a total different language, only using a few words in English) a very brave and faithful leader seeking for revenge and he's become Konstantin's best friend in this reckless war.Released in 1988 this film wasn't a box office hit and it's almost an unknown work from director Kevin Reynolds (Waterworld). Back in the 1980's is one of the rare films about the Afghanistan War (it's a work of fiction) along with Rambo III. But it's a very original film with action scenes and a political criticism (little things), and also a story about how mankind acts in times of war. Two different groups with different cultures can understand each other with only a few words as it was showed here. But what this war was it for? Why did it happened? The titles at the beginning of the film doesn't inform us of why it happened. After watching this movie you might think that everything here was pointless because all you see is the desert, the killings and a tank. No it's more than that. It shows that wars don't have meaningless, stupid, brutal and always kills innocent people (the people of the village in the beginning of the movie). It's also about honor.

The event The Soviet invasion on Afghanistan. The two sides fighting The Soviet Army versus the Mujahadeen supplied by the United States Army. Kevin Reynolds's The Beast tells the story of an Mujahadeen group with a mission to capture and destroy a Soviet war tank or as they call The Beast. And what these nomadic soldiers didn't expected was that an Soviet soldier would help them in this mission.The Soviet side is led by Daskal (George Dzundza in a non typical role of bad guy) an tyrannical commander leading a minor group of men in the desert trying to reach Kandahar. After a group of people of a small attack his tank he and his soldiers capture a man and kill him by running over with the tank. In his crew there's two noble souls an Afghan translator (Erick Avari) and the young soldier Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric). This last one realizes that his commander is totally out of control, and he knows that something very wrong can happen. Konstantin is a guy who play by the rule, even keeping notes over his colleagues bad behaviors. After many baseless suspicions of treason Daskal kills the translator making Konstantin very angered. As result the soldier is tied up on a rock as a punishment for being insubordinate to his commander. But luck is on his side and he's rescued by the Mujahadeen. Now even without speaking their language (he only knows a term of friendship that he learned with the translator) he finds new friends (or better saying allies) with one common goal destroy the tank. In short the old saying worked here The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Mujahadeen group is led by Taj (Steven Bauer, excellent performance, he speaks in a total different language, only using a few words in English) a very brave and faithful leader seeking for revenge and he's become Konstantin's best friend in this reckless war.Released in 1988 this film wasn't a box office hit and it's almost an unknown work from director Kevin Reynolds (Waterworld). Back in the 1980's is one of the rare films about the Afghanistan War (it's a work of fiction) along with Rambo III. But it's a very original film with action scenes and a political criticism (little things), and also a story about how mankind acts in times of war. Two different groups with different cultures can understand each other with only a few words as it was showed here. But what this war was it for? Why did it happened? The titles at the beginning of the film doesn't inform us of why it happened. After watching this movie you might think that everything here was pointless because all you see is the desert, the killings and a tank. No it's more than that. It shows that wars don't have meaningless, stupid, brutal and always kills innocent people (the people of the village in the beginning of the movie). It's also about honor.

Although nominally a comedy, the amusing moments to be found here are surprisingly rare. Lewis' fans may laud this as a comic masterpiece, but the title above &#x97; borrowed from a Leonard Maltin review of the film &#x97; is a better distillation of what it has to offer. But though The Nutty Professor may not have many laugh-out-loud moments, it's still a movie that stays with the viewer, because it's ultimately more a thought-provoking film than a funny one.The plot, such as it is, has been adequately summarized elsewhere. Basically, this is a variation on the Jekyll-and-Hyde theme Jerry's Prof. Julius Kelp, smitten with the lovely Stella Purdy (Stella Stevens), tries to win her over by concocting a potion that transforms the buck-toothed, awkward Kelp into handsome, debonair Buddy Love &#x97; who nevertheless is thoroughly detestable.Both the contemporary advertisements for the movie, and the film itself, use irony and misdirection to introduce Kelp's transformation. One of those movie posters is split in two the top portion shows mad scientist Kelp gleefully mixing chemicals, while the bottom shows Stella tossing a frightened glance over her shoulder as the tag line asks, What does he become? What kind of monster?Likewise, the first time that the film reveals Kelp's Buddy Love persona, it's done in a long point-of-view shot from Kelp\/Love's perspective, as onlookers stop what they're doing to stare at the new creature &#x97; until, at last, the camera spins around to reveal that Kelp has become, well, basically Jerry Lewis playing himself. This was undoubtedly an on-screen first, as Lewis was no longer playing either the high-voiced kid (as he referred to his usual screen persona), and he's no longer the buck-toothed, pathetic Kelp, either. Movie audiences in 1963 must initially have been confused that Kelp's formula turned Kelp into a well-dressed sophisticate instead of the horrible monster hinted at in both that movie poster and in the transformation scene itself (when a hairy clawed hand is shown in close-up during Lewis' vigorous rolling around on his laboratory floor).But then, as one reflects on the creature that Kelp *does* become, one has to wonder if maybe monster isn't the best description of Buddy Love after all. Yes, he's smooth, handsome (Lewis was only 36 at the time, and quite good-looking) and an accomplished crowd-pleaser &#x97; but he's also short-tempered, insulting, and domineering toward Stella, at one point ordering her to wipe off her lipstick so he can commence kissing her. It's really a no-win situation either she can have the clumsy, weak, and awkward professor or the suave, handsome, but ultimately abhorrent Buddy Love.It foreshadows, in some ways, the relationship between Julie Andrews and James Garner in 1964's The Americanization of Emily &#x97; Julie Andrews' character Emily is horrified at the thought of Garner's character, Charlie Madison, dying on the beaches of D-Day. But then she's equally horrified at the prospect of him *not* dying when she finds out he intends to take the coward's way out. So she can either have a live coward (in which case she doesn't want him) or a dead hero &#x97; but either way, she loses him.And so it is with the puzzle-box Stella is trapped in with Kelp\/Love. In his real persona, Kelp isn't really someone with whom Stella will likely want to spend the rest of her life; Kelp needs a mother (or a keeper) more than a girlfriend. And while she finds the debonair aspects of Buddy Love hard to resist, she still recognizes that, at bottom, he's a rude, arrogant jerk.The movie doesn't entirely resolve this dilemma. Kelp may make that moving speech at the prom about being yourself, and Stella may appear to choose Kelp at the end &#x97; but she's still got two bottles of Kelp's formula in her back pockets as they run off . . . perhaps to take Buddy Love out of the closet occasionally when she grows bored with Kelp.Despite this not really being a comedy, it does have its amusing moments &#x97; Kelp removing his wet shoes to stop their squeaking, only to discover that it's his *feet* that are squeaking; Kelp disappearing into the college president's chair when he sits down, then apparently being able to support his entire weight on the thickness of a magazine; or Kelp putting his entire sleeve into the punchbowl at the prom. (Note, of course, that it's always Kelp, never Buddy Love, who provides the comic interludes.)And whatever other problems this movie may have, it still *looks* great. The film's colors &#x97; whether of Buddy's suits, of Kelp's laboratory chemicals, or of the successive outfits Kelp imagines Stella to be wearing in one scene &#x97; are so eye-poppingly bright that Technicolor deserved separate billing as another character.Though a great comic when he was at the top of his form, Lewis (like Woody Allen) apparently wanted to be remembered for something besides comedy, too. All in all, The Nutty Professor &#x97; like its characters Julius Kelp and Buddy Love &#x97; is a strange amalgam too often farcical and fantasy-driven to be taken as a serious meditation, yet too serious (and too bereft of funny moments) to really be a comedy, either.

But then she's equally horrified at the prospect of him *not* dying when she finds out he intends to take the coward's way out. So she can either have a live coward (in which case she doesn't want him) or a dead hero &#x97; but either way, she loses him.And so it is with the puzzle-box Stella is trapped in with Kelp\/Love. In his real persona, Kelp isn't really someone with whom Stella will likely want to spend the rest of her life; Kelp needs a mother (or a keeper) more than a girlfriend. And while she finds the debonair aspects of Buddy Love hard to resist, she still recognizes that, at bottom, he's a rude, arrogant jerk.The movie doesn't entirely resolve this dilemma. Kelp may make that moving speech at the prom about being yourself, and Stella may appear to choose Kelp at the end &#x97; but she's still got two bottles of Kelp's formula in her back pockets as they run off . . . perhaps to take Buddy Love out of the closet occasionally when she grows bored with Kelp.Despite this not really being a comedy, it does have its amusing moments &#x97; Kelp removing his wet shoes to stop their squeaking, only to discover that it's his *feet* that are squeaking; Kelp disappearing into the college president's chair when he sits down, then apparently being able to support his entire weight on the thickness of a magazine; or Kelp putting his entire sleeve into the punchbowl at the prom. (Note, of course, that it's always Kelp, never Buddy Love, who provides the comic interludes.)And whatever other problems this movie may have, it still *looks* great. The film's colors &#x97; whether of Buddy's suits, of Kelp's laboratory chemicals, or of the successive outfits Kelp imagines Stella to be wearing in one scene &#x97; are so eye-poppingly bright that Technicolor deserved separate billing as another character.Though a great comic when he was at the top of his form, Lewis (like Woody Allen) apparently wanted to be remembered for something besides comedy, too. All in all, The Nutty Professor &#x97; like its characters Julius Kelp and Buddy Love &#x97; is a strange amalgam too often farcical and fantasy-driven to be taken as a serious meditation, yet too serious (and too bereft of funny moments) to really be a comedy, either.

Space was not just for fantasy anymore. Some of the best movies to first explore and pioneer the science fiction of space travel were classics like Destination Moon, When Worlds Collide, and of course Rocketship X-M.Genre conventions quickly emerged, which today are enjoyable to watch for as the movie plays. Overarching elements like benevolent governments (or UN), committees, scientists and industrialists are integral to the venture. Experts hold conferences, and if you are really lucky, they will show off a blueprint of the rocketship. The rocketship will usually be a cigar-shaped variant of a German V-2, and will almost always be silver in color. There will also be some semi-solid science mixed in with some really loopy notions about space travel.The crew of the rocketship is usually a blend of scientists, military types, hot-shot alpha males (one or two), and for reasons that probably only made sense in the 50s, a 'regular Joe' kind of character for comic relief (but oh boy is it painful to watch now). Usually an attractive and single woman scientist is present, but no matter what credentials she carries she will be patronized or upstaged by a male at some point, and almost always she will serve coffee to the men (with a smile). Oh yeah, and in the end, one of the alpha males will want to marry her.Other conventions to watch for include the blast-off and its effects on the crew, a few odds and ends become weightless (much to the surprise and delight of the crew), a meteor shower will threaten the ship, and often there will be a space walk along the hull of the ship (with the camera rotated 90 degrees of course).If you enjoy watching for the above elements, congratulations and welcome to the wonderful world of science fiction movies, circa 1950s. I love this stuff.In Rocketship X-M the rocket is based on a 1949 Life magazine moonship design. We get to see the blueprint of the rocket, we learn that it is two stage (as was Life's proposed rocket). Look for bits of V-2 footage on the takeoff and landing of the rocket, but otherwise the special effects look okay. In this movie, great attention is paid to the fuel mixture (from several types of fuel carried on board) and calculations involving that mixture. We learn that these calculations require several hours, and are done by pencil and paper! At one point the crew has to physically alter fuel connections in the fuel bay, which is kind of a cool scene.Rocketship X-M is clearly a classic. As such, it contains many of the genre elements. But in all honesty, the movie drags somewhat because it tries to be so serious and as a 21st century audience member, you just about fall off your chair at the really bizarre and messed up notions of science. But hang in there, it has a great story. The rocket is attempting a flight to the moon, but it goes off course and ends up at Mars (OMG). The crew explores Mars all decked out in obsolete Army surplus gear from WWII (including gas masks), they make an important discovery (Mars looks very cool with the red tone), and attempt to head back to earth to tell the world the crucial lessons they learned to benefit mankind. But do they have enough fuel to get back? Will Lloyd Bridges break down the scientist woman's icy professionalism and get her to fall in love with him?

Murnau's classic 1922 silent film, Nosferatu.Herzog's film possesses neither the iconic imagery of Murnau's, the excitement of Christopher Lee's Count Dracula or Peter Cushing's 1958 Horror of Dracula, the retro-charm of Coppola's Dracula, or the iconography re-writing allure of Bela Lugosi and Tod Browning's 1931 Dracula, which changed Dracula from a horrific monster to a suave nobleman.Still, Herzog's film is interesting for a couple reasons. Whilst most Dracula films turn the Count into a charming Hugh Hefner character (which makes sense, as vampirism is largely a form of unhinged sexual hunger), Herzog's film stars the legendary Klaus Kinski as a monstrous creature. Kinski, whose character is bald, has rat fangs, clawed hands, a stiff gait and pointy ears, is of course modelled after Murnau's iconic Dracula, but the actor imbues his Count with traits which all other major Dracula's lack.In this version, Dracula is neither a cultured gentleman, a sadistic monster, nor a romantic lead. Instead, he is a rotting corpse, a twisted parody of masculinity, whose hungers for blood, sex and the monotonous litany of late-night feedings, clash with his nobility, wealth and polite manners. He's a wretch caught between civilisation and something more primal. Something which he fears is hardwired into his very being. A sad, tragic figure, Herzog's Dracula thus longs for the pleasures of death. More specifically, he wants to put Desire to death. Desire, as an unquenchable machine, desires it's own demise, which if course is the death drive writ large.All the faithful Dracula films have a Lucy character who sets the Count's hormones ablaze. But here Lucy is played by Isabelle Adjani, not as a damsel in distress, but the true hero of the film. Unlike her character in other Dracula versions, Lucy does not sacrifice herself, rather she tracks the vampire down and destroys his lair.In contrast, the men of the picture are completely incompetent. The famous vampire slayer, Van Helsing, is an elderly, ineffectual old man, and Lucy's fiancé, Jonathan, spends the latter half of the film imprisoned by Lucy.Beyond this you have the usual pseudo-sexual vampire themes. Here, the Count's rampant lusts are satisfied only after he bites Lucy, after which they both die, his lusts then passed on to Jonathan, a new breed of vampire\/masculinity which is able to show its face in the light. Some feminist writers use the film to highlight a shift in gender roles &#x96; female empowerment, sex no longer a monster never spoken of, but rather, morphing into a kind of free, liberated and public thing &#x96; but Herzog claims otherwise. The final shot of Jonathan riding off into the blazing sunlight of a desert was simply inserted, he says, because he fell in love with the location whilst scouting landscapes for a future documentary.Murnau's Dracula film remains one of cinema's finest works, and is homaged several times by Herzog. Herzog's Count, though, isn't really after sex, blood, or even mourning over a kind of unrequited love. Instead, he's supremely tired and literally always wants to die. In short, he desires death because he sees constantly desiring desire as a slow death spiral. Murnau's film, of course, is almost the opposite; Murnau was gay and people tend to read his classic as being about sexual repression and a kind of carnality which clashes with civilization and civilized behaviour. One film is thus about suppression, the other about anhedonia (the tyranny of uninhibitedness and expression); Herzog's Count is a Freudian monster, consumed by his own drive to consume and a victim of his very own desires. 8\/10 &#x96; Creepy, and Kinski is excellent, but the Dracula tale is just so VERY familiar.

Murnau's film, of course, is almost the opposite; Murnau was gay and people tend to read his classic as being about sexual repression and a kind of carnality which clashes with civilization and civilized behaviour. One film is thus about suppression, the other about anhedonia (the tyranny of uninhibitedness and expression); Herzog's Count is a Freudian monster, consumed by his own drive to consume and a victim of his very own desires. 8\/10 &#x96; Creepy, and Kinski is excellent, but the Dracula tale is just so VERY familiar. Worth two viewings.

In this version, Richard Harris's brief appearance as King Richard comes off as an ogre, a man ready to massacre children, a vulgar creature whose demise will make one applaud.The rest of the film is devoted to Robin's battling with his old foe-the Sheriff of Nottingham, a rather dull Robert Shaw. Connery is too old for the part of Robin and he is not exciting nor dashing at all. He needed to view clips with Errol Flynn.Hepburn, as maid Marion, has gotten religion and all she provides for is a rather weak performance.There is little excitement generated here and the chemistry between Audrey and Sean is virtually non-existent.With a film likes this, Robin should have remained in the holy land fighting the crusades, even when the latter had ended.
