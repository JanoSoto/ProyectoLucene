What if you learned that the typewriter that created it was there to help you alter the reality around you ? Sounds like a bad movie, doesn't it ? Maybe not this time, after all what television and movie fan wouldn't want to meet and interact act with the characters of his favorite show much less bend and control the reality around him? Unless Star Trek's holodeck becomes a reality, I guess we'll only be able to dream or at least watch this movie. In Delirious, John Candy realizes you shouldn't wish for things because you just might get them. In order to keep from getting bored with John Candy's smiling face and sheer content at being in a soap opera that he created and writes, the movie also pokes fun at all the clichés of the theme (brain tumors, favorite sons, diabolical scheming, series contradictions, et al). Stunningly immortal and sexy Emma Samms seems to enjoy herself in this movie playing against the good girl roles she has always received. Versatile Mariel Hemingway, however, is too tall and goofy to play the other beauty in this film; if not that holodeck truly existed, I would give this role to someone with sex appeal to rival Emma's like Donna Dixon or Ashley Judd. Raymond Burr proves he can be funny as he does his lines straight and David Rasche of the failed series Sledgehammer plays Emma's handsome doctor boyfriend impervious to her wiles who doesn't understand what is occurring around him. John Candy is a hoot in the role we would all want as he falls victim to his own short-sighted planning and typos as he creates the events around him. Missing out on numerous erotic possibilities, he never gets the chance to change the movie's rating from a PG to an R. Nor does he get to create his own celebrity walk ons Madonna as the mayor, Victoria Principal as a policewoman, etc. What we do have is a Brady Bunch-level fantasy-comedy with all the humor of a spoof of daytime dramas. This can be a funny and charming film that takes you through the life, loves and times of one daytime drama writer. Now, if only I could get into Dark Shadows............ I give the movie a 10, but that's mostly for the presence of mind to cast Emma Samms in it.

And I couldn't be happier. Especially because not only does the film team up to great film people- Actor Jim Carrey and producer\/director Ron Howard, the makeup effects in this film is the best I've seen in years. It is simply amazing craftwork done on Jim Carrey as he is enveloped in the Grinch caharcter, and even though you can't see him exactly, his personality, voice and soul is shining through at all times. What also attracted me to the movie is that it takes a look at The Grinch in a way that you understand his phsyche. If you were to read the book or watch the 1966 TV cartoon (which was also fun), all you would see is the basics (and or the third act of this film). But in most of the film, we see how the grinch has been transformed into an antihero and how he may be mad outside, but inside, he has a heart (even if it's 2 sizes to small). But the seriousness beside, this film is pure fun. It's consistently funny as we look at Carrey use his grinch to make the audience yuckle up. And it works. A true family film (kids, adults and teens will range from being amused to being convulsed in laughter), this is the film of the season, that is unless Unbreakable passes it.

It must have the ability to elicit its shocks and scares in a way that its target audience can identify with, without boring them to tears or insulting their intelligence. It must present protagonists we can empathize with and root for, and an antagonist that presents a threat that can represent something that we all fear, first and foremost, death in all its guises.HALLOWEEN managed this somewhat, but John Carpenter's crowning achievement owes as much to Hitchcock and the 'giallo' stylings of Dario Argento, as it does to Carpenter's talent for introducing tried and true conventions in a way that audiences had never seen them presented before.FRIDAY THE 13TH was actually no different and no better than most of Herschell Gordon Lewis splatterfests, or any of the infamous drive-in gross-outs that held sway all through the '60's and early '70's. What set it apart were the vast technical improvements over those earlier films, plus the unmistakable ability of master makeup artist Tom Savini to take cinematic gore to newer, more shocking and more repulsive levels. Which, bottom line, is about all that FRIDAY had going for it.Leave it to the writer\/co-producer\/director of what truly WAS the granddaddy of the slasher genre, the almost unwatchable LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, to come up with one of the last, truly terrifying monsters of the horror canon.The moment we close our eyes and enter our own subconscious minds, traversing the lands of our private, individual dreamscapes, is the moment we become the most vulnerable. Even more exposed than our naked flesh, our open minds are subsceptible to suggestion, to outer and inner stimuli, to the light and dark sides of our psyches that otherwise we would never have a chance to explore...or dare to.So what would happen if we introduced at this point, a creature who could take all the rules that bind the id, the ego and the superego, and slash the rulebook to bits? Someone who could wreak havoc at will the moment you fall asleep, free to torture, to maim, to murder you and your friends in your sleep, and not just make it SEEM real, but bring it all into the realm of waking, bleeding, screaming reality?That is the brilliance and the power of the original NIGHTMARE, eons before Fred Krueger became a razor-fingered Rodney Dangerfield, tossing off goofy quips while dispatching trendy teen actors ranging from Robert Rusler, to Jennifer Rubin, and even occasionally, the likes of Zsa Zsa Gabor. This was like an ABC Afterschool Special whose script somehow found its way into the word processor of Clive Barker, took a left turn into THE TWILIGHT ZONE and never looked back.Compared to the havoc that today's directors can now wreck with CGI, it may seem crude by today's Matrix-style standards. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and there are a few glaring gaps in continuity, but in the casting, the acting, the direction, the special effects and the music (a truly spine-chilling score by genre specialist Charles Bernstein), very few movies of its decade could measure up. It raised the bar for overall ability to scare the squirts out of you, and I can't recall the last time a film frightened me as much as my first ELM STREET viewing did.And that definitely includes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which, IMHO, is a really pale imitation of LAST HOUSE. Get yourself the unrated copy of this horror-in-the-deep-woods gem, turn out the lights, sit back and let it enfold you. Afterwards, if you can still speak, you tell me if you think BLAIR WITCH is still the scariest movie you've ever seen. Anyone who has seen the complete version wouldn't have been surprised at all, that the same director came up with NIGHTMARE and the SCREAM movies. I certainly wasn't.

Basically the film's scenes fall into two distinctly different categories.  First, there are scenes following Spartacus as he suffers through gladiatorial school, rebels against his tormentors, falls in love, and leads a slave revolt that threatens to topple the power of the Roman empire.  These segments succeed in everything they seek to achieve-- they entertain mindlessly and viscerally, and somehow manage to be exciting and predictable at the same time.  We all know, for instance, that the mean gladiator instructor is eventually going to get what's coming to him, but we're actually surprised and a little shocked when he finally does.  Add an effective score by Alex North, some occasionally touching human drama, and a massive battle sequence that clearly served as inspiration for Braveheart's massive festivals of destruction, and you've got one hell of a movie.But then someone decided that the film needed about an hour and forty-five minutes of flat, uninteresting, irrelevant, utterly useless political intrigue among the Roman heads of state.  Spartacus is one seriously lengthy movie, and during the segments focusing on the senate and the military leaders you can't help but look at your watch a few times.  I went along with these scenes at first, but after a while I lost track of all the confusing different political figures and what they were trying to accomplish.  I sat trying to figure out who everyone was and how the intrigues affected the Spartacus revolt story and found myself dozing off.

The young man, Harold, is able to find an unlikely friendship (and more) with Maude, a free-spirited 80-year old woman. This is intended to be comedy, as there are indeed some funny moments, namely where Harold's mother is filling out a computer-dating profile for her son, although it is more bizarre than truly funny or amusing. There are unsettling moments, as the premise itself of a love affair between a couple with a 60+ year age difference makes one kind of squeamish, as well as the gruesome fake suicides, but the worst moment for me was where Harold customizes his brand new Jaguar Sports Coupe until the hardtop resembles a tiny Hearse.  How dare he butcher such a fine a car! Unfortunately, I found the film rather ineffective, as either a comedy or as an unsettling piece that stayed with you (in that it really did not; after the shock value, I didn't care to think about any deeper meaning).  I would not rate this a must-see as many of my fellow reviewers do.  I admit I may certainly have missed the point, and I guess it's just not my type of film.

The love shown was part gratefulness and part idealism (ie living happily ever after with Jack) on her side and affection and anguish on his.  Still, there's a lot of love ing, isn't there?I'm ruining the movie message, aren't I?Kathy Bates gave (I think) a great performance as the unsinkable Molly Brown, and Victor Garber was an equally good Mr. Andrews.  The the extras and computer graphics of people drowning and the ghostly floating figures were great.It's a good movie, if you don't spend all of the three hours dissecting the plot and vivisecting it, or giving everyone a character analysis with Freudian c**p all over.  Then again, that applies to most epics, if this qualifies as one.

I never really liked Blazing Saddles, but that just proves I don't like westerns.Back to this movie,Leslie Neilsen seems to be loving it as he tries on the Dracula cape for the first time and does the Slavic accent.Some of the characters like Stephen Weber,Harvey Korman,Megan Cavanaugh and Mark Blankfield do seem to stand around like window dressing waiting to do their scenes.Peter MacNichol is a hoot as always as in every thing else he does.I do love seeing Lysette Anthony go from a witch on the new Dark Shadows to playing a very busty vampire in this.Her scenes in the graveyard and the tomb are hysterically wonderful.I do love seeing Clive Revill again; I haven't seen him since The Legend Of Hell House.  Mel Brooks also walks away with all the best lines as usual such as he shows where to stand when staking a vampire.Amy Yasbeck,though,is typically miscast; I have yet to see her pull off any trully funny roles but she is fairly amusing in the scene where Weber is in trouble for touching her. Brooks also pulls off some really close carbon copies of scenes of other Dracula movies. MacNichol's view in the cell window is practically direct from a view of Renfield in the original black and white Nosferatu. Cheers to Brooks for another masterful horror parody; now if he would only do ones for the wolfman, the mummy and the living dead.Scary Movie has already covered slashers.
