The reason why I say this is cause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to be one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga. If you disagree with me about what I say the structure is, just send me a message or place a comment.I saw The Phantom Menace twice in 3-D. The first time was the day it was released Feb., 10 and the second time was with my sister on the Feb., 20. Overall, I thought the post 3-D conversion was fairly impressive and it was worth seeing it again after nearly 13 years of its original release. Probably the most impressive 3-D shots were with the holograms and some lightsaber fight scenes. You could also see Jar Jar's tongue stick out of the screen in one shot. My eyes did strain a little bit at times with the transition from shots that were dark and kind of dole colored to very bright colored shots. But that's my only problem with the 3-D conversion.

I loved it and it was a great film to start off with this month since it being December! I had put this film on hold for a very long time, and I shouldn't have! Let's get into it! All the film is about is it sets on a Sergeant who comes to an island full of rituals and sacrificial killings, trying to locate a missing girl who the locals of the island claimed never existed. From there on, it's an unpredictable plot full of twists to whether this girl is real, alive, dead, fantasy or just a myth???? It could be any of those things and I'm not going to give away a cent of this thrilling film because you need to see it! All I can say is that this film is high on thrills, has many great mystery plots, contains it's level of violence and builds on the suspense throughout different scenes, with no music (only singing from the locals) creating a sense and feel of loneliness and isolation.Anyway, it's a classic and people need to see it and forget the remake. This film also let's you think and work out the different results in the actions that the Sergeant makes. The locals of the town give you the suspicion whether the Sergant should trust them and they're very unpredictable in their actions and the decisions they make throughout. It also plays with the mind, tending to let you continually point out what is going on. It's also very unpredictable and it will leave you shocked towards the end!!! The ending scene is the most unexpected and really leaves you in a web of questions!

You have created one of the best made films of all time. You have created a box office bonanza. You have created one of the most iconic movie characters of all time.What do you do? How do you follow it up? All too often we see filmmakers fall into the deadly sequel trap, this trap of course being take the elements and scenes the public really responded to in the first film, and ramp it up to 11Invariably, this approach always fails. Why does it always fail? Because this strategy is often pursued at the expense of the most important element of all- character development and a coherent story, which are the elements that made the original as successful as it was in the first place. From the first scene of Raiders the character of Indy is carefully unfolded before us- he is a man who is driven, resourceful, intelligent, and not afraid of a good fight. But he is also has his weak spots( fear of snakes, which isn't even a weak spot because it enhances his character by showing he has some vulnerabilities) and can be a bad judge of character( the underling who double crosses him in the first 10 min of Raiders). These elements are developed and built upon as the story unfolds.As for the story, again it is laid out carefully. We have Indiana's rivalry with Belloq who is Indiana's cynical foil, his willingness to fight against evil by seeking the Ark to foil the Nazis, his past relationship with Marion, and the unveiling mystery surrounding the ark. All of this is done in a balanced and measured way.The characterization of Indiana and the other major characters is balanced with the telling of the story. Do we learn all of the backstory for each major character? No, but we learn enough about them to make them fully fleshed and compelling. Belloq is amoral and greedy, but like Jones he does have a love for knowledge and values artifacts, also he does at least feel human compassion for Marion- a tough nut, a woman who can fight her own battles and as the movies goes on you can see why a man like Indy fell for her. Sallah is a loyal friend to Indy with whom we can infer he has had some previous adventures. Raiders was a great balance of characterization, story, plot, great action sequences, amazing FX and an iconic score. All combining to make one of the best movies of all time.Sadly, Temple sacrificed the characterization and plot and just decides to make this simple one big action sequence with some gross out sequences to pander to the kids- Temple really went of the way to pander to the child audience( the character of short round, the plot of kids needing to be rescued, gross out moments etc). Was this an attempt to increase merchandising sales? I do not know. Even more disturbing, Indy's love interest this time around is more a caricature of the damsel in distress rather than a fully fleshed out character. We are not given insight into the motivations or desires of the villains other than they are Eeeeeevell. In the other words, the villains are just stock wooden characters there to be defeated by Indiana. Granted, its hard to create a better villain than Nazis, but at least Belloq had some charm and style. But the most disappointing aspect of this sequel is..we don't learn anything new about Indiana. How did he become the man we saw in Raiders? Given that the film is set a year before the events of Raiders, it was a perfect opportunity to show some of the events that lead to Henry Jones jr becoming Indiana Jones. But in this film, we are given nothing to add to the aura or mystique of Jones, nothing to illuminate other facets of his character or his relationships that existed by the beginning of Raiders.Some said the movie failed because it was too dark, or too violent or too gross and too much action. The movie failed because despite having a fantastic character to base the movie upon, it failed to tell the story of that character.

Absolute Power falls into the third category. It isn't awful by any means but I wouldn't call it a great film as it's really nothing special. Eastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a thief who witnesses the President of the United States get himself involved in a terrible crime. The secret service tries desperately to cover up this crime, trying to get to Luther before he says something. It's a dark and cynical film about the way absolute power corrupts absolutely. The film has a fun story filled with good performances from a wide collection of skilled actors. However, when you boil the film down it's really fairly dull and there are numerous issues and absurdities that keep it from being a great film.Absolute Power tries to be as believable as possible, striving to be a sincere suspense\/drama, yet the plot grows more and more absurd as the film progresses and the plot thickens. The way the secret service handles their cover up just isn't believable in the slightest. At first it seems legitimate enough as they do all they can, but as the situation grows more dire they become more and more careless, making silly mistakes and taking unnecessary actions that would never occur in reality. Certain irrationalities obviously only exist to further the plot, breaking down the reality of the film.Yet, this film doesn't aggravate you and it doesn't slip into the realm of utter stupidity, just occasional irrationality. Thus it's still a mildly enjoyable film. The plot is engaging and interesting enough to hold your attention, despite it having no emotional pull and no sympathetic allure. It's devoid of any heart and we don't build any kind of strong connection with the characters. We only watch as they go about their business making a somewhat exciting story move along. I can give the film credit for having a story that is at least somewhat interesting from start to finish, and even has some really great moments every once in a while. There's one particular scene involving the police and two separate assassins that is actually pretty thrilling as it's unclear exactly what will happen. But one gripping scene isn't enough to make me love this film, but it keeps me from hating it. Overall, Absolute Power is a lackluster film that, although it does know what it's doing, doesn't do it particularly well. It might be worth one watch, but after that it's basically forgettable.

With the help of a mysterious man (Jackson), Dunne soon learns that he is, in fact, an extraordinary man with superhuman attributes. Now, I know that the first mention of the name Shyamalan nowadays leads many people to think, . . .ew 'The Last Airbender' . However, there was a time when Shyamalan actually made pretty good movies. This, thankfully, is one of the only 3 he has made. Unbreakable is a truly compelling study of the narrative mechanics of comic books. I, being a big nerd who loves comic books, found this movie to be intensely interesting to watch because it clued me into things which I didn't know about them. Like the fact that a villains eyes are always portrayed to slightly bigger than the hero's because it shows that his view on the world is slightly more off-kilter than the hero's. And the fact that the hero's origin is often tied\/interconnected with the villain's origin. These are just two of the many interesting concepts of comic book writing that are discussed throughout Unbreakable. Now make no mistake - this movie isn't a documentary. Yes, it does discuss a lot of the methods comic book writers utilize to convey their very distinct messages, but it does this verbally and nonverbally. This movie maintains a very quiet, yet intensely brooding tone. This tone is amplified by the really somber and mesmerizing performance from Bruce Willis. The cinematography is really intelligently executed, as I found myself saying, oh that was pretty cool\/clever, to a very large amount of this film's shots. The ending could've used some work, but I'm sure with time I can learn to appreciate it. In the end, I found Unbreakable to be a very good film that delves deeply into some really cool subject matter.

Okay, I know at heart that there are some obvious details in each film that make it different to ones before it, but I can't be the only one who's thought that, by simply pulling a bunch of dangerous-sounding buzz words out of the air (words like 'prosecution', 'corruption', 'mistaken identity' and 'manhunt') I could form the foundation of the next big action thriller. So why, then, is Andrew Davis' The Fugitive, a film that contains all these base ingredients and more, so much fun to watch? Short answer a solid story, good acting and a cast of characters that fit into their respective roles like a favourite pair of pyjamas. Long answer by all means, read on.Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected man sentenced to prison for murdering his wife, despite being adamant that it was not him, but a mysterious one-armed man, who committed the crime. On the bus ride to the big house, the other prisoners stage a daring escape, allowing Kimble to flee and begin a life of anonymity whilst seeking out the real killer. That is, until he crosses paths with Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), a hard-nosed US Marshal who cares not for Kimble's excuses, and whose only concern is restoring the status quo.Excluding the excellent Indiana Jones trilogy (notice I've left out the fourth instalment, which I refuse to mention by name), Ford has made this genre his forte, making him a natural fit for the desperate, determined Kimble. Jones earns the Best Supporting Actor Oscar by playing the typical Jones role to great effect a no-nonsense tough guy with a sideswiping sense of humour. And Joe Pantoliano, best known as Ralph Cifaretto (or Cypher, if you're no Sopranos fan) makes under-appreciated contributions as Gerard's right-hand man.Suspense is on high supply throughout. My personal favourite is Kimble's attempt to hide in plain sight at the hospital, a tense and dramatic set piece that sets a paranoid tone for the rest of the film. But there is a plethora of energetic, 'edge-of-your-seat' moments to satisfy film connoisseurs and action junkies alike, including the sewer chase, the St. Patrick's Day parade and the rooftop climax, all of which comply with the conventions of an action thriller nicely against the backdrop of a bleak, but not quite noir, Chicago CBD.Speaking of conventions, it's clear that Davis has made a tight pace the top priority in The Fugitive, as the entire film is determined to remove any and all obstacles that would otherwise slow the movie down. Character development is restricted mainly to Ford's character, but is sprinkled in just enough to keep the rest of the cast from looking like cardboard cut-outs. But most pleasing was the omission of a romantic subplot. At different times during production, both Julianne Moore and Jane Lynch were scripted as Kimble's love interest. Despite the obvious pitfalls this would create from a logical perspective (considering Kimble spends the whole movie trying to avenge his beloved wife), it also sounds like the director has dodged a minefield of clichés by avoiding the beaten path; something I am very grateful for.Admittedly, the film becomes a little convoluted in the third act. Depending on how much you've enjoyed The Fugitive, this alone might be enough to warrant a second viewing, but otherwise it's nothing that a quick trip to the IMDb won't fix. If you're looking for a theme to take away, I suppose the movie could act as an exposition of human nature in desperate times. However, I doubt that was on the agenda during filming, and so the film should instead be enjoyed as was intended an absorbing, high-drama roller-coaster, which I expect will remain a staple of this genre for many decades to come.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

There is a long build-up- too long in my view- at the start in which we see the troops larking about and preparing for their task. But, in contrast to the style of older film making, we learn nothing about their inner lives. They do not discuss their girlfriends or the folks back home or mention their hopes for the future. So when the shooting starts, the men we are supposed to be rooting for are no more well drawn than their opponents. It is telling that the most emotional moment is the shooting of a Somali whose son throws himself on the body.This lack of emotion is not helped by the general style. Quick editing and the fashionable 'washed out' style of colour make this look like a PC game. Ridley Scott is no doubt trying to recreate the confusion of war. But there is a difference between depicting confusion and actually confusing the audience.The music is often in a different rhythm to the film, which adds to the confusion. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not. For example a scene with an armed car going down a sniper's ally is overlaid with a folk-type tune. This does not vary even when the young man in the turret is shot to ribbons.The combination of loud music and the general din of battle make the soldiers sometimes hard to understand. This adds to the confusion. I found it helpful to use subtitles.After the long drawn out opening, the remainder of the film is an unremitting sequence of battle. Unremitting is the object word. In 2 hours there is no respite to the gory and violent. There are no quiet scenes.

Following in those daunting footsteps is the prodigal daughter, Sofia Coopla. One naturally watches one of her films with certain expectations. I'm glad to say I wasn't let down. The Virgin Suicides (1999), based off the novel of the same name by Jeffrey Eugenides, lacks the in-your-face violence of her father's pictures, but retains the remarkable subtly in its context. Whereas Francis Coopla focused on the underworld of organized crime and the brutality of war, Sofia's debut film was one about the turmoil in the suburbs.Despite not being direct about the family's lives, the film offers many details the audience must pay sharp attention to. Notice the scene early on in the film where one of the boys enters the bathroom of the Lisbon sisters at the chaperoned party scene. As he looks around, close-ups expose the religious objects in their bedrooms, walls, and even their bathrooms. The dull colors of the room differ very greatly from the boys' dream-like fantasy of Kirsten Dunst's character, her orange hair blowing in the wind and her smooth skin bathed in the high-key lighting. Throughout the film we see the boys' vivid sequences of the girls being truly happy, free in a meadow of golden wheat, and extreme close-ups of their seductive features such as the eyes and lips. However, it is hammered constantly and rather darkly just how in contrast the girls' lives are actually lived.The scene of the Lisbon sisters readying for the homecoming dance is a vital one, seeing as the dresses they are forced to wear are drab in color and devoid of variation. It reaches its peak, at least in my opinion, in the long overhead shot of Kirsten Dunst discovering her solitude in the eerily blue low-key lighting of the cold morning on the empty football field. Remember not too long ago as the kids rode together to the dance we saw the bright yellow and oranges of the evening sky and setting sun; creating the distinction between cold loneliness and the warm feeling of belonging. By use of colorful cinematography, camera placement and close attention to details, Coopla creates a movie that hits hard in very quiet ways. Its moments of surreal beauty are constantly paralleled by the harsh grays and pale whites of the Lisbon home that was those girls' harsh reality. Was the theme to the film that religion can be an oppressing authoritarian stronghold on a youth's life, or that women's inner emotions are truly indiscernible by men. Perhaps in the broadest sense, with those many point-of-view shots of people on-looking the Lisbon family plight, the theme to be derived is that humans tend to look away from the problems of others.

It reaches its peak, at least in my opinion, in the long overhead shot of Kirsten Dunst discovering her solitude in the eerily blue low-key lighting of the cold morning on the empty football field. Remember not too long ago as the kids rode together to the dance we saw the bright yellow and oranges of the evening sky and setting sun; creating the distinction between cold loneliness and the warm feeling of belonging. By use of colorful cinematography, camera placement and close attention to details, Coopla creates a movie that hits hard in very quiet ways. Its moments of surreal beauty are constantly paralleled by the harsh grays and pale whites of the Lisbon home that was those girls' harsh reality. Was the theme to the film that religion can be an oppressing authoritarian stronghold on a youth's life, or that women's inner emotions are truly indiscernible by men. Perhaps in the broadest sense, with those many point-of-view shots of people on-looking the Lisbon family plight, the theme to be derived is that humans tend to look away from the problems of others.

Following in those daunting footsteps is the prodigal daughter, Sofia Coopla. One naturally watches one of her films with certain expectations. I'm glad to say I wasn't let down. The Virgin Suicides (1999), based off the novel of the same name by Jeffrey Eugenides, lacks the in-your-face violence of her father's pictures, but retains the remarkable subtly in its context. Whereas Francis Coopla focused on the underworld of organized crime and the brutality of war, Sofia's debut film was one about the turmoil in the suburbs.Despite not being direct about the family's lives, the film offers many details the audience must pay sharp attention to. Notice the scene early on in the film where one of the boys enters the bathroom of the Lisbon sisters at the chaperoned party scene. As he looks around, close-ups expose the religious objects in their bedrooms, walls, and even their bathrooms. The dull colors of the room differ very greatly from the boys' dream-like fantasy of Kirsten Dunst's character, her orange hair blowing in the wind and her smooth skin bathed in the high-key lighting. Throughout the film we see the boys' vivid sequences of the girls being truly happy, free in a meadow of golden wheat, and extreme close-ups of their seductive features such as the eyes and lips.
