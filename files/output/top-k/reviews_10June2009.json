YES!! I wish they would make more creepshow films, more anthologies. I love this kind of film- lots of bite (or Chomp in this case) size stories pieced together by an exterior character, plot, or situation. It's like getting a 10p mix from your mum, and each sweet story has a scary taste all of its own. Some are soft and chewy, others are hard and crunchy, some are sour and you have to spit them down the sink, and occasionally you get a long lace. The best ones are when you get two stuck together so you get one for free! Even though it was your mum who paid for it. I like horrors and actions, films where lots of things happen. In these films the stories are so short they have to keep the plot small, the action fast, and everything is quick and exciting. If any of these stories were turned into a two hour film they wouldn't have the same impact and I would probably fall asleep or cry. I think all films in the future should be made like this. No-one can be expected to stay awake for longer than 2 hours at a time- we all watch MTV, and even American Idol has adverts in it so that we can have a quick nap before the next instalment. Films like Lord Of The Rings go on FOREVER, I felt like I'd aged 84 years after watching the first one. If they'd done all the LOTR films as one 90 minute anthology like Creepshow, it could have been the best film ever Story One. 'There's a bad ring, and a bad man wants it' 'I'm a good guy but it might make me evil, so I'll give it to this wee chump, no-one will expect that. The wee chump and his friends can go to the volcano and throw the ring in'. The wee chump sets off with his friends, meets a fairy, tramp, beardo, and a midget along the way, one of them is eaten, another killed, and they all get separated. Part 2 A monster helps the wee chump to escape, but it really wants to steal the ring. Meanwhile the bad guy sends his armies across the land and the rest of the gang have to hide in a castle and save the children. Part 3 The monster leads the chump into a spider web and steals the ring. It turns out the tramp is actually The King and he rallies the rest of the gang to prepare for the worst. The chumps' friend Brian wakes him up from Spider sleep, they beat up the monster and throw the ring into the volcano. The world is saved, the end. Awesome! Creepshow 2 features 3 stories written by Stevie King (directed by Romeo) during his drunk period. He claims he doesn't remember writing these, and to be honest, I don't remember watching them. The first is about an Indian Zombie getting revenge on the descendants of the cowboys who stole his buffalo. He chases round with a sword, eventually poking their eyes out. The second story features friends going white water rafting. They get chased by the Blob which eats them and pokes their eyes out with a canoe. The last story is about a demon driver who likes to pick up hitch hikers and gives them a terrifying journey. He also wants to poke their eyes out with his hand brake. Linking these stories is a little boy called Billy who likes reading comics. This is the same as the first film, and some of the same footage Is used.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"10 June 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Riply Scott's prequel to this film was a tale of intergalactic terror. Seven friends and their Bumbling Side-kick Jones were travelling home after a long vacation when they encountered a monster. Hearing it's distress call, they let it board their ship, but rather than show its gratitude, it decided to kill off the friends one by one in a terrifying game of cat and monster. The survivors from that film appear again here, namely Captain Ridley and of course Jonesy our heroic side kick. Ridley wants revenge for the death of her friends and recruits a team of super tough marines (that's soldiers to the lay person) to go to their home planet and wipe out the monsters once and for all. This darker tone is in stark contrast to Riply Scott's original, and it continues throughout. This leads to a series of let downs- Jones disappears without explanation early in the film, without explanation so much of the comedy from the first film is lost. Add to this the lack of Cyborg Ash, whose little dance was a hilarious highlight of the first and there are few laughs to be found here. Bill Pullman's marine Ernie 'Dry Heat' Hudson attempts some improvised one liners 'Hey Vasquez- you look like a man!' and tries some banter with his Sergeant 'Can I wear your slippers, Sir?' he asks 'LOOK AT MY EYES!' Capone riplyies. I didn't really understand this comeback, but I assume The Searg was in no mood for fun and games. This is obviously because the film was under the fierce stranglehold of famous control freak Jim Cameroon, known for a lack of humour in all his films. Cameroon reluctantly casts Paxman in all his films as they're cousins and there is a definite tension between the comic genius of the actor, and the ultra serious 'I'm The Daddy' mentality of the Director.Ridley and crew fly down to the planet to hunt down the monsters but are shocked to find a survivor- a little boy called Newt. This is a deliberate attempt to soften the almost unrelenting darkness of the film, and possibly bring in a wider female audience who may enjoy the mother\/son relationship which develops between Ridley and Nuke. The child doesn't talk much which in fact adds to the bleak tone, and the fact that he carries around a decapitated doll's head is rather disturbing. I mean, everyone knows boys don't play with dolls. Newt mumbles things like (in response to Ridley asking if he's hungry) 'I'm mostly scared. Mostly' and the bizarre 'Hi, Firmative!'. Presumably Firmative is some imaginary friend, or possibly futuristic slang. Through into the mix the fact that among the marines is a geeky science geek who wants to steal one of the monster eggs to bring home and experiment on or sell or something. Indeed, he hatches a plan to impregnate one of the gang with the egg so that no-one suspects anything. I think if I woke up with an 8 foot monster mounting me in an attempt to give me its seed, I might suspect something was not right. But back to the film. The gang underestimates the sheer number of the monsters (at least 25) and the fact that their King is on the island too, and soon it is the humans that are on the run. Cameroon is clearly adding a subtext here about man's destruction of nature and of other species, and that eventually it will turn around and we will be on the receiving end. I have studied film studies for at least a year, and have over a year's experience in social anthropology, so I know what I'm talking about. The last half of the film is really a series of chase scenes- in the alien base with tanks etc, in a bedroom with spider monsters, through the living quarters, and then into the sewers until The King wakes up. That's not to mention the super robot fight at the end which was a precursor to Cameroon's next film Terminator 2. So yes, there is much action and excitement, and lots of mistrust between characters which lends another level of tension.Most of the characters are killed off, but all fight well and you really feel like you got to know them. Ridley is a true mother- fighting for her family and friends, strapping on a grenade launcher to take on the bullies, Hudson is a comedian but also a bit of a moaner, Capone, Hicks, and Vasquez are all super tough and ultra cool. There is also Bishop, a cyborg who doesn't dance but preaches the Gospel and does magic tricks with knives. Perhaps if Riply had directed this he would have let some more comedy in, and it would have been a stronger film. At times I wanted to jump into the TV, grab a gun and help out my chums, pumping bullets into skulls. 'Come on, man! Shoot them! Here they come, quick, let's blow them away and get out of here! ARRGH!' I would have been shouting like that. Because the film is so dark and depressing though, I didn't have the energy to jump in and help. So all I could do was sit back and watch each of my friends get eaten, killed, or worse. Overall this is an excitement film, but Cameroon needs to relax and let some light in. I mean what's the point in having all these characters only for the planet to blow up at the end and kill them all? Best Scene When the soldiers are walking through the alien corridors, and all the bleeps are getting closer, but no-one knows where they're coming from. It was quite scary, but would have been better if Hudson had jumped out with his underpants on his head and shouted 'ONLY ME!!!'

Ridley is a true mother- fighting for her family and friends, strapping on a grenade launcher to take on the bullies, Hudson is a comedian but also a bit of a moaner, Capone, Hicks, and Vasquez are all super tough and ultra cool.

ARRGH!' I would have been shouting like that. Because the film is so dark and depressing though, I didn't have the energy to jump in and help. So all I could do was sit back and watch each of my friends get eaten, killed, or worse. Overall this is an excitement film, but Cameroon needs to relax and let some light in. I mean what's the point in having all these characters only for the planet to blow up at the end and kill them all?

Seven friends and their Bumbling Side-kick Jones were travelling home after a long vacation when they encountered a monster. Hearing it's distress call, they let it board their ship, but rather than show its gratitude, it decided to kill off the friends one by one in a terrifying game of cat and monster. The survivors from that film appear again here, namely Captain Ridley and of course Jonesy our heroic side kick. Ridley wants revenge for the death of her friends and recruits a team of super tough marines (that's soldiers to the lay person) to go to their home planet and wipe out the monsters once and for all. This darker tone is in stark contrast to Riply Scott's original, and it continues throughout. This leads to a series of let downs- Jones disappears without explanation early in the film, without explanation so much of the comedy from the first film is lost. Add to this the lack of Cyborg Ash, whose little dance was a hilarious highlight of the first and there are few laughs to be found here. Bill Pullman's marine Ernie 'Dry Heat' Hudson attempts some improvised one liners 'Hey Vasquez- you look like a man!' and tries some banter with his Sergeant 'Can I wear your slippers, Sir?' he asks 'LOOK AT MY EYES!' Capone riplyies. I didn't really understand this comeback, but I assume The Searg was in no mood for fun and games. This is obviously because the film was under the fierce stranglehold of famous control freak Jim Cameroon, known for a lack of humour in all his films. Cameroon reluctantly casts Paxman in all his films as they're cousins and there is a definite tension between the comic genius of the actor, and the ultra serious 'I'm The Daddy' mentality of the Director.Ridley and crew fly down to the planet to hunt down the monsters but are shocked to find a survivor- a little boy called Newt. This is a deliberate attempt to soften the almost unrelenting darkness of the film, and possibly bring in a wider female audience who may enjoy the mother\/son relationship which develops between Ridley and Nuke. The child doesn't talk much which in fact adds to the bleak tone, and the fact that he carries around a decapitated doll's head is rather disturbing. I mean, everyone knows boys don't play with dolls. Newt mumbles things like (in response to Ridley asking if he's hungry) 'I'm mostly scared. Mostly' and the bizarre 'Hi, Firmative!'. Presumably Firmative is some imaginary friend, or possibly futuristic slang. Through into the mix the fact that among the marines is a geeky science geek who wants to steal one of the monster eggs to bring home and experiment on or sell or something. Indeed, he hatches a plan to impregnate one of the gang with the egg so that no-one suspects anything. I think if I woke up with an 8 foot monster mounting me in an attempt to give me its seed, I might suspect something was not right. But back to the film. The gang underestimates the sheer number of the monsters (at least 25) and the fact that their King is on the island too, and soon it is the humans that are on the run. Cameroon is clearly adding a subtext here about man's destruction of nature and of other species, and that eventually it will turn around and we will be on the receiving end. I have studied film studies for at least a year, and have over a year's experience in social anthropology, so I know what I'm talking about. The last half of the film is really a series of chase scenes- in the alien base with tanks etc, in a bedroom with spider monsters, through the living quarters, and then into the sewers until The King wakes up.

Therefore, according to double jeopardy, once she gets out of prison, she can kill him and the law cannot punish her. Sound like a good premise for a fantastic thriller? That's what I thought. The result was a sore disappointment. Watching it in my law class, I noticed that I was more and more fascinated by my desk than the film.The film has its redeeming qualities a rather neat stunt is pulled off on a ferry (it delivers minimal, if any, thrills, but is sort of neat), and a complicated car manoeuvre in traffic is successfully pulled off. The redeeming qualities end there.A huge complaint I have is the film's ridiculous premise. An inmate tells Libby about double jeopardy and how she can use it to her advantage, claiming she was a lawyer. I barely managed to refrain from bursting out laughing. Ridiculous! As someone with a slightly above average knowledge of law, the film's premise was ridiculous. You are tried in a court of law on a certain charge based on certain facts. Example you have been convicted of killing Bob Jones on April 16th, 1987. Change the circumstances, and a new charge surfaces. Example You killed Bob Jones on January 27th, 2001. The film's premise is, therefore, hard to swallow, and emerges as preposterous, not something that a mere suspension of disbelief will cure.Now, let me address the film and its problems in general. We open as Mary Sue&#x85; I mean, Libby, is given a present by her husband a fishing boat she's fallen in love with. On the romantic cruise they take, the husband is killed. So far so good. Here is where Libby's Mary-Sue-ishness comes into play she bursts out uncontrollably in tears at all the right (i.e. dramatic\/emotional) bits and is cold and emotionless at all the other bits, other than one or two bits of Mary-Sue-ish, giggly laughter. Far from complex, she is a ridiculous cardboard caricature who is hard to sympathise with. After being found guilty (of course), she goes through a ridiculously fast, female version of The Shawshank Redemption (consider two black women bet cartons of cigarettes as to how long she will last in prison. Of course, in the 2 minutes Libby is at the prison, with no transition, they become immense friends, one of the women even making a cake for her son's birthday. When she exclaims she is innocent, the women react with false cheers of support. The six years in prison, where the psychological damage to her could've been shown in a powerful way, is glanced at in passing in a few minutes. We see Libby train herself physically once she finds out that she can actually kill her husband.) She then falls into the hands of Tommy-Lee Jones as her parole officer. She makes the stupid move of trying to break into a school to find out where her son now lives. Tommy catches her, and a chase ensues, where it shows that all of Libby's training has been completely useless. Gosh. A shame, ain't it? Libby naturally escapes custody (in a neat concept for a stunt off a ferry, but one that delivers no thrills). She then goes off to pursue her son. Long and short of it is she eventually kills her husband (who tried to kill her earlier and then one more time right before his death) in self-defence. (Of course, she's painted in rather jolly colours, as she doesn't plan on killing him, giggling with glee when her gunshot misses him.) The film ends on a sickening, syrupy-sweet reunion moment between Libby and her son.The Verdict Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, came up with his infamous bomb theory, distinguishing between shock and suspense. Double Jeopardy walks around wearing the label of a thriller, but its only shocks (not thrills) come from a) gunshots the audience knows are coming, but not exactly when OR b) Sudden, noisy appearances of the bad guy that are obviously coming, but again, the audience doesn't exactly know the precise time.

At the same time, it is a truly splendid and unique if uneven survival story. Never Cry Wolf is a flawed film, but it works on a fundamental level on the fact that it has an allegorical message instilled into its story and personified through its seldom off-camera protagonist.Never Cry Wolf is based on an autobiography written by Farley Mowat, a Canadian researcher who was sent to the mountains in the 20th century by the government, who wanted to hear back from him that the wolf population was responsible for the quickly disappearing caribou. He is played by Charles Martin Smith as a preliminarily timid, vulnerable pessimist who is quickly regretting his decision to venture out into the wilderness alone. Once marooned, he struggles to survive and all the while, growing more and more isolated and attached to the land around him and all former aspects of his life seem like another world gone by and not worthy of returning to.The element of Never Cry Wolf that really works, at least for me, is the allegorical subject matter of the destruction of the once majestic North American continent by what many like to call civilization and progress and how easily a person can realize this once committed to understanding and experiencing the old world that's continually dying away. Charles Martin Smith plays a somewhat underdeveloped protagonist who begins his quest completely alone and afraid and vulnerable and as time goes by becomes tougher, stronger in his emotions and his courage, and begins to alienate himself from the people he once associated himself with. What's also genuinely interesting is the relationship he has with the wolves he was dispatched to study and condemn as culprits. Though it's no surprise, Smith does indeed come to admire a particular family of wolves who are not the stereotypical bloodthirsty mongers seeking fresh meat and the thrill of a hunt. By contrast, the wolves are represented as their true nature curious, humble, courageous, and maternal. Smith does not have as much chemistry with the wolves as say Kevin Costner did in Dances With Wolves (1990), but the relationship is still interesting.If there are any flaws to the film, they do relate to the characters. There is hardly any dialogue at all in the film and like with Dances With Wolves, most of the dialogue that does exist is through a voice-over by Smith. The flaw, I felt, was that there was not enough emotion or personality expressed by Smith to make him a sympathetic or relatable character. Brian Dennehy, who personifies the evil of mankind (big surprise) is also kind of underdeveloped and without much of a story to give him a particular air of menace. The major weak point really was the character played by Samson Jorah, who did not hold interest for a moment.In the end, I feel that Never Cry Wolf is more of a fleshed-out documentary on the wilderness with a hint for something greater than a visionary epic. This does not mean, however, that it's a bad film. Despite the flaws that were to be found, I did embrace the film as a mildly entertaining pleasure.

Smith does not have as much chemistry with the wolves as say Kevin Costner did in Dances With Wolves (1990), but the relationship is still interesting.If there are any flaws to the film, they do relate to the characters. There is hardly any dialogue at all in the film and like with Dances With Wolves, most of the dialogue that does exist is through a voice-over by Smith. The flaw, I felt, was that there was not enough emotion or personality expressed by Smith to make him a sympathetic or relatable character. Brian Dennehy, who personifies the evil of mankind (big surprise) is also kind of underdeveloped and without much of a story to give him a particular air of menace. The major weak point really was the character played by Samson Jorah, who did not hold interest for a moment.In the end, I feel that Never Cry Wolf is more of a fleshed-out documentary on the wilderness with a hint for something greater than a visionary epic. This does not mean, however, that it's a bad film. Despite the flaws that were to be found, I did embrace the film as a mildly entertaining pleasure. If I chose to view it again, I wouldn't be going in looking for anything great, but I wouldn't mind the experience either.

Thousands of feet below the surface, a mysterious alien force is discovered, although their intentions are unknown. At the very least, we know the Russians aren't on the attack. That's about all that is really made clear in this movie.When it isn't busy drowning itself in character clichés and predictability, The Abyss uses most of its effort to force us into believing the impossible. This is all well and good, seeing as how even James Cameron himself acknowledges this film as purely fantasy, but little things like the previously drowned coming back to life in a schmaltzy scene and the comatose awakening to save the day tend to stick out like sore thumbs. Cameron, well-adept at both film-making and screen-writing at this point, could have and should have known better. Unlike The Terminator, this film fails to make its characters believable despite an implausible situation, and on the other side of the coin, lacks the intense adventure and horror of Aliens. This could all be forgivable, though, if the film had a solid or consistent plot. It's almost like Cameron was suffering from A.D.D. when he made this film, as evidenced by its multiple endings and dead-end subplots.On the upside, the film is, as expected, a stunning visual affair. You also have to admire Cameron's ambition (which would be focused a little better later on with Titanic) in under-going such a ridiculous film-making process, both in the magnitude of its production and in how outlandish its story really is. The film is anchored by Ed Harris, given one of his juicier roles, opposite the tough and endearing Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, whose career has curiously fizzled out since. The Great Michael Biehn shows up with a mustache and helps amp up the energy of the film, despite the fact that his character is disposable in the scheme of things. Truth be told, the film steers close to perfection as far as the actors and the overall direction goes. Yes, there are some dated effects that trap this film in the 80's, but that's not enough to bog things down. The main problem here is that the story seems to have been forsaken for action and razzle-dazzle.

Liza Minnelli is Sally Bowles in what is her career screen role. With the fading away of the musical genre, we don't get to see Liza Minnelli too often as a singer so be grateful that Cabaret is recorded and popularly available. Her role also calls for a great actress as well, so small wonder she won an Oscar in 1972 as Best Actress. Her award was one of eight that Cabaret received. Cabaret ran for 1165 performances from 1966 to 1969 on Broadway and it was reversed there in terms of casting. On stage it was an English woman and an American man expatriate it Weimar Berlin and starred Jill Haworth and Bert Convy. Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.Repeating his role as the Cabaret emcee is Joel Grey who was the Best Supporting Actor for 1972. I think it would have almost been impossible to do a film version of Cabaret without Grey. He's one fey and evil man who is quite willing to adapt to the new Germany. My guess is he found a boyfriend later on in Ernest Roehm's SA and later paid dear for it, either killed during the Night Of the Long Knives or died in one of the camps.I've always loved the contrast between the Von Trapp family who saw what was coming to Austria and took measures to flee and Sally Bowles who kept on in her words, going like Elsie. York could see what was coming as did many others in her crowd. One can only hope she did eventually.Liza Minnelli's best song was one especially written for the screen version by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb. With all the awards Cabaret won, amazingly that Maybe This Time didn't even rate a nomination for Best Original Song. In an era when good film songs were at a premium, that was inexcusable.One other comparison with Sound of Music. The song sung by the young Aryan pure Germans, Tomorrow Belongs To Me is a frightening number.

I cannot understand how I managed to get to 2009 without having seen more than snippets - I even have it on my DVD shelves, for heaven's sake! But I'm glad that my first full viewing was of the restored print at my local multiplex this is one of those movies which demands to be seen on a really big screen. The advent of CGI means that we have got used to computer generated hordes fighting epic battles, but Spartacus features thousands upon thousands of real people ranged across real landscapes in the days when films like this were a real event.For all its epic sprawl, the heart of Spartacus derives from the love between Spartacus and Varinia, and I was surprised to see this movie from Kubrick - demonstrably such a cold fish in so many of his films - have such a moving centre. Even the key Roman figures are noticeably less clinical than is customary with Kubrick.The main performances are, for the most part, very good (although the less said the better about John Dall's dreadful, dreadful turn as Glabrus), and I was particularly surprised at Olivier. I have found most of his movie work to be mannered, almost self-conscious acting (bordering on thesping if you follow what I mean) - here he gives a naturalistic performance which is by far the best performance I have ever seen from him on film. Jean Simmons is luminous and lovely.

In a movie like this, all that matters is action, action, and more action. Suspense is desired, but a movie can succeed without it. Fortunately, U-571 has both, and in great amounts. The story starts out slowly to help us get to know the characters, but once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Ever.U-571 is populated by a number of good performances. In general, I don't like Matthew McConaughey. In the right role, he can be effective, but usually he just mails in performances in formulaic romantic comedies. But U-571 calls for him to carry the movie on his own, and he delivers. Andrew Tyler is a man who thinks he knows what to do, but it turns out he has a lot of learning to do. He can alternately be like a father figure and a tough-as-nails, do-what-I-say-or-else commander. McConaughey hits every note. He's aided by his CPO Henry Klough, ably played by Harvey Keitel. Klough is a man who does his job no matter what, and expects everyone to do the same. He's the veteran among the crew, but he knows his place, and he stays there. Jake Weber is suitably mysterious as the man who knows everything about the code machine, but doesn't talk about it unless he has to. This is a guy who spends his time behind a desk instead of out in the field, so being in an situation is not something he's used to (then again, nor is to for anyone else, but they're submarine sailors, and he isn't). Rounding out the young (though severely underdeveloped) cast are David Keith, Jon Bon Jovi, Tom Guiry, Will Estes, Jack Noseworthy, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson, Erik Palladino and Dave Power. All are likable and perform ably. Thomas Kretschmann is the German hostage, but again, he's not that developed.One of the reasons that U-571 works as well as it does is that director Jonathan Mostow is able to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. Any personality deficiencies are not as problematic because we feel right like we're there with the crew. But Mostow's skill doesn't end there. He keeps things moving, and the audience never has a break from the tension. Just as one situation closes, another one is right around the corner. In retrospect, this decreases credibility, but for the constraints of a two-hour movie, it doesn't matter. Besides, you won't be thinking about it while you're watching it.Comparisons to the classic WWII submarine movie Das Boot are unavoidable. In terms of quality, Wolfgang Peterson's classic is better, but for those who don't have the time (or can't stand subtitles), U-571 does the trick.

Ultra violence and low budget, while still remaining watchable often times can lead to a cult, and this is no different. This is a bizarre film that shows the weakness in characters, such as drug addiction, sex addiction, STDs and more. The problem is, this movie focuses on over 10 different characters, each with their own sub-plot, so we never get a main plot. It's just a series of stories on puppets working on a show, and how they live their lives.Meet the Feebles is a popular show, starring an eclectic group of animals that sing and dance an perform amusing numbers. Backstage, things are completely different. Arguably, the main plot is that of Robert the Hedgehog, who is the newest Feeble. He is trying to woo Lucille, a chorus girl poodle. Other plots include Heidi the hippo whose lover and manager is cheating on her for Samantha the cat. This sends her in an eating rage, and later a violent rage. Sebastion the fox, the group's gay choreographer is trying to get a number in on the show, but it isn't until the stage goes into complete chaos that he gets it in. Trevor the rat, the manager of the manager, drugs and rapes Lucille. Harry the rabbit believes he's contracted a deadly STD. And many other sub-plots...This movie has no focus, and the constant switch of characters can grow tiring. There's a lot of gross out humor to appeal to those who enjoy puppet violence\/sex, but it only comes in spurts, so don't expect a constant bloody puppet orgy. The Robert the hedgehog story brings a small bit of heart to the movie, but at the same time, it's just not very interesting. None of the plots are particularly interesting, except for Heidi's final performance backstage. It's the characters that make this watchable. There's so many and so many jokes being fired, and about a quarter of them are funny, and the rest you just shrug off.With all that said, this isn't a bad movie. It's just a very disjointed film. It is amusing mostly, and occasionally it's really funny, but you may find for some of the film you'll be closing your eyes thinking about pudding (or something other than the movie in front of you).My rating ** 1\/2 out of ****. 97 mins.

This was my first viewing in 2009 and it would be easy to compare this to 'Fatal Attraction' and more recent 'Obsessed,' but of course I cannot as these two were decades later. So, I guess, this was one that basically started all the basic instinct movies. Clint Eastwood's a Jazz DJ who has an obsessed fan which leads to a fatal attraction. Sorry, there, I did it. Anyways, perhaps I should've seen this movie first. Perhaps then it wouldn't have been such a (VERY) slow-moving picture. (Spoiler alert) We have the (obviously) diabolical femme fatale who's (barely) booked for assaulting a housekeeper 1 hour into the feature and then Clint and girlfriend head off to a Woodstock-type festival for 15 or so minutes. This was followed by the shockingly release of the bad girl just in time for the climax. What? The movie itself was slow at times, but then it screeched to a halt during the music concert. And I guess you'd have to be a fan of jazz (of which, obviously, I'm not) because it's throughout and incredibly wrong in the final battle sequence. It just doesn't flow\/fit the action. But, then, again, it's the one that started the evil female stalker films, much like what Michael Myers did in 'Halloween' for the male stalker side. And I'm not an Eastwood hater (loved 'Unforgiven,' 'Gran Torino' and 'In the Line of Fire') but it was either his acting or character that didn't play out too well. So many odd events happen and Eastwood shows little to no emotion, as if just reading lines. In this movie, he actually was supposed to be human and not super-cop Dirty Harry.

I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits.In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought Malkovich was better.Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm, John Mahoney as the Secret Service head, Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire.

After watching Stone's pro football movie, the name of which I have blocked out, I understand how conservatives (and really anyone who enjoys a good film) must feel. He, Stone, is the very picture of the bleeding heart liberal (and this from a guy who has done his share of bleeding) as he paints with huge, broad brush strokes and Nixon is no different. What was he trying to say about Nixon? All that psychedelic crap, the wild colors et al? Was Nixon on acid? And then he got a wonderful actor, Anthony Hopkins, to give an over the top, Classic Comic Books performance with no nuance what so ever. Only Joan Allen, a longtime fav of mine, saved face with a wonderful, long suffering portrayal of Pat. All of Stone's films are over the top, it's his way for sure. But, this one really ranks (pun intended) right up their with his worst efforts. Do yourselves a favor, and if you are feeling like a Nixon fix, forget this turkey and rent Frost\/Nixon, a really wonderful character study of two men, and a huge (Paris Hilton alert) moment in American history.
