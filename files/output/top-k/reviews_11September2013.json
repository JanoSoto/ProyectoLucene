The cinematography is amazing. We get it. But is this a great narrative? A great drama that somehow shows us something important about fascism? No way.At best this is a story about one chapter in the life of an eccentric mixed-up guy who worked for the fascists. And I don't think that's done in a satisfying way. The story leaves too many questions. Too many important scenes are left out. How come we never see what Marcello does during the week. It feels like he is a perpetual aimless bourgeois who wanders around Rome by himself. Does he have a job of any kind? Splitting the story up over six or so years didn't work for me either. Wouldn't it be important to see his wife's reaction immediately after the assassination? Too much is left out to form a complete picture of these characters.

Is this her way of trying to understand or reveal his true motives? I just don't buy it. Here she is with her and her husband's life at risk and she decides an appropriate strategy would be to flirt with the enemy behind her husband's back!

The story of a prison warden who wants to change everything that's wrong in the prison system of his state really happened. Brubaker focus on a challenge to a corrupt system that on the surface seems to be doing its service of punishing convicted criminals but also is a vile and dirty business whose purpose is to profit above all costs. The lead character, played by an unusual and remarkable Robert Redford, is introduced to us as a prisoner who barely speaks but observers everything concerning how inmates are treated by the guards, how the machine works behind bars and the constant brutality of the place. The plot twist to everyone is when he presents himself as the new warden and he sets up a whole reformation on the place, condemning what's wrong and doing what he believes it's right. There's plenty of benefits for the prisoners but the guards and the businessman who always gained advantages with the old administration aren't happy about this, and that misery and dissatisfaction goes back to the people who hired him, the governor and his staff who now pressure the man to go easy with his work. After all, they are losing a lot of money obtained with frauds and illegal schemes. One man alone means nothing so Brubaker is helped by some inmates and a local authority (Jane Alexander) who is close to the state governor, and will try to convince everyone that Brubaker's idealism if put to work can be profitable for everyone involved.Brubaker's idea isn't just to denounce the illegal affairs of the state and make budget cuts. He's more concerned with the way convicted felons are treated, want to stop their exploitation and make the place a safe environment instead of the critical animal factories that don't punish anyone but is only useful to transform them into bigger monsters whose only fate is either death, or commit more violent crimes or to return to the animal factory again. Sure, this idea is good and valuable but not practical. In the film's case, it fails because one can't change a system unless if one being part of it; Brubaker made the terrible mistake of not firing the whole officials team, and those guys still managed to cause harm and work their way behind his back; and the people with the money will always speak higher.Such idealism wouldn't work today, that's sure but it could worth a shot, specially in countries where the private initiative isn't the option (because politics are having their big time with a failing system that pays them well). Today's criminal minds are far more worse than the ones from the 1980's when this was made and they probably wouldn't leave a place where they could feel as if being on a hotel, practically with the cell keys on their hands, dictating orders like Pablo Escobar did in his prison time.

I have very mixed reviews about this film, and am sure I am not the only one. I do not believe this to be a marmite film as most of the reviews suggest. I can and do see this from the point of view of both parties, seeing it as a boring waste of time and seeing it as sci-fi\/cinematic history.I do agree, the story line is very scarce. There isn't that much happens, and when it does it is over before you even realise its begun. There is a lot of slow, boring and un-necessarily long clips of pretty much nothing; ships\/people floating around, someone running, a phone call, a conversation that offers very little to the plot. I am not a troglodyte as some of the lovers of this film may be starting to think. I understand why it is included and done the way it is, but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly boring.However, to see this from a positive point of view, one must remember that this was made in the mid-to-late 1960's. Meaning that everything done in this was done for real, rather than CGI as everything is now. For this reason I don't feel that it can be put in the same class as modern sci-fi films.I sadly have not read the book of this, I have just decided to watch the film because my friend likes to quote it to me and I wanted to see what she was going on about. This left me very skeptical when I started watching, especially as seemingly nothing was actually happening. You really do have to keep watching and thinking about what it is actually depicting. A large amount of the themes and science fiction ideas were depicted on screen for the first time in this film and is therefore giving a visual insight into what mankind has predicted the future will be like and it is remarkable how much they have actually gotten right for what we have already accomplished and what we are still working on. A lot of the ideas in this film are still being copied to this day, and has now actually got me questioning Ridley Scott's work. I am not saying that Scott has copied Kubrick, just that some of the praises Scott has received shouldn't really be given solely to him for his work in the sci-fi genre. Kubrick has managed to show to the world the realism of space. We all watch films these days and like to point out, that couldn't happen, that would never happen, etc. etc. That is the reason behind all the slow and uneventful scenes, it is being kept to a realistic standard of how it would actually have to happen and to show you how slow a long space trip like that would actually be. The shots of space exploration also show demonstrations of the physical properties of our universe and how things actually happen.So, to conclude. Although this may not be an exciting, eventful or thrilling film, it is certainly a feat of cinematography. It more depicts the realistic side of sci-fi rather than the laser guns and phasers of popular sci-fi shows. So if you are looking for a fast paced, action sci-fi, then this isn't for you. If you more enjoy the technological\/engineering side of themes like this, then it is right up your street. Just bare this in mind, be in the right mind set when you sit down to watch it!

This left me very skeptical when I started watching, especially as seemingly nothing was actually happening. You really do have to keep watching and thinking about what it is actually depicting. A large amount of the themes and science fiction ideas were depicted on screen for the first time in this film and is therefore giving a visual insight into what mankind has predicted the future will be like and it is remarkable how much they have actually gotten right for what we have already accomplished and what we are still working on. A lot of the ideas in this film are still being copied to this day, and has now actually got me questioning Ridley Scott's work. I am not saying that Scott has copied Kubrick, just that some of the praises Scott has received shouldn't really be given solely to him for his work in the sci-fi genre. Kubrick has managed to show to the world the realism of space. We all watch films these days and like to point out, that couldn't happen, that would never happen, etc. etc. That is the reason behind all the slow and uneventful scenes, it is being kept to a realistic standard of how it would actually have to happen and to show you how slow a long space trip like that would actually be. The shots of space exploration also show demonstrations of the physical properties of our universe and how things actually happen.So, to conclude. Although this may not be an exciting, eventful or thrilling film, it is certainly a feat of cinematography. It more depicts the realistic side of sci-fi rather than the laser guns and phasers of popular sci-fi shows. So if you are looking for a fast paced, action sci-fi, then this isn't for you. If you more enjoy the technological\/engineering side of themes like this, then it is right up your street. Just bare this in mind, be in the right mind set when you sit down to watch it!

Everything was all about the Turtles back then, Turtle mania, everything was pizza, skateboarding, martial arts and using surfer slang...particularly annoying.The plot is an origins plot obviously, telling the story of how the Turtles come to meet 'April' and 'Casey', how they came into existence and their first battle with 'Shredder' and his Foot Clan. What is good about this film is the fact they incorporated elements from both the original comic book and the popular cartoon. At the same time the film was also quite dark in places and with a lot so called bad influential material such as kids being taught the ways of crime, stealing, lying, general delinquency and of course weapon based fighting. But really parents! what did you expect?.The classic of course being the UK having a heavily cut version of the film to avoid the showing nunchaku violence, the fact the entire franchise was renamed 'Teenage Mutant HERO Turtles' and they cut the finale scene with Shredder. Germany also included cartoon sound effects to lessen the impact of the fighting, pfft! these Euro countries huh.Myself I enjoyed this film back in the day and I still do today. I loved how the film is dark and gloomy in places, its still highly childish and dumb naturally but the essence is quite a fine line. The sequence where 'Raph' loses it after 'Splinter' is taken is actually quite scary for kids I think, a very dark moment. In fact most scenes with Raph are quite edgy really, for a kids film, I always wanted him to swear haha. The fight sequences are pretty neat and do show the actors performing some decent moves in the suits...something you don't really expect seeing how bulky they look. Of course you never see anything nasty, its all quite tame and more in line with the cartoon but its still fun.This made possible in my opinion by a few factors. Firstly the entire film has a darkish gritty look about it, the picture quality isn't polished and shiny like some big franchises, this could be down to the fact the film was an independent film. I don't think this was intended, its just one of those happy\/lucky mistakes, although the lighting is dim throughout. Secondly the Turtle suits are very good and very different from the later more kiddie friendly suits. The colour scheme is darker, the eyes are smaller, in general the faces\/masks just looks slightly meaner. The later suits were brighter and with much bigger eyes (Disney eyes). Thirdly the weapons all looked pretty realistic too, if you get a look at them, they don't look like rubber n plastic, they look surprisingly good. As mentioned the actors all move nicely within the suits too, no restrictions it seems. Fourthly I think the main villain is played brilliantly by Saito. He goes at it for real, not a hint of ham or hokeyness, he plays Shredder as if he were a real crime lord and a complete bastard. True he doesn't actually do anything accept growl all the time...'TURTLES!!!', but its the way he does it, the dude owned this role. Oh and his outfit looked sweet too, you'd think it would look cheesy but it fudging rocks!.lastly I give kudos to the voice actors who really brought the characters to life. Never really liked the voice for Raph gotta be honest, he sounds like he's slow or something. The other three are great, really got into the Turtles vibe and made you believe, especially liked Corey Feldman contribution for 'Donatello', the guy was born to be that characters voice. In fact the whole cast does well in this film in all honesty, everyone plays it for real (to a degree) and thusly the film doesn't come across like a dumb kids film. Koteas goes a bit far in places, clearly enjoying himself, but its fun to watch him.Its hard to say but this film is a bit of a classic now, a cult classic. The first and easily the best Turtles film but also a film that played out well for adults too, a film with giant rubber ninja turtle suits!. It helps that Jim Henson was the creative team behind the suits. The film ends on a bit of a damp spot in all fairness, anti climax really, but that doesn't hinder the overall experience.

Believe it or not&#x85; Pierce Brosnan was set to take over the role at this juncture. But he couldn't get away from his show Remington Steele. He had to wait until 1995 where he would finally cement himself as James Bond. This was actually the very first James Bond movie I saw, so I kinda hold it dear to my heart. It's also a really good action movie ( Wait until you see the fight sequence in the Airplane during the finale!) It has one of the most exciting openings you'll see in a James Bond film. I also liked how gritty it was. Sean Connery is the most entertaining Bond, but Timothy Dalton may be the most realistic. His cold blooded approach to the role was very refreshing for the time, and I loved his all business attitude. He does have some Bond wit that we all love, but it's a really different portrayal as Bond. Some say he is the best Bond. I'd be inclined to disagree, but he might just be the Bond that resembles the books the most closely. Dalton was absolutely wonderful and probably tied for my 2nd favorite Bond with Daniel Craig. Maryam d'Abo is one of my favorite Bond girls of all time. There was just something about her that was so sexy and endearing. I thought she was excellent.

It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role.Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay viewer, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them.First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in orderClue one The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's boy. In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual.Clue Two In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another amigo because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him.Clue Three Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved.Clue Four After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's different. Clue Five There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes.As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's boy. In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual.Clue Two In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another amigo because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him.Clue Three Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved.Clue Four After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's different. Clue Five There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes.As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.

It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role.Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay viewer, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them.First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information.

You are expecting that after he is arrested by the police, his motives will be clear. However, after his arrest. the only thing that is clear is his mental instability. A learned man becomes a preacher of sins and how to end them. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have acted beautifully.

One thing that I felt fell completely flat was intermittent narration by Robert Benchley; Benchley was a clever fellow, but here I just didn't think it was well written.The film begins with Lamour and Hope an an old married couple who are suddenly visited by old DCrosby. They reminisce about their adventures in the Klondike. It's well done and leads into the main flashback story. Two thugs murder a man and steal his map to a gold mine in Alaska. The murdered man's daughter (Lamour) is told on his deathbed to find a man named Ace Larson to get back the gold mine. Meanwhile, two con men (guess who) are performing their crooked vaudeville act, only to have to run from the police and an angry mob. The duo decides to split -- one going to Alaska, the other to New York...but of course Hope gets dragged into the Alaska trip by a more clever Crosby. Meanwhile, the thugs also board the boat to Alaska, and when Hope and Crosby put their money into a safe -- which is actually a port hole -- and lose their funds they work as ship hands...and discover the thug's stolen map to the gold mine...which they promptly steal. In Alaska, Ace Larson plots to cheat Lamour out of her goldmine, while Lamour entertains in his saloon (doing a nice rendition of Personality). After stealing the gold mine map and getting caught, Crosby and Hope disguise themselves as the thugs, not realizing that they are crooked. Each of them holds one-half of the map. Once in Alaska they both fall in love with Lamour (naturally), but are pretty inept with their romancing...while Lamour assumes they are the thugs who stole her father's map. She plays them, not realizing they are actually the good guys! The real thugs arrive and Hope and Crosby escape them via dogsled...although exactly where they are going is left up in the air. Nevertheless they are chased by the thugs until they come to a cliff with no escape. But, of course they do escape after some close calls. Meanwhile Ace is in the chase, as well, as is his woman (Hillary Brooke, whom we often saw with Abbott and Costello). Brooke plays a faux love interest for Hope, who has already apparently lost Lamour to Crosby. While once again escaping from the villains, Hope and Lamour gets separated from Crosby when a glacier crevasse opens up, and Crosby is left to face the mob while Hope and Lamour escape. Then we suddenly go back to the present as Crosby doesn't tell Hope and Lamour (or us) how he escaped the mob (that's a little disappointing, but perhaps part of the joke). In the end we find out that Hope and Lamour have a son who looks just like a young Crosby...but of course that wouldn't have been allowed in those days...so Hope informs us that the boy was adopted (wink, wink).Crosby and Hope are...well, Crosby and Hope. Their chemistry is magic. The Personality number may be Dorothy Lamour's best on screen number. Hillary Brooke's performance as the shady woman is fine, as is Douglass Dumbrille's role as the crooked Ace Larson.I should mention that this film includes one of Hope & Crosby's best buddy songs -- Put It There Pal. It was a classic that they performed many times over the ensuring years. Great stuff! Overall the gags are a little better in SOME of the other Road Pictures, but this is fun and there are some good laughs. The mainstream DVD I have isn't a very good print, unfortunately, but overall it doesn't detract too much from your viewing pleasure.

It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him.

While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian&#x85; even though at first they don't get on.This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen&#x85; her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags&#x85; it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.
