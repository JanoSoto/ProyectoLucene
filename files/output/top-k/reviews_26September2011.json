[{"date":"26 September 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Election is a film beautifully capturing the ugliness of a situation; an all at once funny, bubbly, flashy and well made comedy getting up there on screen the frank and unkempt nature of both high school politics and the items which democracy in general can lead people to both do and become. It is a film telling the story of a handful of people both innocuously placed into situations they have no right in being anywhere near, and at once delivers a telling account of those whom go out of their way to both exploit and destroy the lives of certain others. Alexander Payne's film is a brash and often funny, in both a blackly and morbidly so sense, film depicting those caught up in an event spiralling out of control and eventually coming to ruin each of both their own, and most everyone else's involved, in the process.When one outlines that the film, in its barest of forms, is a piece about the behavioural patterns exuded by an array of different people of varying ages and genders brought about by an election, one is rushed into thinking that such an outline might put the majority of audiences off. In spite of this, Election comes to form a wondrously tight comedy\/drama doing remarkably well in its exploring of such a thesis in a taut and intelligent manner. It is about the pratfalls of free-world politics; about the idea that anybody, from any background and of any nature, can run for something and have an opinion on things, but a film exploring such a notion through the lens of an American high-school inhabited by those less than pleasant once the exterior shells have been stripped away.There exists three principal characters without there necessarily being any specific lead; their interactions and dynamics coming to formulate the nucleus of the film and their behaviour driving the plot. The film is entirely liberal in its addressing of each of these people, wondrously remaining so in spite of its overall sending up of liberalism. There is a lone narrator initially guiding us through proceedings before certain others begin to get involved in his life much more than he would like. This person is Jim McAllister; a teacher at the high-school but an athletic man, a precise man and a meticulous man that is established through the film's opening scenes. McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick; if people whom were old enough to remember Ferris Bueller's Day Off when it was released didn't feel old when watching Broderick play that of a nuclear fallout scientist in the previous year's Godzilla, then chances are they might have done upon seeing the individual whom played that titular rouge back-in-the-day now teaching at a high-school.His introduction is inter-cut with that of Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick, her additionally concise nature in laying out numerous paraphernalia for her upcoming election campaign highlighting degrees of similarity in their coexistence's and priming us for the ongoing tussle which will later play out. Flick is an achiever; always first to answer the class question, she excels in numerous fields of performance, journalism and foreign languages and appears to just stand out when she sits in class amidst the rows of other classmates, as if glowing or radiating out from the rest of them and their less than enthusiastic, less than prominent features. If McAllister is aware of her, it is because a colleague of his lost both his job and his dignity at the hands of her and the ill-judged extra-marital affair his colleague got caught up in. Third in line is the student polar opposite to Flick in Paul Metzler (Klein), a big guy with a penchant for contact sports more-so school work whom, in McAllister's own opinion, is somewhere nearer the bottom of the student spectrum of greatness. Paul's sister Tammy (Campbell) even decides to run in the election herself, a decision motivated on a personal rather than a professional level when her bisexual girlfriend leaves her for Paul.Metzler comes to run for the election up against Flick when McAllister falsifies his belief that he has the ability to do so, a low blow aimed towards school-star Flick in what is an attempt to derail her ambitions and performance. There is an amusing instance in which Flick stares at him and his campaign table as he attracts the attention from the other students; he may not have the ability, but he is certainly popular &#x96; her disgusted gaze captured with some Morricone-like spaghetti western-esque musical tones reiterating a sense of conflict; a sense of these people, include McAllister if you will, caught up in a melting pot of tension and antagonism without necessarily being able to exteriority show such things prominent the American high-school equivalent to a Good, a Bad and an Ugly neatly summarised in this fleeting composition. Where that remains one instance of these parties clashing and coming up against one another, the film itself is a more than apt collective whole depicting sleaze and fallouts circumnavigating this election; a neat and timely alternative to your more typically adolescent high school caper which works.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"26 September 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person &#x96; some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.
