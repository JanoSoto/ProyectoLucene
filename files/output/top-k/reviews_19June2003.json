However, my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been saying.Kino's digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive.  The sound and picture quality are both excellent.  However, I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia, on the film's influence on future films, and on the incredible visual effects, given its year of release.  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie.  I thought this was a good film, but not a great one.  A rating of 8.3 is much too high, and at #93, there are plenty of better films ranked below it.First, the good parts of the film 1) The special effects are excellent for a pre-1930s film. 2) The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work, the decisions they make, and in how easily they are led\/misled. 3) The main character is well developed throughout the film, and the audience can relate to him well. 4) The film is visually stunning and impressive. 5) The story of the working class, vision of the future, machine-men, etc. have had a very strong influence on many films which came later.On the other hand, here is a list of what could have been done better 1) Many scenes dragged on too long and were tedious.  I can't imagine it being any longer than it already was. 2) The differences between the thinking class and the working class were not clear; both seemed to be pretty mindless. 3) The themes and ideas in the film have been explored better in other productions. 4) The set design and special effects are not as good as they are in the 1936 film, Things to Come. 5) Things to Come also has a far more interesting and creative vision of the future. 6) Joh Fredersen is not well developed, and his motives and decisions seem illogical for the leader of the thinking class. 7) There is no explanation for how the spiritual and motivational leader of the working class became so intelligent, capable, and\/or competent.  More background on Maria would have helped develop her character, and improved the film.In its defense, it could be that I was not as impressed by this film simply because so many films which came after it have copied, borrowed, stolen, or re-worked ideas that appeared here first.

There was no plot, and the humor which isn't great begins to drag on after no real point is established. The only thing that really kept the movie entertaining and sometimes amazing was Johnny Depp. He is absolutely astonishing with his voice and character mannerisms. He was absolutely incredible. I can not praise him enough. However most of the drug effects were exaggerated for comedic reasons and were sometimes unbelievable. Acting goofy doesn't make you high. I couldn't really find much of the humor funny due to an earlier comparison of the movie to requiem for a dream. I kept feeling bad for these people and the fact that they were never sober was scary. It was sad, and these feelings finally came to play in the scene with the waitress at the end. I couldn't really find the drug effects funny because these people are so messed up. People say I'm looking too into it; however this is a true story. Johnny Depp delivered most of the funny lines and they were due to his character not the drugs he was using. Without him the movie wouldn't be half as good.         5\/10 not three because of Johnny Depps amazing talent for characterization.

There was no plot, and the humor which isn't great begins to drag on after no real point is established. The only thing that really kept the movie entertaining and sometimes amazing was Johnny Depp. He is absolutely astonishing with his voice and character mannerisms. He was absolutely incredible. I can not praise him enough. However most of the drug effects were exaggerated for comedic reasons and were sometimes unbelievable. Acting goofy doesn't make you high. I couldn't really find much of the humor funny due to an earlier comparison of the movie to requiem for a dream. I kept feeling bad for these people and the fact that they were never sober was scary. It was sad, and these feelings finally came to play in the scene with the waitress at the end. I couldn't really find the drug effects funny because these people are so messed up. People say I'm looking too into it; however this is a true story. Johnny Depp delivered most of the funny lines and they were due to his character not the drugs he was using. Without him the movie wouldn't be half as good.         5\/10 not three because of Johnny Depps amazing talent for characterization.

This definitely complicates things for Toula on the way to a new life.  This movie has  big comedy, tender family moments and a great cast.  My personal favorites were Toula's father (Michael Constantine) and mother (Lainie Kazan), although the movie belongs to its star Nia Vardalos and her movie beau, John Corbett.  The ensemble cast and the ring of truth in the story make it work.  It's definitely one of the top 10 movies of 2002 and a refreshing change from much of Hollywood's recent fare.  It may not be an Academy Award Winner or an attempt to be 100% authentic, but it is a fun movie to add to your collection.  I'd rate it 89\/100.

The producers eventually convinced the original and greatest Bond, Sean Connery, to return one more time for 1971's Diamonds Are Forever (Connery would play Bond for the last time in 1984's Never Say Never Again, a thinly veiled remake of Thunderball, for another studio) before handing over the franchise to Roger Moore.That said, Diamonds Are Forever is definitely the weakest of the original Bond films starring Connery. Agent 007 hooks up with a ditzy smuggler (Jill St. John) as he links stolen diamonds to a plot by SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray) to build an orbiting space laser.Many Bond fans dismissed Lazenby and anything to do with OHMSS. Apparently, so did the makers of this movie. How much better this film would have been if it was about Bond getting personal revenge against Blofeld for what happened in OHMSS (those who have seen OHMSS know what I am referring to). Unfortunately, there is no reference at all to the events in the previous picture, and the plot follows the basic evil villain holds world ransom with super weapon formula instead. Connery's still the best Bond and knows how to make an entrance, but he looks noticeably older and less engaged than in his earlier efforts. OHMSS had a smart, classy, and capable Bond Girl in Diana Rigg's Tracy. Diamonds Are Forever has an annoying and bumbling Jill St. John as Tiffany Case and Lana Wood in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her walk-on as the aptly named Plenty O'Toole. Also appearing in the film are two agile female guards named Bambi and Thumper (I wonder what the folks at Disney thought?) and a pair of ambiguously gay assassins. Charles Gray is a strangely effeminate Blofeld (he even dresses in drag at one point) who lacks the bald head, as well as the diabolical menace, of Donald Pleasence or Telly Salvalas.Since the story is weak and formulaic, Diamonds Are Forever instead relies on the same campy jokes and pointless chase sequences that would later plague the Roger Moore era. It should also be noted that this was the last of the official Bond films that could feature SPECTRE due to complex copyright reasons, although an unnamed figure who was obviously supposed to be Blofeld appears in the opening of 1981's For Your Eyes Only.6 out of 10.

Overall grade 6\/10.  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 June 2003","score":"","review":"  A remake of the 1963 film The Nutty Professor. Although it hardly has anything in common with it except for the title and it is a scientist who transform himself into someone else but otherwise so unlike is a good comedy. Many scnes are hilarious especially those with the family. Eddie is perfect of all the roles of the family members. I loved him as the mother. It was just perfect. There are many laughs and overall a great comedy for laughs although it tries sometimes to be serious but fails in that territory and Jada Pinkett was not very good as Sherman love interest.
