That she's a woman is the least of her problems.  Her real obstacles are, in ascending order being a trifle too clear-headed, being honest, and being an atheist.  (Actually it's the last two together that damn her.)  And that's why the film is so good.  The plot requires a candidate with unfashionable beliefs and integrity, and the script has the guts to actually give her both.  The speeches in this film - all of them - were clearly written by people who took the time to try to understand what people who say such things believe, and why.This is not a simplistic film, whatever you may have been told.  Nor are the characters simplistic.  How does one tell if a character has been poorly developed?  Most people employ the completely unreliable black and white test measure a character's goodness; if it is higher than some arbitrary level, the character is too good; if it is lower than some other arbitrary level, the character is too evil.  This is a ridiculous way to think, even subconsciously.  There's no reason WHATEVER, in ANY kind of fiction, why a character shouldn't be very good or very bad, or why the entire fictional world shouldn't be populated by people who are one or the other.  The real test we should employ is this does the character's motivation make sense?  And the answer, in this film, is yes.  In every case yes.  -I've heard people say otherwise, but never convincingly.  I've heard it said (for instance) that we don't know why the president never asks Hanson to stand down, when in fact it's made perfectly clear to anyone paying attention he's stubborn, he wants her, and - this is the more subtle point - he half realises all along that he would demean himself by doing so.  Whether such considerations would weigh with actual presidents is beside the point, since it's perfectly believable that they'd weigh with HIM.The film makes but four mistakes worth remarking upon, only one or two of which matter.  The camerawork could be improved.  Lurie decided to go with the camera-following-the-characters documentary approach, which is never a good idea - but he drops this foolish affectation in all the important scenes, so we can forgive him.  And the president's speech at the end... in real life, I know, he would wrap himself even more in the flag and make even less sense, but we, the audience, ought to have been given something better.  Still, what matters is THAT he gave the speech, not what in particular he said in it.  So we can forgive THAT.  -Then there's this Hanson does finally confess to someone what really happened on the night in question.  No reason why she shouldn't; but WE should not have been told what happened.  The point of the film is that it doesn't matter; and if it doesn't matter, we needn't be told.  I, for one, wasn't even curious.As for the fourth mistake...Runyon's nefarious plan seems to go off without a hitch, and Lurie is savage on a political process that would allow this to happen, but two elements of that process escape close scrutiny the press, and the public.  (The latter, indeed, escapes all scrutiny.)  Runyon leaks his dirt to the press, who dutifully make hay of it, in order to morally outrage the public, who are dutifully outraged.  His plan would have failed had either press or public refused to cooperate.  How does the PUBLIC, in particular, escape blame?  In a democracy - even one with an electoral system as absurd as that of the United States - the electorate cannot deny responsibility for the way its representatives behave.  Why does nobody in the film criticise Joe Voter, or Joe Tabloid-Buyer?I confess to not minding THIS lapse very much (even though it's something I feel strongly about).  The film is generally so much more intelligent than you'd expect it to be.  Look, for instance, at the way Hanson's interrogation is structured.

I enjoyed The Return of the Living Dead and its sequel, but I found Re-Animator slightly dull at times and Scream to hardly be well...a scream.  Fright Night isn't so different.  It's never scary, and it's not nearly as funny as I had hoped it would be.  I suppose the end result is rather middling, it's neither truly bad or good.Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) notices something odd about his neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon).  One night, he spies on Dandridge and another man moving a coffin around.   Then, he notices a prostitute enter his house, and later the next day she's been found murdered.  Charlie begins to suspect Dandridge is a vampire, but can find no one, neither his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) nor odd friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) to believe him.Finally, he tries to enlist the help of horror movie star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), who initially thinks he's crazy but begins to believe when he notices that Dandridge doesn't cast a reflection.  Meanwhile, Amy is being seduced by Dandridge, much to Charlie's dismay.  It then becomes a matter of time before she will become a vampire and he and Vincent try to reach her and kill Dandridge before the transformation can complete.Fright Night isn't really that much of a waste of time.  There are far, far worse vampire films out there and the fact that this one doesn't take itself seriously doesn't hurt matters.  However, I expected a lot more laughs than what I got.  As a matter of fact, I remember laughing hard twice, chuckling a couple of times, and a smiling a few other times, but that's about it.  I did love the scene with Ed inside Charlie's mother's bed, since it broke every horror cliche in the book, yet I can't help wonder why more jokes weren't added into the film.  It doesn't help matters that the movie isn't particularly scary, not that it aims to be but it would help.  The film suffers from far too many slow moments, mostly from extended 80's dance scenes that are unbearable, as well as a cheesy 80's soundtrack that's a pain to listen to.  There's even a death scene that feels like it's going on forever. Eventually, the movie does get reasonably exciting in the last 20 or so minutes but that feels a little late, especially for a movie that's a 105 minutes long. There's no real suspense present, either.  Let's face it, the final outcome is never in doubt, despite an attempt at an ambiguous final scene.

It's never scary, and it's not nearly as funny as I had hoped it would be.  I suppose the end result is rather middling, it's neither truly bad or good.Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) notices something odd about his neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon).

Meanwhile, Amy is being seduced by Dandridge, much to Charlie's dismay.

There are far, far worse vampire films out there and the fact that this one doesn't take itself seriously doesn't hurt matters.  However, I expected a lot more laughs than what I got.  As a matter of fact, I remember laughing hard twice, chuckling a couple of times, and a smiling a few other times, but that's about it.  I did love the scene with Ed inside Charlie's mother's bed, since it broke every horror cliche in the book, yet I can't help wonder why more jokes weren't added into the film.  It doesn't help matters that the movie isn't particularly scary, not that it aims to be but it would help.  The film suffers from far too many slow moments, mostly from extended 80's dance scenes that are unbearable, as well as a cheesy 80's soundtrack that's a pain to listen to.

The irony of the situation was probably a coup for the producers of the film.Another statement Travolta proclaims is that Hollywood films lack realism.  This is one film that follows that to the hilt. Its a film to be enjoyed, but in the same sense it tries too hard to be all things to be all men.

But with sexy sultress Halle Berry by Travolta's side pulling Hugh Jackman's cords - you soon realise that plot is going to be secondary to the slick direction and matrix inspired action sequences\/camera shots.However, the inspiration of the Matrix runs throughout the film.  Hugh can see the code (or be it with a little inspiration of a blonde girl's head in his lap and Vinnie Jones pointing a gun to his head), Travolta proclaiming mis-direction in the world, and how it can be used, or abused and action sequences using bullet-time.The sub-plot of US State sponsored terrorism, and that at some point the US may go to extreme lengths to keep America safe sends shivers down my spine.But there are bad parts to the film.
