The movie Rocky is about a down and out boxer in Philadelphia that gets a shot at the heavyweight boxing championship of the world and goes the distance with the Champ Appollo Creed, who no one ever went the distance with. At the same time it has a romance story between Rocky and his friends sister Adreinne.The movie Rocky was the first to display the formula that many other movies followed to success. It used stark realism and a not so Hollywood result of losing the final fight, combined with the irony of Rocky wining his first fight a being considered a bum, topped off with inspirational music to bring the audience a realistic feeling of triumph of the human spirit. The movie is more successful than the many movies that followed it including all of the 5 Rocky sequels. Why? Well many have wondered about that. I have often thought about writing a fight club for women. I came up with a movie and guess what, it is really a rehashing of part of this story, revolving around someone like Adriene. The super success and critical accaim of this masterpiece lies in the fact that we have a movie of two characters being transformed by love, Rocky and Adrienne. This transformation is choreographed to great music. Stallone was a down and out actor pitching a movie about a wrestler called Paradise Alley, which no one wanted to make, when he as a second thought, pitched this movie to Hollywood execs. Stallone had not been remembered for his role in the Lords of Flatbush and he did not have much of a reputation at all.He broke through with Rocky because it had tremendous supporting performances from Talia Shire, and Burt Young, not to mention Burgess Meredith, who I always thought of as the Penquin from the Batman TV Show, until I saw his great performance in this movie. He also got a tremendous effort from Bill Conti who wrote the music. I read Stallone's original script, and I believe, the Director Mr. Alvidsen also did a great job editing the movie to the music. He also cut a lot of less meaningful scenes out of the end of the movie, to enable the music to overwhelm the audience in the end. (If you listen to the movie, the music is almost non-existent in the beginning and the music is more complex orchestrated and in every scene by the end) Talia Shire played Adrian the shy sister of Pauley, Rocky's best friend. As such, she had to show us she was shy, which is very hard to do on screen. She shows through fleeting glances at Rocky that Adrian has an interest in Rocky that she can not bring herself to show outwardly. She also brings out an underlying intensity when arguing with her brother, showing that when shy little Adrian is passionate, she can really gets her point across.After the big fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Adrian also charges through thousands of people when Rocky calls her at the end of the movie, which in miniature, became the formula for romantic comedies after this movie. Two people separated by obstacles come closer and closer until they finally get past all of the obstacles and get together.The music of Rocky was awesome and inspirational. I especially liked the song Going The Distance, which played during the big ending fight from Round 3 to round 14, when Rocky is taking the beating and hanging in. It is the most inspirational song in the Rocky movies. I also liked the song You Take My Heart Away, which plays during the romantic scene when Rocky takes Adrian's hat and glasses off of her and reveals the real Adrian for the beauty she is. In all a very ground breaking movie and rightfully it has been copied numerous times but never equaled.

The blood-black humor is still as biting and sharp as ever, and the best lines still induce morbid laughter (I love my dead gay son is a personal favorite). And a top-notch cast of 80's actors who really deserved to end up doing more with their careers (except the ones who actually DID do more, most of whom should have stopped right here) carried this material with such grace, the film really hasn't aged at all.There is a timeless feel to Heathers, and it's something that definitely struck me watching this film today. Here's the confession I am writing this review after watching Heathers for the first time. Of course, I had heard about this film for years, but somehow it stayed out of my DVD library until just recently. After finally taking in this much lauded classic, I'm sorry I waited so long.But, perhaps approaching this film with today's eyes lends a useful gauge of its true effectiveness. After all, I watched the film simply to watch it, and I had no historical or sentimental ties to it to cloud my judgment of exactly how much I enjoyed it. The fact that Heathers is so great, despite the fact that it came out of an era during which high school films were made in a very specific mode, thus have mostly aged very poorly, speaks volumes about its quality.Let me explain... Picture teen films made in the 90's during that dark period where pagers, not cell phones, were the apex of communications. Of course, all the hip kids at the time would have a pager, so naturally, references to this ultra-modern form of technology would enter into the plot, or at least the peripheral. Someone watching a film from this period today would immediately notice this antiquated device, and the film would then date itself. Heathers has no such attachments to its era, and in fact, it looks very little like any high school film made in the 80's (or ever, actually). The use of almost no music in the film adds to this mystique, and since there's no Simple Minds song guiding the action, we can't quite place the Heathers' link to popular culture there. Ditto with the fashion, which, aside from some pretty intense hair-dos, doesn't place our characters into any historical context. The teens in this film don't strut around in legwarmers or Member's Only jackets, and even if they did, this would have an ironic coolness about it in today's retro culture.I only point this out to demonstrate that Heathers seemed to have much more on its mind than entertaining teens for a couple of hours. It takes significant forethought to omit anything that places significance on the time and place the story unfolds and focus all of the elements on the darkly delightful story instead. Heathers wouldn't work nearly as well, or apply so encompassingly, if it tied itself to a singular post of time. One of the reasons the film holds up so well today is that it looks like it could have very well been made today. This fact makes the rumors I've heard of a remake in the works one of the worst ideas of all time... and that's really saying a lot considering how many classic films have been tainted by a wretched modern make-over\/cash-in (oh, that's right... we're supposed to call them re-imaginings).You can easily find the plot and any other pertinent information on the very listing you browsed to come to this review, and certainly Heathers is a film that has been discussed so much that I won't be able to add any significant perspective to it. Rest assured, I won't try.I'm only here to say that I finally watched Heathers, and found it deserving off all the hype that I've encountered in the decades this film has existed. The satire is cutting and brilliant and the themes are universal, and will remain universal as long as there are millions of insecure teenagers on this planet vying for the ever-present enigma of acceptance. Hell, most adults are still searching for that themselves, which would sort of make Heathers a film that grows up with you.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 June 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Trouble is, not a lot really does, in between the absolutely superb set-pieces that distinguish this piece and compensate for its gradually faltering script.. The opening sequences have a classical brilliance. A lame girl is strangled in a Massachusetts village-hotel one thundery afternoon. Seized from behind she does not struggle with her attacker - identified to us only as a Glaring Eye - but is posed strikingly with convulsed hands above her head like a kind of religious sacrifice. Downstairs in the lobby an early form of motion-picture show is also reaching a tragic end. Among the rapt audience sits Helen (Dorothy McGuire) for whom this world that cannot speak has direct relevance. As a child she had witnessed the deaths of her parents in a fire and has been mute from shock ever since. Which puts her high on the hit-list of the Glaring Eye who's already accounted for several young girls with imperfections. The self-important Constable (James Bell) warns her to get home before dark..She accepts a buggy-ride from the new young doctor (Kent Smith) who wants her to see a specialist and whose interest seems more than professional. When he's summoned on the road to a case she continues on alone through the tingly-tangly woods to the big old Warren mansion where she lives-in as a domestic. Armed with a piece of branch she runs it along the fence like a child whistling in the dark but fails to notice, as the storm breaks, a figure in oilskins watching her from behind a tree along the drive. As she fumbles for her key in the pelting rain it makes to intercept her but she reaches the front door unaware and unscathed. Inside the house, splendid with spacious vistas and shadowy byways, a sly old matriarch (Ethel Barrymore) dominates the scene, ostensibly bedridden but with a revolver under her pillow. Just as well as Glaring Eye's on the premises, scrutinising Helen from the landing as she studies her reflection in the full-length mirror. Her breath on the glass makes her mouth disappear... Things start spiralling down once we meet the Warren children - playboy son Stephen (Gordon Oliver) and his half-brother Albert (George Brent), a stuffy Professor whose beautiful secretary Blanche (Rhonda Fleming with her old nose) is conducting an uneasy affair with his despised sibling. While this dull trio go through the motions (to increasingly uninspired dialogue) Mrs. Warren keeps warning Helen to quit the house, the tippling cook (Elsa Lanchester) gets drunk and all's set in motion rather too obviously to leave Helen alone with the killer.

","genre":"Film-Noir, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"29 June 2009","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" La Cérémonie is a strange film and difficult to pigeon-hole. The film is directed by the great Claude Chabrol and based on the novel 'A Judgement in Stone' by Ruth Rendell. The location for the film has been moved from the UK to Chabrol's native France, and most of the film takes place in a small, isolated village. The film is a rather slow burning drama, but the interest is kept up by the intriguing characters and social study. The story itself really allows the director to do what he does best; as it provides a handful of intriguing characters that are able to manipulate their situation into a thrilling climax. The film focuses on the well-off Lelievre family. They hire Sophie as a maid. She's a strange and quiet woman, and is harbouring a dark secret; her illiteracy. While out in the village one day, she meets Jeanne; a post office worker jealous of anyone who is of a higher social standing than herself, and the two strikes up a friendship that eventually has a tragic result.The setting that Chabrol has chosen for the film really benefits the story as the isolation allows the director to focus purely on the characters. Sandrine Bonnaire is suitably strange in the lead role and while we are never allowed to learn a great deal about her character; the actress plays a very good part. Isabelle Huppert co-stars and really steals the show with her anarchistic character that provides a catalyst to all the mayhem. The film is very much of the slow burning variety but it's interesting throughout and we do get a good payoff at the end. The film has a point, although it does have to be said that it can become a little muddled at times. Chabrol does do a good job of showing the characters for who they are and getting the audience on the side of the right characters to allow a strong ending. It has often been said that this film isn't among the director's best work, and when a director has previously directed films such as The Breach, This Man Must Die and Wedding in Blood; it would be rather difficult for anything to break into that pack. La Cérémonie is a very good film, however, and certainly is recommended to Chabrol fans.

You'd be hard pressed to find two names that lit up a marquis together like these two back in their day and its exactly what makes a film like Butch Cassidy go from good to timeless.No, the film wouldn't be nothing without them, but it's their over-masculine insults trying to mask their deep care for one another that makes them both funny and endearing, as does their care-free attitude about theft. Hill reflects all of this in his film and it makes it that much better.The movie follows its titular outlaws in the twilight of their infamous careers. Their reputation precedes them and their age, particularly Butch's, catches up with them. Throughout the film is a sense that times are changing and that they won't be able to keep robbing banks and trains forever, an appropriate and meaningful foreshadow that affects the film. Things stay good for part of the film, but eventually someone is on their trail and they're just as crafty. Butch and Sundance go on the run, unable to shake them off the trail.Newman brings his usual swagger to the role of Butch. He's clearly aging, but his idealism and vision for finding the next big job never fades, even when it gets him into trouble. Newman carries the perfect sense of humor and is never afraid to make Butch seem vulnerable, as legendary as he is. Redford is the skilled, more easily angered of the two, always keeping his logic handy. He's always quick to insult Butch but always quick to defend him. The unspoken bond between these two is strong and excellent.The cinematography in this film is top notch, especially in the beginning. Conrad L. Hall gives these men the mystique, makes each scene feel like a tall tale or a legend. It's really quite beautiful and the changes from sepia to living color sell this mood even more. Even more than the images, the choice of scoring this film is the most interesting and daring choice of all. Burt Bacharach provides an old saloon theme, a more positive tune as his only scoring and then writes the classic tune Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head to accompany a care-free montage. The music echoes not the danger and peril as would a typical Western score, but the joy and timelessness of the story. It seems strange at first, but it's the right choice given the film's themes.No one forgets a great on-screen tandem and that is Newman and Redford. There's an undeniable chemistry between them though they are both strong enough to star on their own.

Chuck Russell's 1988 version of The Blob was a hugely entertaining romp from a director who clearly loved the genre; John Carpenter's The Thing oozed with atmosphere and pushed make-up FX to a new level; but it was David Cronenberg's re-imagining of The Fly which really proved that a skilled director blessed with a unique vision could turn a remake into a masterpiece.Cronenberg keeps the basic plot from the Vincent Price classic&#x97;a scientist experimenting with teleportation becomes horribly disfigured after his body is accidentally merged with that of a housefly&#x97;but discards the silly notion of a man sporting a massive fly head and arm. Instead, the director once again indulges his obsession with 'the flesh', and has his protagonist suffer a much more gradual fate in the days following his seemingly successful experiment, genius Seth Brundle (a wonderfully eccentric Jeff Goldblum) gradually transforms into a monstrous creature as his body struggles to fuse his own DNA with that of the fly.In addition to losing his looks, bits of his body, his ability to digest, and eventually his mind, Brundle also has to cope with the possibility of losing girlfriend Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who is pregnant with his child. When madness finally takes control of Seth, and his transformation into 'Brundlefly' is almost complete, the scientist abducts Veronica as she attempts to abort her pregnancy, takes her home to his lab, and pushes her into one of his teleportation pods, his intention being to merge himself with Veronica and their unborn child, thus creating the ultimate family.A superb central performance from Goldblum, whose quirky, individualistic acting style is perfect for such an unusual role, is perfectly complemented by the equally unique Davis, and solid support is given from John Getz as Veronica's loathsome ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans. The film also benefits immensely from stunning creature and gore effects courtesy of make-up artist Chris Walas (who created the memorable creatures from Gremlins); these ensure that The Fly is as nauseating as it is heart-breakingly tragic. Amongst the revolting sights on offer are a very painful looking broken arm inflicted by Seth during a show of strength in a bar, a quivering inside-out baboon (one of Seth's earlier mistakes), and the Brundlefly vomiting corrosive liquid onto Stathis' hand and foot.If I was going to nitpick, I might argue that baboons seem like an unnecessarily dangerous test animal for Brundle to work with (but then again, maybe they had a special on baboons at the pet store) and the scientist's uncanny ability to program a computer to recognise the poetry of flesh (as he puts it) comes a little too easy, but these are minor niggles and do very little to spoil the film as a whole.With Hollywood currently showing no sign of slowing down the remake production line, perhaps those responsible should take a look at The Fly to remind themselves how the job should be done properly.

This original film is so superior to the crumby 2008 remake, that there is simply no comparison at all. Michael Rennie is superb as the extraterrestrial Klaatu. Patricia Neal is wonderful as the gal, and Hugh Marlowe is just as irritating as he is meant to be as the bothersome boy friend of Neal who is only interested in himself. Gort the frightening giant robot is superb, the best of all, and that was the only thing that worked in the remake, because they kept him with his visor eye slit that emits beams that kill (a bit like Cameron Diaz). The next time I want to intimidate someone I don't like, I am going to get my very own visor eye slit fitted. Must practice on the light beams, though. Well, this film is a bit preachy, but then it was the early 1950s when that sort of thing was expected of any film trying to be serious. Klaatu absolutely refuses to deal with the representatives of a single nation or even a selection of nations. For him it is the United Nations or nothing. Great globalist propaganda. The question as to why he landed on the White House lawn rather than in New York City in front of the United Nations building is swept aside. The film has plenty of pathetic soldiers with guns. It certainly is a standard motif of sci fi films coming out of America that you have to have panicky soldiers resolutely clutching their useless rifles, shooting the spacemen, revving up their tanks (before they get vaporized), the whole Pentagon thing. You simply cannot have an American sci fi film without nervous soldiers fingering their triggers, it just wouldn't be convincing, would it? The whole 'war on terror' might even be called into question, just think. This film is seriously intended, has a certain degree of profundity to it, albeit with great dollops of one-worldism thrown into the soup, to make it set. If you can wade through the messages and brush the forest of guns to one side, you have a really good story there, and it works on screen, justly being described as one of the classic sci fi movies of yesteryear. But what is wrong with now? Why can't they ever get remakes right anymore? In the old days, you could remake the 1937 'Glass Key' by Dash Hammett and even improve on it a lot only a few years later.

Thankfully, the BBC were able to refresh my memory on Saturday night and therefore, I was able to watch this again with my Better Half. And you know what - it still is a gripping and classy action conspiracy film that surprises as often as it entertains, assuming you can stand Tony Scott's never-stand-still direction.Will Smith plays hot-shot attorney Robert Dean, chasing mobster Pintero (Tom Sizemore) and unaware of the politically motivated murder of a congressman, instigated by shady politician Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight). But after a video of the murder is discovered, Reynolds sends his NSA guys after the tape which finds itself in Dean's unknowing possession. Soon, Dean's life falls apart and he finds himself chased by government agents wherever he goes. But as he desperately tries to discover why this is happening to him, his only hope lies with a shadowy individual known as Brill (Gene Hackman)...The first thing that surprises you is that despite the director of Top Gun at the helm, this is a brilliantly written and thought-provoking thriller that doesn't patronise you with techno-jargon. The second thing that surprises you is the quality and depth of the acting - stars like Jack Black, Seth Green and Scott Caan pop up in the casting but all actors deserve praise as everyone is convincing. But the most surprising thing is how under-rated this film is. This film grips like a pair of Michelins and offers something more than your usual Jerry Bruckheimer helping of explosions and cool styling yet nobody seems to be talking about this like they should. There is a slight sense that this sort of stuff is out-dated these days as technology continues its relentless advance and the numerous gaffes about map coordinates and the accuracy of spy satellites may damage this films credibility somewhat but by and large, this is a quality film.Maybe I'm being harsh on Tony Scott - I'm a huge fan of his brother Ridley, though - because this film would be a fine addition to any directors CV. Enemy Of The State remains a class above most action thrillers, feeling more like The Fugitive than The Running Man which can only be a good thing. It's also good to see a modern film with Gene Hackman in, before his self-imposed retirement and we can only hope he changes his mind soon because he is a genuine Hollywood icon. In the meantime, enjoy a movie that thrills and excites but also makes you think in equal measures.

He lives a life of denial in a sort of cocoon that protects him from reality. Colin Firth plays Adrian LeDuc in a performance of such perfection that the character becomes as real as someone I've known for a long time. When reality becomes too overwhelming to ignore - financial difficulties in this case - Adrian sees himself forced to open, somehow, his hermetic universe and invite a stranger into his house. A paying guest. It is hilarious to see him interviewing his potential tenants because he knows he will never ever be able to share his space with another human being. That's why the entrance of Jack, a magnetic and unexpected Hart Bochner, is so brilliant. The scene is constructed like a movie within the movie and movies are, perhaps, the only thing Adrian trusts and understands. The moment is one my favorite film sequences of all time. For a moment we step out of the reality of the moment and step into Adrian's mind. He sees what he wants to see in the way he wants to see it and the music builds and for a split second, we're him. We understand his need much more clearly than he does. Colin Firth doesn't play his character for sympathy, Adrian is a character difficult to like but we end up loving him because his longing is the most basic of all human longings love, affection, companionship. Not once that fact is stated in the film and yet is there permeating every intention. This became crystal clear as I watched the film last night, for the first time in many years, there is an enormously human element that protects Adrian for being what he appears. He is a victim of some emotional disaster. We don't know what but it's there. If you look into Colin's eyes as he attempts a smile, you can see the child hoping to be rescued. It seems I'll keep finding new things in this 20 year old independent movie. I don't know why, it's a mystery and I for one, love mysteries.

Maybe I was setting my expectations a little high, especially having seen Misery, which wasn't made till after this. Director Phillip Noyce is no puppet master, failing to pull on the strings of the audience which make us jump like all good thrillers do. After the death of their son, Rae and John Ingram take a sailing trip to calm their nerves. One day they rescues a young artist named Hughie Warriner, from a wrecked schooner. He claims that the crew is dead and the ship is sinking. When John goes on board to investigate he discovers that no only is the crew dead but they were murdered. Leaving him to go down with the ship, Hughie then takes off in The Ingram's boat with Rae. How is she gonna get back to her husband across miles of open water?Dead Calm is another case of good premise with mediocre execution. The problem is quite simple, there is not enough tension. Despite being in the middle of the ocean with a killer, it never feels like Rae is in dire trouble. Part of it has to do with the character of Hughie who is too far from menacing to provoke fear. Billy Zane, in his first decent sized role, does not really know what he is doing. He plays the role too quirky with no sense of menace. Nichole Kidman isn't very convincing either, and doesn't show the slightest bit of fearful emotion in her role. Quite frequently, she even delivers her lines as if nothing is happening. (there is a killer on board for crying out loud!)The only part of the movie which generates some tension are the scenes with John on board the sinking schooner. fighting to survive as the water level is rising, poses much more of a threat, in my opinion. One of Dead Calm better qualities is its music, creative and abstract. the film is nicely photographed too. I think we take the spectacle of sea pictures for granted, It is hard enough to set up a camera on a rocking boat let alone set it up and get a good shot.In the end Dead Calm is not a bad film, but it's kind of dull and it didn't scare me, and if you've already seen Misery, I doubt it will scare you too.

Maybe I was setting my expectations a little high, especially having seen Misery, which wasn't made till after this. Director Phillip Noyce is no puppet master, failing to pull on the strings of the audience which make us jump like all good thrillers do. After the death of their son, Rae and John Ingram take a sailing trip to calm their nerves. One day they rescues a young artist named Hughie Warriner, from a wrecked schooner. He claims that the crew is dead and the ship is sinking. When John goes on board to investigate he discovers that no only is the crew dead but they were murdered. Leaving him to go down with the ship, Hughie then takes off in The Ingram's boat with Rae. How is she gonna get back to her husband across miles of open water?Dead Calm is another case of good premise with mediocre execution. The problem is quite simple, there is not enough tension.

The performances are all fantastic - some more than others. Edward Woodward gives an exceptional performance as devout Christian copper Sgt. Howie, he plays the role with a sort of innocence and likability, and is the character most of the audience are likely to relate to. He really shines throughout the film. Britt Ekland is also very well cast - although her experience making the film wasn't the best and she seems to regard the film very lowly, she still takes the character of Willow, the landlords daughter, on very well. She seems to represent the whole Pagan aspect of the film. Ingrid Pitt and Diane Cilento are welcome additions to the cast, but do not receive a lot of screen time and aren't overly crucial to the film. Christopher Lee remarks this as the best film he's starred in, and I would agree with him. He's terribly underused in the movie but the scenes he does feature in are some of the best. The music is very fitting and when I saw this the first time, was what really scared me. A lot of the songs tend to be mocking Howie and enhance the idea that everyone on the island of Summerisle is against him. Christopher Lee's duet with Diane Cilento of The Tinker of Rye, really stands out to me. The music is very powerful as it really lures the viewer into a false sense of security. The locations are stunning, and if made a point of visiting the ones I've not seen some point this summer. I'd say this movie really has to be seen with the deleted scenes intact, because the theatrical version leaves huge gaps to the story and cuts out a lot of brilliant dialogue between Woodward and Lee, and some further examples of the pagan practices in Summerisle. The Wicker Man is a prime example that, anyone can make a film on a small budget and it can still stand up against big budget rubbish that studios spout out, such as Neil laBute's horrific remake. I'm hoping Hardy's newest project Cowboys for Christ manages to keep this low budget, rural feel. Interesting that Don't Look Now & The Wicker Man were put into a B-Movie Double Bill and regarded as rubbish by the studios but now both stand out as two of the most chilling and powerful horror films ever.

Strait-laced teetotaler (and maiden sister of a preacher) Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) meets a kind of ordinary joe who is a handyman deluxe sort of guy, Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a bit crude and likes to swill his gin. They're in the middle of Africa during the Great War. Her brother has been killed, the Germans have the natives where they want them and, well, Charlie has an old river boat and offers to give the high-toned woman a ride.There is nothing quite like the sparks that fly from opposite poles. And yes, opposites do attract, but of course it takes them awhile to feel the magnetic force. The beautiful thing about this love story is how Charlie proves his mettle and wins her heart--a heart never won before--by sheer gumption and by finding the courage he never knew he had--egged on and inspired by her relentless strength of character. The moment that she realizes, despite all the differences between them, that she loves him is beautifully and exactingly captured by John Huston's superb direction.The second reason to see this cinematic masterwork is the performance by Katherine Hepburn. She has given many outstanding performances; there is hardly an actor anywhere held in higher esteem, nor one who has had a more lasting and admired career. I have seen many of her movies but never have I seen her better. She is just perfect for the part and delivers every line with style and a deep understanding of her character. She allows us to understand that Rose's crazy, naïve beliefs about what is possible infect Charlie to the extent that he becomes something more than himself, and it is that self that she falls madly in love with.The third reason is the inspired performance by Humphrey Bogart. This is not the usual worldly-wise, tough guy that Bogart usually plays. Instead he is an ordinary, though pragmatic joe who knows his limitations. He didn't last this long as a self-styled river boat captain without taking certain precautions in what he would venture and what he would not. Yet, so taken with the relative status and the exquisite high-toned righteousness of Miss Rose Sayer, he is able to do things that ordinarily he wouldn't try. And when she falls in love with him, he is amply rewarded, and the audience loves it.I should add that shots of the boat, the African Queen, and of the animals along the river and in the river seemed authentic and atmospherically perfect even though I've seen a couple hundred much more modern African nature videos.By the way, this movie contains the famous quote, spoken by Miss Hepburn Human nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put on this earth to rise above. One more thing to add the movie was adapted by C.S. Forester and James Agee from Forester's novel. Those are two of the best writers to ever work a Hollywood screenplay, and it shows. The dialogue and the development of character and story are exquisitely done so that one is lost in the events and only returns to the real world when the movie ends.Truly, they don't make them like this anymore.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Laforgue is accompanied on his journey by a party of Algonquin Indians as well as by Daniel, a young French interpreter who is primarily just up for the adventure.As the journey proceeds and the seasons move from fall into a harsh winter the mood of the film becomes ever more bleak. The continuing culture clashes between the Algonqins and Laforgue are sometimes humorous but are ultimately sad in their revealing insights into how difficult it is for one culture to understand another. One scene has Laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the Algonquin chief and then having Daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman. Laforgue is trying to show the Indians that he has much to teach them, but their interpretation of the incident is that he must be some sort of demon. When the party meets up with some members of another tribe and they see Laforgue dressed in his black robe and ask if he is intelligent, the Algonquin chief quickly answers, No. On the other hand Laforgue views the Indians in their current unenlightened state as savages.Not all is love and harmony between the various Indian tribes. When the Lafourgue party encounters a band of Iroquois there are some scenes of violence and torture where the squeamish may want to avert their eyes.Daniel, speaking the Algonquin language and having taken up with the chief's daughter, begins to have some understanding of the Indians and their ways.

His reaction to sexual temptation is confession of sin and self flogging.

As a long-time fan of Phil Silvers' fabulous series of the 1950s, I was skeptical about this movie, although I usually like Steve Martin's films--especially Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.I thought it was quite true to the spirit of the TV show. I was pleased that it was PG and not full of foul language and other things not fit for children. They didn't try to duplicate everything in the original, merely to present a similar group of characters, with the same names. The plot was not unlike one in the series, but was not a remake of any episode from the series.They had some lines that sounded like they could have come from the series. They had a way to signal brass coming so Bilko's men could quickly put away all their gambling devices and make the motor pool look like one--just as the series did, only more elaborate. Col. Hall in the film, just like on TV, acknowledged that Bilko knew more about what was going on, and, in effect, ran the post.Other reviewers have detailed the plot. One highlight for me was the clever way Bilko arranged for his adversary to give himself away after ruining the test of the hover tank, not knowing the machine was not going to work in the first place. That was thinking like the Phil Silvers' version would have done.I agree that Silvers, and Nat Hiken, would be proud that their series was re-created as a feature film 40 years later. It wasn't the funniest movie ever, but it was surely no worse than a very funny film.

The script is quite touching and sometimes funny, and there is some nice music and cinematography. I was also moved by the ending, which was full of pathos and sadness. With her enchanting smile and fruity voice, Gwyneth Paltrow is very appealing as Helen. John Lynch is suitably dull, but melancholy as her cheating partner Gerry (who is constantly seen getting advice from his friend Russell), and John Hannah lights up the screen as James. I do have two problems with this movie. One is that Jeanne Tripplehorn doesn't quite convince as Gerry's ex-girlfriend, reduced to uttering rather predictable lines, and she is possibly underused too, again it could be to do with the structure of the story, which I found confusing when I first saw this film. The other flaw is that there is one scene that never rings true, the scene with Gerry's confession that he still loves her, and then soon after Helen finds in the parallel story she's pregnant. Overall, it is an enjoyable film, not the best movie ever made, but definitely worth watching. 8\/10 Bethany Cox.
