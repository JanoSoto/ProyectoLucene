[{"date":"18 April 2010","score":"","review":" Batman, Superman, and several other comic book icons had been coming to the big screen for years, but none of those movies really required the sheer ambition that was necessary to bring such a beloved and complicated, ensemble style book like X-Men to film. I don't think that X-Men was quite as good as the first Spider-Man or Batman movies, but it succeeded admirably in putting together the world and characters necessary for it's sequel, X2, to be such a great movie. I think that Bryan Singer and the producers made a lot of good decisions with this movie. Focusing the story on the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was smart, as were most of the casting decisions. The film adaptations of the various characters and their powers were not perfect, but they certainly could have been worse. The special effects were great for their time, too.For all those things that it does right, though, I still consider it to be only slightly above average. Maybe the reason that I don't love the move more, is because I've seen it so many times that it has little left to offer me. I don't ever remember thinking it was amazing though, even when it was new. X-Men is a decent comic book flick, but it pales in comparison to its much better sequel.

Joel Schumacher has inexplicably inverted the inspired direction Batman was taken by Burton, making it a homage to the 'joke' TV series from the 70's rather than a dark and brooding fantasy.Every set piece and character outside Wayne Manor is decorated with fluorescent pink\/yellow\/blue and has a cheapness akin to that of your neglected\/abandoned local Laser Quasar. The Batsuit has nipples. The Batmobile looks like a disco light machine with no aesthetic qualities or practical purpose. Batgirl is not hot, she's not clever, she's not welcome. Poison Ivy is not sexy, she's not clever, she's not welcome. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not Dr Freeze. Bane is not Bane. Batman is not Batman, ad infinitum...No, this is bad, really bad. Even after reading this review your expectations are NOT low enough, you will still be angry that this movie was ever made and that squillions of $$$ were thrown around for it's development and promotion.
