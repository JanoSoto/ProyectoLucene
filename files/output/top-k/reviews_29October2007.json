I suppose one can get engulfed in the film, in the sense of drama, but I guess I am getting old, and starting to think about films while I am watching them. It was inevitable from the beginning that something bad is going to happen. I suppose we are primed for this by everything shown early in this film, but I do not want to talk about the formal qualities of the film just yet. There is a sort of a time lapse release one gets with this film, at least I did, in that oh, this is the sense of freedom that is craved and one gets when one lives their life without thinking, and, this is the ultimate impetus, as I see it, in this film, which, I suppose, is mirrored in many aspects of American life. I hope it is undeniable that nobody does any thinking in this film, or has any sense of caution, not to say humility, except for the cousin who seems to understand in his bones that the best thing for Tina is to get put in jail, for the short term anyway, because even then her problems are only going to be postponed the way she chooses to live. And to her, it is such an imperative that it is not even a choice in the film what to do. She is so driven by her libidinal and psychological needs so that she can redeem her being in this society, that she is driven like an animal for that personal redemption. With severe blinders on. And, as it is shown in the film, this can only lead to destruction. With animals like those hick boys running around, and quite a few other predatory vectors of rural society, it is impossible, this film shows correctly, to go with the soul so to speak, and find your way and place in this society without thinking...Now it is probably impossible to find one's way through thinking also, it is such a labyrinth in America, so many pitfalls, but at least we can say that caution is necessary for self preservation, this film clearly shows, for people who are willing to think about it. Formally, I can only say that since everything was done perfectly well, even perfect, I can only disagree with the last few seconds of the film which introduces a short time lapse sequence. Was this film like a time lapse sequence? Does the director want to encourage the audience to see this film, finally, as a thoughtless roller coaster ride? I know she wanted to leave us with that cool feeling and exit on a high, but is that really the vision she wishes to perpetrate, or, as I understandingly admit, it is just a kind of an unconscious rejection of right discernment?! From Lana's point of view it was like a roller coaster ride, but why does K. Peirce wish us to consider the film from her point of view at its ending, and not Tina's after all the hard work has already been done? Anyway, no one will notice.

The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and skeletons.

Not only the movie was groundbreaking but its main character also became one of the all-time greatest horror icons. A nightmare on Elm Street isn't your typical slasher film; it's far more impressive and intelligent. The story is about a demon that kills teenagers in their sleep. The cinematography is so brilliantly done that the lines between the dream world and reality often get blurred. Near the end of the movie, it becomes a real puzzle to figure out whether what you see is a genuine event or part of a dream sequence.The bad guy in this movie is one of the most powerful demons from hell. His clothing however might suggest otherwise. He wears a stupid, brown hat and a red-and-black striped sweater. The most unique trademark of this horribly-burnt child molester is his glove with razor-sharp finger-knives. He will use them to slaughter his innocent victims who find themselves trapped in a mysterious world from which they cannot possibly seem to escape. In this world, the monster is all powerful like a god and he will set the rules in opposition whenever he feels like.This movie is certainly the darkest and most terrifying of them all. The first time we see Freddy Krueger in the flesh is truly one of the most spine-chilling moments in horror history! This creepy-looking creature is beautifully played by actor Robert Englund who's an American leading actor of Swedish descent and very famous for appearing in dozens of horror films. His greatest achievement will however always be his chilling portrayal of Freddy Krueger. The main part is played by actress Heather Langenkamp who stars as Nancy Thompson; the girl who decides to fight back rather than become another victim. Her performance is quite good as is John Saxon who plays her father. This is also the debut of Johnny Depp. Needless to say Wes Craven is the most important person for he came up with the idea and directed the movie as well.In short A nightmare on Elm Street is not only a horror classic, but also one of the finest horror movies ever made! It's an intelligent and very original yet gory thriller! If you ever wish to try out a horror movie - this is a great one to begin with!

Those he wishes to die are Robert Sedgewick, a rich student who has his(filthy rich bitch) girlfriend Julianne Moore completing his assignments for him, while also winning a prestigious scholarship thanks to her meddling that Buschemi rightfully deserved. Moore becomes a target, despite Buschemi's infatuation with her, when she plants a stolen artifact in his room framing him, telling other faculty about it's whereabouts leading to his expulsion from college. Christian Slater, Moore's sister, isn't on the hit-list until he threatens Buschemi's life and mummy. Has it's gory moments;okay little finale even if it's a bit obvious.The second tale, Cat from Hell, concerns a pharmaceutical chairman(William Hickey) whose haunted by a deadly cat behind the deaths of three people that lived under his roof. Hickey believes that he's haunted by the feline, and last on the list to die, because his very habitual, expensive, and successful drug was tested on nearly 5,000 cats. He hires nasty, but slick-suited assassin David Johansen to destroy the cat for a substantial fee. What seems like a rather easy assignment for the hit-man turns out to be far more difficult than Johansen could've ever imagined. Probably the least of the stories because of the rather silly(but, gruesome)finale which will induce gross chuckles.The third(..and, in my opinion, easily the best)of the tales is Lover's Vow)about a struggling artist, flat-broke and dumped by his agent, who sees a bartender murdered by a gargoyle in graphic fashion. James Remar vows to the gargoyle not to tell anyone what he saw happen in place for his life..ever. He meets, in the same night mind you, a beautiful drifter Rae Dawn Chong who enters his life changing it forever. But, Remar might make a decision he'll regret..and break a solemn vow he promised not to reveal..with the yearning to tell Chong a secret he's held during their ten years, two children and artistic success which might ruin everything. The gargoyle design and animatronic work is amazing. This one has some really effective gore sequences as well. Good story, told rather fast. Remar is quite good, I thought.Okay anthology, but I felt the third tale was really the only one that left a lasting impression. Stylish direction helps a little bit. Not near as good as the spooky series for which it's title derives from.

Those he wishes to die are Robert Sedgewick, a rich student who has his(filthy rich bitch) girlfriend Julianne Moore completing his assignments for him, while also winning a prestigious scholarship thanks to her meddling that Buschemi rightfully deserved. Moore becomes a target, despite Buschemi's infatuation with her, when she plants a stolen artifact in his room framing him, telling other faculty about it's whereabouts leading to his expulsion from college. Christian Slater, Moore's sister, isn't on the hit-list until he threatens Buschemi's life and mummy. Has it's gory moments;okay little finale even if it's a bit obvious.The second tale, Cat from Hell, concerns a pharmaceutical chairman(William Hickey) whose haunted by a deadly cat behind the deaths of three people that lived under his roof. Hickey believes that he's haunted by the feline, and last on the list to die, because his very habitual, expensive, and successful drug was tested on nearly 5,000 cats. He hires nasty, but slick-suited assassin David Johansen to destroy the cat for a substantial fee.

And it would not be proper to make a review of this without at least mentioning people like Ray Walston, John Heffernan, Dana Elcar, James Sloyan, Sally Kirkland, Avon Long, Arch Johnson, Leonard Barr***, Pauline Myers, Larry D.Mann, Joe Tornatore, John Quade, Ed Bakey, Arch Johnson, Jack Collins, Tom Spratley, Kenneth O'Brien, Ken Sansom, Ta-Tanisha, William Billy Benedict***, Patricia Bratcher, Chuck Morrell and Guy Way.In making the Heroes of our story the Grifters, themselves, the mark would have to be portrayed as a total scum bag of a person, a lowlife of the lowest order. If not, the fact that these guys cheat unsuspecting citizens of otherwise honestly earned money would throw a totally different light on things, There are no Robin Hoods out there! (See Also PAPER MOON (1973).NOTE * The character of Kid Twist (Harold Gould) is most likely patterned on famous real-life, big time Con Man of Chicago, Yellow Kid Weil.NOTE ** BUTCH CASSIDY veteran (as Flatnose Curry) Charles Diekop & Les Paul play a most amusing (as well as menacing) pair of Mutt & Jeff Bodyguards. (Hooker even calls them that once!) NOTE *** The Burlesque Comedian, Leonard was played by Leonard Barr, Dean Martin's real life Uncle. And as for that Roulette Dealer, it's William Billy Benedict, Whitey in THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL (1941) and played in so many other EAST BSIDE KIDS\/BOWERY BOYS films as Whitey, what else?

The set designs, particularly Wong's house have been nicely decorated. The background score is pleasant. Jackie Chan pretty much plays the same character as in most of his films but he's still fun to watch. Anita Mui deserves special mention as she provides the funniest moments and is a delight to watch (even though it felt slightly awkward to see her cast as Chan's mother).

Basically Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare books expert and dealer, and he is seen by rich book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who hires him to validate his newly purchased copy of The Ninth Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows by 17th century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three that exist. The book supposedly summons the Devil, and Balkan claims it is a forgery, he has hired Corso to find the other two copies, and find out if it is genuine or not. So as you'd expect, the film sees him travelling a lot, finding the two books, and spotting the differences between them and Balkan's copy, this is probably the only interesting bit in the film. I could hardly concentrate towards the end, and I can see what the critics mean by a disappointing hallucinatory climax, for example, Corso and Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) having sex on the grass in front of a burning building, I must have missed him going through the Ninth Gate. Also starring Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl, Barbara Jefford as Baroness Kessler, Jack Taylor as Victor Fargas, Tony Amoni as Liana's Bodyguard and James Russo as Bernie.

And while many critics and fans will leap at the opportunity to hail the film's genius (or even champion it as the greatest horror movie ever made), I can't say I've ever been particularly impressed with it--there are good things to be said about it, certainly (most notably Boris Karloff's absolutely tragic portrayal of the Monster), but nearly as many distractions and miscalculations. The most notable flaw (which also afflicts Universal's Dracula) is wandering too far afield of Mary Shelley's source novel, which took a more meditative dramatic approach to things (and free of extravagant setpieces like the lightning-storm birth); here, the screenplay is derived from a stage production, and it shows--a lot of the soap-opera styled dramatics over Henry Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) marriage to Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) seem present to make the material palatable to a wide audience, rather than capitalize on the tense dramatic moments of Shelley's text. Also distracting is the character of the Baron (Frederick Kerr), who plays Henry's father as an endlessly drunk, nattering wino thrown into an expensive suit (the film's syrupy epilogue is made that much worse by his participation). All that aside, Whale has an excellent visual eye, cribbing from the German expressionists ornate, dream-like sets (conveyed through eerie long shots) and images that can be quite profound (the dazed father carrying his drowned daughter past celebrating townsfolk) and tragic (the extreme long shot of the burning windmill). There is also much strength in the performances of Clive and Karloff, their respective roles chipping away at the dramatic density of the script and winding up closer to Shelley's insights on human nature--when Whale seamlessly cuts from the Monster's face to Henry's at the climax, it is quite clear that the greater evil isn't so clear-cut. Frankenstein is a film worth watching, but I don't think I am alone in favoring the Hammer versions, which made the human dramatics synchronous with the over-arching storyline, and took themselves seriously enough to eliminate clownish roles.

At no cost, does Paulie intend to let her friend off the hook when she decides the relationship has to end.She goes to such extremes in many unpleasant and awkward situations that the story becomes irritating even before the final choice is made.Summing up Artistically interesting but very flawed film dealing with a doomed relationship between two not very sensible young women.
