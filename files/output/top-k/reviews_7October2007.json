It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand, a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster, three literate and musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members, and best of all, Babe, a Hoy piglet, learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs Rex and Fly, to win the annual sheep herding competition. Clever animation, well done animatronic creature-doubles, and a menagerie of superbly trained farm animals makes the story of the little pig who could be more than just bacon for breakfast a film for the entire family. A simple story that underscores that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself is to be respected in the kingdom of all animals, Babe certainly brings to the screen through comedy and drama, lessons all ages can understand. As Babe grows bigger through the great job of fattening up by Mrs. Hoggit, he makes friends with a sheep who conveys much wisdom about the rules of farm life where Rex is the dominant working dog, and the sheep are considered ignorant. However, Farmer Hoggit and Babe share a special relationship that confounds his wife, the sheep dogs, and the sheep. Hoggit trains Babe how to herd sheep and he's a mighty smart and fast learner, ultimately changing the rules that dominated the pecking order of the barnyard - because that's the way it's always been with good manners and friendship.James Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggit gives an understated and superb performance as the patient farmer who is willing to give a young pig a chance. This is one of the most delightful family films which is perfect for seasonal get-togethers or just because its a nice change to see a film devoid of car chases, explosions, and four letter words, yet adult in its message as well.

Lawrence, private citizen, taking a spin on his motorcycle, a short ride from which he would not return. We move to the Funeral, and like all funerals of the famous who die in tragic circumstances,* there are a lot of Big Wigs present, not to pay respects, but rather just to be seen.We also are privy to a roving reporter, stopping all the high governmental folks, asking of their knowledge of the deceased former 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Though the audience was then unaware that Director David Lean's cinematic device to both introduce us to characters from Lawrence's past, who we will be seeing again, later in the film.Among those who we meet are General Allenby(Jack Hawkins), now a Lord and an American Newspaperman & Newsreel Maker, one Jackson Bentley(Arthur Kennedy)which should be most interesting.This Mr. Bentley character is the one responsible in the film version for making Lawrence known to the world. This was essentially true, but for some reason the true name of this Press Agent for Lawrence and the Brits.The true identity of this American Newspaper Man is Lowell Thomas (1892-1981). He had been very active as a Newspaper Writer, as a Radio Newsman and a bit of a film maker, for it was two of his newsreel specials that made 'Lawrence of Arabia' into a household word. A sort of documentary compilation WITH ALLENBY IN PALESTINE AND LAWRENCE IN ARABIA (1919)was released after the War, and it started Mr.Thomas on the road to fame and fortune. (Also a very long career in Film(FOX-MOVIETONE NEWSREEL), Network Radio News and Television right up to the 1970's.(I well remember his HIGH ADVENTURE WITH LOWELL THOMAS as a 7th Grader,1958-59).Now getting back to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA(1962).A multi-faceted character would certainly require a multi-level, extra long epic sort of a film to tell the story properly. Well, they sure did that thing! We were all treated to a 216 Minute Epic which had the good sense and decency to have an INTERMISSION inserted right in the middle! And it sure seemed that the hour plus of viewing an awful lot of Sand and Dessert sure must have worked on our minds as pop sales in the lobby seemed quite brisk, indeed! As for the casting of Lawrence, Sir David Lean went with a newcomer, young, good looking and promising as an actor in Peter O'Toole. The very blonde haired and very blue eyed Mr. O'Toole gave us a T.E. Lawrence who was a sort of genius, who was out of step with the rest of the World, though Lawrence would definitely hold that it was the World that was out of step.He was highly educated and possessed super knowledge of Middle East History, Arabian Peoples, Islamic Religion and Arabian Language. It was while he was on staff a British Army HQ in Cairo that the idea of sending him on the mission to find Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness) was formulated.The eventual formation of the Arab Milita, which too forces loyal to Feisel and added more and more tribal warriors as time went by was a far cry from stories we are used to. The brutality of the dessert warfare and the frightful methods employed are most vividly portrayed. And what immediately comes to mind is a scene of an attack on a Turkish Railroad Train and its aftermath. As the attackers are 'taking inventory' of the goods on the train, a man in a bloodied up suit walks by in a seeming trance, obviously in a state of shock.The brutal blood letting scenes seem a little much at times, but it is done purposefully and not just for the sake of gratuitous violence. This David Lean was masterful in weaving a tale with some distasteful elements and maintaining a very mature, grown-up view and attitude. All the way from the start to the very end, this attitude is constant. There is no false glorification of War, nor is there any message that one could interpret as being pacifist. War is just there, we have to put up with it as best we can.The same sober realistic attitude is maintained with the alleged homosexuality of T.E. Lawrence. There are several parts of the story that sort of hint at it, but it is not mentioned, nor does the Director avoid the issue. His scene with Lawrence's being picked up and fondled by the Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer) was brutal, shocking and went far enough to get the point across; and to explain the great change in Lawrence's personality.If made by some lesser Director today, the whole sequence would be far different and much more graphic. A modern movie maker would have to 'draw a picture' for the audience, for the old fashioned virtues of subtlety and implication are not in the arsenal of film weaponry of these guys.And we must make mention of the beautiful, powerful and most memorable original score from the London Phiharmonic Orchestra, which makes our sense of hearing a full partner of our enjoyment.The Verdict on Sir David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is ****1\/2 (four and a half stars.)

It also doesn't make the mistake of focusing on Las Vegas to the point of glamorizing it; the city remains the story's setting above all else.Nicolas Cage certainly deserved his Oscar for his role here, bringing out Ben's many qualities to their fullest. Shue is equally great in her role, showing Sera as someone whom we need to understand, even if we don't admire her.

James becomes fascinated with cars & car crashes, he then meets up with Helen who also has a thing for crashes & they start to have a sexual relationship. They meet up with a guy named Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who is the founder of a small group of people who stage car crashes for their own sexual fulfilment, they listen in on emergency service channels & turn up to car crash accident scenes & take photo's, they get turned on by watching video tapes of car crashes & get off on looking at pictures of people badly hurt in crashes...This Canadian British co-production was written, co-produced & directed by David Cronenberg & is a difficult film to analyse & at times is a difficult film to watch. The script was based on the book Crash by J.G. Ballard first published in 1973 & deals with people who have a fetish for car crashes, I have no idea whether there really are people out there who get turned on by such things but it wouldn't surprise me it there was, & in that respect it's quite a difficult film to relate too as I can't really put myself in any of the character's situations. Cronenberg is a meticulous filmmaker & he knows how to develop character's, how to write dialogue, how to shock & Crash is certainly an extremely well written film with brilliant characterisations. Crash is very much a character driven film rather than an events driven one, the character's dictate the on screen action rather than the other way round. There are some disturbing scenes but the film is never overly graphic or exploitative, people describing car crashes to each other as they have sex, getting turned on by someone else's injuries & voyeuristically looking at real life car crash accidents are strange notions & ideas to try & understand. While watching Crash last night the time flew by, in fact I couldn't believe how quick it went even though it's a relatively slow film so in that respect it certainly grabbed me & drew me in. I'm not to sure whether I enjoyed Crash or not which sounds odd I know but I just can't quite make up my mind whether I did or not & maybe I never will.Director Cronenberg is a top filmmaker & Crash has lots of style & is as artistic as a film about car crashes can be. There's a fair amount of sex both straight & gay plus a fair amount of nudity although it's not gratuitous, there's no blood or gore so forget about anyone having sex with dead bodies or open wounds. Crash was an extremely controversial film when it was released, here in the UK the national tabloids really laid into it & several councils up & down the country banned it although the notoriously strict BBFC passed the full uncut 'Unrated' version intact & is now freely available on DVD here in the UK uncut, personally I think it's the notion & ideas behind the film which are more shocking than what is actually seen on screen. Cronenberg's response to the controversy was brilliant & clever, he simply said 'there are two versions of Crash, one that exists on screen & one that exists in peoples heads' & that to me is the perfect answer because it's so true.With a decent sounding budget of about $10,000,000 Crash is well made, it's striking to look at & Cronenberg is just a great filmmaker & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Shot on location in Toronto in Canada. The film won the Jury Special Prize & the Golden Palm at that years Cannes Film Festival which apparently raised a few eyebrows. The acting is very good from a solid cast.Crash is a difficult film to analyse, sometimes a difficult film to watch but it's never less than fascinating & absorbing in a disturbing sort of way. I'm not sure I can recommend it as I'm not even sure I liked it myself, a real curiosity from Cronenberg. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2007","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Crash starts as film producer James Ballard (James Spader) is involved in a car crash in which he is badly injured, a man dies & his wife Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is also hurt. James becomes fascinated with cars & car crashes, he then meets up with Helen who also has a thing for crashes & they start to have a sexual relationship. They meet up with a guy named Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who is the founder of a small group of people who stage car crashes for their own sexual fulfilment, they listen in on emergency service channels & turn up to car crash accident scenes & take photo's, they get turned on by watching video tapes of car crashes & get off on looking at pictures of people badly hurt in crashes...This Canadian British co-production was written, co-produced & directed by David Cronenberg & is a difficult film to analyse & at times is a difficult film to watch. The script was based on the book Crash by J.G. Ballard first published in 1973 & deals with people who have a fetish for car crashes, I have no idea whether there really are people out there who get turned on by such things but it wouldn't surprise me it there was, & in that respect it's quite a difficult film to relate too as I can't really put myself in any of the character's situations. Cronenberg is a meticulous filmmaker & he knows how to develop character's, how to write dialogue, how to shock & Crash is certainly an extremely well written film with brilliant characterisations. Crash is very much a character driven film rather than an events driven one, the character's dictate the on screen action rather than the other way round.

He finds Wyke eager for him to take his wife...or does he? Then an elaborate (and plodding) game of cat and mouse begins.Why this is so acclaimed is beyond me. I'm not a young kid (I'm 45) and I usually find talky movies downright fascinating (Rope and My Dinner With Andre are two great examples) but I was bored silly by this. It moves WAY too slowly and I didn't find the characters or their dialogue even remotely interesting. Olivier constantly keeps digressing to the point where I just wanted to hit him. Caine just walks around looking confused. The twists at the end are good but by that point I was so bored I could have cared less. I actually dozed off for a few minutes! The acting does help. I've never been too impressed by Olivier as an actor--in the Shakespeare films and Wuthering Heights he seems unable to change expression. However he was good here. He chews the scenery and goes roaring through his role. But, as I said before, he's constantly going off the subject and getting into these little speeches that quickly got annoying. Caine is a wonderful actor but he looks a little out of his depth here. He was excellent at the end though. The production design is incredible--Wyke's mansion is just incredible. Still I found this slow and boring. This might have worked on stage but it certainly doesn't transfer to film. I can only give this a 4.
