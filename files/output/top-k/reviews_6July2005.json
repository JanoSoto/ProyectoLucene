Now, don't get me wrong... being the second greatest film ever is quite an honor, and any film lucky enough to receive it must be pretty damn good anyway.

Of course, we know he isn't guilty, but either way, he's sent to live out two life sentences at Shawshank, one of the toughest prisons in the world. Meanwhile, Red (Morgan Freeman, also in his finest performance) is denied parole again, after serving 20 years of a life sentence.It should be known to most of you that this movie is entirely based off of a 90 page short story by Stephen King called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, which was featured in one of his collections. The book is entirely made up of Red's passages, which means that in the movie he's going to become the narrator. Normally, this would become intrusive, but here, it shines.

Notably, only one person is credited at the opening -- you guessed it, Stanley Kubrick. The use of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is brilliant and really impressive -- one of the iconic moments in film history. No one will ever forget that sequence.Then comes the Dawn of Man. The apes were clearly mimes in costume. Still, Kubrick and his crew did an excellent job of somehow back- or front- projecting the African vistas into these scenes. The God-like intervention of the monolith in human evolution is the entire concept of the story, and I found it most effective in this opening sequence. The use of Ligeti's musique concrete is very effective here.Then comes the space travel to the orbiting station and the moon. This is a little slow, but the effects here were very beautifully done. I love the shot where you see the shuttle falling through the void of space toward the station. I don't believe these effects have ever been improved upon -- or ever will be.I must say, though, that I find it very irritating when filmmakers greatly overestimate the amount of technological advancement that will occur in the near future. It was obvious to anyone in 1968 that almost none of what is presented in this film was going to exist in 2001, much less in 2101. Massive orbiting space stations, huge moon bases, commercial space travel? Come on. Similarly, LA will not have 500-story skyscrapers and flying police vehicles in 2019 (Blade Runner), nor will we have cars driving on vertical highways in 2054 (Minority Report). These ridiculous predictions are even more irritating in the so-called hard science fiction movies like 2001, where Kubrick so obviously and pompously believed he was being scientifically accurate to the last detail.The character of Dr. Floyd (and his fellow scientists on the moon) is almost unbelievably dull and uninteresting (while seeming smug at the same time). Still, there is some real mystery and suspense as they investigate the monolith on the moon.Then we cut to the Discovery mission to Jupiter. The centrifuge is possibly the most remarkable set ever used in a film, and Kubrick filmed it remarkably. The background on the mission is conveyed in the most pedestrian way possible -- the astronauts listen to an interview they gave to the BBC.

Stanley Kubrick was the most talented film director to ever walk the face of the earth. It's an extremely bold statement, but I'll stand by it proudly. You see, I've never encountered a filmmaker with such a meticulous and keen vision as Mr. Kubrick's. He truly was a genius and every film he made was a shining example of his wondrous talent. Well, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is his very worst film in my opinion, not to mention his most pretentious. It's a very muddled, confusing, peculiar and most of all boring film, but it presents itself as if it's a masterpiece. Critics raved about it, but the Academy shunned it (a move of the wise in my opinion). Kubrick fans seemed to have split on it, and I'm here to say it's a damn shame this was this brilliant man's last film. 'Eyes Wide Shut' tries to awaken curiosity, be provocative and cause us to think long and hard, but it just ends up being an absolute train wreck. It isn't a bad film, but it is just so upsetting and disappointing since it came from Stanley Kubrick.The warped story follows a rich married couple living it up in a nice apartment in Manhattan. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) is a wealthy, young and handsome M.D. married to a slightly crazy nagging woman, Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman). They seem to be such a perfect couple and have a smart seven-year-old daughter, but they have extreme jealousy issues when it comes to their relationship. Alice is jealous of Bill being with other women, and so is Bill to a certain extent. Just before Christmas, the two get invited to a Christmas party held by Bill's boss, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). At the party both Bill and Alice find other people they may be attracted to and fight and argue about it later that night. At the party, Bill runs into an old friend of his who dropped out of medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), who is the piano player\/band leader at Ziegler's party. After the party, Bill and Alice have a huge marital fight while smoking marijuana, and in the middle Bill gets a call from the daughter of a patient who passed away. Bill makes a house call to see Marion (Marie Richardson), whose father has passed. After visiting her, he decides to not cut the night short and go out to see Nick Nightingale play at a local bar. The two meet up, and Bill becomes aware of a secret organization which Nick plays piano at, and wants to check it out. Nick lets the password slip and tells Bill the address. Bill checks it out, and it ends up being a secret ceremony people wear costumes and masks too, then have wild sex orgies with various hookers. Bill get's spotted by the leader of the organization and then is threatened not to tell anybody. The film takes a bizarre and hard-to-follow turn after that point, and frankly it looses my interest.'Eyes Wide Shut' isn't a success not due to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick provides astounding direction as always. His vision is vibrant with color and beauty, and that alone kept me going throughout the film's two hour and forty-minute runtime. The acting from the two leads isn't that great. Tom Cruise is absolutely dreadful in his role, and is anything but believable as a doctor. Nicole Kidman is nothing better then average, but her screen time is way more limited then you probably would anticipate. The supporting cast is good though, with strong performances from Sydney Pollack, Todd Field, Vinessa Shaw (as a beautiful prostitute Bill takes a liking to), Rade Serbedzija (as a costume shop owner), Leelee Sobieski (as the costume shop owner's daughter) and Broadway actor Alan Cumming as an eccentric and entertaining to watch hotel desk clerk. The writing in 'Eyes Wide Shut' drags repeatedly, and it's of a quality so low I'm absolutely shocked Stanley Kubrick wrote it! Although the film's cinematography as music score are incredible, it can't really make up for a drawn-out and tiring storyline. Supposedly it took Stanley Kubrick a long time to make this, and that definitely shows because of how jumbled and hard to follow the film is.In conclusion, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a film for Kubrick fans only. Others will roll their eyes and sigh through the drawn-out pretentious movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' is. Even though there is a lot of intriguing scenes buried within 'Eyes Wide Shut' they never really seem to redeem the constant dragging of the film. It seems as though there is two or three movies going on at one time in 'Eyes Wide Shut' because the film never really blends into together well. I'm going to cut 'Eyes Wide Shut' more credit then it could possibly deserve because it has the great Stanley Kubrick's name on it. Kubrick really does a fine job with the directing aspect of 'Eyes Wide Shut', but the film lacks almost everything else. 'Eyes Wide Shut' ended up being a disappointment of colossal proportions, and that's an absolute shame seeing as though it was our world's finest film director's last motion picture.

I have only one thing to say about this Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino Sonny Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to use all of his powers to fix his son, because he didn't want his mother to see him like this. This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now!

Just as Magnum Force was quite different in feel and plot to Dirty Harry and attempted a few new things,Sudden Impact is the same in relation to the third film The Enforcer which,whilst good fun,was really just a rehash.It's really a film of two parts. The first part is almost a parody of all the tried and tested Dirty Harry elements-Harry's controversial police work in one scene he threatens an aging mafia don at his daughter's wedding,only for the guy to have a heart attack!,his telling off by his superiors,his threats,his seeming invincibility he seems to dispose of more baddies in the first half of this film than in all the others put together,etc. The writers are astute enough to suggest that Harry is a bit out of place-someone calls him a 'dinosaur'. The action is almost constant.Around half way the film changes and becomes a much darker and more serious work. The pace becomes a lot slower and there is a moody,almost film noir feel. The Harry films always have taken place a great deal in darkness,but this one is especially notable in that respect. Clint Eastwood is well respected as a director these days but he was a fine director before,the use of shadows and darkness in this film is very effective,as is Sandra Locke's somewhat haunted look and presence in this film. A flashback scene of a rape is also very good,lots of quick cuts and nothing too graphic,but we get an idea of the horror. We are presented with Harry's most interesting opponent,a woman who is killing off those who raped her and her now paralysed sister. The 'romance' if it can be called that between the two is interesting and oddly touching,and it looks as if Harry's attitude to violence and justice is really going to be tested.Except it isn't. The climax piles on the violence and we are treated to one of Eastwood's finest 'resurrection' bits quite a few films of his have him almost killed and than coming back almost from the grave to take revenge. However,the expected confrontation between Eastwood and Sandra Locke's character doesn't occur and the film takes the easy way out. A shame.There seems to be more borrowing from other films in this one,for instance the carousel from Strangers on a Train,the avenging rape victim from Angel of Vengeance and lots of other films,even the end scene is reminiscent of Casablanca. It's also a touch disturbing how Eastwood always seemed to have Locke for a while his wife raped and\/or brutalized in his films think The Gauntlet,The Outlaw Josey Wales,Bronco Billy. Nonetheless,Sudden Impact is an intriguing if not entirely successful entry in the Dirty Harry series,and it's the one which gave the world go ahead,make my day.

I cannot think of another movie off the top of my head that can meet the same claim, but there are others, few and far between. What's so great about this film? Without getting into too much detail, it goes over the top - and succeeds. Batman (1989) did the same, as did Dr. Strangelove (1964). From the dramatic monologues and heroic score, The Right Stuff pays tribute to an equally dramatic and heroic period in our history.I must admit that this statement is of minimal scientific value - there is no formula that makes the early days of the space program heroic or whatever. It's simply the historical perception that seems to have attached itself over time to the era. Director Phil Kaufman used this notion to the fullest extent - it is apparent in the recurring and very catchy techno\/orchestral score, the cinematography, and the stellar personalities of the main characters (Gordo Cooper, John Glenn, and Chuck Yeager). While the most romantic aspects of the test pilots and astronauts, space flight, and the dangers they faced are indeed overdramaticized (in a bombastic way - even the masturb... the sperm collection scene is made into an inspirational sequence), the men still seem human. No GQ\/or boy-band good looks here; just mortal guys accomplishing incredible tasks.The Right Stuff does not falter in any respect, at least none that I can see. No scene drags out for too long, the dialogue is witty and interesting, and the editing is without error. It is a historical movie, of course, but The Right Stuff is filmed in such a unique manner that no other movie is similar to it, with the exception of From the Earth to the Moon (1998 TV). Some of the greatest movies have become dated, either through dead giveaways (hairstyles, special effects, soundtrack songs, etc) to the more subtle (editing, that old feel, etc). 2001 A Space Odyssey and Patton (1970) come to mind.

They were supposed to be brown. So, on the spot, he decided to switch to black and white. Brilliant. Some of the greatest decisions are made due to small mistakes.

Karloff had strong affection for the part and he was too appreciative for all the Monster had done to make him famous.Karloff was even against the changes made to the character in the Bride Of...('35) and the Son Of...('39);so it's very understandable that he'd never actually play the Monster after the 1939 film.Boris Karloff could see that the role would degrade to merely a sidekick for other Universal monsters such as The Wolf Man and later Count Dracula in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein(1948).As House Of Frankenstein begins,we discover that Karloff is Dr. Gustav Niemann who has long been imprisoned in the Neustadt Prison with a hunchbacked killer named Daniel played by J.Carrol Naish.Neimann is the epitome of a mad scientist(having once given a dog the brain of a man) with his ancient jail cell covered in chalk writings,drawings and mathematical equations while he speaks reverently of the late Baron Henry Frankenstein.Lightning strikes the old prison and destroys both the Dr.'s and Daniel's cells ...allowing them to escape together.After helping Professor Bruno Lampini(George Zucco) get his wagons unstuck from a rain drenched road,they murder him and his driver and take over the traveling show. Karloff carries in the traveling show the skeleton of Count Dracula(John Carradine)who he allows to return to life as long as the vampire does his bidding.This section of the film is an excellent way to start this Monster movie off with a bang!John Carradine makes a superb Dracula with gray hair,a gray moustache and a top hat turned slightly to the side.This Dracula seduces Anne Gwynne by allowing her to see the supernatural world that he's returned from.But she's his downfall because he kidnaps her which causes Niemann and Daniel to abandon him. Dracula dies from the sun's rays hitting him before he can get to his coffin. Carradine gives one of the absolute best interpretations ever of the Count...he's in too little of this film.Neimann travels to the village of Frankenstein now where Daniel meets a gypsy girl(Elena Verdugo)who's injured after being beaten by a male gypsy.Dr.Neimann and Daniel inspect the Castle Frankenstein's ruins,but as they search the duo come upon a ice cavern that holds the frozen bodies of Frankenstein's Monster(Glenn Strange) and the Wolf Man(Lon Chaney Jr.).They build 2 fires to set the frozen Monsters free because Neimann wants to get his hands on Henry Frankenstein's notes. Larry Talbot(Chaney)agrees to help Niemann in his search because the Mad Dr. has promised to build Talbot a brain that will relieve him of his werewolfism. The group returns to Niemann's old laboratory with Karloff's Niemann only interested in working on the Frankenstein Monster while the Mad Scientist lies to Talbot who continues to go through his nightly changes as he turns into the Wolf Man and kills.Niemann and Daniel go to Visaria and murder 2 men who helped to put the Dr. in Jail.Their brains are to actually go into the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man because Niemann wants them to suffer! Ultimately,he brings the Monster back to full strength while the gypsy girl(who has fallen in love with Talbot)is attacked by the Wolf Man(who kills Verdugo's gypsy)...but she kills the Wolf Man with a silver bullet.Both Die.Daniel is heartbroken and takes the girl's dead body back to Niemann to revive.However,the Dr. refuses.Karloff's Gustav Niemann is only interested in his own depraved wants.So Daniel attacks him and as the 2 fight,Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster bursts his bonds.The Monster attacks Daniel,throws him through a laboratory window to his death.The Visaria villagers storm Niemann's laboratory and chase the Monster(carrying Dr.Niemann) into some quicksand where both perish.
