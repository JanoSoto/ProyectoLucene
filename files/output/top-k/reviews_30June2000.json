Made for a meagre $75,000, technically, there is no major flaw.  For only his second attempt, the directing is not only competent but quite accomplished, note the crane shot as Gloria crosses the street, Davy's negatively shot dream or the boxing match - as well directed as 'Raging Bull' or 'Rocky'.Again, the same goes for the other areas of the movie.  Kubrick, who wrote, directed, edited, produced and photographed the movie, did a great job on all fronts.  The soft under or side lighting of whenever the movie reaches a sad or dangerous point was very noir for what essentially is a B-movie.This movie is a B-movie.  It's the kind of film that you turn on the TV to on a Sunday afternoon, and it seems to be proud of it.  Kubrick later said that he was ashamed of his first couple of attempts at feature-film directing.  That's too bad, he had a damn fine film on his hands.
