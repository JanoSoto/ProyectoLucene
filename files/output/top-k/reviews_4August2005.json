However it was not on it's release in 1968. In the present, Blade Runner is considered to be a science-fiction success. In 1982 when it was released, it was considered a failure. What do these films have in common with the 2001 movie AI Artificial Intelligence? These movies were misunderstood because they were too far ahead of their time. Stanley Kubrick was the director of 2001, as most know. When he started story boarding and organizing ideas for the film AI, he was in a familiar situation. He was going to attempt to make a revolutionary film with ideas and opinions people were not ready to accept. The director of the film was not Kubrick however, because he passed away. The project was given to another legendary film maker Steven Spielberg. Spielberg would eventually create a film that will in the future be considered on of his best.While watching AI, it is hard not to wonder at times what is going on. The movie makes the viewer think as the story is so complex and futuristic bringing up future controversial questions about if humans should play the role of God. There is very little time for the viewer to tap into his or her emotions, while watching the film and trying to understand. This film should be accepted as a warning cry to humanity and not a movie that desperately tries to grasp the viewer's emotions.Also, the visual effects in the movie are unbelievable. ILM really was revolutionary with the film's visuals. They are unlike anything that had been previously seen. There was a mixture of serious texture with that of an almost cartoon taste. It works though to create a movie that is visually an artistic achievement. The sets are very creative and unique too, and blend modern day objects with those of the future.In this movie this is wonderful acting. Human characters act human, and the stale acting of the Meca is perfect since they are artificial. The music by John Williams is also always a nice touch.While everything in the movie seemed perfect, the ending was a little long, and the blue fairy at the end was a little too unreal. Sometimes the story slowed down, but the characters were usually developed which is nice in a movie, especially when your characters are very different. The movie ended in Kubrick fashion giving the viewer at first a feeling of confusion, but once looked into, it makes sense what Spielberg was trying to achieve with this Kubrick idea.All in all, AI Intelligence is an artistic achievement in cinema history from story to visual effects. After the second viewing of the movie the story really came together and made a lot of sense. It may be a movie misunderstood now, but in the future it should and will be remembered as a masterpiece that was finished by one of the greatest directors in history (Spielberg) in memory of the genius and the unforgettable man who started it (Kubrick).

I know he already had a couple of great efforts under his hat by this point, but here he had to create his own version of the universe, no less, besides making his wry observations about humanity. This is 'The Universe as It REALLY is' according to Brooks (not just Earth, everything else, too). And, good heavens, he pulls it off. This makes other filmic 'fantasies' about the after-life (the '78 version of Heaven Can Wait comes to mind) look very simplistic and lazy by comparison.In Brooks' story, his character dies a few minutes after the film begins. He and the audience then find out what happens to us after death. In this version, instead of purgatory, there is a sort of pit-stop for our souls, where we review our lives in a court-like setting; a decision is then reached on whether we go back to live another life or 'go on.' I think each viewer interprets what 'going on' means based on their own beliefs. Myself, I didn't take that to mean going to heaven. The complicated structure of the universe as presented here would make that conclusion a bit too simple. I think it just means you go on to another higher level and continue learning. As stated bluntly in the film (by Rip Torn), the whole point of existence is to learn, to get smarter. It makes a whole lotta sense and I'm not sure even Brooks knew what he was tapping into with these profound observations. Eventually, a soul may reach a state of ultimate knowledge, or Nirvana - or whatever you want to call it.But, Brooks thought everything out before he committed it to film. As the story progresses, we learn more about how the universe works, mostly courtesy of Torn. Pretty much everything seems to be worked out, as if Brooks asked himself a ton of possible questions and then answered them. I did have a couple of questions in my mind after the movie was over, such as how are really bad people handled in such an inoffensive easygoing setting?

Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see Princess Mononoke I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.------- The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made Mononoke just because he was in his depressive I hate the world phase. All in all, the epic Princess Mononoke deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7\/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story.

Just watch Being there or The Graduate and you'll see what.Grade 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2005","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Medieval Japan.

When you think about it, that's what he makes. 'Gremlins' is the jewel in his crown, a wickedly funny horror\/comedy that still charms me every Christmas.Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is a nice young man with a loving family. His inventor father (Hoyt Axton) gets him a little creature called Gizmo (voice of Howie Mandel) that looks like a cross between a teddy bear and Yoda for Christmas. There are three rules to keep in mind when taking care of Gizmo 1. Keep him away from bright lights, they hurt him. 2. Don't get him wet, he'll multiply. And most importantly, never, ever feed him after midnight. As you can imagine, all three rules are broken, Gizmo spawns a bunch of nasty ugly Gremlins, and all hell breaks loose.The movie is very funny in it's mean-spirited way. My favorite scene is where the Gremlins, after wreaking havoc, go to a movie theater and watch 'Snow White'. They love it, and they start singing along to Heigh-Ho (to Billy's amazement). The payoff shot is Gremlin heads bobbing in tune to the song. That always gets a laugh out of me. The gremlin effects are good, and little Gizmo is like a less-annoying Furby. The script by Chris Columbus is dark and menacing without being an R-rated outing (although apparently the original script is even worse), and I wonder how Columbus ended up making 'Home Alone' and 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. No matter; 'Gremlins' is a high-energy B movie that spawned a hilarious sequel. It's one of my favorite movies.

The very first death scene is something gorehounds will love, I won't give it away though. The rest of the murders aren't as gory but either have a cool setting, cool lighting and lots of suspense.Also being a teen oriented film, this has to have quite the cast.

Whether for religious reasons, physical reasons or even for a bet, we all have attempted, and mostly failed, to sacrifice those things we need the most. It'd be interesting to know how many have attempted to sacrifice sexual activity for that time. In 2002's '40 Days and 40 Nights', Josh Hartnett's character tries just that. Crammed full of sexual reference and incredibly dumb moments, '40 Days and 40 Nights' is saved from the oblivion where it so obviously belongs by the pure fact that it is occasionally entertaining. Yes it never makes you fall off your seat in laughter, and the characters are incredibly shallow, but more often than not, you can't help but find yourself smiling.Matt Sullivan (Hartnett) is a mess. Never recovering from his last girlfriends rejection, he leaps from bed to bed only to find himself suffering psychological trauma and hallucinations. Deciding he needs to get his head sorted, Matt decides that it is time to give up sex. Thus for the 40 days and nights of Lent, he gives up all sexual activity. Including personal relief into the decision, Matt finds temptation constantly around the corner, not least from the fact that he has a new girlfriend in the shape of Erica (Shannyn Sossamon).Firstly, lets ponder the impossibilities involved with '40 Days and 40 Nights'. There's the fact that at one point he makes Erica orgasm using a flower, a fact that women will happily condemn at a moments notice (although most have probably tried after watching this film). There's also the fact that if a man goes from constant sex to no relief of any kind, that he's not going to have a say in the matter. The body will find a way to make him let off steam. The fact that for the entire time Matt lasts in the film, he never once experiences any sort of wet dream (as would happen in such a sudden 'cold turkey' situation), is just evidence of how little the creators thought this premise through.Away from practical impossibility, the film also suffers from the predictable fact that it is often incredibly crude. Whether it is a hot office worker spreading her legs on the photocopier or Matt's hallucinations of naked women, the film is never afraid to lower the tone beyond sensible parameters. At just over an hour and a half long, it is just one long smut joke, and it's doubtful 'Confessions of a window cleaner' had this many sexual references.All the characters are also incredibly shallow individuals. Obsessed with sex, every single girl offers herself to him in return for the possibility of winning money. At the same time, all of his friends, rather than supporting him, ridicule and humiliate him with an online betting syndicate. There's not an individual in the film that doesn't seem to be sex obsessed and superficial. This isn't real life, this is some sort of nightmarish fantasy.So where do we go from here? There's so many criticisms about the film, there surely can't be any saving grace? Well, against all better judgement, there is. You see, whilst the film is crude, flawed and dumb, it is also at times entertaining. We're not talking hilarious or anything, but it does sometimes make you smile and enjoy it. You watch the story unfold, you really don't care for any of the characters, and yet you just can't turn it off. The film hooks you in and subjects you to ninety minutes of torture. Yet once it's finished, you do find yourself happy and content by what you've seen. It's always annoying when something like this happens, but when the story is really this bad, you find yourself even more frustrated.Rude, crude, physically impossible and woefully shallow, '40 Days and 40 Nights' is not a good film. So it is with a heavy heart therefore to confess that you might actually enjoy it. It's a guilty pleasure.

Explosive and action packed, it is also entertaining at points and well worth someone's evening.After alien ships appear in the sky, humanity is divided in their opinions. When scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers a timer counting down to an event however, he fears the worse and rushes to the White House.

Unfortunately for humanity though, the aliens are already prepared.Violent and explosive, 'Independence Day' will always be remembered for the moment the White House is blown up. Impressive effects for the time, that scene is just one of many occasions throughout the film when graphics take over from the human element. For this sort of film, this can only be a good thing. Whilst actors like Goldblum, Pullman and personal favourite Judd Hirsch, all pull their weight during the film, people don't watch for them, they watch for the special effects and the occasional Will Smith quip (of which there are many).People also watch to see humanity come out on top.

But while the Civil War is an element that keeps turning up in his movies, he never actually did do the Civil War film he wanted to do - a biography of the career of Ulysses Grant. In his career he tackled the Civil War three times. In PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND he dealt with the story of Dr.Samuel Mudd, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in Lincoln's Assassination. In HOW THE WEST WAS WON, Ford did the segment dealing with the battle of SHILOH, with Harry Morgan as General Grant and John Wayne as General Sherman. This film was the nearest that Ford ever got to his dream film. THE HORSE SOLDIERS was the only film that was devoted to a full study of the effect of the war in the South, on both Union and Rebel soldiers. While not, perhaps, the best that Ford could have achieved - he was in the twilight of his master career - it is a fine film none-the-less. The story is based on an incident in 1863 known as Grierson's Raid. Cavalry leader Benjamin Grierson was sent by Grant into Alabama and Mississippi on a raid to attack a railway junction, supposedly to destroy it for strategic reasons. While it was important to knock the railway junction out of effective work, the real purpose was to tie up Confederate forces in these backwaters. Since December 1862 Grant was struggling to capture the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi, the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. But try as he did Grant kept losing to the Confederates under Joseph Johnston and John C. Pemberton (the commander in Vicksburg). But Grant had noticed how Confederate cavalry men like Earl Van Dorn and Nathan Bedford Forrest had forced him to use men to protect his supply lines, and took valuable time away from him trying to fight off or track them down. He decided that Grierson, a first rate Cavalry leader, could do the same thing to Johnston. A very intelligent Confederate Commander, Johnston was nervous at unexpected difficulties. Grant reasoned that Grierson's men would panic Johnston, and cause him to waste time chasing him down. As it turned out Grierson's Raid worked. The pinning down of large numbers of Rebel troops in Alabama and Missisippi was wonderful for Grant's Vicksburg campaign. It was the beginning of the successful conclusion of the campaign, as Johnston's attention was now split between trying to help support Pemberton and trying to reassure frightened southern populations in the hinterlands. Grierson got most of his men back to Northern lines. Vicksburg was able to hold out until July 4, 1863. It's fall (the day after Lee's defeat at Gettysburg) really marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War.This incident is the basis for THE HORSE SOLDIERS. Ford concentrates on what the experience of the war must have been like in the Southern countryside. Certain things are taken from other incidents and battlefields. When a military school's cadets are brought into the field to try to catch or slow down John Wayne's men, Ford is really picking up on an incident in the war in Virginia, when the young cadets at the Virginia Military Institute came out to fight the Union troops under Sheridan in 1864. One can forgive the transition of the incident. It has been pointed out that one of the characters, Colonel Secord (Willis Bouchey) is a splendid type - the political officer. Men like Secord (usually in the position of General) bedeviled both sides, because of their usually normal level of mediocrity or idiocy. A few rose to the job well - the best of the Northern political generals was Black Jack Logan, who would be a valuable associate of Sherman in the battles around Atlanta. But for every positive General Logan, there were thieves like Benjamin Spoons Butler, who feathered his nest as military governor of New Orleans (he supposedly stole even the silver spoons of the citizenry). Actually Secord is normally intelligent, and follows Wayne's strategy. But he is constantly looking ahead at post-war elections. Towards the end he even wonders if the White House beckons.Another lovely moment shows the fraying of the Southern cause. Wayne and his men come across two Rebel deserters (Strother Martin and Denver Pyle) who have tied up the local sheriff (Russell Simpson). Wayne thanks Martin and Pyle for their unofficial assistance to the Northern cause,telling them which way they plan to go. While Martin chatters away (mentioning the strength of Rebel forces in the area), Wayne carefully knocks out Pyle and then Martin, and then unties Simpson and assists in tying up the two deserters. William Holden is watching this, and later asks why he helped Simpson. Wayne explains that he decided to feed the deserters false information about his own movements, as they would probably give the information to the Confederates later on anyway.All the performances are fine, with Wayne in particular as a man who hates doctors and medicine for a valid personal reason. Holden is in a subordinate role but he gets some nice moments. So does Constance Towers, in a rare leading part, as a passionate Confederate supporter who gradually gets to like Wayne. Carleton Young, as a former friend of Wayne, has a moment trying to rally Confederate forces at the railway depot. It is a good Ford film, and makes one wish that Ford had made his Ulysses Grant biography.

I know some of you might say that well this movie simply states the FACTS as they happened, but I'm afraid that is where you are dreadfully wrong. The movie simply shows Black Africans as bloodthirsty born savages who needlessly attacked American SOLDIERS involved in a COMBAT operation. For the producers to do justice they could have at least showed why the Somalis attacked the US soldiers. This is where the facts come in about a month or so before the incident, American helicopters, while hunting for a SINGLE warlord, had come to the town looking for him. The Somali residents did not trouble the Americans then, for after all the Americans were there to help them all out. But in hunting for that SINGLE guy, the Americans, in their classic military tradition, blew up the ENTIRE building that this guy was thought to be in, killing at least 75 PEOPLE, all of whom had LOVED ONES too (and the guy was not even there). So what do you think Mogadishu residents did the next time they saw American helicopters in their neighborhoods? They had to at least try to defend themselves from another mass killing of course. And the vast majority of the Somalis killed by the Rangers were unarmed women and children, a fact the filmmakers carefully disguised. And by the way, for those of you who think the Rangers in Somalia were sweet little angels, I believe that the ranger one who was portrayed by Josh Hartnett is currently serving a thirty-year sentence for CHILD RAPE!!!

I have seen this movie probably over a hundred times and it never gets old. I have it on DVD and yet every time I happen to catch it on TV, I just have to watch it. I know most of the words by heart. Kevin Klein plays the perfect guy you almost love to hate because he makes you so angry for the dumb things he does then turns around and makes you swoon. And then of course Meg Ryan is always the perfect pick for these kinds of films. What can I say other than opposites really do attract in this fun-loving completely romantic movie. This is definitely a classic movie in my mind and a must buy, not rent.
