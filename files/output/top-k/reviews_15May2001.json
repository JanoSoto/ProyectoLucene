In fact, compared to Rocky, this movie is not very good. It is stuffed with some of the most hackneyed sports cliches you'll ever see. Maybe it's just impossible to come up with a decent sports film. It always comes down to a final fight. There are very few options along the way.POSSIBLE SPOILERSTo thicken the proceedings, three conflicts are built up. One between the main character, Diana, and her friends at high school, one between her and her father and her family situation, and one between her and her new boyfriend. Unfortunately, all are lacking in certain ways. The first, between her and her classmates, falls flat quickly. Maybe I just have a strong distaste for anything involving high school (I've been thankfully out of that situation for several years now), but I feel it is all underwritten. None of her classmates are developed in a significant enough way to make us care about the outcome of the conflict (and, to spoil it, they never resolve the issue). We'll skip her family relationships for the moment (they're a bit complicated) and go on to her boyfriend. It's all pretty cliche, with Diana feeling jealousy over the trampy girl who always is trying to get her man back. Also, and it comes as no surprise, she is forced to box her boyfriend in the film's climactic scene. First off, the director\/writer cheats by refusing to give us a good view of the actual match. She films it in slow motion and cuts out significant portions, giving you no idea what is happening in the match; when the decision comes, you have no clue who will win. That adds a bit of suspense, but an actual boxing match, something that you may crave by this time (there's very little boxing in the film, really), would have produced more suspense. However, the boyfriend situation works much better than the friend situation. The actors have chemistry, and, although cliche, I did care about their relationship. Their final scene, although sewn together with formulae, is touching (it is an ode to the famous ending of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows, where we end in a freeze-frame towards which the camera moves closer and closer).Now I must talk about the relationship between Diana and her family. I'm not sure I understood the situation with her brother, and I'm not sure whether that's my fault (it was hot and humid, and thus difficult to pay attention at times) or the writer's fault. Anyway, I'll take the blame for that one. What I can argue over is the relationship and situation between Diana and her father. He is a very interesting character, and I think he's diminished by both the writing and the actor playing him. The casting for this character was very poor indeed. He's supposed to be a brute who has changed his ways (supposedly; I might have misinterpreted this situation, also). Diana accuses him of driving her mother to suicide by beating her. This whole backstory is what stimulates Diana's character the most, and Kusama develops it very by-the-books (straight from Screenwriting 101), mentioning it passim. She (Kusama) thinks she's being really subtle, but she ends up underplaying it too much. If I had written it, I would have given this whole conflict much more prominence, as well as the role of the brother. Still, the way it is done gives any mention of the mother an emotional background, and two scenes involving it are probably the two best scenes in the film one where Diana is forced to sell a locket which contains pictures of her and her mother (she keeps the pictures of course, but it is heartbreaking when she is standing outside the pawn shop with those two naked photos in her hand) and one where Diana attacks her father physically, accusing him of killing her mother.A couple of more things about the writing and the direction it would also have been good to develop more strongly the relationship between Diana and her trainer. It seemed to me as if Kusama had wanted to do this, but chickened out. It ends up being rather cliche. I'm beginning to paint a picture which, to me, seems pretty clear. I'm betting that Kusama had a much more complex film going for her, one that may have soared past its cliches like an eagle, but that she felt as if it would be far too long a film if she had used it all. I have mapped out four different relationships that Diana has to deal with, and all four peter out for the most part. All four could have been developed much further. But it ended up being 111 minutes long, about the average length, maybe even a little more, for a feature film. I've already shown Truffaut's influence on this film. Godard, the other French New Wave giant, also influences quite a bit. Jump cuts are used constantly. Godard's first film, Breathless, is most famous for its jump cuts, and he said that he used them so often because, for his first film, he didn't want it to be too long. Jump cuts cut significant time from the film. This is obviously why Kusama jump cuts so often, and, like Godard's Breathless, it is her first film.But I have done little besides complain! I must tell you why it overcomes its weak script! Michelle Rodriguez absolutely shines. Seriously, I think I'm in love with her and I pray that she'll get more parts. I remember, when commercials for this film would air on television, friends would comment on how ugly Rodriguez was. I think she's absolutely stunning. She has so much personality and so much skill in this film. You may correctly say that she sports only one expression throughout the film, a scowl, but you ought to notice, too, that Rodriguez is expressing a lot of feelings underneath that scowl. It is only a front, a defense mechanism, and Rodriguez (as well as Kusama) knows this. Her Diana is an endearing character, and, as hackneyed as the film can get at times, she always makes it worth watching and I always cared for her.I give the film a 7\/10.

We both grew up in the 70's and am quite familiar w\/ the 70's rock bands of varying stripes primarily during the later half of the decade but also the bands and music that came along early in the decade.It's unfortunate that I was not old enough to directly experience the goings on at the time Almost Famous took place (1973), I was, in the 3rd grade at that time however. My memories, kind of like Cameron's, is of an innocence, albait of a much younger kind of innocence than his that comes from being a youngish child and experiencing things for the first time so my recollection of that time is a little different than his. Adolescence is a powerful time for children\/pre teens in that the emotions can run rampant, take things out of proportion, and distort reality due to a simple lack of life experiences gained as one grows older. And that is what made this movie work, that wide eyed, yet cautious innocence that William posessed. I feel that is one of the movie's biggest strengths.I found the characters, at least the main characters such as Francis McDormond (the mother), Zooey Deschanel (William's older sister), Patrick Fugit (William) to be specific, very well thought out and not overly shallow as many characters are.The movie is about William writing for Rolling Stone for an up and coming band on tour, called Stillwater. the movie has us watching William try with all his might to get the interviews he needs and all the while learning something about himself, the life of a rock and roller and discovering love through Penny Lane. Now, Penny Lane is an interesting character herself. She always seemed to never be in the reality, always in a make believe\/fantasy world. I got the sense that she was trying to not admit to the realities of life and lived her life through the glories of a groupie, even if she never admitted to being one.I found some of the scenes, especially the scene in the bus when the group, one by one began singing the lyrics to Tiny Dancer-a little syrupy in my opinion.But overall, I find Almost Famous well acted, and reasonably accurate-even if from the eyes of a 15 year old kid turned adult.The soundtrack was excellent. Nancy Wilson of Heart did an incredible job of picking period accurate music, such as Tommy by the Who, Elton John etc. My favorate scene in the whole movie was when William discovers his sister's rock albums, on vinyl and pulls out Tommy, an original Decca pressing, places it on the record player and then watching the label spin and being mesmerized by the music that came forth (and I can definately relate to that).All in all, a very good movie and reasonably accurate, not necessarily nostalgic look at the rock scene of the early 70's.As stated earlier, I was a child in 1973 and therefore my recollection of the music and the times were a bit hazy and quite innocent and naive (what do you expect from a 3rd grader?). But to this day, I have some Aerosmith, Lynard Skynard, the Doobie Brothers, Carol King, Joni Mitchell and later on Silver Convention, Chicago, Average White Band, the Cars and of course Fleetwood Mac.

All stations (that I have been to) in DC, at the edge of the platform, have circular lights which signify the coming of a train. The edge of the station in the movie is yellow, which I know for sure is in the Baltimore subway (I rode it everyday for a year)2. DC stations are usually much wider, have a dome interior, with different style of benches.3. The walls are white, and the only station where the walls are white in Baltimore is the Johns Hopkins Hospital Station.4. The scene when the train exits the tunnel into the surface was recognizable as being in Baltimore, so is the drop off itself being on the path to the Owings Mills station. The highway which the train traveled is I-795. I am not saying that this makes the movie poor in quality.

All stations (that I have been to) in DC, at the edge of the platform, have circular lights which signify the coming of a train. The edge of the station in the movie is yellow, which I know for sure is in the Baltimore subway (I rode it everyday for a year)2. DC stations are usually much wider, have a dome interior, with different style of benches.3. The walls are white, and the only station where the walls are white in Baltimore is the Johns Hopkins Hospital Station.4. The scene when the train exits the tunnel into the surface was recognizable as being in Baltimore, so is the drop off itself being on the path to the Owings Mills station. The highway which the train traveled is I-795. I am not saying that this makes the movie poor in quality. I just think that a LITTLE more attention could have been given to this, since it really made me said WHAT?? when I saw it.

Every movement is purposeful.I find that, however, Monica Potter is unacceptable as an actress, for she is simply without ANY expressions. In one of the scenes (Not really a spoiler since no plot information is included) which she follows Freeman up a staircase, she looked more like a child following her parent rather than a partner at work. The character Megan was well done. I believe that a child does not necessary go into hysteria when an extreme circumstance descends upon her. As an intelligent child, she looked for ways out, and take the things that come with bravery. The plot was fairly predictable, but not completely. The script was well-written, and the pace was quick, not too fast, but never slowed down. Overall, a great experience.********************************************************************* *******************Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!************************* *********************************************************************I can be wrong about this.

Ed Wood's reverential treatment and acceptance of the man everyone else forgot is the touching heartbeat of the film that sketches its characters as so inherently likeable despite being outcasts of society.With its inspired casting and evenly paced direction that blends a mixture of horror, comedy and tragedy, &#145;Ed Wood' is perhaps the finest film in Burton's distinguished yet highly unusual career. In some respects it works well as a later day &#145;Sunset Boulevard', a damning indictment of Hollywood's shunning of the little guy and burying the stars that have lost their appeal, yet on the other hand it is reverential biopic of a man who followed his dreams and visions as diligently as his mentor Orson Welles &#150; although without the same degree of success. The principle strength of the film lies in the outstanding performances of Depp and Landau, with a supporting cast including Sarah Jessica Parker as his demented girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as his one true love, and Bill Murray as camp would be transsexual providing excellent support.Wood may well have been the worst film maker of all time, yet as Tim Burton himself said `It takes talent to make a really good movie, but it also takes talent to make a really bad movie.' Wood never compromised what little artistic integrity he had, and in the process he has given us some rare atrocious gems to savour. These in turn have provided Burton with enough material to make a Grade &#145;A' film that celebrates the life of Wood and shows him as a man with a vision who was prepared to realise it at any cost. Finally we get to see that vision as it was originally intended. Quite simply this film is a masterpiece.

Because the trailer was pretty cool (it contained the way groovy song Get Duffy by Primal Scream!), I owned every single (Emma Peel) Avengers episode (way before A&E made it easy for everyone) on video and Uma looked pretty neat-o in a weird outfit. Did I have my doubts? Sure! This was being made by the director who brought us Benny And Joon! (God, how I hate that film!) Well, on the day of the release I began to really sweat. First there were no reviews to speak of (that being always a very bad sign) and while waiting in line people were coming out of the theatre grumbling lame, don't waste your money!, and where did I park my car, again? So maybe in a way, I wanted to like it, because everyone hated it. Oh, and I was hoping to hear that Primal Scream song in the movie again. Well, unfortunately the song was only in the trailer, so that was a let down, but the film did manage to put me in some kind of hypnotic dream state that neither fully enthralled or fully entertained me. It just sort of existed like a weird pot haze state. Did I appreciate the liberties it took on one of my favourite tv shows? Not really. Emma Peel's character was reduced to a neurotic victim, versus the ass-kicking woman that the show had depicted. Mr. Steed was a little too foppish and suffered terribly from an over abundance of blush (they should have fired the make-up department)? A friend of mine met Patrick (the original Mr. Steed) and he'd mentioned that there were some great moments in the film that were edited out at the last moment? Also, I can recall reading that they did some last minute special effects tweaking? Maybe a director's cut is in order? Was it the best film I ever saw? Nope! What I have found with a lot of films though, is that everyone has such strong opinions of a film that really doesn't warrant much of a reaction. I mean if people really want to explore BAD films, then surly there is definitely worthier candidates then this one. It has a lot of cool (though I'm not a big fan of digital, but..) effects, and the color is bright enough to keep most viewers awake. The acting is a little shakey, but at least the cast was attractive. The characters remind me more of the last season episodes with Tara King, more then the Emma Peel ones. It does have some great surreal imagery though. The colorful bear outfits are like some opium induced (or Grateful Dead inspired) dream. If I was a child I could have had nightmares for days. Also, I thought the landscape of the new England was pretty inspired. It had a cold almost isolated feel of another planet. An alien environment like the isolated villages I use to view in the TV show. I spend (unfortunately) a lot of time at jobs that just allow me to surf the net for a living (life of a receptionist), and I spend many of the hours reading a lot of reviews from people who should not be reviewing films, but hey, it's freedom of speech. And then I spend the latter part of my day watching films that no one could be bothered to watch. Why is it that a film relatively harmless as this one gets such outrages and attention, when a film director like John Cassavetes gets barely 4 reviews a film? But I find it interesting that (for the most part) all reviews as whole put together all the thoughts on a film. I've read reviews of films I love and can't get enough of, and found myself giggling at someones bad review of it. Why? Because film in general takes people places that they don't necessarily ask to be taken to, or change the way a person usually predicts it should be. Depends on the mood. One film is just one interpetation of an idea. A film does not  have to be the last word on a topic, but rather an opinion. At least it tried a little harder to hit the mark then the Mod Squad remake. In a way I highly recommend everyone see this film, because it's different from the typical Hollywood turn out, and someone at a studio decided to drop millions of dollars on it with people spending hundreds of hours making it. Will there be a sequel? I should predict not. So hey, it's a one off deal. For all the people that hate it...you're eyes will bleed no longer. I predict that this will be Sean Connery's second Zardoz (and I love Zardoz). In 50 years, people will look to this film and think...hella weird (due, no doubt to the failed sense of British humour.

The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure.  After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make.  Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose.  It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie.

But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.

This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make.  Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose.  It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.

It has some basic weaknesses, but also some major strengths that make it worthwhile.  The basic story is established early Catholic priest Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) hears a confession from the church caretaker, who has just killed a man.  Circumstantial evidence leads to Father Logan himself being suspected, but he is bound by the seal of the confessional and is unable to clear himself, putting him in serious danger of being wrongly convicted.Two basic weaknesses keep I Confess from being one of Hitchcock's better works.  First, too much of the plot hinges on the priest's confessional responsibility.  In itself, this is an interesting plot device, leading to an interesting twist on one of Hitchcock's favorite themes, the wrongly accused man.  But there are not enough other significant plot elements, and this one point cannot bear the load that it has to carry.  In particular, a non-Catholic viewer, without an intuitive sense of the importance of confessional, will find it difficult to remember just how impossible it is for Father Logan to clear himself.  This could have been established somehow earlier in the film - Hitchcock could be very creative when demonstrating things like this - but as it is, it is assumed that we already appreciate its importance.The two leads also are less than ideal in their roles, making it harder for the audience to develop the deep identification with them that makes Hitchcock's best movies such exciting experiences.  The ever-brooding Clift is very believable as a priest, but his acting range is too limited to make us fully appreciate his dilemma, nor can he make the romance angle as compelling as it could have been.  Anne Baxter is also too melodramatic as Logan's old friend who wants to clear him.  Baxter is a good actress in the right part - for example, her breathlessness is ideal in All About Eve - but her character here really called for something different.Yet there are some strengths to I Confess.  One that stands out is the wonderful black-and-white photography.  The film was made on location in Quebec, and Hitchcock masterfully uses a careful selection of shots throughout the picture that establish Quebec's distinctiveness and its stark beauty.  It is one of Hitchcock's best pieces of location filming, rivaling the French Riviera scenery of To Catch a Thief, although of course with a much different tone.  In both films, the location nicely complements the story.Karl Malden is good as the inspector assigned to the case.  Malden must accept the usual role of a Hitchcock policeman - hard-working, honest, and earnest, but not very perceptive.  Malden makes what could have been a bland character come to life.There is also a fine climactic sequence Father Logan is finally put on trial, and the verdict sparks public outrage and a carefully filmed and suspenseful chain of events.  The climax is perhaps less satisfying than those of Hitchcock's best films, but that is mainly because we never learned to identify very much with the characters; it is not a fault of the ending itself.  There are some fine Hitchcock touches here that you have to catch on repeat viewings.

Cameron's magnum opus has every element you'd expect from a Hollywood epic &#150; romance, tragedy, historical grandeur, lavish sets and costumes, eye popping set pieces, and of course sexy actors &#150; but somehow manages to achieve great results with the smallest amount of subtlety. The film begins in modern day Nova Scotia where a marine archaeologist (Paxton) stumbles across some tattered drawings whilst exploring the wreck of the famous ship for a priceless diamond. The drawing is that of a naked young woman who appears to be wearing the proverbial diamond of great price, and when Paxton's find is broadcast on TV it sparks off some memories in 101 year old Rose Calvert (Stewart). It transpires that Rose Calvert was in fact the socialite Rose DeWitt-Bukater who was supposed to have gone down with the ship some 84 years earlier. Of course that was not the case, and Cameron's film gives her the opportunity to set the record straight. In 1912 she was going to America to wed her thuggish fiancé Caloden Hockley (Zane), when in mid Atlantic she decides to throw off the shackles of her upper class oppressors and jump ship in a manner of speaking. Then she meets her knight in shining armour Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), a down on his luck travelling artist who saves her in every way a person can be saved (cue nauseating plot line). So they meet, he shows her the ways of the world by taking her to a party in steerage class, she leaves her fiancé, he teaches her to fly, paints her in the nude, they have sex, the ship sinks, he dies and her heart goes on &#150; and on and on and on. So essentially it is just your classic tale of boy meets girl, ship meets iceberg. Despite all the hype and hoopla, &#145;Titanic' is quite a mesmerising piece of work that delivers an endless series of thumps to the heart while provide little if any food for thought. Although the characters are essentially black and white morally unambiguous personages, and the actor's thespian talents are not really challenged by the roles, and the dialogue has patches is purely prosaic (note when DiCaprio overhears the that the ship will sink he comments `This is bad' &#150; very observant), the film has a great deal to compliment it. The opening underwater sequences are as eye catching as anything ever committed to celluloid, the vast shots of the ship in motion are breathtaking, and the attention to detail of the ship's interiors are flawless. However hackneyed the script may be, DiCaprio and Winslet inject their limited characters with endless charm, and the romantic romp is a shamelessly enjoyable roller coaster of fun and frolics. Yet it is only when the ship collides with the berg that the film kicks into first gear. The panic, terror and heartbreak of the sinking is viscerally recreated in all its gory horror, proving once and for all that James Cameron is the world's foremost director of action sequences. The aftermath is equally appalling, having to be seen to be believed.With a running time in excess of three hours this film could do with being a little shorter, and some of the sequences featuring the two leads trapped in the bowels of the sinking ship are excessive. Against its predecessor the highly commendable &#145;A Night To Remember', &#145;Titanic' can hold its own, primarily for its brutal depiction of the ship's final hours, however it has neither the historical accuracy nor the emotional depth of the former. Criticisms aside, &#145;Titanic' is the movie that will reinvent blockbusters for the 21st century, and while it is about a subtle as a hole in the head &#150; or the hull if you must &#150;  you will not be likely to see a bigger film for many years to come.

The only songs which truly work are those where Chevalier sings; Vhank 'Evv-en For Litt-el gels! and I Ree-mem-burr 'eet vell! have a kind of absurd, dandyish swagger to them that works due to Chevalier's charisma; he plays up the lecherous old extravagant Frenchman role to perfection. Sadly, after a decent early entrance with Chevalier, Louis Jourdan is very bland and unengaging. He should have been played with vigour as a cynical cad, of the George Sanders school. Leslie Caron, a good decade too old for the role she is supposed to be playing, isn't very impressive as Gigi herself. The distance of the camerawork leads to a certain distance from characters who are at best, competently played. The surplus of talk, the lack of dancing and of memorable music all contribute to Gigi being a very dull, talky film, that struggled to keep my attention.

The script, timing, lighting, even the Adr and sound sync are waaaayyy off. And why does General Noriega look like he's being played by Bob Hoskins with a bad tan? This movie made me want to set my television on fire. I've always found Sandler's appeal somewhat dubious, but after Going Overboard it's clear that most of his professional success is probably due to a blood pact he made with Satan around 1991. I can't believe Billy Bob Thorton and Billy Zane didn't take their name off this piece of garbage or collaborate on a master plan to destroy every copy of it in existence. This movie is concrete proof that there is REAL EVIL in the world. You've been warned.
