Not only is Nichols a master of tone and atmosphere, and the film brilliantly-paced with basically no dull bits, but it's such a technical tour-de-force. The photography is striking, not sure how much credit to give to Nichols and how much to the great Robert Surtees, but they seem to have had a great understanding of what they wanted to achieve. The use of flares (which I'm really fascinated by now, as sort of a by-product of seeing Elswit's work on Punch Drunk Love) during that conversation between Ben and Elaine in the car outside the Taft hotel, or the flares caused by sunlight in the POV shots of Ben talking to his father from the pool, with his dad moving in and out of the way of sunlight. The whole movie just has great little visual touches like that.Obviously the use of music and sound in general is wonderful, this movie popularized the music video-within-a-movie thing that Wes Anderson for example does so well, I love it personally, but I know a lot of people really don't. Just as silence is used so effectively a blank black screen is also used tremendously well at times. The use of camera throughout the film is fantastic IMO, there's rarely even a conversation that's boringly, conventionally filmed, something you can't say even about the work of many major directors like Scorsese etc. He also seems to have a great grasp of how much emotion can be conveyed in the distance between the camera and characters. When there are close-ups in The Graduate they are very affecting and beautiful, and the zoom-outs (and zoom-ins) are also striking and used to great effect several times in the movie. Don't even need to mention some of the great transitions and the editing. Also love how Nichols shows us several perspectives of the same thing in several scenes.

The woman, once full of life, has slipped into a life of alcoholism and it appears she is hiding a dark secret. When you ask most people what Hitchcock's worst film is many will say this one here while others will say they've never even heard of this movie. The movie was a crashing bomb when originally released and it got horrid reviews by everyone except the French, which is a shame because the movie is actually pretty good. The acting is brilliant, the direction great, the cinematography wonderful and there's a blazing music score but what keeps this from being a minor masterpiece is the downright corny and at times horrid story. I think another problem is that people go into this movie expecting a Hitchcock movie and it's certainly not that. This movie isn't about suspense or drama but instead it's about emotions and for the most part I think Hitchcock gets this out of his cast. Bergman is certainly wonderful in her role and she really sells her characters fall and then rise. What makes Bergman's performance so much better is the fact that her character is very poorly written but she's still able to work with it and deliver someone to care about. Wilding is also wonderful in his role and brings a lot of drama to the role as does Margaret Leighton as a dirty maid. Cecil Parker is also very memorable as the Governor. However it's Cotten who steals the film with his incredibly wonderful performance as someone who we think is mad but there's so much more to his character. Cotten doesn't have to say anything but he carries this certain intensity, which really jumps out at the viewer to make us keep our eye on him because we fear that he's capable of doing something very bad. The music score by Richard Addinsell perfectly captures the mood of the characters and the cinematography by Jack Cardiff really makes for a beautiful film. The biggest problem with the film is that the story isn't strong enough to suppose a 117-minute running time and there are way too many corny or unanswered things. The transformation from drunk to princess happens way too fast for Bergman's character and the love triangle at the end just comes off silly and without any real drama. Had a better screenplay been written then we might be calling this one of the director's best films. As it is, this is a very strong movie as long as you don't go in expecting something it isn't.

Perhaps those flaws would have gone down easier had the cinematography not been a pretty dull TV-level affair in general and Francois Girard's direction so flat much of the time, but unfortunately those aspects also hurt the film overall, though neither are incompetent.

There is the usual group of people forming a loosely structured community, and there are reality intrusions and unanticipated events. But the film has a plot too. It generates not just a sense of familiarity but tension as well. It leads somewhere and the outcome, which is a matter of life and death, is problematic.Warren Beatty rides into a rough-hewn town in the Pacific Northwest. The buildings are all made of raw planks of shaved wood. The rooms are small, drafty and crowded with sweaty people in gargantuan fur robes.Beatty sets up a cat house. He's soon joined by Julie Christie, who convinces him that he does not know how to manage a whore house or anything else -- he can't subtract nine from twenty-three in his head -- whereas she, with all her experience, and with a share of the profits, can turn the entrepreneurial adventure into a success. She does so.Beatty falls for Christie over time, but she's largely indifferent to him. Also she's into doing opium with the local Chinese population during her quiet time. It's a very PC movie. (Beatty Many Chinks around here?) Little does he know that trouble lies just around the corner. He doesn't know because the character, unlike Beatty, hasn't read the script and doesn't realize that a Western that is not an outright comedy requires a climactic showdown. Two agents from a mining company show up and want to buy him out. They offer a fair price but Beatty is a bit of a fool and turns them down flat. Christie warns him that the company doesn't take no for an answer and that he's endangering his life, but Beatty, the big know-it-all who can't add or subtract, rejects a second, higher offer from the two agents. The agents are both puzzled and disappointed. They agree to turn the affair over to Jake. Then they leave town.Jake is seven feet tall. He rides into town in a silver fur coat the size of a circus tent, carrying a ten-foot-long big-barreled rifle, accompanied by two ominous gun-toting hoods of lesser proportions.At last Beatty awakens to the fact that these are deeper waters than he'd thought. But he's not Gary Cooper and this is not High Noon. Beatty is not only terrified at the prospect of death. He does everything he can to sell out.First, full of bravado, he visits Jake Butler in the saloon. While other townsfolk look on, Jake immediately takes control of the situation. Beatty offers him a cigar but Jake says, Have one of mine. And when Beatty suggests they retire to a remote table to talk business, Jake stops him with, No, this is fine. Beatty then offers, with much hemming and hawing, to sell his property at a lower price than the two agents first offered. But I don't make deals, says Jake with a big firm grin.Next, Beatty goes to the nearest port town in Washington state and looks up the two agents, hoping to sell out to THEM, but they've already gone.Beatty consults a lawyer -- the next senator from the state of Washington -- who tells him he has nothing to worry about; they'll take the matter to court and Beatty will be a hero to the common man. Talk about Job's comforters! Beatty may be shot and killed the very next day, so the last thing on his mind is becoming a beacon of hope for the man on the street.You can tell this is an Altman film from the overlapping dialog and the way disparate individuals keep bumping into one another and trading wisecracks. Most of those wisecracks were hoary with age when I heard them in high school. Beatty You keep talking about 'we.' Who's this 'we'? You have a turd in your pocket? And there is humor too, more set up than in many of Altman's other films. Christie excoriates Beatty for not having bathed. Beatty gets drunk, sitting in a chair and trying unsuccessfully to close his pocket watch, shabby, mumbling, I don't give a s***. I ain't takin' no g** damn bath. But he does finally bathe and tries to visit Christie with a handful of flowers. The door to her room is locked. Open this door, he demands. No. Well if you think I'm going to talk to you through a locked door (he lurches against it and it doesn't budge).... that's all right with me. The shoot out is full of suspense and far more believable than that in High Noon. The whole structure of the movie makes more sense. Beatty has no sense of honor. His manhood has nothing to do with it. Of the people he manages to put a bullet into (one each), he shoots two of them in the back before they know he's there. And Christie merely droops with resignation and retreats to the Chinese opium den.The movie isn't as taut as it might be, or as inexorably logical. (What Altman film is?) The deep affection between Beatty and Christie pops up out of nowhere like a jack in the box. The sound track is sometimes muddied by extraneous conversations. The production designer and set dresser should get a medal for that drafty new wooden town. It's a Northwest Coast climate. When it's not raining it's snowy or, at best, cloudy. Seattle weather forecasts sometimes predict sun breaks, meaning that the cloud cover may have holes in it and if you're lucky you might get a glimpse of the sun. The town reeks of damp sawdust. And like the surrounding forests of pine and fir, it's laden with wet heavy snow. Give a medal to wardrobe too. Where did they come up with that cartoon cowboy hat that Keith Carradine wears?

He rides into town in a silver fur coat the size of a circus tent, carrying a ten-foot-long big-barreled rifle, accompanied by two ominous gun-toting hoods of lesser proportions.At last Beatty awakens to the fact that these are deeper waters than he'd thought. But he's not Gary Cooper and this is not High Noon. Beatty is not only terrified at the prospect of death. He does everything he can to sell out.First, full of bravado, he visits Jake Butler in the saloon. While other townsfolk look on, Jake immediately takes control of the situation. Beatty offers him a cigar but Jake says, Have one of mine. And when Beatty suggests they retire to a remote table to talk business, Jake stops him with, No, this is fine. Beatty then offers, with much hemming and hawing, to sell his property at a lower price than the two agents first offered. But I don't make deals, says Jake with a big firm grin.Next, Beatty goes to the nearest port town in Washington state and looks up the two agents, hoping to sell out to THEM, but they've already gone.Beatty consults a lawyer -- the next senator from the state of Washington -- who tells him he has nothing to worry about; they'll take the matter to court and Beatty will be a hero to the common man. Talk about Job's comforters! Beatty may be shot and killed the very next day, so the last thing on his mind is becoming a beacon of hope for the man on the street.You can tell this is an Altman film from the overlapping dialog and the way disparate individuals keep bumping into one another and trading wisecracks. Most of those wisecracks were hoary with age when I heard them in high school. Beatty You keep talking about 'we.' Who's this 'we'? You have a turd in your pocket? And there is humor too, more set up than in many of Altman's other films. Christie excoriates Beatty for not having bathed. Beatty gets drunk, sitting in a chair and trying unsuccessfully to close his pocket watch, shabby, mumbling, I don't give a s***. I ain't takin' no g** damn bath. But he does finally bathe and tries to visit Christie with a handful of flowers. The door to her room is locked. Open this door, he demands. No. Well if you think I'm going to talk to you through a locked door (he lurches against it and it doesn't budge).... that's all right with me. The shoot out is full of suspense and far more believable than that in High Noon. The whole structure of the movie makes more sense. Beatty has no sense of honor. His manhood has nothing to do with it. Of the people he manages to put a bullet into (one each), he shoots two of them in the back before they know he's there. And Christie merely droops with resignation and retreats to the Chinese opium den.The movie isn't as taut as it might be, or as inexorably logical. (What Altman film is?) The deep affection between Beatty and Christie pops up out of nowhere like a jack in the box. The sound track is sometimes muddied by extraneous conversations. The production designer and set dresser should get a medal for that drafty new wooden town. It's a Northwest Coast climate. When it's not raining it's snowy or, at best, cloudy. Seattle weather forecasts sometimes predict sun breaks, meaning that the cloud cover may have holes in it and if you're lucky you might get a glimpse of the sun. The town reeks of damp sawdust.

There is the usual group of people forming a loosely structured community, and there are reality intrusions and unanticipated events. But the film has a plot too. It generates not just a sense of familiarity but tension as well. It leads somewhere and the outcome, which is a matter of life and death, is problematic.Warren Beatty rides into a rough-hewn town in the Pacific Northwest. The buildings are all made of raw planks of shaved wood. The rooms are small, drafty and crowded with sweaty people in gargantuan fur robes.Beatty sets up a cat house. He's soon joined by Julie Christie, who convinces him that he does not know how to manage a whore house or anything else -- he can't subtract nine from twenty-three in his head -- whereas she, with all her experience, and with a share of the profits, can turn the entrepreneurial adventure into a success. She does so.Beatty falls for Christie over time, but she's largely indifferent to him. Also she's into doing opium with the local Chinese population during her quiet time. It's a very PC movie. (Beatty Many Chinks around here?) Little does he know that trouble lies just around the corner. He doesn't know because the character, unlike Beatty, hasn't read the script and doesn't realize that a Western that is not an outright comedy requires a climactic showdown. Two agents from a mining company show up and want to buy him out. They offer a fair price but Beatty is a bit of a fool and turns them down flat. Christie warns him that the company doesn't take no for an answer and that he's endangering his life, but Beatty, the big know-it-all who can't add or subtract, rejects a second, higher offer from the two agents.

There are several full-length texts that explore this film's every nuance, and countless articles have been written about the film itself, its birthing of the summer blockbuster, and its impact on motion picture history. With this in mind, I am fully aware that I will not be able to shed any new critical light on this landmark film in a 1000-word IMDb entry. However, since Jaws is indisputably one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly in my all-time Top 10, I felt that I had to write SOMETHING about it.Few films are perfect. This one absolutely is. Jaws is the rarefied movie that can weather intensive scrutiny of each of its sum parts, and still emerge from this analysis as a clearly superior work in every aspect of its production. The acting is top-notch, and each of its characters are perfectly cast and essayed. The score is superlative, and as key to the horror within as the shark. The story itself is deceptively simple, yet powerful enough to remain both timely and timeless. The camera work and use of environment to create tension are unparalleled in the film medium, and every frame carries an implied menace, even when the shark is nowhere in sight. Every detail of the film-making process is performed here with such groundbreaking precision that the film almost becomes a textbook.Those familiar with the troublesome shoot that birthed this film know all the anecdotes associated with that process, so we'll skip those here. But it is worth noting that the film is actually better because of each problem encountered during the production, which certainly says a lot about the talented crew that put this together, but says even more about what role fate plays in the creation of true art. This film was supposed to be made exactly as it was, and the series of happy accidents and no-show mechanical monsters that forced the film-makers to turn the ocean into a monster with another monster inside of it ended up changing the possibilities of what a horror film could be, and tapping into each of the most potent fears of mankind simultaneously.It's also worth mentioning that Jaws is one of the only films ever made that not only surpasses its source work, but renders it relatively useless. Certainly, Peter Benchley's novel is a fantastic read, but no words can essay the endless possibilities for terror the way that the frames of the vast, mysterious ocean do in this film. While Benchley's characters were well-defined and offered layers of depth, the actors here don't play these characters, they BECOME them. The Amity Island in the book is a well-crafted fictional beach city, but the town and its denizens are so magnificently rendered in the film, we could almost be watching a documentary.But, stripping all that away, Jaws is a monster movie, and on that count it succeeds better than any other film in the genre. The unimaginable horror of being attacked by this monstrous fish and crushed between its titular Jaws conjures up agonies beyond comprehension, and even though we see very little of the shark's capacity for destruction in the film, the glimpses we do get, coupled with our own implicit subconscious knowledge that dying like the victims in this film would probably be about the worst way our lives could end, create a scenario borne straight from nightmares.In terms of this film's impact, I can only speak personally. The honest truth is that I am terrified to this day of the ocean; so much so that when I go to the beach, the only contact I have with the water is when I walk along the coast and feel it lapping at my feet. Now, I'm not necessarily afraid to go in the water because Jaws is a scary movie, even though it most assuredly is. What frightens me is that there ARE sharks out there in the sprawling blue-green enigma, and some of them DO attack humans, and though I am keenly aware that no one has ever caught a shark as big as Bruce, I am also aware that there are depths of the ocean we have yet to discover, and lifeforms down in these depths that we aren't even aware exist... and they probably swim up closer to the surface from time to time.Frame by frame, Jaws is quite simply a masterpiece, and considering the impact this piece of celluloid has had on my life to this day, I would have to consider it the most truly scary horror film I have ever seen. Yes, there is levity, and there are moments of peace buried within the razor tension of the film's core struggle of man vs. beast. But, overlying all of this is the inescapable knowledge that somewhere out there, shark's in the water... our shark.

As always I learned with each film I've watched from the Coen brothers even though most of their plots are a little offbeat they still entertain and hold interest. As evidenced from watching this film it proves even ordinary people anywhere can finds themselves caught up in crazy things that involve unexpected twist and turns yet somehow it all solves it's self in the end.Set in the great northern united states mostly taking place in a small Minnesota town it involves William H. Macy as a desperate car salesman who wants money. And he will do anything even if it means arranging a crazy scheme to have his wife kidnapped so he could get ransom money from her well to do father. And that's just what he does when he contacts two stone cold thugs(one who's played brilliant by Steve Buscemi who enjoys having sex with truck stop prostitutes and escorts on the side!) from Fargo, North Dakota to travel to Minnesota to kidnap his wife. As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.Overall Fargo is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films.

But he's not looking for any Tom, Dick and Harry to complete his wishes, which we learn to involve his suicide, and for the chosen one to return to the location to call out his name twice. If he was to respond, then the helper is to assist him out of a self-dug hole. Otherwise, 20 shovels of sand is needed to bury Mr Badii, and the helper can make away with his car load of cash, with absolutely no strings attached thereafter.Shot mostly within the interior of his vehicle, and rarely, if not never do we see the characters interaction within the same camera frame, the narrative's punctuated with plenty of solitude and contemplative silence when Badii is on his own in search of his mark, and then filled with plenty of dialogue depending on who's making the case &#x96; Badii in trying to convince those whom he had conned into hopping into his travelling vehicle, or those that he had roped in to help &#x96; a Kurd, an Afghan and a Turk, attempting to either escape, or trying their best to talk him out of his thought.

Then there are those who are stuck in the middle, where money plays a key into covering one's heart, because it's needed to facilitate a personal gain.Given my continuous curiosity of the landscapes in Tehran, Iran, where this film was shot in, it doesn't show you much beyond the brown-orange environment of a construction site that Badii frequently uses, going almost to the top where he intends to end his life at. It seems as bleak as Badii's mission can be, with Kiarostami never flinching into giving you additional clues as to the background of this man with the singular passion, which admittedly does waver a little, leaving the ending open ended, with the coda making it all a little more complicated. To me, that little scene looked more like a making-of documentary that couldn't find its proper place in a DVD extra.In any case, if time and the National Library permits, I'm likely to be picking up more of Kiarostami's works to see if indeed they're my cup of tea, or otherwise.

Not that the story itself is confusing because it's easy to figure out what's going on, the confusing part is that there isn't any mystery or suspense going on. It's as if the film itself doesn't know what it's trying to do and perhaps that's because, as rumor would have it, Laughton pretty much took over the production and wouldn't do anything Hitchcock said or asked. I'm not sure how true that is but you can look at this picture and not see too many of Hitchcock's usual touches. With a story like this Hitchcock should have worked wonders but instead we're left with an incredibly dull film that doesn't contain too much life. Laughton is incredibly hammy and over the top in his performance but at least O'Hara delivers something worth watching. She's certainly the best thing in the film.

The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as the villain of the piece, Mr Thorwold.

Couple that with the characters themselves never really all that well defined, and it's mass confusion for the first hour.

In 2008, an AFI poll placed the film at the top of all American sports films but it's really much more than that. It's an artfully executed character study of a paranoid, destructive man who just happens to be a great boxer.In portraying Jake La Motta, Robert De Niro won his second Oscar and it's easy to see why. He famously put on sixty pounds to play the boxer in his retirement years but his performance needs no such gimmickry in order to succeed. He effortlessly handles all aspects of the role, from raging bull to pitiful has-been. The rest of the cast gives him capable support. In fact, Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty both landed Oscar nominations.The direction by Scorsese is near flawless (I say near flawless because some of the fisticuffs aren't totally convincing as far as I'm concerned). While Scorsese didn't get the Oscar that he deserved, Thelma Schoonmaker's editing did. It should also be noted that the cinematography landed an Oscar nomination as well. Also worth noting is the soundtrack, which mostly sticks in the background but also makes superb use of the intermezzo from Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana.Ultimately, though, I do think that the film has a bit of a weak link and that's the story. Perhaps it's La Motta's lack of redeeming features but, to me, his journey seems somewhat inconsequential. That being said, it's not a bad story; it's just not at quite the same level as the other elements of the film.All in all, this is indeed a worthy classic but I don't completely agree with the critical consensus that typically identifies it as one of the very best of all time (I'm thinking top 10 or so here). However, all that really boils down to is that I think it's slightly less of a masterpiece than other masterpieces.

In fact the acting and characters become so irritating it is the only element of Phantasm that takes it away from being considered a true Horror classic by most Horror buffs (or maybe it's George Lucas' unauthorized use of Jawa's?).When one scans the Horror elite those films have pretty atrocious acting problems too, so why should Phantasm fail so much? It shouldn't really because Phantasm is just as good as the classics. One of the reason why Phantasm is such a unique film is the well established characters unlike most Horror films; whilst the acting is somewhat absent from the strongly written character it's still enough to redeem the awkwardly delivered lines, odd facial expressions and comical snappy reactions. The films score is also perfect and mesmerizing that fits well by Fred Myrow, it was in fact one of the most powerful elements of the movie that really had me engaged. The stunning visuals and the concept and imagery of The Tall Man (wonderfully portrayed by Angus Scrimm) are authentically creepy, like something one would encounter in a nightmare. (in fact, I had a dream where I was in Hell and I encountered a priest that had been shrunk and dissected by a demon and this was before I saw Phantasm) I know I would be pretty hysterical if The Tall Man was stalking me.It's these points of the film that for me makes Phantasm an atmospheric and creepy horror gem, in fact it brings me back to when I was a five year old child in a video store in the 90's, traumatized by the VHS covers for Hellraiser and The Blob only to eagerly await the day I was old enough to view them. Another reason why Phantasm's atmosphere works so well is the use of white and brightness instead darkness Phantasm's surreal mortuary is a nightmarish treat of white marble walls lined with drawers of the dead, gaping large hallways and The Tall Man's shoes trudging along the tiles that make you feel he's going to jump out of the television screen. From the flying silver balls to the void to another dimension, Phantasm's concept of a ghoulishly eerie tale about a soul keeper is wonderfully mastered and pulled off.No matter how jammed with 1970's horror clichés the use of the shoestring budget and surrealism incorporated into Phantasm makes it a pure Horror gem. It seems all the love goes to over rated films only because they're so talked about and not actually analysed. This movie has creeped me out more than any other Horror classic ever could now and I'm far from the age I was when I used to be scared those films.

In the Trivia section here, it is charged that the film was made under an apartheid regime because John Wayne supported it. Hatari was filmed in Tanganika, and there was no apartheid in effect in that country at the time. (Apartheid was a legalized caste system only ever in effect in South Africa.)2. While the native African populations are kept largely in the background, there are no denigrating remarks made concerning them, but instead an insistence that their traditions be respected. The film's social structure is actually constructed to emphasize cultural pluralism - the focal group is made up of a German, several French descendants, a Swiss-Italian, a Spaniard, a Native American, an American Jew (Buttons as Pockets) and of course Wayne - an Irish Catholic playing the only WASP in the group.3. The homophobia charge directed against the film has to do with a single line, when Dallas asks Pockets why Wayne's character doesn't like women, and Pockets says she suffers under a misapprehension. I'm sorry, this is homophobic? I watched this movie several times over the past 40 odd years and I never noticed this until I read it on IMDb? Well, maybe it's not really there.4. It is charged that the film has been censored for homophobia, sexism, racism and smoking (?!) in television broadcasts. Maybe in the troll's fantasy world. The film has occasionally been shortened due to it's length.5. The film, it is charged, is sexist, using women as mere objects. Of what? Dallas, the female lead, is aggressive about her job, about her desires to experience Africa, about her sexuality. And she's hip and intelligent, intimidating the older (and old-fashioned) Wayne on a number of occasions. If this defined sexism, there would never have been any need for feminism.6. Smoking - it should be pointed out that smoking is as much a right-wing issue as a liberal concern (it insults fundamentalist Protestant aesthetics). There's no denying that a lot of smoking takes place in this film. It was made when the preliminary studies on the dangers of smoking were just coming out and their veracity contested by the tobacco companies, and after a long tradition of heavy smoking in the cinema. The smoking behavior of the characters is just one of the things one tolerates if one wants to see a good film of the era.7. It is suggested that the animals - especially the elephants - were mistreated during the film and killed off afterwards. There's no evidence to suggest this, reports that the actors themselves were involved in the capture of the animals are counterfactual evidence against this charge (what you see is largely what actually happened), and it is known that the baby elephants died four decades later of natural causes in zoos.Now onto the film itself The acting is largely insufficient (as plagued most Hawks films of the '60s). It is episodic. The plot, such as it is, meanders.

When people say the plot to this is predictable, I say fine, the ending is, but the journey there sure isn't. For the time and age this movie is very refreshing and it's almost amazing how being one of the first to fall in the category of chick flicks it still isn't one, because1. It's not clichéd in any way. 2. Most of it is comedy, focusing little on the romance and delving more into comical situations and mix-ups. 3. The bit that is romance is sweet and nice without overdoing it, playing off a real situation, not a fairy tale one.I guess this seems paradoxical but this movie's romance department is quite realistic. I appreciated the ending a lot, no kiss (though it wouldn't have hurt )) no mushy declaration, no ostentatious proposal, just a nice pun well-played out and charmingly unforgettable. I give this movie 9 out of 10 because I didn't like the wedding sequence. I guess that was the only gag that didn't make it the perfect afternoon movie. Other than that you should all go and see this classic. Plus, Clark Gable is way sexier here than in Gone with the Wind.
