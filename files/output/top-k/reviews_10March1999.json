Christina Ricci gives one of her best performances to date as DeDee Truitt, the 16-year-old who is full of herself and thinks of all others as losers (only those who are nice).Don Roos, who both wrote and directed this film gave a valiant effort only to see his film lose its focus (everyone eventually skipping off to Canada for no apparent reason) after having a powerful and interesting first half hour. This film is unabashed in its truthful display of people and how others can step in and ruin everything for them. It just happens that the catalyst for all events to come is when DeDee decides she no longer feels right living with her mother in Louisiana, so she decides to go move in with much older half-brother (Martin Donovan) who just happens to be gay. DeDee eventually steals his boyfriend and takes his whole livelihood with her, also taking the film downward from here.Some of the most interesting casting choices were made for this film, all dull in their own manner and each having nothing to take anything away from Ricci. Many have complimented Lisa Kudrow on a wonderful performance - I think this comes after so many have seen her so often as a simple blond, the likes of Friends. She really offers no more to this film than simple one-liners that had me groaning at each mention. Ivan Sergei (Matt) could use a little more experience before trying to step into a role such as this, he seemed lost throughout the film. Johnny Galecki (Jason) made me think of Roseanne each time he was on screen and Lyle Lovett (Sheriff Carl Tippett) should most definitely stick to singing.If only this film could have stayed on the course of its first half-hour, then we would have had something special here.

Despite the ego-tripping arrogance that Vincent Gallo loves to flaunt in print, his film is sometimes compelling, occasionally brilliant, and almost always watchable.  Following the story of Billy Brown, a small timer who has just been released from prison, Buffalo '66 seems initially burdened by some troublesome cliches, but it nicely evolves into a provocative character study.  Gallo's ace is Christina Ricci, who delivers one of the year's finest performances as the tap dancer who agrees to pose as Billy's wife for the sake of impressing his parents (who apparently don't know that their son has been behind bars).  The lengthy scene at Billy's house did not entirely work for me -- I just did not care for Anjelica Huston's portrayal as Billy's neglectful mother, although I did like Ben Gazzara as the father. Gallo fortunately sidesteps the expected ending even as the audience is led to believe that is right where he is headed.  This aspect of the film, along with the performances of Gallo and Ricci and the overall directorial texture and look of Bufflao '66, allow me to recommend it.

Usually I try not to write or think about a film right after I have seen it.  However, I am too overwhelmed to prevent myself from writing.  I had been waiting over a year to see a film like the `Fetsen' that would both demonstrate superb craftsmanship and be able to move me personally at the same time.  The combination of the two in a film is without a doubt the product of brilliant storytelling.  I would, therefore, like to start by congratulating the storyteller Vinterberg before going on with my eulogies.As for why I liked the `Festen' so much there is no better place to start from than Dogme 95.  I must confess, though I loved Lars Von Trier's `The Kingdome', that I thought Dogme 95 would be nothing more than a fruitless publicity stunt.  Of course I have been proven wrong.  For one thing reading the comments on IMDB it is apparent that viewers, whether they liked the `Festen' or not, whether they are interested in film as art form or not and whether they are aware of what Dogme 95 is or not, have all commented extensively on the cinematography, the camera and the directing.  I believe that this is an important achievement.  All the expensive technology that has been used in mainstream cinema within the last few years have made viewers forget that there are actually people behind the cameras who are making decisions.  This supposedly is good directing, because it carries the viewer into the universe in which the film is taking place.  But carried to an extreme it homogenizes films to an extent where the viewer watches a ship sink with the same emotions as he\/she watches cows fly in a tornado.None however, despite the colossal events that they depict, can achieve the explosiveness with which the `Festen' turns a simple family gathering into a crisis of catastrophic proportions.  This is mainly due to the brilliant use of Dogme 95 that, among other things, requires that camera movements be restricted to those that can be achieved with a handheld camera, and, only natural light and locations be used.  I believe that these are only principles and whatever individual directors achieve with them solely depend on their respective talents.  It is the same thing with mainstream Hollywood cinema, though there is a widely used form of narration, only Steven Spielberg and a handful of other directors are really good at it.  As such one must look at how Vinterberg has used the principles of Dogme 95 to produce the work of superb storytelling that the `Festen' is.Without a doubt the use of natural light only has worked to the advantage of the film by helping convey the atmosphere required by each scene.  The film starts off in daylight as all the family members arrive at the family run hotel to celebrate their father's sixtieth birthday.  The bright sunlight is therefore good to convey the idea that the family is actually attending what they believe will be a celebration.  However, as the story unfolds and dark secrets of the family are unraveled, the light also changes. Outside shots give way to darker interior shots.  Sharp images shot in daylight give way to darker and grainy images.The use of handheld camera, however, is perhaps the most important element in conveying the general atmosphere of the film.  The constant trembling and sharp movements of the camera in closed claustrophobic environments create the uneasy feeling that there is something constantly threatening to explode.  I could think of no better way to shoot a film about a family that reveals its darkest secrets throughout the gathering.  When the secrets in the `Festen' are eventually revealed unleashing anger and hatred, the explosive moments the viewers had anticipated, the fast camera movements only serve to enhance the violence of each scene.  Another director, though not related to Dogme 95, I admire for his use of constant camera movements in closed environments to generate the same feeling is Martin Scorcese (especially in Mean Streets).  This quality, among other things, has made Martin Scorcese one of my favorite directors of all times.In addition to brilliant directing, I thought that the `Fetsen' had a superb cast of very talented actors.  My only regret has been the fact that I do not understand Danish and could therefore not enjoy their performance as much as I would have wanted to.  But the rhythm and emotion in which the actors delivered their lines is powerful enough to transcend any language barrier.   The screenplay is brilliant.  It could have been shot by the worst Hollywood director and still have become a decent film.  I do not want to give the plot away.  The only thing I will, therefore, say is that the character development is very good, and, the plot, the pace at which it unravels and each family member reveals or changes his\/her position, makes the story fall together exactly as it should have.One of Dogme 95's purposes is to bring the viewer closer to the story and the characters, if this is the case I believe that that the `Festen' has achieved just that.  Ironically, though Dogme 95 also intends to undermine the role of the director as auteur it has achieved just the opposite.  But I believe that this is a good and refreshing thing when most other upcoming filmmakers do not seem as concerned as their predecessors had been\/still are with film as art form.

He may be a competent director, but he is no master of character or originality, favouring instead the kind of technical accomplishment or macho nonsense (and, let's face it, his female characters are males in all but name) that appeals to young, male Americans. It leaves me cold, and it makes me mad, when he, and his fans, try to convince me otherwise.

Marie, Sally's best friend (Carrie Fisher)  is always looking for a man for everybody including herself with her very own personal box of names and addresses; Bruno Kirby (City Slickers)  as Jess,  thinks that a woman who has a great personality cannot be pretty, is Harry's best friend.

This film speaks Hollywood, shows Hollywood, cries Hollywood and dies Hollywood. Billy Wilder tried harder than any of his other film while making this one and it sure shows.The story of the aging film star that still lives in the past was something like a tribute to an era that even in the 50's had long lost its luster. Gloria Swanson in the best role of her career plays Norma Desmond, the silent screen star who is in the process of writing a script for a film to be directed by Cecil B DeMille, or at least she believes so. Norma entails the help of a younger man named Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), who in a bit of desparation of his own, decides to alter her script for her in return for money and a place to live.The haunting mansion that Desmond lives in with only her butler Max (Erich von Stronheim) shows only pictures of her, has a screen onto which her films are shown to her weekly and plays host to other former silent film stars (notably Buster Keaton in a surprise cameo), is a reminder of how time passed Norma by. Norma tries, though in vain to make Joe love her as she loves him. She even goes through the trouble of having a small orchestra play all night on New Year's Eve just for the two of them. When Joe asks when all of the other people are going to arrive, Norma responds this is a special evening, this is our evening. From here on we see to what lengths Norma will go to show Joe how much she loves him, regardless of the fact that he does not love her.Joe is eventually approached by a script reader, Betty, (Nancy Olsen) that finds some potential in one of his older scripts and offers to work with him to bring it up to par. The only problem is the close grip that Norma has around him. Joe knows that he can only sneak away at night since Norma doesn't want him to be away from her for any amount of time.

This movie is so boring and talkative that I almost fell asleep the second time I watched it, there is at least a chunk of thirty minutes of not seeing Godzilla during the middle of the movie! All you see of this Godzilla is mostly his feet and tail, other than that, this Godzilla looks like a cross between Stripe from Gremlins, an alien from Aliens, and the tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park and has the head of Mufasa from the Lion King. The thing died from twelve missiles to his chest, something the Japanese Godzilla would have never felt. This Godzilla doesn't have his famous radioactive breath, but some fire burp he only did twice during the movie.

This type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why FG actually won the Oscars!!! 1) The title Forrest Gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about FG as it first seems for the average viewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than FG. 2) FG is laughing at us as we laugh at him. We see him as abnormal, but when Forrest tries to understand us he finds out that normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. This is clearly shown with the short clips of political and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. This helps to prove FG case against normal people. 3) The movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time a viewer watches it they get a different version of what Forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature as a whole. Only Forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society. Forrest can't understand why normal people do this, as for me personally I agree with Forrest on this issue. 4) While Forrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but because some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. Yet it was the viewers who were silly as they see things through Forrest's eyes not their own. Equally the viewer misses many of the important aspects of the movies' message because they fail to go into Forrest's world and explore.Misinterpretation that the viewer makes 1) The running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking scenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he\/she cannot think broadly. This scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever people because they seem to be doing something special. What Forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as every else. But we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) When Forrest is speaking at a rally against Vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without really understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) Jenny only realises that Forrest is the right person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character.The Movie also shows how normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. Forrest does not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal.

My view is that wars are a form of killing of the poor, the lower middle class,  people get killed because there were no other jobs available to them except to join the military. It is also a form of making money, selling armaments  and the struggle for power. I might be wrong in that! But that is my opinion.When this movie came out I was in law school and I was fighting my own war at school as law school is much similar to a military regime. I was a basket case!  This movie put terror in my head!  I was terrified.  I said that I would never watch a war movie again in my life!  But I have overruled that principle.  I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen,  had made a mistake that he admits in his letters to his grandmother.  I kept asking myself why is this kid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of Stone's movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this movie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye on things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not mistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was coming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world!  When Stone was at Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to!  Oh, God!  Bless his soul!  He believed innocently that he could serve his country. Viet Nam changed a naive innocent recruit who went to war, and allowed him to see the ambiguity of the war.  The platoon started fighting between itself and killing innocent civilians, because the two sergeants could not get along. This conflict of choice turns the young recruit into a man that we now know as one the best writers, directors,  producers of our days.  As Chris, Stone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only child and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he feels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels Chris' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is always a price to pay for being independent!  That is clear in Platoon.I could never come up with stuff that Stone does.

I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen,  had made a mistake that he admits in his letters to his grandmother.  I kept asking myself why is this kid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of Stone's movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this movie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye on things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not mistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was coming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world!  When Stone was at Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to!

As Chris, Stone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only child and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he feels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels Chris' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is always a price to pay for being independent!

This is the movie you take  your BF to when you're about to dump him, so he realizes there are more evil people than you in the world. I went to this movie with both high hopes and dread. I'd read some reviews that had  slammed it, I'm a big fan of 1988's Dangerous Liaisons, plus I  read and liked the book (for a Lit class, OK), but my friends had all raved about the movie. It wasn't as good as I'd hoped,  but it was a hell of a lot better than I'd expected! The updating is carried off very well, and it's both genuinely funny  and dramatic. The script is a bitchy riot, at least in the funny  bits. The serious parts are less convincingly scripted. There  are some awkward shifts between black humour and melodrama, as  the consequences of the main characters toying with people's  lives eventually catches up with them. It's not as good a movie  as Dangerous Liaisons, and if you haven't seen DL yet, I'd  recommend seeing CI first, or you might not get as much out of it. But it's a risk-taking movie that sees most of its brave  choices pan out. Most, not all. While Manhattan high society is definitely the equivalent of ancien regime France, and teens can be very manipulative, CI doesn't have the dramatic weight of the  original. The characters are so young it's hard to believe  they're making life-or-death choices, and the social pressures  aren't the same. Back in the 18th C women had to appear chaste  or lose everything, while now Monica brags about oral sex on TV.The switch especially hobbles SMG's role as Kathryn Merteuil.  Glenn Close's Merteuil has a great speech about playing games while maintaining outward respectability, and comes across as a twisted early feminist. When Kathryn has a similar speech, it doesn't work, b\/c her hard-earned good girl rep seems more like  a choice than a social necessity. The double standard of men as studs and women as sluts still applies today, but Kathryn's  justification is unconvincing, b\/c we don't see what really drives her to conceal her true nature. SMG is great in the beginning as the ultimate insincere bitch goddess, but she loses  momentum as the film goes on b\/c the script doesn't let the  character grow, so we never see what's underneath the controlled  facade and vicious quips. Despite the 2D role, SMG is spirited  and believable as a self-centred manipulator, but she falls flat in 2 key scenes w\/Phillippe near the end, exuding the same old  bitchy spite instead of the real menace needed to make the plot  twists plausible. In contrast, both Phillippe & Witherspoon  start out shaky & improve dramatically. At first Annette is   smug, self-righteous good girl but she develops into a strong, independent-minded, intelligent young woman whose goodness comes  not from her virginity but from her integrity and compassion.   When Sebastian convinces her her scruples are wrong, she gives into him with a wholehearted honesty seen in no other character.My only complaint is that the mind games he plays on  her to get her to this point end far too quickly, as if the writer is in a hurry to get on with the plot & is missing a  golden opportunity. But still, the Annette\/Sebastian romance is compelling, due also in part to Phillippe. RP has the toughest role in the film he has to start out as a charming amoral  psychopath & gradually evolve into a man destroyed by the  conflict btwn love and his ego. He pulls it off. Never having  thought of RP as more than eye candy (can you blame me after  54?) I was shocked. He starts out shaky, giving a mannered John  Malkovich impression, but soon makes the part his own building from cocky, malicious,love-to-hate-him stunts to a young man  enraptured by love. Near the climax he is believably despairing  & confused, unfortunately more so than the lines (RP & RW pull off the big brushoff scene on sheer intensity, b\/c they're given little to work with by the script. The dialogue in this scene doesn't hold a candle to the original) He can't match Malkovich  for dramatic power, but he does a hell of a lot better than any 23-yr-old teen heartthrob w\/no serious movies under his belt has  a right  to do. The 4th star, Selma Blair, did little for me.  The character was a cartoon, more clueless than innocent, & her  slapstick bits didn't mesh well w\/the more sophisticated humour  of the other character. I found the very ending of the movie kind of unsatisfying, although I can't put my finger on why. It  just didn't have the dramatic impact it needed.
