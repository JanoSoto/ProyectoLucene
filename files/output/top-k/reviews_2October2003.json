[{"date":"2 October 2003","score":"","review":" This is NOT your average, mindless slasher flick. Scream a real psychological breakthrough in the genre of slasher movies.This movie demonstrates a most excellent advancement in the genre of slasher flicks. Let me begin by saying this is NOT a flick; a flick being a fluffy little piece of nothing designed to make money and nothing more, OR a movie which is so low budget (or the acting is so bad) that it can't do anything but make you laugh, regardless of the subject matter. This is a quality production. The direction was wonderful and the acting was believable. The key to this movie, in my opinion, is three-fold.(1) The characters seem to realize they are in a horror movie. They quote movies, site movies and refer to movies all throughout the dialog. This, to me, adds to this production, and establishes it as an homage to the horror genre in general. This is a serious parody; not meant to be amusing, but rather, thought-provoking. Randy points out to his friends (and the audience) all the basic rules of surviving a horror movie, as if he knows the now-famous quote by John Lennon that Nothing is Real.Randy's rules for Surviving a Horror Movie.1. You can never have sex.2. You can neither drink nor do drugs. It's a sin; an extension of Rule #1.3. Never EVER under any circumstances say, I'll be right back, because you won't be back. You'll be dead.(2) The citing of actual movies and events by the characters lends a total reality to this production that lacks in others where they actually make UP movies to site and critique rather than being bold enough to work real movies into the script. (You can only hear that Richard Gere\/gerbil story so many times before you start to believe it. Tatum) Perhaps they are afraid of being accused of endorsing certain movies, while slighting other directors'\/actors' work.Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this movie grabs the bull by the horns and makes you believe the characters are real. You have the uncanny feeling that you are watching actual live footage of these people, rather than characters on a screen, that's how realistically these characters are portrayed.(3) The characters are SENTIENT. They realize there are consequences. They aren't mindless victims\/killers. In a very poignant scene, the killer asks of the victim, Did you really call the police? My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me! in a tear-filled, pathetically whiny voice. It lends to the scene a certain reality that it would have otherwise lacked. The whole movie is blessed with these reality checks, helping to make it more and more believable.Neve Campbell is completely believable; her character (Sidney Prescott) seems real and is so beautifully portrayed by Ms. Campbell that she has fully established her gift as a thespian. I do sincerely hope that she is not type-cast in horror movies for the duration of her career. Her talents could well be used in any leading role, in any genre. Her list of credits is already quite impressive, all things considered.Her character is not one of those horror movie heroines who falls down while running from the killer, who can't keep her head straight in a real crisis, or who proves inept and incapable of fending off an attacker. Her character is brave, and strong, and capable. I LOVE that!!The character development was so rich and deep, further lending credibility and reality to this production. Above the feeling of watching live footage, you feel as if you personally know the characters and care about what happens to them. This is key in ANY good movie.Henry Winkler was amazing in his role as the principal of Woodsboro high school. This is the first serious role in which I have admired his abilities. I hope it is not the last. He demonstrated a quality in this movie that I have never before seen in his performances. Even Wes Craven makes an appearance as Fred the Janitor in Winkler's most poignant scenes.As this story unfolds, you will be blown away. This is one of the best movies of the genre of slasher, and also rates with The Game, Fallen, Psycho, and a much later movie, Identity, in the psychological thriller Hall of Fame.A most excellent movie; totally awe-inspiring soundtrack that works with the movie SO WELL. It is endearing to see a director take so much care with every little detail of a work; so much so that this is a true work of art. It is believable, watchable (if from behind a pillow, your half-closed hands, or your knees), and downright SCARY. Truly, I find those movies which tap into the category of that which could actually happen to be the scariest. This is definitely one of those movies. I have the whole trilogy right next to Halloween, Halloween 2, and Halloween H20 in my collection. I honestly think this movie tops Halloween, if only by a small bit.The twists are so amazing they will leave you sitting there with your mouth wide open.It gets a full 8.89\/10 from...the Fiend .

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"2 October 2003","score":"80 out of 112 people found the following review useful","review":" Once Upon a Time in America is probably the most difficult film I have ever encountered in terms of completing an overall accurate cinematic criticism. This movie just grows in myth and debate as the years come and go. Co-writer\/director Sergio Leone (who became an international success with A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in the late-1960s) could not really figure out what to do with the complicated novel Hoods when adapted to the silver screen. He struggled through with writes, re-writes and several versions of this production. Every version seemingly has more questions than the one before. There are six screenwriters credited. In the end the final product (the very long running 229-minute version) is one of those films that cannot really be talked about. If you try to talk about this production with someone unfamiliar with it, you will leave them dumb-founded and completely confused. Elements of time, situations, heart of the story and characterization get mixed up into a long and winding road of a movie that is extremely deep and definitely complicated. An elderly Jewish man in the 1960s (Robert DeNiro with heavy makeup) comes back to his old New York neighborhood and goes on a quiet and sad journey of remembrance and personal loss. Flashbacks to the early-1920s start quickly as we see a young group of Jewish adolescents in New York (Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, Adrian Curran and Brian Bloom among them) run around town and take advantage of hard-core criminal syndicates and dim-witted beat police officers. The group is wise beyond their years. They have street-smarts that put them into a high class of law-breakers. Early problems develop and brutal multiple murders take place by Tiler. He is sent to prison for the better part of the 1920s and returns in the 1930s in the form of Robert DeNiro. The other youngsters have grown up to become James Woods (in his first legitimate screen role), William Forsythe and James Hayden. DeNiro's reunion comes and goes like a lightning strike and the group gets back to old crime basics. By this time Prohibition is a way of life for the gangsters of major U.S. metropolitan areas and the quartet takes full advantage of that opportunity to run wild around the city and create immense profits for themselves. Killing men in their way and even at times raping women in their path becomes a norm as the production advances. Other characters leave almost as fast as they appear. Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams and Danny Aiello make such short runs that if you are not paying attention closely you might miss them. The women make more pronounced impressions. Youngster Jennifer Connelly grows to become Elizabeth McGovern (DeNiro's childhood love who has aspirations of acting and singing professionally) and Woods finds companionship with the ultra-erotic and smart-mouthed Tuesday Weld (doing her best work by a mile). As the movie continues, DeNiro and Weld develop a bond of hate that turns into mutual respect and eventually they even become the oddest of friends. Woods and DeNiro have a mutual unspoken brotherly love that translates into one of the most important relationships in the history of the movies (DeNiro and Al Pacino would later share a similar bond in the vastly under-rated Heat some 11 years later). As all this happens though we begin to wonder if all we are seeing is the true reality. A dream-like beginning (which supposedly shows the fates of the four criminals) does not always fit with an amazingly strange final 30 minutes that seems to defy convention, time constraints for the characters and major cinematic screen-writing principles. Symbolism that has always been prevalent in the Italian cinema also comes into play here and these symbols may indeed hold the true answers to the mysteries within. And then again, maybe not. Once Upon a Time in America was Sergio Leone's final film and it grows in myth and legend due to that fact. Much like similar movies like Giant (James Dean's final performance) and Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick's hypnotic final production), this movie just seems to go into a higher stratosphere of Hollywood that totally ignores the typical norms that are always in association with other big-name movie products. James Hayden even died of an apparent drug overdose shortly after this film was initially released while performing on Broadway. And thus the legends grow and multiply. Overall in the end I do believe that Once Upon a Time in America is arguably the finest movie of the 1980s. It is definitely a unique production that stands near the paramount of a decade that was mired in stupid comedies, teen flicks and endless horror movie installments. DeNiro is truly a revelation once again here and he dominates most in a production of seemingly endless wonderful performances. The movie is one of those that should be studied and analyzed over and over by those who really want to get to the root of cinematic history and development. Much like its running time, the excellence of Once Upon a Time in America is nearly immeasurable. 5 stars out of 5.

I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing... but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen. That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes. Just take a look at the similarities... Fight Club The Narrator (hereinafter Jack) feels depressed and alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be. Calvin and Hobbes Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes his friend and companion Hobbes. Fight Club When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else looks at Tyler, they see Jack. Calvin and Hobbes When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy. Fight Club Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this desire in Jack himself. Calvin and Hobbes Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her. Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same desire himself, if only to himself. Fight Club Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the job he did as a parent.Calvin and Hobbes Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly in the polls. Fight Club While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss, whom he does not like. Calvin and Hobbes While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like. Fight Club When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around him things are serene. Calvin and Hobbes When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and do what they felt was right.

Some of the best of all comedies are so simply because they treat their characters with such loving affection - from works of comedy such as Planes, Trains and Automobiles to more dark and brooding comedies like Fargo. Without love of characters there is a lack of respect, a film goes nowhere and an audience senses both and disregards it. A film like American Pie may not be the best of all films but I laughed, not so much at the gags but rather because the characters taking part in the gags seemed pretty darn infectious and sweet. Beneath the crudeness there's a heart - you just may have to dig through some waste to get there. The film lacks the honesty and realism of teenagers that made John Hughes' 80s films so appealing to audiences - this is more or less a routine sex-and-prom teen comedy - but, like I said, the characters make up for this. It's about four graduating teenagers - Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) - who make a pact to have sex by prom night. Bring the whole family to this one - you'll have a ball! A pretty immature and borderline basic plot we have that is put to pretty good use through some crazy - though immature - antics. The title of the film is more than just a figure of speech.

However EON productions were eventually able to begin work on the 17th official Bond film, and GoldenEye exploded onto the big screen in 1995, six years after the release of Licence to Kill. Happily the wait was worth it, because GoldenEye is one of the best Bond films, featuring a satisfying mix of great action and memorable characters. It was a huge hit, reinventing Bond for the 90s and helping to ensure that the franchise would continue into the 21st Century.The film succeeds in part because it feels a bit like a Bond greatest hits, with such OO7 trademarks as the Aston Martin, beautiful women and big action set-pieces all playing a prominent role. Martin Campbell proves himself to be a worthy Bond director, orchestrating the impressive action scenes with great flair, particularly a memorable tank chase through St Petersburg. However, GoldenEye (named after Ian Fleming's home in the Caribbean) also acknowledges the fact that times had changed since OO7's Cold War heyday. Bond finds himself travelling to a newly capitalist Russia, and he also has to deal for the first time with a female M, played wonderfully by Judi Dench, who makes no bones about calling OO7 a sexist, misogynous dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War, although underneath she already has a sneaking affection for him. There is also a feisty new Miss Moneypenny for Bond to contend with, Samantha Bond replacing Caroline Bliss in the role and making it quite plain that her Moneypenny will be no pushover for OO7. Q, however, is still played by the ageing but sprightly Desmond Llewelyn, and although he is only in one short scene it is a good one, providing another link to Bond's past.Unlike many Bond films, GoldenEye has quite a good plot. It certainly helps that the chief villain is a fellow OO agent, who was once a close friend of Bond's. This set-up adds real spice to the scenes between Bond and Trevelyan, for in OO7's eyes Trevelyan has committed the ultimate sin of betraying both his country and his friend, giving the film a serious edge. Indeed, one of the most welcome features of the film is its lack of schoolboy humour, which the producers might have been tempted to include after the dark Licence to Kill's poor Box Office showing; thankfully they resisted the temptation, and GoldenEye is much the stronger for it. Another plus is the strength of many of the principle characters. Izabella Scorupco is one of the very best Bond girls, proving herself to be a good actress as well as a beautiful one, and her character fits in well with the serious, modern tone of the film by being both quite a realistic character and a skilled computer programmer. Sean Bean is good as Trevelyan, even if his rather forced upper-class accent prevents him from being one of the great villains. Still, he is menacing and his final showdown with Bond is gripping and effective. Stealing the show is Famke Janssen, who is gloriously OTT as the sex-mad henchwoman Xenia Onatopp. Onatopp kills men by crushing them with her legs, and she makes for a classic Bond femme fatale.Then of course there is Pierce Brosnan, who makes a strong debut as OO7. Brosnan was of course invited to become Bond a decade earlier, before his commitments to Remington Steele prevented him from taking the part. Now the Walther PPK was finally his, and he makes the most of it with a performance that nicely blends toughness with humour, and also traces of humanity. In certain scenes Brosnan does a very nice job of portraying the essential loneliness of OO7, and also his fierce loyalty to his country.  In doing so he maintains the welcome seriousness that Dalton brought to the role, but he also comes across as more relaxed and humorous than Dalton, making his Bond a more rounded character in the style of Sean Connery. Arguably, it is the most impressive debut performance of any Bond actor.Naturally, GoldenEye is not perfect. It is a bit too long, and I found Alan Cumming's Boris a rather irritating character, although his eventual comeuppance was very satisfying. Robbie Coltrane's entertaining cameo as a former KGB agent could also have been longer, and I am not a fan of Tina Turner's dreary theme song. These, however, are minor quibbles. GoldenEye is a very entertaining and action-packed film, which captures the essence of Bond and has some real substance too in its plot and characterisation. I would rank it with From Russia with Love, For Your Eyes Only and Licence to Kill as one of the top Bond films, and subsequent Brosnan outings have not yet bettered it.

She's the woman Paul truly lusts after.   Each women stars in one of his movies and you can tell which on he thinks is a hero and which is a villain.  This gives Paul a flawed dimension and these women bring out the two faces of this talented man.Overall CQ is a tad vague.  I liked it that way; something tells me if I knew what Coppola was truly trying to say it would be quite a letdown. Thankfully I will take my interpretation and leave it at that.I also loved the B-picture itself.  It was campy and silly.  Like Austin Powers without the laughs, and tons more style.  Lindvall was the perfect choice for Dragonfly because she looks like a Model in the Sixties.  Like a Breck girl from the 60's.Plus, Billy Zane's (Titanic) small roll as Mr. E, is so goofy and yet so suave you can't help but be pulled in.CQ is not for everyone and a nominal understanding of the creative process of film will enhance it.

I mean if you took one look at the time and energy exerted on one motion picture you'd probably scream.  Sure some movies deserve the time spent on them.  Nobody is going to begrudge the creative team behind 2001 A SPACE ODYESSY or CITIZEN KANE. But what about the creative team behind HOWARD THE DUCK.  Did not talented people put just as much time and energy into that film?   CG is a film about the creative process thru the director working on a film just a stupid and banal as HOWARD THE DUCK.It tells the story of a young and talented film editor named Paul (Jeremey Davies, Spanking the Monkey) and his short stint as director on a B grade science fiction film in 1969.  The film about a secret agent named Dragonfly (Anglea Lindvall, New York Stories).  It's Moonraker meets Charles Angels. This film is directed by a creative visionary named Andrezej (Gérard Depardieu, The Closet).  After months of editing the end still needs to be reworked, and Andrezej has been thrown off the picture because his producer (Giancarlo Giannini, Hannibal) he taking for to long to finish.Andrezej is replaced by a snotty kid named Felix DeMarco (Jason Schwartzman, Rushmore), he's the kind of guy who doesn't deserve to be where he is and everybody knows it.   When tragedy strikes the new director.  Paul is called in to finish the picture.First time director Roman Coppola, has crafted a disjointed but still overly satisfying film.  Making movies is a game of luck and CQ (The Morse Code phrase for Seek You) has some real moments of brilliance. It's about the lengths money men will go to make a picture, it's about compromise, and it's also about the creative quest to make an audience happy all while keeping yourself from going crazy.Jeremy Davies is one of the most underused actor's in Hollywood.  He does so well with each and every performance, even if the films suck (See Million Dollar Hotel, for example).  His Paul is both nervous and yet calculated. He hides in the shadows only to jump out and surprise you.  Like any number of craftsman and artisans he's the real talent and he props up those around him.I loved how Coppola, counterpoints the silly B movie with Paul's other black and white art film.  Paul is making this drippy and disjointed film at his house.  It's this surreal black and white film that features disjointed takes, and exists for arts sake more than anything else.  Of course it's silly and pretentious, but in the end it's all about creating your own film, and moving on with your life.

I decided to view it and remain neutral and just let the film play out without having read the bad reviews beforehand. Story is set in Chantilly, France in 1671 and a broke nobleman named Prince de Conde (Julian Glover) has decided to throw a 3 day feast for Louis XIV (Julian Sands) and all of his royal friends with the hope that if he is impressed enough he will commission the Prince to General as war looms with Holland. Conde has put the 3 day feast and all of the entertainment in the hands of Francois Vatel (Gerard Depardieu) who can work magic when it comes to preparing feasts even though he may not have enough food. Vatel is a patient man full of loyalty and honor and ethics. At times he is forced to tell some of the royal guests No to certain extravagances and this has caught the eye of Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman) who has become the Kings new mistress and also has to repel the advances of the Marquis de Lauzun (Tim Roth).*****SPOILER ALERT*****While the King is playing cards he asks Conde to put up Vatel as part of a bet and Conde reluctantly agree's. Conde loses and Vatel is given the news that he must pack his bags and get ready to head to Versailles. Vatel is so crushed by his loyalty being ignored that he kills himself. This film was directed by Roland Joffe who had given everyone a truly horrible adaptation of The Scarlett Letter and I don't think this film is anywhere near as bad as that although several critics will say otherwise. The look of the film is very impressive and the Art Design was nominated for an Oscar. Good cinematography make this a visual delight but the story seems to be another story. I do recommend this film and I'll first tell what I liked about it. First, I though Depardieu gave a convincing performance and his loyalty was very evident in his characterization. He convincingly played a man sworn to do the best he can and asks of nothing in return. Secondly, even though a romance between Thurman and Depardieu seems very unlikely I did understand why she would admire him. How can anyone not be touched by his tenderness and morals. But I have to admit that the story could have been a lot better if more had been explained about Vatel. We watch Vatel in this film spend too much time poking his fingers in pots and tasting the food. Of course all of royalty is portrayed as spoiled snobs and it's now become cliche to show them in this light. This film caused a ruckus when it opened at Cannes because the script was rewritten by an Englishman from a French story and it was filmed in English. The bad reviews were all aimed at Joffe and I'm not sure if his career will ever be the same. This film does have some glaring flaws but I suggest to people that if they view it to do so with a fair and open mind. I do think Depardieu is good in this film and Thurman isn't bad either. I think it's worth a look.

'12 Monkeys' involves time travel and the tortured essence of a volunteer who moves in and out of different time periods, desperately trying to accomplish his mission.  Brad Pitt was simply GREAT in his role, the best acting from him that I have ever witnessed.The viewer is led through a dream-like maze of events in the past, with several episodes of flashback and\/or deja-vu.  There is anguish, high suspense, violence and pain, and Bruce Willis was in top form.Highly recommended for those who like Sci-Fi Thrillers!

The story is told through the narration of (Ewan McGregor) who plays Mark Renton cropped haired and cheeckier then a Sex Pistol this is easily his best role to date. Renton is a bad person trying to go straight and choose life but finds it very difficult with his no-hoper friends dragging him down, gormless Spud (Ewan Bremner), untrustworthy Sean Connery obsessed Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and little psycho beer monster Begbie played both intensely and hileriously by (Robert Carlyle) who just about steals the show, he's like a Scottish Joe Pesci.The soundtrack is also excellent and all in all a great movie which cost £2m to make but went on to gross nearly £50m world wide.Mark 8.5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Trainspotting is for me the best modern British film which tells the story of four so called friends from Edinburgh, Scotland enjoying the highs and suffering the lows, of heroin addiction, while indulging in petty theft, sex, booze and violence whenever they are capable of it.This is a dark and ironic take on young junkies at their anti-social worst, directed with terrific energy and style by Danny Boyle, it's a witty version of the usual documentary approach to these sort of subjects, and is excellently acted by its ensemble cast.
