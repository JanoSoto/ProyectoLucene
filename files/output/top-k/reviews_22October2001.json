To represent the honah of Savannah, she calls upon our local drunk and former golfer, as well as her former boyfriend (same guy), with the improbable name of Rannulph Junuh. Quite honestly, I enjoyed the name of this character better than the film.Well, here we go. The match is arranged for two days of 36 holes each, yet when the they finish the first 18 holes, it's dark, yet they show the next 18 holes taking place in brilliant sunshine. If you like, and\/or play golf, you'll find all sorts of things incorrect in this story. If you don't play, I doubt you'll like this melange at all.Now let's come to Bagger himself.

First of all, expect topnotch performances by the lead and supporting performers.  Robert Redford hasn't acted in a movie, since The Horse Whisperer and I was very impressed by his comeback.  He pulls off the role with the greatest ease.  James Gandolfini was great, too.  Though he played the rat, he wasn't over-the-top, and was creepy in a way that's not in-your-face.  I'm sure Gandolfini felt he was typecast.  Aside from his role as gangster Tony Soprano on The Sopranos, he also played a gangster in The Mexican and basically played the same role in the few other films he's done.  So he dropped his Italian-American New Jersey accent and took on the role of an earnest, but corrupt and egotistical prison warden.  Gandolfini is truly a fine, underrated actor and his role in this movie is proof.  I also have to give it up for Mark Ruffalo, who plays the prison bookie.  I've never seen him in other movies--at least I don't recall--and I think he's a good actor who has the tendency to become a household name with further film roles.The plot is predictable and expectedly melodramatic, but the characters are sharp and likeable.  So you feel for these people as the film goes along, and that's the tool in engaging the audience.  In fact, I was in tears at the end.  Just thinking back to the ending, I'm getting all teary-eyed.  I guess I sort of saw it coming, but when you create characters that the audience builds a good attachment to, that's a key in manipulating their emotions.  And that's what happened, in my case.  I was cheering for the prisoners at the climax.  How often do you feel sympathy for characters in prison, who are guilty of their crimes?  Even the Redford character felt guilty of his actions, which I also found interesting. The Last Castle is nothing deep or philosophical.  It contains elements of prison dramas of the past, but never wears out the cliches.  It stands on its own two feet, and proves to be a good, compelling piece of cinema.

A former film critic, Lurie has emerged in the last few years as a maker of old-fashioned good movies well made.  He impressed me last year with the political drama The Contender, and this year he brings us The Last Castle, a prison picture that overcomes some dramatic potholes to provide a solid two hours' worth of entertainment.The castle in question here is a maximum security military prison, home to the armed forces' toughest offenders.  The whole place is ruled by Col. Winter (James Gandolfini), a tinpot tyrant who delights in turning his prisoners against one another.  Make them forget they are soldiers, make them forget they are MEN, and you will win...that's Winter's philosophy. Then, a monkey wrench is thrown into the works, in the form of Gen. Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford), a much-decorated three-star general court-martialed for a battlefield infraction.  Irwin immediately sees Winter for what he is, and as his weeks in the prison wear on, he begins to realize that he is surrounded by SOLDIERS, tough, competent, and ready to fight.  All they need is a general to get behind...and a villain to rally against.The Last Castle is a character-driven piece, and is carried by the strengths of its performances.  Robert Redford takes a character who is admittedly rather sketchily written and, through sheer force of his charisma and personality, turns him into someone quirky and specific.  Irwin is more like the Sundance Kid than any character Redford has played in some time a rebel battling against a system that has arrayed insurmountable odds against him.  This time, however, Irwin is a product of the system, and he knows its rules.  Redford conveys that wisdom with a bemused grin or a mere flex of his craggy but still handsome face.  This, folks, is star power.The actors surrounding him put in equally fine work.  James Gandolfini is miles away from The Sopranos as the despotic Col. Winter, and makes him a fine villain, loathsome yet pathetic and curiously affecting at the same time.  Mark Ruffalo comfortably wears the role of the prison bookie, a cynic whose father was a Vietnam P.O.W. with Irwin, and Clifton Collins, so creepy and evil as the assassin Frankie Flowers in Traffic, turns in a drastically different turn here as a stuttering corporal who first recognizes Irwin's greatness.Lurie helms this material with assured confidence.  He gives the film a gritty, authentic look and feel, he knows how to recognize a dramatic moment and pay it off, and he handles the film's quieter scenes and its boisterous action payoffs with equal elan.  Any way you slice it, it's just good filmmaking.Though David Scarpa and Graham Yost spike their screenplay with memorable moments and fine dialogue, they shoot themselves in the foot with third-act implausibilities (you'll find yourselves asking more than once, Now how did they manage to throw THAT together?) and an abrupt finale that leaves too many unanswered questions.Still, even with these problems, The Last Castle is a solid, rousing piece of mainstream entertainment.  It's well-made, it tells a good story without insulting your intelligence or your good taste, and it showcases some fine acting by veterans and newcomers alike.  And I bet Lurie didn't even break any of his cameras.  I'm sure Dreamworks appreciates that, if nothing else.

The whole place is ruled by Col. Winter (James Gandolfini), a tinpot tyrant who delights in turning his prisoners against one another.  Make them forget they are soldiers, make them forget they are MEN, and you will win...that's Winter's philosophy. Then, a monkey wrench is thrown into the works, in the form of Gen. Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford), a much-decorated three-star general court-martialed for a battlefield infraction.  Irwin immediately sees Winter for what he is, and as his weeks in the prison wear on, he begins to realize that he is surrounded by SOLDIERS, tough, competent, and ready to fight.  All they need is a general to get behind...and a villain to rally against.The Last Castle is a character-driven piece, and is carried by the strengths of its performances.  Robert Redford takes a character who is admittedly rather sketchily written and, through sheer force of his charisma and personality, turns him into someone quirky and specific.  Irwin is more like the Sundance Kid than any character Redford has played in some time a rebel battling against a system that has arrayed insurmountable odds against him.  This time, however, Irwin is a product of the system, and he knows its rules.  Redford conveys that wisdom with a bemused grin or a mere flex of his craggy but still handsome face.  This, folks, is star power.The actors surrounding him put in equally fine work.  James Gandolfini is miles away from The Sopranos as the despotic Col. Winter, and makes him a fine villain, loathsome yet pathetic and curiously affecting at the same time.  Mark Ruffalo comfortably wears the role of the prison bookie, a cynic whose father was a Vietnam P.O.W. with Irwin, and Clifton Collins, so creepy and evil as the assassin Frankie Flowers in Traffic, turns in a drastically different turn here as a stuttering corporal who first recognizes Irwin's greatness.Lurie helms this material with assured confidence.  He gives the film a gritty, authentic look and feel, he knows how to recognize a dramatic moment and pay it off, and he handles the film's quieter scenes and its boisterous action payoffs with equal elan.  Any way you slice it, it's just good filmmaking.Though David Scarpa and Graham Yost spike their screenplay with memorable moments and fine dialogue, they shoot themselves in the foot with third-act implausibilities (you'll find yourselves asking more than once, Now how did they manage to throw THAT together?) and an abrupt finale that leaves too many unanswered questions.Still, even with these problems, The Last Castle is a solid, rousing piece of mainstream entertainment.  It's well-made, it tells a good story without insulting your intelligence or your good taste, and it showcases some fine acting by veterans and newcomers alike.  And I bet Lurie didn't even break any of his cameras.  I'm sure Dreamworks appreciates that, if nothing else.

The original Hellraiser was a so-so horror film that was veering dangerously close to sub-par territory and Hellbound was a sequel that featured an incredibly silly core for a plot when you think about it (It turns out the girl's journey to hell was nothing more than an attempt by her uncle, of all people, to get her into his bed).  But it's to my surprise that Hellraiser III is actually better.  Why is this?  Probably because it has no pretentious story pretending to tell more than there actually is.  This film is made for no other purpose than for sheer entertainment value, and for that I find it considerably more respectable.  It also has Terry Farrell in it, and she's a considerable improvement above Ashley Laurence and Claire Higgins combined in both acting ability and looks.The movie begins with Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), a down-on-her-luck reporter, trying to get her big story.  She's in a hospital one night, and a young man is admitted and he has chains embedded into various parts of his body.  The doctors try to do what they can but he literally tears apart in front of their eyes.  This, Joey believes, is the story she's been looking for.  She tracks down the person who brought the young man to the hospital, a woman named Terri, who apparently is the boyfriend of J.P. Monroe, the owner of a popular club.  It's also this same club that contains a statue of the cenobite Pinhead, whose demon form is now trapped in this condition but can be revived with blood.  Pinhead is eventually awakened and he makes a deal with Monroe, thus creating a chain of events that sets Pinhead free and out to wreak havoc on the city.There are a few things that are immediately noticable about this film when compared to the previous installments.  For one, it doesn't have that dark, pervasive atmosphere, which is good since it wouldn't fit here at all.  Another thing is that the movie has a more polished look to it, due mainly to the fact this was a big studio release.  So, on a technical level, this movie does indeed look more professional and competent than the other entries.  Of course, it takes more than just that to make Hellraiser III superior to its predecessors, and it accomplishes that because it's a fun ride and acknowledges its own lack of ultra-seriousness.It's in my opinion that series fans are being far too hard on this movie and are pretty much wrong when they consider it among the series' weakest films.  I've even heard complaints that it lacks the depth of the original, which just makes me want to laugh because the original had about as much as depth as a puddle of dog urine.  Stylish direction and weird imagery does not add up to meaningful and deep, and director Clive Barker didn't have the convictions to take his film beyond the level of a gorefest, albeit still a somewhat stylish one.  The sequel, Hellbound, was just a dreary and silly descent into a very bland-looking hell.Director Anthony Hickox chooses to play Hellraiser III as a thrill ride in one form or another and is mostly successful.  The movie begins somewhat slowly (though never boring for a moment) but builds up to a furious final half-hour that features a hell of a lot of gore, some terrific visual effects (as well as some weak ones), and a slew of new cenobites, all of which lack the dark seriousness of the previous ones and are obviously played for laughs here.  Not a bad thing, if you ask me, considering some of the past cenobites were a little unintentionally funny and a change of pace is welcome.As is usual, you can expect tons of gore from a Hellraiser film, and this one's certainly no exception.  I believe I saw the R-rated version, so that probably explains why a few scenes looked a bit trimmed and toned down.  There are still some very memorable scenes of mass slaughter, such as a nightclub massacre that results in what must have been 100 total deaths, an immense body count!  The gore here looks less grimy and repulsive, and as a result, is less disgusting and disturbing than the previous films. Terry Farrell is pretty good as the reporter who has stumbled across the biggest story of her life.  Admittedly, her good looks do mask some of her less convincing moments, but she's fairly solid for the majority of the running time.  Doug Bradley is a scene-stealer as Pinhead, who is used more extensively in this film.  Gone is the enigmatic creature and in its place is a more darkly humorous and delightfully wicked villain.  A lot of series fans complain about this rendition of Pinhead, but I enjoy it far more than his We have such sights to show you! bits from the original.  His performance as his human self is not bad, either, and it's actually a little hard to believe (in a good way) that these two very different characters are played by the same actor.Now, this is a good sequel and fun horror film, but it's by no means a great movie, which obviously means it still has flaws.  The plot stretches a bit thin at times (but there's still far more of one here than in Hellbound) and some of the effects work is a bit shoddy at times.

The movie is also never scary or particularly suspenseful and you do get the feeling that Hickox was often trying to play the film as a flat-out horror flick.But on the whole, this is much better than I could have ever expected and it's nice to be pleasantly surprised by a film that I was certain was going to be pretty weak.

The original Hellraiser was a so-so horror film that was veering dangerously close to sub-par territory and Hellbound was a sequel that featured an incredibly silly core for a plot when you think about it (It turns out the girl's journey to hell was nothing more than an attempt by her uncle, of all people, to get her into his bed).  But it's to my surprise that Hellraiser III is actually better.  Why is this?  Probably because it has no pretentious story pretending to tell more than there actually is.  This film is made for no other purpose than for sheer entertainment value, and for that I find it considerably more respectable.  It also has Terry Farrell in it, and she's a considerable improvement above Ashley Laurence and Claire Higgins combined in both acting ability and looks.The movie begins with Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell), a down-on-her-luck reporter, trying to get her big story.  She's in a hospital one night, and a young man is admitted and he has chains embedded into various parts of his body.  The doctors try to do what they can but he literally tears apart in front of their eyes.  This, Joey believes, is the story she's been looking for.  She tracks down the person who brought the young man to the hospital, a woman named Terri, who apparently is the boyfriend of J.P. Monroe, the owner of a popular club.  It's also this same club that contains a statue of the cenobite Pinhead, whose demon form is now trapped in this condition but can be revived with blood.  Pinhead is eventually awakened and he makes a deal with Monroe, thus creating a chain of events that sets Pinhead free and out to wreak havoc on the city.There are a few things that are immediately noticable about this film when compared to the previous installments.

Jackson are incredible in this film full of exploding trucks and full-on shoot outs!The script and storyline aren't (terribly) unrealistic, and funny also; the cast and acting are great and the special FX are mind-blowing!

Never will I forget my Grandad saying You´ll like this one - there are a lot of stars in it. And indeed, from that day I really loved this movie! It is funny, entertaining and above all it is clean! I have seen It´s a mad, mad world lots of times since, even a dubbed version in Germany, where I live now.

Mike Myers stars and also writes the script to the movie and as usual he does a great job. The movie has some funny scenes, but if you really want to see Austin Powers at his best than see the sequel, Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. Now, that is great. I give this movie a 6-7\/10.

This is ten thousand times better than anything Disney did, and I really like a lot of the old Disney films, so that's quite an honor. I first saw this when I was about 7 or 8, and boy, did I fall in love with it. Those who complain about the crude animation need to look a little bit closer. That's the movie's charm, and if it were animated like a Disney film, then it just wouldn't be the classic that it is. Heinz Edelmann, a little known but incredible artist, designed this film, not Peter Max, which a lot of people have a tendency to think. If I ever had a chance to meet Heinz, I think I'd be so ecstatic that I'd drop dead. Anyhow, let me get started on my review. This movie begins with a beautiful opening scene of Pepperland, an unearthly paradise located beneath the sea. That's when the Blue Meanies, lead by the Cheif Meanie and his sidekick, Max, do destroy all that is happy and good, leaving Pepperland into a barren, deathly quiet wasteland. It's now up to Old Fred to escape into a Yellow Submarine to find help--and does he ever! It's none other than the Beatles themselves!I don't want to put too many spoilers in here, so if you want to see what happens, you'll have to watch it for yourself! <=) My rating 100\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 October 2001","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  How can you not be enraptured by this film?

I have to admit that I was so enamored by `Crumb' that I find it hard to maintain an objective distance to Zwigoff's latest work -- overall I liked the movie.  In the cold light of day though, I have to admit that `Ghost World' has some definite flaws.The film tells the story of two -- initially -- cynical high school graduates, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson).  They are in a position that many in the audience will be able to relate to  while in the cloistered school world they have defined themselves through their critical attitudes to the American main stream -- mall life, fake `Sixties diner' replicas, the insincere friendliness of behind - the - counter staff and waiters (`would you like a LARGE coke with your order?'), `no shirt no shoes no service' moralists, pretentious art teachers, the subtle yet pervasive racism.  Now that they are out of high school they are forced to acknowledge almost instantly that their cynicism does not get them very far  becoming independent, getting a flat, earning money, building a relationship is virtually incompatible with their dismissive attitudes.  Unfortunately Zwigoff does not manage to come up with any compelling alternatives;  his way out seems to be withdrawal, shunning `The Gap' and listening to old blues records rather than shaking a leg to Hall & Oates -- the sort of sophistication offered with greater honesty by entirely main stream TV fare such as `That Seventies Show'.  Consequently large stretches of the movie strangely turn out to be a sort of dork porn, Zwigoff living out his fantasy of a young bird falling for an outcast record collector (Seymour, played by Steve Buscemi).Overall, an enjoyable movie, as long as you don't expect it to offer you an easy way out into a life less mundane.
