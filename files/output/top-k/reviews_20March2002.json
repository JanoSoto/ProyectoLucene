I've worn the tape out over the years, because even now that I'm a (supposed) grown up, I still get the urge to go back and watch again and again.The film is beautiful, filmed on location in Europe (Austria, I think?) with a whimsical and richly romantic air.  What I love most about this movie is that it makes the effort to flesh out the characters into three dimensional figures and to set against an (at least plausible) historical backdrop, while still maintaining a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek self-awareness--a live-action period piece that enjoys the fact that it's really a fairytale and a musical.  I've always thought that gave it just a hint of sophistication.  The movie also explores more of the complexities of the stories and the characters' motivations.  It carries us past the classic slipper moment and allows for a more complete ending, which I found more fulfilling.As for the characters themselves, I loved Cinderella, neither the modernized girl-power of Ever After (which I loved, by the way) nor the blank goody-goody-ness of the Disney classic, but a very human and lovely blend of the two--with a gorgeous voice thrown in for good measure.  Prince Edward, played flawlessly by Richard Chamberlain, gives us a hero to root for, in addition to our traditional heroine.  You don't just wait for her to be found, you cheer for each of them to find the other.  The rest of the cast is filled in with real people that the viewer comes to care for and value in the story almost as much as the main pair.  You are not left with the typical stock characters that you see so often in fairy tales.  I especially loved the Fairy Godmother, the Prince's Companion, the Chamberlain, the senile King, the Dowager queen...okay, I really love them all.  Even the dog.  )I despaired of every finding a real copy on VHS until recently.  The VHS retained a few scenes that were edited from the TV version (I assume) for time, and I have to say I think that I liked the short version better.  I thought that the it flowed more smoothly, and I found that I did not miss the musical numbers they cut.

It's definitely one my favorite horror movies and I have seen a bunch, including many zombie movies Night of the Living Dead, Dead Alive, Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead, etc. Most of these old zombie movies are so cheesy and filled with such fake, harmless gore scenes, however, that they shouldn't even be classified as real horror movies.Resident Evil is really different. I entered the theater not expecting much at all, thinking it would just be another cheesy, stupid attempt to make a video game.However, I tried to be optimistic since the movie had an R rating. All the movies I've seen up until this one seemed like they were made for teens with overprotective parents, censoring all the original violence and gore contained in the video game to avoid being bombarded by whining mommies. This one is different.. It really depicts the real dark, horrific environment of the original game series and captures the mood and feel of the game. I couldn't have imagined it any better than this.I think Anderson could have also done really great with Mortal Kombat in the past if he had just captured this sort of violence and action and tried not to dress up the video game's plot. After all, the plot and character backgrounds are only about a paragraph long in Mortal Kombat - they're not what made the game great. It was the fast paced action and brutality, cool martial arts and effects.This movie presents a very honest attempt to capture the video game without trying to dress up the storyline or the script too much. It also comes up with some great ways of presenting things in the game that would have sounded a bit cheesy had they presented them directly as they were. For example, the zombies are never referred to as zombies in the movie. Instead, they are simply referred to as infected humans who are virtually dead but still animated because their brain can still function at a very primitive level.As a horror movie, this is one of the least predictable ones I've seen and definitely the most intense. There's a feeling of suspense throughout the entire film and there are no real breaks to really relax the audience save for a minute or two of dialogue here and there. From the very beginning to the very end, trouble is happening. The gore scenes are really intense, but they are presented in a really gruesome way that none of it seems to wear off by the end of the movie (ex - by the end of Evil Dead the gore wore off to the point that it was just plain funny). There's no dumb comic relief character to provide cheesy punchlines as so many recent horror movies have started using either. The soundtrack, though a bit too heavy metal for my tastes in some areas, really worked GREAT in my opinion with the visuals.Now, don't expect this movie to win an oscar for its script and plot. After all, it is just based on a shoot-em-up video game... But that's exactly the best part of the movie it presents a video game honestly as how a movie should present one, successfully capturing the atmosphere and action that we all love in the playstation game.I have to say I enjoy brutality and action in stylish movies like this. This doesn't mean I only like these kind of movies, but they are a nice break from the more serious movies where the script is the most important aspect of the movie. I don't expect everyone to like it -  especially the squeamish or people who are into more serious movies - but this was just the type of movie I needed tonight and I really hope they make a sequel.

The other way to look at it is that this is a classic that a whole new generation can and will enjoy. It's extremely hard to find on video and hasn't been on screen in many, many years, so it's about time that a whole new crop of kids (and adults alike) get to experience what we were lucky enough to have when we were younger.The film itself has held up pretty well and doesn't seem too outdated. Kids in the screening seemed to enjoy it thoroughly and didn't really seem lost at all. While there are five extra minutes, it's hard to tell where they are for most that haven't seen the movie in a while. E.T. does a little more running this time around, with some help from newer CG techniques. Other than that, the CIA agents are now armed with walkie talkies instead of guns and the terrorist costume line has been replaced with hippie costume. Those are silly little things, though. Due to our country's newfound sensitivity, I suppose it makes sense, but also doesn't seem like it would be too offensive or scary! I mean, this is an older movie!

It also tells the story in a type of genre long thought dead and only used in Disney cartoons - a musical. This movie is colorful in every way, from the lovesick and love obsessed Christian and the courtisan\/singer Satine to the amazing costumes.  The cinematography in the movie was exquisite, my favorite use of the camera being near the beginning when you first enter the Moulin Rouge, it is used to make you feel disoriented, like Christian probably felt when he first entered the late 19th century version of Studio 54. In a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you feel all of it. The Truth - This movie is sensual, uplifting, a definite Spectacular Spectacular. The Beauty - Every thing about the movie is beautiful, from the setting and time ( late 19th century, paris france during the bohemian revolution) to the people, costumes, music...need I say more. The Freedom - You will feel free as your entranced by this story about the lovesick Christian in his attempts to free his first love, Satine, from the grips of the evil duke. The Love - You will love to watch this movie over and over again.

A much better script, with a genuine sense of drama and hopelessness.  Probably why they didn't use it.Now, I have never played the game (and that should not be a requirement. If it is, you need to hire another writer) so I cannot say if it's true to the game or not.  But then I don't really care if it does or not.  I'm interested in what sort of movie the studio produced.  Is it scary?  Can folks act?  Does it make sense?  Is the ending a standard movie cliche? Resident Evil fails on all these points.I won't bother going into the errors with their bio-toxin lab.  (If you can't figure out on your own that the lab would NOT run off the same air ducts as the rest of the facility, then you won't understand the rest of the movie's problems.  Go watch Ghosts of Mars and brace yourself for the surprise ending you'll never ever see coming.  Honest.)  The scene continuity is terrible.  Folks are surrounded by zombies with no way out, then next scene they're safely out of the way.  What happened?  How'd they get out?  Guess Paul Anderson wrote himself into a corner.  Frankly, he does that a lot.  Getting in and out of the lab appears so darn easy you have to wonder why they didn't send in the janitor to reboot the system while he's mopping the floor.The biggest hole is why the computer simply didn't TELL someone that the virus had escaped, why this is a Very Bad Thing.  But since there's an antidote, it's not really that bad, is it?  How about shutting down the facility entrances, notifying folks in charge, and then giving them a shout of the green stuff before you go killing everyone?  Must be a software error.

Would really be so difficult to not film the ending of `Guess what-it's not over yet!  Bet you didn't see THAT coming!'  Umm, yes, we did.  About an hour ago.  It's such a standard ending now you'd think they teach it to film students.Not much to see here, and very little to get excited about.  Standard pulp fare for the masses.

It's always interesting to see a serious actor paired up with a comic actor.  DeNiro and Murphy make an unlikely team, and it does create a lot of fish-out-of-water humor, but nothing we haven't seen before in the previous thousand-or-so buddy cop flicks.  The two talented actors give it their all, and I can't blame the film's mediocrity on them...but I can blame the scriptwriters.  First of all, reality TV has become such a staple of pop culture that it's no longer fascinating.  I liked the Truman Show, I laughed out loud at Ed TV, (both of those films were ahead of their time) but Showtime was released about six months too late.  I've never been a fan of reality TV in the first place, but after seeing rats devoured on Survivor and bull testicles devoured on Fear Factor, a reality show about two real-life cops on the beat doesn't sound that innovative.  One thing that kind of bothered me was I felt too much sympathy for DeNiro's character, a no-nonsense cop who's brilliant at his job and simply doesn't want to be bothered by swarms of cameramen following him after he successfully finished a drug bust.  So when the network executives approached him with the idea of this new reality show, I wasn't thinking Come on, Bobby.  Loosen up!  I was thinking Leave the guy alone.  He's just trying to do his job.  Of course, predictably, Murphy--the more dim-witted cop--ends up using his so-called street smarts and offers more help in solving the case than the overzealous DeNiro, but this is a simply a plot device.  However, I felt the climax was quite original and much more exciting than the standard shootings and car chases throughout the film. There are a few funny moments, but none that made me laugh.  I got a fair share of chuckles, though.  I wish Shatner could've gotten more screen time.  He was a hoot in Miss Congeniality and I was hoping to see another fine comic performance.  But he only has a forgettable, three-minute appearance in which he spoofs himself as a former TV cop.  All his funny gags--like Shatner sliding off the hood of the police car and falling to the ground--were given away in the previews.  And I can pretty much say that about most of the funny gags--if you've seen the previews, you've seen it all!  The film opens with about a three-minute sequence in which DeNiro preaches his thoughts on crime and punishment, and then we're supposed to laugh when they cut to the class of first-graders.  It was a great setup, but we already know the punchline!This is not an annoying, obnoxious or gross-out comedy and it is good-natured.  Aside from a good deal of PG-13 curse words, families should feel safe to take their kids to see this movie.  But the writing is dull and half-a**ed.  It seems like the script was written in an hour, without even the consideration of a rewrite.  The gags are basically sitcom material, and this movie would've been better suited for the small screen.  One thing I have to applaud though is the Johnny Cochrane cameo.  I think that was the only scene where I actually laughed.  You're better off waiting 'til Showtime hits the video shelves.

Was the alcohol necessary? Given the state of the sequel, methinks it was.Thankfully, there were enough laughs in this to make it worth the effort. Sure, the story's rubbish, but then, the story ain't the point here.Chevy Chase is his usual hapless self here, which is funny in itself (unlike many of his films, sadly - where's the SNL Chevy gone? Methinks he needs to fall down some stairs again). Rodney Dangerfield steals the show with some disgraceful one-liners. Sadly his own films milked this, and aren't as good.Bill Murray puts in a fine showing as a psychotic gardener under orders to destroy the gophers.

I was very disappointed.Let's face it 1) The people are odd and wacky and weird. 2) They are crazy 3) Crazy stuff happensAnd yet, on its own, all of this isn't funny. The story about a rather horrible father who returns to his family after 17 years because he is broke, and because he wants to prevent his still-legally-married wife from divorcing and marrying another is not typical comedy-fare. The cinema was still and quiet throughout, with just the odd chuckle every 20 minutes or so. The movie feels more like a quirky tragicomedy, but it is too removed from reality for the drama to affect the audience, and too serious to be funny. Honestly, who wants a quirky comedy about incest and rejection and traumatized people? And the fact that half the family once were prodigies and geniuses does nothing for the movie. It's simply an excuse to dress them as geeks - they never do anything clever or wacky. All of this is occassionally interrupted by a narrator, which distorts the flow of the movie even further, and in one or two places the narrator is simply used to tell people what feelings the actors are trying to express on their faces, with their expressions. Especially in one place, it's as if they were unhappy with Gene Hackman's performance and wanted to make the point so that everyone gets it.All in all, a complete disappointment, if it weren't for the soundtrack (which helps setting the mood immeasurably), the looks and costumes, and the washed out brown colours that the movie is shot in.

Thornton's performance is so good, you will want to watch this film again.  He doesn't really seem like a dangerous man rather the kind, compassionate type. Dwight Yoakam is extremely effective as the abusive boyfriend to Frank's mother.  He is funny yet menacing at the same time. Yoakam impressed me very much here.  Lucas Black as Frank, the boy who is befriended by Karl, does a very good job in his role.  John Ritter had a heartfelt role as a gay man with a good heart.  J.T. Walsh must be mentioned as well.  His role is short but he is extremely funny as one of the residents at the psychiatric hospital.  He truly was a great actor.  Robert Duvall shows up at one point as Karl's father. I like the title of this movie, the music, the part where Yoakam and his band play some country-tinged rock, Thornton's vocabulary, etc.  See this movie.  Without a doubt, a powerful, memorable film that deserves much praise and attention.  See it and you will understand why Mr. Thornton is such a genius.

But Gal's out of the game, y'see, and he says no. Repeatedly. Retired, he says. Done, he says. Trying to go legit, he says.  Don't they always try to go legit? And then the Big Boys want them to pull of One Last Heist, or some such nonsense? And so the old fart straps on his hoodlum scowl and gets to work. They never stay straight, these guys.So much of the dialog in this movie is utterly incomprehensible, at least if you're not from England. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the British speak English? The Cockney dialects are unintelligible, at least at the beginning. I suspect that once you get used to the accents, you can pick up at least some of the words, but for my money this is a movie that should have had extensive subtitles. As a point of reference, in Snatch (2001), Brad Pitt's character was an Irish gypsy who spoke a completely unrecognizable dialect - it was so muddled that even the other characters had no idea what he was saying! This movie's a lot like that, only the joke's on the audience, not the characters.It's violent, and it does have its twists, which are both usually good points in a movie of this genre. The movie received quite a bit of acclaim when it came out in the theaters because of Kingsley's performance (this ain't Ghandi, a role he perfected with an Oscar in 1982); however, I don't see his work as fine acting - I see it as overacting. He's hammy, not nuanced. People see a lot of energy, which Kingsley surely brings, and assume it to mean the guy's acting up a storm. Well, chewing scenery is acting up a storm, too - just not good acting. The rest of the cast is relatively faceless, including Amanda Redman as Gil's ex-porn-star wife (I just wanted to use the words porn star in this review somewhere!). None of them stand out above the others; Kingsley only stands out on the basis of name recognition. I'm a little amazed that this received the praise it did, particularly for Kingsley himself. It's not solid entertainment at all, and not worth the bucks to see it, although the plot does scamper along pretty well. But because of the poor enunciation (for Americans, at least), the complexities of the plot never come to light, frustrating the viewer.

Go see Resident Evil today!!! ;) ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Only this movie would make me want to write a review. This has got to be one of my all-time favorites. If I had to choose a couple movies to take to a deserted island this would be one. No matter how many times you watch it you see new things every time. The characters are mysterious. Their interaction is tense. The music, camera work, and sound effects all work together to heighten the mood. The acting of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen is riveting in its unflinching intensity. As you get caught up in the story you will find yourself hanging on every word and every mannerism. Thankfully the story is clear enough so that the flashbacks serve to add timely bits of info when needed but don't slow the pace. Every time I see this film I feel wrung out by the end. Hats off to Quentin Tarantino; this is hands-down the finest work he's done. The soundtrack is a wonderful romp through the Seventies. I strongly recommend watching this in Widescreen version with Surround sound but video tape and your T.V. speaker will still be exciting.

I saw it on sale at a supermarket and i was intrigued by the synopsis of the story at the back cover. I love this type of stories about paralel universes but i was not sure that a story like this could work properly as a serious romantic drama. Particulary one made-in-Hollywood. Basicaly i feared that this was another comercial sugar coated Jennifer Lopez-Julia Roberts comercial movie. I was wrong. I rented this movie totaly convinced that it was going to be bad, but, after the movie ended, i went back to the supermarket and i bought a copy for myself ! PASSION OF MIND was a real surprise to me. I´ve been reading plenty of bad reviews about it after i´ve seen it, and i can´t disagree more with them. I guess most people don´t realy get it´s idea and so rather than thinking about it, they decided the movie sucks. Possibly because it doesn´t follow that usual love-story comercial crap that make Hollywood´s so called romantic movies, most people don´t like it, because this PASSION OF MIND is a movie where you have to think along and you don´t have everything totaly explained all the time. But above all it´s an original movie, and a very good diferent aproach to a romantic story without making it look plastic.What stroke me first was the incredible cinematography. I never before seen New York filmed in such a beautiful way. The exterior locations looked trully beautiful and it´s a real viewing pleasure just to see a good story set against such beautiful images in the background. As for the plot, i think it´s a brilliant concept and a very inteligent way of telling a romantic story. Ok it might not be the most original one if you read a lot of sci-fi novels, but in this case it was extremely well presented, with never a dull moment despite the slow pace the story moves along. A great for story for people who like sci-fi themes and for people who don´t. Great script, good dialogue, good ending and it keeps its mistery right up untill the end ,without giving much away through out the whole film, making us stay glued to the tv set untill the movie finaly ends. (The region 2 dvd, has an incredible image and a fantastic 5.1 sound mix wich fills the room with a perfect 3d atmosphere)If you like stories about paralel realities, and you like this sort of existencial themes and hipotesis, you´re going to love this movie. As someone said in a review back here somewhere, this is a real good quantum mechanics movie, wich depicts very well some of the concepts present in those theories without complicating things for the viewer. Above all it makes us think and wonder. It´s a great movie to initiate a discussion about the theme afterwards and a very inteligent and beautiful romantic story. Pretty impressive actualy. As i said, a real good surprise. If you like originality, watch this. If you only like guns, explosions and special effects, stay away because you won´t get it. PASSION OF MIND is trully an execelent surprise.
