That person being someone who went to an all black college. I feel that film had a lot to say for that type of person and it would have been meaningful for them but having not been from that type of background it does almost nothing for me. I also have yet to see She Gotta Have It. I went to really bad and I do hope it is classic but I have not scene it so I will not judge it tell the time that I view it comes along, hopefully soon. Do the Right Thing, has a lot to say for everyone about race relations. If you think the movement is over this film shows you that there is still some things that need to be accomplished, especially in the hood. It shows that some white people will go down there make a buck and never care what kinda of job opportunities they are taking away from the black community that lives there. I feel though that it also shows that some people of color have not progressed either. Lee may have not meant for it to be there but that is what I take from. If they had maintained cooler heads at the end of the film than Radio Rahem would have lived, but because they felt the need to throw a fit over there being no black players on Sal's Pizzas's walls then they caused his death. I can see where if your black and wanted to take it from the perspective that Sal caused it by being racist that you too would be right. I feel that both sides had done wrong and that maybe the film is saying that we should come together and grow as a society.I love this film's stellar cast. It has up comers, Martin Lawerance, John Turrtoro, Spike Lee, Joie Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Nunn, and Ginocarlo Espisito. It also has a couple of old pros, Ruby Dee, doing some of her best work, and her long time husband and great actor Ossie Davis. It also has an actor who would sadly not be given much time to grow, the late great Robin Harris, I hate that he is deceased and feel that he had a triumphant career ahead of him. Spike Lee's direction is good in this and I love who he tries to show his love for his home town area. I also like Ernest Dickerson's surreal lighting and set ups through the film. The whole movie looks as if it's backgrounds could have been drawn in that is how beautiful Dickerson makes reality. Watch this to see the world through someone else's eyes, it might change your opinion about things.

I've done Marty and will do Requiem for a Heavyweight, Bang the Drum Slowly and The Days of Wine and Roses. I'd love to see the original 12 Angry Men with Bob Cummings but it doesn't seem to be available. I'd love to see a cable channel devoted to these old shows, even some non-classics if they represented early work by famous actors, directors and writers, (as so many of them did). But this will do for now.I believe that of all the famous live dramatic presentations of the 1950's, the greatest of them all was Rod Serling's Requiem for a Heavyweight, the premiere show of perhaps the best of all the anthology shows, Playhouse 90, to which Serling was a major contributor. It's the ultimate story of human dignity, (and how many stories are explicitly about that?).The locations are seedy gyms and boxing arenas, a corner bar and some streets. The only opening up between the TV and film versions is a chase scene between Maish, (Jackie Gleason) and some hoods that takes him through the streets and back alleys. The real difference is the casting, which involves several giants of show business.The underrated, (for most of his career) Jack Palance is Mountain McClintock on TV, a bumbling hulk of a fighter who is still a young man, (33), in age but ancient in any other way. He retains some cognitive ability but not much and a certain gentleness as well as a blind faith in his manager. But he's reached the end of the road and doesn't know where to go. Palance looks like his own ghost, trying to comprehend the present and oblivious of the future.Anthony Quinn, who was personal friends with a number of boxers, inherited the role, (now Mountain Rivera) for the movie. He is a great actor and he gives a great acting performance as Mountain. But it always seems to be a performance. When he's supposed to be hurt, he acts hurt. When he's supposed to be sensitive, he acts sensitive. But he doesn't seem to be the same guy in both scenes. He is a little too intelligent and philosophical in the scenes where he's not climbing out of the ring, too much like the real Quinn. He is performing Mountain Rivera. Jack Palance BECAME Mountain McClintock. It was a shock to see him in an interview on the same tape as the erudite man he actually is. He was Mountain in every minute of every scene of the TV show.Jackie Gleason, (Maish), and Mickey Rooney, (Army, the trainer), are two of the colossi of 20th century show business and it's interesting to see them work together. Except that Gleason's performance seems to be missing something, as if he really didn't understand his character, even though he must have known many people like him. Rooney comes off better. Of course he has the better lines, although some of them appear to have wound up on the cutting room floor as some of Ed Wynn's best lines from the TV show are absent. One thing I liked was that Army was obviously an old fighter himself, with the scars on his face. He was presumably Maish's meal ticket before Mountain came along, which adds something to the story.The story of Ed Wynn's performance is interesting and touching. He was a life-long comedian who punctuated his performances with silly laughter and other bits of business. His son, Keenan, was afraid that, in this live show, he was going to do that, which would have ruined anything. Ed was terribly nervous for fear of the same thing and because he'd never played drama before. His nervousness only made it more likely that he'd resort to his mannerisms. They actually rehearsed on the side with Ned Glass, who played the bartender, to take over the role if Ed broke down, which was a real possibility. Instead, he came through with flying colors in a legendary performance. The knowledge of this story is part of the legend. It's possible that Glass, (or Rooney in the film) might have been as good but the performance wouldn't have been as dramatic an achievement as what Wynn did.I like Keenan Wynn's Maish much better than Gleason's. He has a haunted, desperate look. The best Gleason could do is look dyspeptic. Kim Hunter and Julie Harris, as the employment counselors, are a wash, although Julie has more to do in the film. The real fighters employed as the washed up barflies add a lot to the atmosphere. Mountain has an awareness that he doesn't want to be one of them. (Some of them were known to have suffered from dementia). I like the tragic ending of the film better than the hopeful one of the TV show, although I prefer Maish and Army going off with the young middleweight at the end, their hopes renewed, as we see on TV. Maish's angry anti-boxing diatribe at the end of the film rings true enough for boxers but false and out of character for him.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"3 September 2006","score":"","review":" Bernardo Bertolucci... Wherever I ask anyone about this man, there is usually one answer that appears the director of THE LAST EMPEROR (1987). This film, made almost twenty years ago, is still so popular that every day there is a place in the world where it is watched. One may ask what is so special about it that a film about the last emperor of China became one of the undeniable cult movies? The answer, I think, lies primarily in Bertolucci, the director and some of the movie's powerful aspects.THE LAST EMPEROR which, on the one hand, deals with quite a difficult content being a sort of vague movie filled with flashbacks and flash-forwards, is, on the other hand, a real tribute to what Bertolucci tries to convey in cinema colors and fascism. The overdose of colors may seem an exaggeration for some viewers while fascism appears to be a wonderful insight into characters' emotional states. The movie, particularly the sequence filmed in the Forbidden City, is full of breathtakingly stunning picture of the declining imperial power of China. This makes THE LAST EMPEROR an impressive epic proportion film and the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro one of the finest found in films. Pu Yi (John Lone), the last emperor, spends his youth years in the Forbidden City where he theoretically rules, but actually plays ruling since his country is no longer the empire it used to be but a communist People's Republic of China. These scenes (actually flashbacks since the film's action starts in 1950 when Pu Yi is already a prisoner) are splendid. Let me mention, for instance, the throne of the Empress widow, Pu Yi's wedding, a sensual love scene between Pu Yi and his two women - the Forbidden City sequence is pure Bertolucci with magnificent entertainment. The rest is a contrasted moody picture and a realistic image of the cruel reality that the main character experiences after the downfall of his power. Therefore, it is a different entertainment filled with director's political evaluations. CAST The performers consist primarily of Chinese cast, some not famous internationally. Nevertheless, they are all worth attention and the performances in this movie are unquestionably good. John Lone is very appealing as the Son of Heaven, the Lord of ten thousand years, Pu Yi. He perfectly expresses the emotional states of his character, gives a balanced performance of an aging man and of someone whose fate is exceptionally brute. By his developed performance, he leads a viewer to his character's psyche and creates a unique insight into his emotions. Joan Chen is marvelous as the empress Wan Jung - a beautiful woman and a very talented Chinese actress. I think that her most unforgettable moment is the wedding night and her first kissing the young emperor. But the performance that is outstanding in the movie is the one by Peter O'Toole. Since he is the only British looking actor in the film, he does a perfect job among so different cast. His role of Reginald Johnston, the emperor's tutor, a Scotsman, is entirely worth consideration. O'Toole is a great actor, one of the very best of all time and whenever I see his name in the credits, I am certain that he will not disappoint me with anything. And that is true, without any doubt, when applied to THE LAST EMPEROR as well.CONTENT The entire story may seem sad the last emperor of China who was considered the Lord of ten thousand years, ends up as a peasant citizen of the People's Republic of China experiencing communist cruelty and even the Mao cult with its Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Yet, the action is constructed in such a way that a viewer's interest is wonderfully kept. I loved the aforementioned flashbacks and flash-forwards since this created a feeling of timeless facts. Not chronology makes the utmost importance but life treated as an integral part of a human. When we live, we escape to our memories very often and that that is the thing which constitutes our dreams and evaluations. Moreover, by showing Pu Yi's life in this way, Bertolucci went deeper into his emotional states and filled the film with associations and inner struggles. I loved the moments of Open the door! - how beautifully symbolic and how accurately emotional! CULTURAL REFERENCE There is one more factor that makes this film interesting the insight to the Chinese culture. I have never seen a movie that presents an exotic culture (exotic to me as a Pole) in such a balanced and interesting way. Among many moments that show the marvelous culture of the Far East, I loved the moment when three year-old Pu Yi appears at the imperial palace. A widowed empress is set on her throne under the black pearl and tells little boy about his future and the dead emperor who is riding dragons in heaven. Little Pu Yi's face is filled with wonderful curiosity of a child. This moment remained in my memory as particularly unforgettable. THE LAST EMPEROR is a good film. I do not consider it a masterpiece as some other people do, but I find it a highly accurate movie that is absolutely worth a look. Perhaps, you will not agree with me that the performances are that great since you may have different expectations concerning this aspect; perhaps, you will not like the Chinese story since the history of this country does not constitute your primary interests. However, you will love the number of moments filmed in the Forbidden City...I promise you that! ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2006","score":"","review":" Bernardo Bertolucci...

CULTURAL REFERENCE There is one more factor that makes this film interesting the insight to the Chinese culture. I have never seen a movie that presents an exotic culture (exotic to me as a Pole) in such a balanced and interesting way.

A widowed empress is set on her throne under the black pearl and tells little boy about his future and the dead emperor who is riding dragons in heaven. Little Pu Yi's face is filled with wonderful curiosity of a child. This moment remained in my memory as particularly unforgettable. THE LAST EMPEROR is a good film. I do not consider it a masterpiece as some other people do, but I find it a highly accurate movie that is absolutely worth a look. Perhaps, you will not agree with me that the performances are that great since you may have different expectations concerning this aspect; perhaps, you will not like the Chinese story since the history of this country does not constitute your primary interests. However, you will love the number of moments filmed in the Forbidden City...I promise you that! ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"3 September 2006","score":"","review":" Bernardo Bertolucci... Wherever I ask anyone about this man, there is usually one answer that appears the director of THE LAST EMPEROR (1987). This film, made almost twenty years ago, is still so popular that every day there is a place in the world where it is watched. One may ask what is so special about it that a film about the last emperor of China became one of the undeniable cult movies? The answer, I think, lies primarily in Bertolucci, the director and some of the movie's powerful aspects.THE LAST EMPEROR which, on the one hand, deals with quite a difficult content being a sort of vague movie filled with flashbacks and flash-forwards, is, on the other hand, a real tribute to what Bertolucci tries to convey in cinema colors and fascism. The overdose of colors may seem an exaggeration for some viewers while fascism appears to be a wonderful insight into characters' emotional states. The movie, particularly the sequence filmed in the Forbidden City, is full of breathtakingly stunning picture of the declining imperial power of China. This makes THE LAST EMPEROR an impressive epic proportion film and the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro one of the finest found in films. Pu Yi (John Lone), the last emperor, spends his youth years in the Forbidden City where he theoretically rules, but actually plays ruling since his country is no longer the empire it used to be but a communist People's Republic of China. These scenes (actually flashbacks since the film's action starts in 1950 when Pu Yi is already a prisoner) are splendid. Let me mention, for instance, the throne of the Empress widow, Pu Yi's wedding, a sensual love scene between Pu Yi and his two women - the Forbidden City sequence is pure Bertolucci with magnificent entertainment. The rest is a contrasted moody picture and a realistic image of the cruel reality that the main character experiences after the downfall of his power. Therefore, it is a different entertainment filled with director's political evaluations. CAST The performers consist primarily of Chinese cast, some not famous internationally. Nevertheless, they are all worth attention and the performances in this movie are unquestionably good. John Lone is very appealing as the Son of Heaven, the Lord of ten thousand years, Pu Yi. He perfectly expresses the emotional states of his character, gives a balanced performance of an aging man and of someone whose fate is exceptionally brute. By his developed performance, he leads a viewer to his character's psyche and creates a unique insight into his emotions. Joan Chen is marvelous as the empress Wan Jung - a beautiful woman and a very talented Chinese actress. I think that her most unforgettable moment is the wedding night and her first kissing the young emperor. But the performance that is outstanding in the movie is the one by Peter O'Toole. Since he is the only British looking actor in the film, he does a perfect job among so different cast. His role of Reginald Johnston, the emperor's tutor, a Scotsman, is entirely worth consideration. O'Toole is a great actor, one of the very best of all time and whenever I see his name in the credits, I am certain that he will not disappoint me with anything. And that is true, without any doubt, when applied to THE LAST EMPEROR as well.CONTENT The entire story may seem sad the last emperor of China who was considered the Lord of ten thousand years, ends up as a peasant citizen of the People's Republic of China experiencing communist cruelty and even the Mao cult with its Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.

The first good scene is the opening panorama shot which is more than good and one might think this is the right movie to sit through, unfortunately it falls down minute by minute. Based on a novel by Stephen King director Stanley Kubrik tries to tell the story of the writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) who takes a job in an empty hotel in winter Colorado together with his wife and son. His job is to heat the rooms because of frost damages. In the beginning (2nd scene) it is told him that a man who had the job years ago killed his wife and daughters because he couldn't stand the loneliness of the empty hotel ...Then problems occur, not only for Jack who is going mad like the man years ago, but also for Kubrick and his co-screenplay writer. They do not find a concept to translate King's novel into a good film. They take elements out of it (Jack's son has supernatural powers) that do not work in a movie even if it is two hours long. A more coherent scenario would have been to focus on Jack and his visions. This leads to the second good scene. In one of his visions Jack meets the man who has killed his family and who was a former waiter in the hotel. This is a subtle and well written horror scene and we see that Jack is now taking this man as a model of his own behavior towards his family.The third good scene is Nicholson's acting before Duval hits him with a baseball bat. This is brilliant acting in a furious monologue. We can also add the scene where he speaks to Duval in a closed room (interesting camera angle too).Generally the movie is way too long and way too boring.

If Director Ralph Bakshi wasn't even able to afford to make his animated feature...animated! He probably shouldn't even have bothered! While several of the scenes are word for word from the book, they are soullessly done. A story should have a soul, if you will, and this film lacked anything of the sort. Which is a huge part of the problem with it. The original books, on the other hand...well, they almost overflowed with the stuff. The author, the esteemed Oxford Professor, J.R.R. Tolkien, spent about twelve years of his life writing them, using a typewriter. He seamlessly spun together a beautiful fabric of a story, using his craftsmanship, his devotion and his love for his work. This brought us The Lord of the Rings. Ralph Bakshi merely took the materials he already had and just slapped them on screen with very little care. After looking through the movie, piece by piece, the two biggest mistakes that Ralph Bakshi made are definitely evident.Biggest Mistake #One He tried to do it for too little budget, $8 million. What he was able to do with that little amount is impressive, though, I will admit. On the other hand, being impressive of such a small amount of money, and actually making something that actually is impressive, in and of itself, are two different things. He definitely needed about twice the budget that he had just to get the film fully animated, and even more than that if he wanted to add a little style to the animation. Biggest Mistake #Two He tried to fit the entirety of the first two books (about 730 pages total, and in small print) into one two hour and fifteen minute film. This forced drastic cuts all throughout it, especially in the Two Towers section, also at which point he'd run out budget for animation for the most part (filming at high contrast and using rotoscoping does not make animation). He was also forced to sacrifice personality and development for most of the characters. All this led up to a sudden end, in which the narrator announced to be continued.

Both plays have a similar kind of construct to them where there is a premise and pull that has the characters where they are in their one-room setting (Match had a man visiting another older man seemingly unknowing at first tagging along with his girlfriend really seeking out if the man is his father or not), while always with realistic dialog. And the realism with Tape all has to do with the situation and the mind-games pulled by the most torn, fascinating character, Vincent (Ethan Hawke). He is payed a visit by filmmaker Jon (Robert Sean Leonard) in town for a film he has in a festival. Vincent, unlike Jon, is a nowhere man with his life, drug dealer and sometimes firefighter who decides the night before Jon's big movie opens to put him between a rock and a hard place; admitting to Vincent's first girlfriend Amy (Uma Thurman) that one night Jon had his way with her.It's not that Tape is completely without some conceits that might come with a play as opposed to one with a film. The last few minutes are almost too funny for the double-cross that is pulled on Vincent. But the limitations on such an indie as this- which looks so much so that one wonders if it was all filmed in less than a week- are not really to be pondered so much as what the strengths are. Belber's ear for how these character interact, in equal measures of being pushy, apologetic, uncomfortable, surprised, shocked, bemused and tense all goes hand in hand with having it set in such a small motel room in the middle of the night. Hawke has an underrated- or rather underseen due to its low-level indie appeal- performance here, as someone who decides to get loaded to assist himself in his arrogance in the situation; his physical presence early on is also of interest as before he slowly, sneakily unleashes his conversational intentions unto the adamantly nice and introspective Jon, he bounces around the room like a loon. Thurman, too, is excellent here in a restrained performance, but one where she shows so much in many a reaction shot.And these shots, from a film-making point of view, keep the material involving even in the more contrived moments. Linklater and his crew keep things going as if it's one of the best student films you've ever seen. The editing is always at a speed to keep up with the characters timing with their dialog and looks (which work best with Hawke), and there's even a Cassavetes style to the level of human drama with the proceedings of both substance and style mixed together. It's one of those cases where you really don't mind- and after a while notice too much- the hand-held quality where to add some spark to the bigger back and forth moments he whips the camera like one might if looking at them each as they speak. You get the tension and the emotion, but it's never as dull of expectable as a soap opera. And aside from the music in the end credits, it's all in real-time as its being seen. If it's not great it's maybe because Belber has to have some kind of kick in the story to set it off (i.e. the tape itself). But with Linklater's eye and a cast like this, it's hard to complain.

Little Nicky is the end of the line for Sandler's long string of great comedies.This is one of the most offensive comedies I have seen because of his inane body gestures, stupid jokes and miscast actors. I left the theater asking myself what could he be thinking by making this film.One of the most confusing aspects about Little Nicky was the consistency in jumping from one subject to the other without focusing on any one particular subject. Instead, Sandler recruits Harvey Keitel, Rodney Dangerfield, Allen Covert, Reese Witherspoon, Patricia Arquette and Rhys Ifans to star in this painful excuse of a film. These fine actors made the biggest mistake of their careers as they signed on to participate in Little Nicky. Little Nicky is another reason why movie studios should pay closer and much more careful attention to the films they make. Also, they should re-examine the standards for films without a plot containing substance characters en developed to its fullest potential and screenplays that seem to be written without much effort.Little Nicky revolves around the life of Nicky, the son of the devil,who must travel above ground to capture his brothers as they create havoc. While above ground, Nicky meets a beautiful girl and makes new friends, which creates difficulties for him as he tries to accomplish his mission. Little Nicky made me feel so sleepy I almost fell into a coma.There is a difference between silly comedy and stupid comedy; unfortunately, Little Nicky fails to reach the level of great comedy because all of the comedy is offensive. From the body gestures to the jokes, I felt sick watching this film. I can almost guarantee that people would not have seen Little Nicky if they knew it was a senseless comedy. This is not a trait that people will find attractive.Little Nicky lost its credibility and right to be called a comedy because of its many problems, inconsistencies and stupid comedy. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success.The only tolerable aspect of Little Nicky was the appearances of Dangerfield and Keitel because they played the most interesting characters in the movie.

This is his only horror effort of the decade and his next to last that he has done of this writing, the last one being 1992's Raising Cain. I am somewhat glad De Palma left the horror field behind as it did not really suit his visual style. I love Carrie, and Phantom of the Paridse, but see The Fury as a mess and 1973's Sisters as a travesty of wasted film. De Palma's skills are more well suited for action and dramatic suspense, not Horror suspense. This is not to say that I do not love the horror genre, believe me I do, I just find that Brian De Palma has fared much better with his action and personal stories better than the horror. Dressed to Kill, is a good movie that falls somewhere between the greatness of Carrie and the dullness of The Fury. In parts of Dressed to Kill like when Angie Dickenson finds that she may have contracted an STD and all the suspense that surrounds that and what leads up to her death are all good scenes. Some of the Kieth David stuff is intriguing but I find him not to be a very good actor and am glad he is pretty much gone from the scene now. The only good performance he ever gave was in Jaws II and look how little he does in that film. He is better as a sidekick and not a star. Nancy Allen is wonderful and hot as always. This is during the prime of her career and when she was married to De Palma and could still generate good jobs. That all ended after her turn in the Robocop series. Michael Cain is superb as always in this film. It's nice to see him as the villain for a change and not as the old British dude that turns up in every film now to give it integrity, even if the film does not deserve his talents. De Palma him self does a good job on this getting past the crap fest that was The Fury and tries to bring a faster pace to this one. He sorta succeeds. His next effort Blow Out would be a worse movie than this, but 1983's Scarface the follow up to that would ultimately be one of De Palma's best. I feel he learned how to please 80's audience with the fastness of this film and somewhat good story of Blow Out combined with a drug scenario and made Scarface the crowning achievement it is. Watch Dressed to Kill to see a master grow, Nacy Allen, and a nice turn by Michael Cain.

Feh, feh, feh. Dreadful. Just dreadful. I hated this movie.First off, it's from a school of film which I've always hated no plot, just a bunch of episodes strung together. The ultimate example of this the whole movie is a flashback to the childhood of the narrator, who, in the opening scene (prior to flashing back), tells us how after 50 years, he's leaving the valley. Then we go into flashback. And so we go on this movie-long flashback of his life and times growing up in the valley... but NEVER get CLOSE to filling in the actual, non-flashback story WHY is he leaving the valley? What was up with that? I claim the right as a viewer , that if you're going to announce a momentous event and then slip into a flashback, that the flashback better damn well explain the momentous event! But of course, that would require a plot, and this movie can't be bothered with that.OK, so that's my complaint about the form; how about the content? Plain and simple, this movie reaches the point of bathos. In its endless sequence of episodes, we move from one tragedy to another, with the severity increasing as we go. Before the movie is over, everybody either loses their job at the mine, gets killed in the mine, has to forgo the love of their life, or gets beaten up and whipped by preposterously sadistic teachers and classmates. I won't give away the ending, such as it is, because you'll see it coming a million miles away anyway it's the only tragedy left that hasn't happened yet. By an hour into this thing, I was looking at the clock to see how much more I had to endure.All this travail is set against a backdrop of such sappy, syrupy sentimentality that you're likely to get your hands sticky just handling the DVD. Apparently we're supposed to feel some kind of great love for these characters; I didn't. For the most part, I found them sketchy and one-dimensional. The father, the mother, and to some extent the preacher, aren't too bad, but everybody else, you're apparently supposed to find lovable because everybody talks about how lovable they are. For instance, the great tragedy of Ivor when he dies, we're supposed to be all devastated and all-- except I couldn't remember which one he WAS. All you could really say about him was, he was the one who got married. Did he have any personality? If so, I missed it. Did he say or do anything memorable? If so, it escaped me. He was as cardboard-cutout as the rest of the brothers. Actually, did ANYBODY in this movie have a personality, aside from the 3 principals I mentioned? And let us not forget to pause and reflect upon the townsfolk. Part of the sentimentality is supposed to be about the wonderful people in this miner town, that we're supposed to identify with. The noble good workers and all that the narrator lovingly looks back on. Except that they are a total prop, and change like the wind to suit the plot (such as it is). They're good, wonderful people-- except when they're narrow-minded and nasty. And somehow we're not supposed to notice the inconsistency of them flip-flopping, by my count, SIX times in the movie.But the nadir, the absolute nadir of the movie, the moment when it lost me irretrievably, was when the boy, who has now become an honor student (and how did that happen? His teacher was a sadistic bastard who hated him, yet somehow gave him honors marks. But since we were done with that episode, no reason to bother explaining what happened! After all, we can't be bothered with plot!) and has the chance to climb out of the harsh, filthy mine life and become a doctor or lawyer, really rise and make something of himself-- decides, no, he WANTS to work the mines. This is the central character, the protagonist with whom we're supposed to identify, and he's an absolute blithering idiot. I couldn't respect him a drop after that.Awful, awful, awful. I got no enjoyment out of this movie at all.

In my high school French class, we watched this and I was amazed by the praise it was receiving. Personally, I found the constant singing to be well beyond over the top, nails across a chalkboard annoying, and ridiculously repetitive and mundane. I love a good musical as much as anyone but when the same tune is repeated throughout the entirety of the movie with no deviation, it becomes absolutely moronic. I can even look past the singing of such simple unimportant sayings as 'Hello, how are you' 'fine, isn't it a lovely day', I mean, honestly doesn't it get to anybody else but me?Another thing is the storyline. I can handle almost any movie no matter how annoying it was made as long as there's a good story to follow, but this movie not only lacks the complexity of a decent movie but the intelligence to make the ending a surprise. The girl is pea-brained and unromantic, only wishing for security and not romance while the boy is at war only thinking of his pregnant girl at home. It was more than obvious that she would ditch him and at the end where she met him again, after years of being with Roland, the other man, and where they both now have children they named them the same, it wraps the entire fiasco into a tacky hallmark card celebration of a lack of imagination and skill. If you can look past the singing of petty phrases, the constant repeating of the same tune over and over and over again, and the more than easily predictable plot, then I would recommend this movie for you. It might lack in a lot of things, and overcompensate in the worst places, but overall it has the possibility of being a good movie. I think I might even had enjoyed it if only it was on mute.

Personally, I found the constant singing to be well beyond over the top, nails across a chalkboard annoying, and ridiculously repetitive and mundane. I love a good musical as much as anyone but when the same tune is repeated throughout the entirety of the movie with no deviation, it becomes absolutely moronic. I can even look past the singing of such simple unimportant sayings as 'Hello, how are you' 'fine, isn't it a lovely day', I mean, honestly doesn't it get to anybody else but me?Another thing is the storyline. I can handle almost any movie no matter how annoying it was made as long as there's a good story to follow, but this movie not only lacks the complexity of a decent movie but the intelligence to make the ending a surprise. The girl is pea-brained and unromantic, only wishing for security and not romance while the boy is at war only thinking of his pregnant girl at home. It was more than obvious that she would ditch him and at the end where she met him again, after years of being with Roland, the other man, and where they both now have children they named them the same, it wraps the entire fiasco into a tacky hallmark card celebration of a lack of imagination and skill. If you can look past the singing of petty phrases, the constant repeating of the same tune over and over and over again, and the more than easily predictable plot, then I would recommend this movie for you. It might lack in a lot of things, and overcompensate in the worst places, but overall it has the possibility of being a good movie. I think I might even had enjoyed it if only it was on mute.

In fact,my brother is Autistic,Sam is HARDLY Autistic),albeit high-functioning. He had his daughter with a homeless loser of a woman(in details made quite fuzzy,besides the obvious),and even though he is a responsible and can-do sort,his retardation begins to come to a head with the fact that his daughter,who's barely in grade school,is reaching an intelligence that exceeds his.

To me,this show is most at fault by the direction and writing,where it doesn't seem to trust that you,the audience,will get the point about who to root for and who to root against,making sure the Social worker(Loretta Divine)and the state attorney(Richard Schiff)in particular are such cold,arbitrary and heart-less professionals that one would have to be pretty cruel and insensitive to not be taken aback by their methods of trying to discredit the hero.A sweet-natured film with interesting imagery,this film IS worth a look,but you should be ready to have this film try to squeeze the emotions out of you with extreme prejudice.

Russell Crowe may be a jerk in real life, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen and he is very convincing as genius-mathematician-turned-schizophrenic John Nash. We follow his career and his life starting out at Princeton, getting married, and ending up in Stockholm, heartily accepting the Nobel Prize. He ages 47 years in the film but Russell Crowe is perfect at every stage.So the film makes it clear to us that John Nash is a genius man. Yet I was never mesmerized by his 'beautiful' mind &#150; not in the same way I was with other cinematic geniuses in films like Good Will Hunting, Pi, Enigma and Amadeus. This is because you cannot trace his mathematical thoughts, we do not get to follow his genius pattern ideas and oh, when he draws an umbrella-shape in the stars for Alicia (Connelly) IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN UMBRELLA.

He is the victim of schizophrenia, which makes him paranoid, delusional and insecure. He is never at 'the height of his career', but always a bruised man plagued by his own mind. It just takes him a while to realise it and shake him from his paranoid state. This part is handled superbly in the film -- the break-down is perfect and heartfelt and Jennifer Connelly is there as a supporting wife all along.That actually bothered me somewhat, and it is where the glossy Hollywood autopilot is switched on and Ron Howard leans back in his directing chair. While Russell Crowe is great and Jennifer Connelly is great, their marriage is TOO great. The real Alicia Nash wasn't the pretty little devoted wife to a troubled husband all these years; she divorced him in 1963. Another polished detail that irked me (moreso than the perfect marriage) was the Nobel Prize culmination. The real John Nash shared his prize with two others, but in the film Russell Crowe appears as a sole winner giving a poignant, sappy speech about the equations of love, and the audience cheers, claps and stands up at the end of it.So in summary, if you do not mind the occasional lofty Hollywood approaches to drama, then this is a very good film. Russell Crowe carries it, Jennifer Connelly supports it and Ed Harris and Paul Bettany add further weight to an already respected cast.

Sylvester Stallone gives one of his best performances in Daylight leading a group of civilians to safety after a New York tunnel engulfs in flames. Stallone works his magic as a former EMS chief sent in to save these civilians.When I heard Stallone's name mentioned as part of the cast of Daylight, I knew it would be a non-stop thrill ride; however, what I didn't realize it would be a thriller that had depth mixed in with everything else. Daylight is a credit to Stallone's ability and this remains one of his best roles to date.Adding to this awesome film are Stallone's co-stars, which include Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Jay O. Sanders and Stan Shaw. I enjoyed watching this ensemble work together because they seem to need no direction when on screen. It was as if they were really trapped in the tunnel. From the fear to the heroic actions they took, these actors were top notch.I concede that Daylight is predictable. However, I disagree with those who say it hurts the film. My point is it doesn't matter whether a film is predictable, rather how it is presented.

But that line does still speak to me after now having seen the film twice, and still feeling as if I haven't really SEEN it altogether. Or at least maybe felt, or taken in. Andrei Tarkovsky considered this his least favorite film, and perhaps as a filmmaker myself I could understand. With a pace that never once breaks from the consistency of its focus on the differences between Nature and Earth and technology and science, as well as love, loss, memory, etc, it can be tricky for the director not to find something to critique of himself. And as it was, according to an interview on the DVD, Tarkovsky was obsessed with his work to the point of perfectionism. But, as has been put forward more times than need be to count from reading reviews and comments, this is the Russian equivalent of Kubrick's 2001 really only on two fronts, the pushing forward of boundaries in experiencing visions of what can truly never be known, and letting its characters find out what it means to be without Earth so far out in space (and equally what can stick around).But Tarkovsky is not interested in the same obsessions that had Kubrick and Clarke, and so the comparisons can only go so far before it's really just time to take the film on its own terms, or at least in relation to other science fiction films. It's not about true discovery into the unknown and reaching for mysteries rooted in us as apes. The discoveries of Solaris are known pretty well to anyone who's lived and loved and lost and not been able to connect once lost. The character of Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis, one of the two really stirring performances of the film) starts off on Earth surrounded by natures plenty, and as a mostly stone-faced widower its almost until halfway through the film that we finally see what can be tapped into in his empirically based mind. The exposition- handled through a testimony of a scarred spaceman- tells of an Ocean, being studied by the Solarists, that has started to have a life-force of its own, creating what may or may not be there for those close to it. When Kelvin arrives at the Solaris station, around two weary and worn scientists for the cause, he gets the effect of a resurrected person- his deceased wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk, the other one)- who's own ambiguities and connections as real or copy start to bring the real psychological panic to the film.All of this is done in such a way that is easy to assume as boring. But if you give yourself to the style of the film, stay with the pacing, it is rewarding on its own level, perhaps too in its way comparable to 2001, as it leaves enough to interpret. Tarkovsky is not after anything conventional, which can be seen as a draw back for some. Solaris asks its viewer to take a more emotional journey than one that might find a little creature or lots of real 'action'. Kelvin's time with his new Hari is contrasted against the near empty space station, as he has formed out his wife from somewhere inside of him. In fact it's probably so much connected with philosophical overtones- with at least some time given to talking about the whats and whys of really seeking out something outside of Earth that can only be understood in logic beyond simplicity. At the same time a love story is also worked in, or rather a love constricted within boundaries of perception and the surreal. Why can't Hari be killed or disappear? What happens when Kelvin has his fever late in the film? And can Hari ever really feel at peace with him? What's love when reflected upon? The questions raised, which may or may not be answered by the end of the film (though it had an ending that had me saying out loud oh wow, in part surprise and in part seeing how the factor of the 'Guests' made perfect sense), are put to a backdrop of something that can really be described as something of great art. It might leave little parts that are imperfect, but overall like some big epic poem Tarkovsky's film sinks deep into its subject matter that for those who can grasp enough of it in one or two viewings can take that in tow with the style. And, as mentioned before, at almost three hours it carries as much weight on the side of capturing the visuals as it does of expressing the characters. There's a beauty to nature, and it's seen with just as clear and undiscriminating an eye as the long scene on the road driving (my personal favorite), the oceans in space, and the corridors of the ship are seen as enclosing and impersonal. Some of these images on their own had me re-watching them on their own, just to see how he and his crew did it. It's got that desire to raise questions that marks the most interesting science fiction, in this case to terrify us by the nature of the people affected by realized abstractions, and to conjure some thought as to what's in us as much as what might be out there. An extraordinary movie that is, to be expected, going to draw its audience as take it or leave it. If you do take it, it marks as one of those movies that asks for your patience and then delivers as much once its over as it did when it was on.

Where he got these characters from is even more of a mystery. This movie is a celebration of all things trashy, and yet I got the feeling that when Tarantino started making this movie he realized he could make it so much more than that. He has a gold mine of character and dialogue here, and he has used it up and more.The best thing about this movie is its dialogue. Everything everyone says is so natural; you believe someone would say these things in real life. Every conversation is essential to the plot, but when they take place they feel spontaneous. Even sequences that would feel contrived under a lesser screenplay or lesser director feel perfect in this movie, such as the scene between Willis and the cabdriver, or the scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing at the restaurant.Not only are conversations natural, but the way events shape out feels like real life also. When we are expecting Mia and Vince to get on the good foot and do the bad thing, what we get instead is a crisis in which Mia almost dies. When we expect Butch to get killed, instead he does the killing. The movie felt like it was leading me in one direction but then led me in another, but I didn't feel gypped because it felt right.And the actors are something else in this movie. John Travolta did not give the performance I expected from him- I expected hammy Travolta and what I got was understated Travolta that fit into everything around him; definitely not what I expected. Sam Jackson has the most fun in this movie, but manages to keep it real at the same time. I can't even get into everyone else, simply because there are so many good performances.I gave the movie a 10 (something I've done for only three other movies) because it's so complete. I had trouble figuring out what the point of the movie is, and I'm still not sure, but it really doesn't matter. The stories are so intriguing and the characters are so engaging, I don't really care about the point of it all. I just want to see it again.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing.Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proved he is only human. Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to sitcom fame; Slater should make wise decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down. Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never to be seen.

Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing.Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proved he is only human. Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to sitcom fame; Slater should make wise decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down. Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never to be seen.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games.
