Add that to the fact that this is one of the few sci-fi films that doesn't rely entirely on special effects, wars and explosions to make it's story interesting and you have a classic. And the Director's Cut just makes the original better by giving the axe to Harrison Ford's abysmally bleak voice over and removing the light-hearted ending. Basically, it makes the film is more ambiguous which makes it far more interesting in my opinion. Ridley Scott wanted it to be released in exactly this fashion, and it's easy to see why.The visual and environmental similarities between BR and Scott's prior work, Alien (1979), are easy to spot right from the get go. It's fairly simple, they're both dark and use scaled Gothic models with Swiss precision, creating an entire world worthy of the dizzying imaginations of the audience. I would not be surprised at all to find out if both films had some of the same special effects people. That said, BR is a beautifully dark and futuristic world that is very convincing to the eye even though there's no CGI...which is a good thing because a lot of times models are more accurate and realistic. And believe it or not, for the most part, these effects easily hold up in today's world and look only slightly aged.

Aren't they alive and conscious too? Don't they have hopes and dreams? How different from us are they really? Simple but extremely effective. Most sci-fi's nowadays are too busy trying to cast Vin Diesel or buy the best CGI effects without really worrying about the story. It's sad, but it's all about money.

I would recommend American Psycho a film by Edward R. Pressman to anybody looking for a flick with mediocre acting, a pretty good 3-way sex scene, and good 80's clothes. After reading the novel in two weeks I was excited to watch the movie. Disappointing.The movie is about Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a single New Yorker who is the vice president of Peirce & Peirce, a company on Wall Street. He detests his job and is disgusted by his materialistic friends, whom he is the most materialistic of all. His fiancée, Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) is pressuring him to get married, his secretary, Jean, is in love with him, and he is going insane.I think the film did very well preserving the Bateman character and his twisted mind, but it nearly touched on all of the other characters. If I had not read the book (I probably wouldn't have rented the movie) I would have thought the characters weren't nearly well developed and I would have been confused. In my opinion, with the length of the scenes, I felt like certain scenes were only in there as an homage to the book. I felt the movie was trying to be too much like the book. Like the director and the screenwriter were afraid to add scenes or to even add dialogue. They just cut scenes and put ones in the movie that made no sense if one had not read the book. I did, however, like Bateman's monologue. I did, however, like the door at the end that said THIS IS NOT AN EXIT. I liked how (like most horror movies) it didn't show a close up at the end with very dramatic music. It was there for those who read the book, but if you hadn't you wouldn't have known what it said. In conclusion, if you have read the novel, it is worth watching, if not (unless you are a big Newsies fan) don't bother. It really only has the effect of a bad, uneventful, 80's horror movie.

I'm one of those who never saw the original Seven Samurai, so I won't be comparing the two.  Naturally I loved the music from TMS!  It was interesting to hear what the documentary had to say about how competitive the seven were about getting noticed on-screen, especially Steve McQueen.  I did wonder why he was always putting his hat on and off, for no obvious reason!  Apparently, Yul Brynner told him that if he didn't stop it, he (Brynner) would remove his own hat, and that would be the end of it! ;-)Another interesting story was the one about the censors.  Apparently, Mexicans were so insulted by the way they were portrayed in a previous Hollywood film shot in their country, that the Mexican government sent along minders on this one to see that Mexicans were shown in a more favorable light.  IMO, the villagers in this film were still shown as fearful, helpless, brown-skinned people, looking to the brave, strong, benevolent white Americans to solve their problems, but it *was* an improvement over previous Hollywood offerings.  At least the smaller roles were played by actual Hispanics, though the main Mexican roles were played by white actors, including a Russian and a German(!).  Actually, I didn't even realize Horst Buchholz was supposed to be Mexican, despite his brown eyes and hair, until I watched the documentary!  I can't complain too much about Eli Wallach, because he did such a good job, but these days the non-Mexican-ness of Chico and the Old Man are glaringly obvious. I did notice a sign of early-sixties liberalism when Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen's characters offered to see to the transport of a dead man who was being denied burial simply because he was Indian.  As per usual for the era, the actresses had little to do except show fear and weep over their fallen husbands' bodies, with one as the rather boring love interest (though at least the actress who played her was Mexican).  I liked Yul Brynner, the good guy dressed all in black, and quite sexy at 45 (or 40, depending on what source you go to).  He did a good line in inscrutable and mysterious, as did James Coburn, though it got to be a bit much in the end.  Everybody was so terminally cool (with one exception) that it started to feel a little two-dimensional.  Just once I would have liked to see Brynner's character relax and let out a real laugh, even if he went straight back to being inscrutable and mysterious a minute later.  Somebody mentioned the economy of the script - it's true, it conveys a lot with few words.  The plot of the movie seems rather predictable now, but that may be because it's been copied so many times since!  I appreciated the fact that the opening credits admitted straight out that this film was based on The Seven Samurai.  I wish this rule were enforced for all remakes!

I'm one of those who never saw the original Seven Samurai, so I won't be comparing the two.  Naturally I loved the music from TMS!  It was interesting to hear what the documentary had to say about how competitive the seven were about getting noticed on-screen, especially Steve McQueen.  I did wonder why he was always putting his hat on and off, for no obvious reason!  Apparently, Yul Brynner told him that if he didn't stop it, he (Brynner) would remove his own hat, and that would be the end of it! ;-)Another interesting story was the one about the censors.  Apparently, Mexicans were so insulted by the way they were portrayed in a previous Hollywood film shot in their country, that the Mexican government sent along minders on this one to see that Mexicans were shown in a more favorable light.  IMO, the villagers in this film were still shown as fearful, helpless, brown-skinned people, looking to the brave, strong, benevolent white Americans to solve their problems, but it *was* an improvement over previous Hollywood offerings.

This one has everything that you any sensible person would try to avoid in a film; cardboard characters, more clichés than I thought would be possible to actually cram into a mere two hours, horrible(and I DO mean HORRIBLE) one-liners, zero acting talent, lousy, obvious special effects, etc. The list goes on, and so could I, but for the sake of anyone reading this, I'll try to keep my rant reasonably short. The plot is ludicrous; Sommers should be severely punished for putting such garbage on the screen, and prohibited from ever working with film again. The twists and overall story were painfully predictable; I know of children stories that are more unpredictable and involving. The characters are, as I stated, cardboard cut-outs. They are all one-dimensional, and they constantly change what little personality they have, doing 180-turns every few minutes. Not a single character was the least bit likable; I know this might be to keep us from being sad when the bad guys die, but I didn't care the least bit for any of the people who did survive, either. I was actually rooting for the creatures most of the time when someone died, at least they had an excuse for having zero personality. The acting is almost as non-existent as the character development; actually, equally as non-existent... neither actually existed within the movie. The special effects are ridiculously bad; I have only seen a few movies with worse CGI, and they were all made half a decade before this. What annoyed me most about the pure crap that this film indeed was, would have to be the dialog; every single character constantly utters insults, one-liners, etc. I didn't actually think it was possible, but I'm pretty sure that every single line in this 'film' was a cliché. Characters are constantly either bragging, spouting perverted babble, or talking trash to each other. Half of the time, this means that the person who's doing one of the three aforementioned examples of just how worthless these characters are is about to die, but the other half it's just there, probably to take up runtime, in order to make the film long enough. Another example of this is the two scenes near the end, which are supposed to be sentimental, but are instead just totally out of place scenes that take up more wasteful time. You don't care about any of these characters, and they don't seem to care about each other, either, so why in the world should we care when we see them sad, and why should they be sad for losing someone they quite obviously don't care about at all? This movie is truly horrible, but had it at the very least been laughably horrible, I could have gotten a good laugh at it; but it wasn't it was just painfully horrible, and almost impossible to sit through. Had I been tired when I watched it, I would have fallen asleep. Zero laughs, thrills, or interesting moments. All in all, yet another example of how Stephen Sommers can't make a decent movie if his life depended on it.

Apartment Zero should have aptly been named Roommates from Hell with the movie centering around two oddballs playing all kinds of crazy games with each other. The first Adrian, Colin Firth, an Englishman living with his mother in Buenos Aires and second Jack, Hart Bochner, an American working for some communication firm in the Argentine capital. Adrian and Jack are so different to each other in their interests and relationships as well as their conception of right and wrong as Mother Theresa is to Atilla the Hun.Adrian runs a movie theater and rooming house and the theater seems to be losing money but you never see him have any financial troubles running it during the entire film. You get the impression that Adrian is independently wealthy and just does that, the running of the theater at least, as a hobby. As we soon find out Adrian is a very big movie buff especially in those black & white movies of the 1930's 40's and 50's. With Adrian's dying mother sent to a nursing home he put up her apartment for rent and one of the people looking to rent it is a good-looking charming and what seems like a very nice person Jack who's from the USA working in Buenos Aires. Struck by Jack's charm and good-looks as well as wanting to have someone to take his mothers place, as someone to talk and confide to his most intimate feelings, Adrian not only takes Jack in but, to Jack's complete surprise, offers to cook breakfast for him every morning and even do his laundry for no extra charge. The movie goes on for over a half hour giving you the impression that Adrian and Jack were gay lovers with Jack using and playing around with Adrian's nerves by needling him about going out with girls and getting drunk. On one occasion Jack even leaves him, only to have Adrian beg him to come back, just to see how far he can go to break Adrian down emotionally. I think that Adrian just wanted someone to fill the void that his mother, who later died, left in his life and there was nothing sexual at all in Adrian's longing for Jack's company even though Jack seemed to mistake Adrian's feeling for him and think that he was madly in love with him.Then just when you think that you finally got what was going on in the movie the truth comes out about Jack and it's all bad news. A friend of Adrian's Claudia, Fransesca d'Aloja, asks him if she could use his theater, and Adrian lets her, for a political forum about a series of murders and kidnappings in Argentina that they, in the forum, feel is connected to the government using death squads to stamp out political opposition. Looking at a number of films and photos on the screen we see Jack involved in these atrocities and it turns out that Jack is not Jack but an American mercenary named Michael Weller who was reported killed some time ago in Argentina. Instead of concentrating in on this story the movie go back to it's confusing narrative with Jack and Adrian living and acting like the odd couple and later when it had Jack trying to leave the country his passport was found to be invalid. We then see Jack casually pick up some male hustler, at the airport, and murder him in his hotel room in order to steal his identity and leave Argentina as well as Adrian.Jack then goes back back to Adrian's apartment where he finds Claudia looking for him, that's Adrian not Jack, only to murder her even though she didn't at all recognize him at all as the very dangerous Michael Weller, paid America killer, and thus trowing more attention on himself then there already was! which was none at all since Jack was reported to be dead and no one was looking for him in the first place. The ending of the movie Apartment Zero was somewhat like the ending of the movie Psycho, with Adrian acting and looking almost unrecognizable but unlike the Hitchcock horror classic this ending made absolutely no sense at!
