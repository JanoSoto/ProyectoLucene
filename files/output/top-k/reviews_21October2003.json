[{"date":"21 October 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Julian Sands is well labeled as the Muse of director Mike Figgis. After no less than three films where Figgis has successfully coaxed the best performances out of this fine, sadly underapreciated actor, one begins to see an almost DeNiro\/Scorsesian reparte' between the two artists. The film itself is quirky, breathless, passionate British celluloid at its most honest, and any project that can make even the bricky, fish-eyed Saffron Burrows look exciting is a success in more ways than one.

That said, it is still great fun, even for arachnophobes. It's well filmed, amusing and scary. A good tale, well told. Jeff Daniels and Julian Sands are excellent as usual and John Goodman is the most bizarre pest exterminator you will ever meet. Lots of cameos by character actors keep the interest going throughout and basically there's not a dull moment.
