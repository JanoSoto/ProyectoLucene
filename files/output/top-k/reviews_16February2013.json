Before the war, we are introduced to Mrs. Miniver (Garson), matriarch of a warm, happy middle-class family straight out of Father Knows Best except that in this case it's usually Mother who knows best. She and her architect husband (Pigeon) have three children, two small and cute, one grown up and just out of Oxford. He's smart but he's a callow youth. (All youths are callow.) The kid sounds like a fatuous Marxist at the dinner table, but a pretty guest (Wright) soon brings him down to earth.Theresa Wright is a member of the Beldon family. They're aristocrats, not middle-class like the Minivers. There is also a working class in the village, shopkeepers, postmen, and people of that ilk, and the Minivers enjoy friendly relations with all of them. But Lady Beldon (Whitty), the Aristocrat-in-Chief, holds them all in contempt. However, the aristocratic Wright and the non-U Miniver son from Oxford fall in love and -- Well, I could go on with this, but not without sounding like a sociologist.What it is, is a kind of training film for civilians during war time. Mrs. Miniver is a resolute, brave, uncomplaining, church-going, stiff-upper-lip model of civilian endurance. Not just for the Brits who, by the time of this release, had already learned any lessons to be derived from suffering, but for Americans too. The movie was released in 1942 and shot in 1941, when Europe had been at war for years and everyone knew that the war was just around the corner for Americans. So, while the Army recruits were getting movies showing them how to avoid venereal disease, the civilian audiences got movies like this, demonstrating how to avoid breaking down under stress.It's filled with stereotypes but well done for what it is. I'll give an example of a well-written scene. It's the blitz. The Miniver family is huddled down in its bomb shelter in the back yard of the mansion they live in. They're subject to Nazi bombs that scare hell out of them and bash in their dining room.Here's how a perfunctory script would handle the scene. The sirens wail. The family rushes to the shelter. Suddenly -- overhead -- the roar of airplane engines. Anti-aircraft batteries bark at the enemy. A salvo of bombs blasts the shelter as the brave but terrified Minivers huddle together and silently pray. The bombs stop as abruptly as they began. The Minivers emerge from the shelter and stare, stricken, at their smoking, half-ruined manse.Not here. The scene opens with the family already in the shelter, looking out the door while a city on the horizon is aglow with searchlights probing the sky and fitful bursts of anti-aircraft shells. Not many bombs, observes Pigeon. And we think, Whew, at least the Minivers aren't getting slammed. Back into the shelter, where they read Alice in Wonderland to their dozing children. Then, from nearby, the loud KRUPP of batteries going into action. Then the sound of airplanes. The Minivers sit silently, Garson knitting calmly, Pigeon staring at the walls. Nobody says anything about having loose bowels or needing a jolt of whiskey. The whistle of the first bomb at a distance. Then another, closer. Then a veritable rain of bombs knocking everything over in the shelter. Fade out.A scene at the railway station follows. The Oxfordian is in the RAF and has just returned from his honeymoon with Wright. After an effusive greeting, Pigeon says, Well -- I'll show you to your room. And they walk up the path into the house, and for the first time we see that half the house seems to have been dismantled by the bombs -- windows broken, daylight showing through the roof, furniture reduced to kindling.I've spent that much time on one scene because the scene illustrates the care with which the script was put together. A more reckless approach would have had the whole business over with in five minutes. Instead, the terror and ultimate shock are allowed to creep up on us, bit by bit, as the threat grows nearer and the aftermath of its impact delayed. Good job.Helmut Dantine is a surprise as a downed and desperate German pilot. For one thing, he's handsome instead of ugly. For another, he shows weakness from his wound and when he collapses in pain, we almost feel sympathy. I only wish he hadn't had to eat like an animal and bark out order like, Give -- me -- coat. He should be stalwart. Instead, he acts and sounds like Frankenstein's monster.

It showed up as an instant play movie on Netflix. I was already very familiar with the movie being on several critics' list for must see movies but this part made me even more skeptical. Why? Because many of the reviews focused too much on the wonderful cinematography, how the film represents the Italian neo-realist film movement, the greater social issues of poverty and austerity measures of the time, and the psycho-social father\/son dynamic. Well, all that's nice but is the movie good? The answer is a resounding yes! This 1948 film is way before my time but I connected with it as strongly as any film from today.The plot is very simple, a father named Antonio is in desperate need of work during post World War II era in Rome. He finally gets a job opportunity posting advertisements but it requires his bicycle which he has already pawned. His determined and supportive wife gathers all the bed linens to help raise money and retrieve the bicycle from the pawn shop. The father's son, Bruno polishes up the bike, noticing a small dent and admonishing his dad for not pointing this out to the pawn shop manager. The son is instantly adorable! The father is elated with his new job which comes with a regular salary and housing stipend. However, on the very first day of work, the bicycle is stolen. The rest of the movie involves the father's search, accompanied by his son, for the bicycle. This movie is infuriating as you experience the apathy of the police and community to the father's situation. As the day prevails, Antonio becomes more desperate and all that he stands for as a man and father begins to disintegrate. The best movies are the ones that stir intense emotion whether it's joy, sadness, fright, etc. This movie is maddening. You understand the final actions of the father but you also are deeply pained for how it forever changes his son. Thanks to all of you that encouraged us to watch this film.

Even though she's claimed one of the two top billings for this movie, she's only in it for about half the length of the film at most. I know such a comment is a little unusual to make, but I think it's important that I mention it now before my readers read the rest of this review. With that said, let's continue to talk about Kramer vs. Kramer. As far as all of the Best Picture Oscar winning films go, Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the more forgettable ones. While it's undeniably well acted, there are still major pet peeves that I had with the film. Dustin Hoffman plays a very busy advertising executive who has just landed an important assignment that will lead to a big payday. When he gets home late and tries to tell his wife (Meryl Streep) the good news, she tells him that she wants a divorce and leaves him. Whatever reasons why their relationship had deteriorated aren't really explained that well. There's a scene with the couple in a coffee shop where they act like a happy couple for the first couple seconds, but then they abruptly and forcefully act hostile towards each other that proves that weakness. Anyways, let's keep going. This divorce becomes a serious issue for him in that he has to take care of their child (Justin Henry) all by himself and the fact that he has too busy a work schedule to take care of him. When they become forced to spend quality time together, they don't care much for each other at first. But to the surprise of very few people in the audience including myself, they start to warm up more to each other. So when the time comes in which the parents have to battle for custody of the child, the child is left with an unbearable situation to undergo. As I stated in the introduction, Meryl Streep isn't given enough screen time. Considering the fact that her character put this story into motion in the first place, she should have been given more focus and depth than what she got. Noting that the film lasts more than an hour and a half, I honestly think that she was only in the movie for about half an hour which is inexcusable. While the writers handle Hoffman's story fairly well, they should have done much more with Streep's. But that isn't the only significant problem that I have with this flick. I realize the comment I'm about to make might sound unfair. But as long as reviews such as this are meant to express one's feelings, I feel that it's best to simply say it. I didn't like the kid that the parents were battling over. He came off as sort of an unlikable brat. He's too whiny and fueled with negativity, he causes a lot of trouble, and when he gets himself hurt, I felt no sympathy for him since he sort of had it coming due to the arrogant, careless behavior he commits. While you could argue that he's going through a terrible situation for a child, I could also counter argue that he could have been less obnoxious. With that said, the film has some very good performances behind it. Dustin Hoffman is believable as the busy father who tries to reconnect with his son in the midst of this unfortunate separation. Jane Alexander is warm and likable as his neighbor who also has to take care of a child on her own and tries to support him when he most needs it. I think if the kid were less whiny, if the wife was more developed and had more screen time, and if we understood why the relationship went downhill in the first place, Kramer vs. Kramer would have been better. As it is though, it's average at best.

I think if the kid were less whiny, if the wife was more developed and had more screen time, and if we understood why the relationship went downhill in the first place, Kramer vs. Kramer would have been better.

Even though she's claimed one of the two top billings for this movie, she's only in it for about half the length of the film at most. I know such a comment is a little unusual to make, but I think it's important that I mention it now before my readers read the rest of this review. With that said, let's continue to talk about Kramer vs. Kramer. As far as all of the Best Picture Oscar winning films go, Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the more forgettable ones. While it's undeniably well acted, there are still major pet peeves that I had with the film. Dustin Hoffman plays a very busy advertising executive who has just landed an important assignment that will lead to a big payday. When he gets home late and tries to tell his wife (Meryl Streep) the good news, she tells him that she wants a divorce and leaves him. Whatever reasons why their relationship had deteriorated aren't really explained that well. There's a scene with the couple in a coffee shop where they act like a happy couple for the first couple seconds, but then they abruptly and forcefully act hostile towards each other that proves that weakness. Anyways, let's keep going. This divorce becomes a serious issue for him in that he has to take care of their child (Justin Henry) all by himself and the fact that he has too busy a work schedule to take care of him. When they become forced to spend quality time together, they don't care much for each other at first. But to the surprise of very few people in the audience including myself, they start to warm up more to each other. So when the time comes in which the parents have to battle for custody of the child, the child is left with an unbearable situation to undergo. As I stated in the introduction, Meryl Streep isn't given enough screen time. Considering the fact that her character put this story into motion in the first place, she should have been given more focus and depth than what she got. Noting that the film lasts more than an hour and a half, I honestly think that she was only in the movie for about half an hour which is inexcusable. While the writers handle Hoffman's story fairly well, they should have done much more with Streep's. But that isn't the only significant problem that I have with this flick. I realize the comment I'm about to make might sound unfair. But as long as reviews such as this are meant to express one's feelings, I feel that it's best to simply say it. I didn't like the kid that the parents were battling over. He came off as sort of an unlikable brat. He's too whiny and fueled with negativity, he causes a lot of trouble, and when he gets himself hurt, I felt no sympathy for him since he sort of had it coming due to the arrogant, careless behavior he commits. While you could argue that he's going through a terrible situation for a child, I could also counter argue that he could have been less obnoxious. With that said, the film has some very good performances behind it. Dustin Hoffman is believable as the busy father who tries to reconnect with his son in the midst of this unfortunate separation. Jane Alexander is warm and likable as his neighbor who also has to take care of a child on her own and tries to support him when he most needs it. I think if the kid were less whiny, if the wife was more developed and had more screen time, and if we understood why the relationship went downhill in the first place, Kramer vs. Kramer would have been better.

Don't get me wrong though, the film was very entertaining as it showed a lot of the action on the field and touched on some aspects of the scandal. The acting was stellar and it was really fun to see Charlie Sheen and John Cusack right as they were first starting out. As for the ending, well that was expected, but I still really enjoyed the sports action, back stories, and even the over the top dramatics surrounding the story.

Therein lies the magic of this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film long after one has had the arguments on whether it's a subversive master stroke of film making or merely a cheap sci-fi relying on age old concepts.

For a large part of the project, Schwarzenegger's character hasn't got the slightest idea what's going on and he's in quite a bit of danger out of the fact a group of highly skilled government agents are armed to the teeth and coming after him. He plays a construction worker, Douglas Quaid; a middle aged, everyday kind of a guy with an apartment of his own and a wife in Lori, played by Sharon Stone.

Running a pneumatic drill at a quarry with best friend Danny de Vito by your side; pushing the subway to work every day and seemingly not being able to get away from the news broadcasts of trouble and strife between rebels and government agents on Mars, however, is wearing him down. Through the Recall of the title, Quaid hits upon a business who can put him in a chair for a few days; wire him up to a machine and insert memories that have him think he's done something incredible during a holiday away. Something, however, goes wrong and he thinks he's living the dream (so to speak) without the final programming having been carried out &#x96; thus, an adventure involving all sorts of new and exciting people, as well as new and exciting places, kicks off and we have in our midst one of the smarter, better sci-fi\/action films of its era.Michael Ironside plays the man charged with capturing Quaid, Richter; someone who's already an item with the undercover operative fulfilling the role of Quaid's wife and there's an amusing insinuation Richter is going after Quaid with the intent instead on killing him because of this. The action eventually shifts to Mars and a red light district already shrouded in political turmoil. Waltzing into a brothel to some music from Sonic the Hedgehog, we're introduced to Melina (Ticotin); a young woman who works there who breaks the mould in her appearance amidst the scarred, soft bodied characters including dwarfs; facially imbalanced personnel and three breasted others. It is from here the pair of them begin to occupy the frame for an extended time, taking on the sleazy governing official Cohaagen (Cox) whose own plans to wreck some serious hassle on the Martian inhabitants loom.Structure and pacing are crucial to the film; never are we overwhelmed with details and revelations, nor do we ever lull in proceedings as new information and such keep flowing. What works is how sheltered we, the audience, are from this strange new future of automated taxis and interplanetary travel. We are spared the external shots of anything gratuitous in this far flung future until Quaid has truly realised he is out of his element, something that aides the disillusionment process on both sides.

We forgive the film for its eventual descent into second unit dominated territory. Think hard the moments from our dreams that are the most intense often happen at the tail end of them, do they not? They are the last thing we dream and the first thing that we remember when we awake. If nothing is real and everything is fake, the movement into the final act whereby intense shootouts and near death experiences are all the rage seems fitting, as this constant dicing with death as the denouement looms intensifies the experience.

Either way, when the lead character awakens from this particular episode in the morning, it will be a scream loud enough to awake those not just lying next to them, but in the adjacent homes.

Set on the beautifully lush, tropical island of Hawaii, the story is about a girl named Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase) who can't seem to make any friends. Then one day, her cousin takes her to the Pet Store and she adopts a dog who she names Stitch that is really an alien experiment named 626. Once Stitch (626) escapes the space station, his jailed creator Jumbaa (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) and accomplice Pleakley (voiced by Kevin McDonald) are commissioned by the Grand Councilwoman to bring him back and reward Jumbaa his freedom in return for Stitch's capture. Underlying in this plot is Captain Gantu (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), who, once Jumbaa and Pleakley fail to capture Stitch numerous times, is sent to capture Stitch. When this movie was released back in 2002, there were numerous teaser trailers placing Stitch in some of the most memorable moments in Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, which just happen to be films in the Disney Renaissance Era. Those previews were what really made me say Wow! This is gonna be a great Disney movie! Sure enough, it was, and still holds up 10 years later. Stitch, by far has got to be one of the funniest characters in Disney history. There was even a great message in the film Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. The scene at the end where Stitch almost had to leave Lilo behind is one of the most emotionally filled scenes I've ever seen in any Disney movie. All in all, Lilo and Stitch is one of the better films in the Disney cannon and to be honest, (aside from the brilliant Toy Story trilogy, Up, and Monsters, Inc.) is better than most Pixar movies that get way too much attention in my opinion. It has all elements of classic Disney with a touch of Elvis Presley! Like many Disney movies, this is one that I have in my ever-growing movie library! This is a film that should not be missed by anyone who's a Disney fan or that has children. Despite the PG rating, it's a great, entertaining film for the entire family!!! Rating 10\/10!!!

I have to give credit to Cameron for not just rehashing the first alien film, but to name just a few of its many flaws; many of the characters are not memorable to say the least, and a few like hudson and Vasquez are just bland stereotypes. the film also feels dated and is painfully predictable. this brings us to the infamous alien 3.alien 3 begins with ripley's escape pod crashing on a prison planet called fiorina 'fury' 161, killing all of the surviving characters from the last film except ripley. many fans of James Cameron's ''aliens'' are outraged about how David fincher shamelessly got rid of their beloved characters. however, i've never been able to sympathise with characters like Hicks and Newt since i found them both to lack personality. in fact, i think their deaths add to the superb dark atmosphere of the film. for some reason, people often say they find the characters from alien 3 to be indistinguishable from each other. this is simply not true. most of the films characters are prisoners who have been shaved bold due to a lice problem. beside almost all characters being bold, it really isn't that hard separating them from one another. i had no trouble recognizing any of them. it's true the film focuses on just a few of the total of 25 prisoners but that's only logical and the characters the film does develop more deeply turn out te be very likable. the film doesn't rush right on to the action like the last film, but takes its time to make you like the characters you're supposed to like. It was actually a shame whenever one of the main characters died, a feeling i never experienced while watching aliens.the film has also been criticized on being to much alike the first alien film. I don't find this bad at all, to be honest. In my opinion, ''aliens'' kind of ruined the whole sense of terror behind the xenomorphs. Alien 3 revisits the idea of a single alien creature terrorizing a group of people and does it well. it doesn't simply copy the first film's story like many people blame it to , but uses the same concept in a whole different context. ripley being stuck between a bunch of rapists and murderers also gives the story a whole new dimension. the story isn't very complicated but is executed very well in my opinion.the thing that makes this movie really stand out for me is the visual style. the movie has a very dark atmosphere which i personally really enjoy. the dark feel of the film is archieved by using some great lighting, beautiful sets and lots of very effective shots. most of the time the alien effects are solid, though sometimes the alien clearly looks pasted in. Especially in the beginning of the film some alien effects look a bit fake but this is all made up for with the very exciting and visually stunning last scene of the film. the finale really got my blood pumping and ripley sacrificing herself for the good of humanity would have been a wonderful ending to the alien franchise (if it hadn't been ruined by resurrection, what's with the french and ruining everything?)all together, alien 3 is a painfully underrated movie. if you've seen the movie and didn't like it, i recommend giving the re-edited version of the film another try. you might even like it going in with the right attitude.4 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2013","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This film has received much hate, which I believe is undeservedly. people have called this film ''the worst sequel ever'', praising the last film ''aliens'' by Cameron to be ''the best sequel ever''. however, i feel like this is unbelievably exaggerated. first of all ''aliens'' is not nearly as good a film as you might have been led to believe by it's huge amount of fans.

People get killed, stuff explodes and our half-Inuit heroine goes through it like Lara Croft, with the difference that she keeps surviving not by skill or guns but by pure chance.

I haven't watched this movie in years but I remember it as a very funny movie that made good fun of the college football recruiting process. I was thinking about this movie the other day and decided to check out the rating for this movie and was shocked to see that it was hovering around 4.1. I must have seen an entirely different movie or there are a lot of people that don't see this movie the way I saw it. I loved Micheal Anthony Hall movies back in the day and this is one of my all time favorites. I really liked 16 candles as well as Noation Lampoons Vacation. Who can forget Weird Science. So there is no way this movie deserves a 4.1 review. 10 all the way for me. Really probably around a high 7 but since people are all butt hurt by this movie for some reason I'm giving it a 10.

In a small American suburban town lies a castle upon a large hill. In this castle lives the most extravagant and meticulous invention ever created. This invention is the boy Edward Scissorhands. However Edward has not yet been finished and has the unusual choice of scissors for his hands.Edward has spent many years after his creator passed on living in this castle on his own. To Edwards surprise one day a very kind hearted Avon lady comes to the castle and discovers Edward. She makes an on the spot decision and decided to take Edward home with her to her family.Edward is welcomed into the home and quickly becomes well liked by family and neighbours alike. However as time goes by all this quickly worsens for Edward and he finds him self in danger. Kim, Peg's daughter is able to see past everything and is able to fully understand Edward and her feelings towards him.Edward is again left to spend many years on his own in the castle.My Verdict - This is a very emotional and loving film, following Edward through his acceptance into the community and the drama that follows after. Johnny Depp portrays his character with sheer passion and drive, I cannot fault anything about this man. Winona Ryder as Kim is a perfect choice and she shows her character to the full emotion of true love. Dianne West as Peg is outstanding, she portrays the epitome of an Avon lady and a huge hearted lady.

In the beginning it sets things up like the mothers abandonment is going to be a central theme, but only touches on the subject on a few occasions. It also keeps skipping between the romance with Dice and Mariah's music career without much connection. Pick a theme and go with it!My third criticism is that this kind of rags to riches type story has been done so many times before. The struggling artist making it big, while at the same time dealing with personal problems, is a hard theme to pull off, and has been done much better by other film makers, with other artists. However, Glittr really is not as bad as many people claim, it's a pretty OK pop star success story, the only real problem is the boredom.
