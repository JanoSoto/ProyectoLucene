[{"date":"20 May 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Unlike the common fairy tales that everyone is familiar with. Shrek is a fairytale with new attitude and style.The story begins with and focuses on Shrek, an Ogre who enjoys living in his own swamp. People are afraid of him because of his looks. Because of that he lives alone. Right until a band of fairytale creatures came because they were forced off of their homes. Reason why is because of Prince name Lord Farquot who wants his kingdom of Dulock to expand more.Accompanied with a talking donkey, who is slightly annoying to Shrek. Are on a quest to meet with this Lord Farquot in getting his swamp back. Since the power hungry prince owns Shrek's land, he makes a deal with Shrek in rescuing a Princess Fiona for him. He wants to marry Fiona so he can fulfill in becoming King of Dulock. Shrek agrees with this deal and is about to have more than a quest to fulfill. And Princess Fiona is more than your average princess.I didn't expected this movie to be a big success. But I got to admit, that it's a classic for a CGI. Besides the unique storytelling, and humor, the visuals and texture are all well done. PDI, who made the movie did an excellent job in adding so much detail in all of the backgrounds. Every time you'd watch this movie, you'll notice small bits you didn't notice from before.I also like the use of parodies and in jokes on Disney. The choices for the main characters are clever. Including Eddie Murphy making the movie funny as Donkey. And Mike Myers fits the role of Shrek so perfectly.If you like mild humor comedies with action, and fantasy. Then Shrek is the right choice for that category.
