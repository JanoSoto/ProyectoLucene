I don't have anything against the media although i find the movies are often not very enjoyable. This has changed a bit with Pixars movies, and of course this one.Shrek is an ogre living in a swamp. Suddenly his wonderfully desolate swamp gets filled with fairy-tale creatures though. It seems that the prince who runs the land has decided to rid it of all fairy-tale creatures. So now they have come to hide in Shreks swamp, disturbing his peace. Shrek goes to the prince to complain, and ends up being sent away on an important mission.The first thing that strikes me about this movie is how wonderfully animated it is. It's simply stunning! The animation technique here seems to be focused more on realism than the one used in Pixars movies. This gives Shrek a more textured look, almost like you could touch the characters with your hand.The second thing that strikes me is the wonderful sense of humor. Seldom has an animated movie been done with such exquisite feeling for what's funny and what's not. Also they have managed to make this extremely enjoying both for adults and children. Pixars movies are good but i always felt they were more directed at children, this however contains enough nods to things an adult understands more than a child, which make it fun for the whole family.In short, i found this movie to be wonderful. The sense of humor, the stylish look, the funny characters, the nods to fairy tales and the world that has been created. All this combined make this one of the most entertaining movies in it's genre. I rate it 8\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 February 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" My view on animated film is rather divided i would say.

Jones travels to India after a dramatic escape from the bad guys, and along with his young friend Short-Round, and dancer Willie Scott they find themselves embroiled in a terrifying adventure. A local village appears to have been cursed when its mystical stones were stolen. The children of the village have also been taken. The village priest believes Jones is a God sent to bring back the kids, stones, and joy, and Jones is soon travelling to a nearby Temple to investigate. He soon uncovers a plot to resurrect an evil God, although the real problem is that Mola Ram, the bad guy is using the children as slaves, killing many and drugging others with what is known as 'the black sleep of Kali Ma'. Indy tries to bring down Mola Ram and save the kids while recovering the stones, but of course this will not be easy, especially after Indy is captured. The film is widely seen as the weakest of the series, perhaps because of the gore, but probably because of the racial undertones. It must be remembered though that the film was set in Colonial Times (or at least when India was still seen as a British Colony), and this sort of thing runs through the series, as well as hundreds of other films. Indy can be seen as the white western man coming to save the helpless East from a tyrannical ruler, with his supposedly superior knowledge and technology proving to be more powerful and useful against their primitive and barbaric ways. However, Lucas and Spielberg are not stupid, they would have been fully aware of these themes, and to an extent they are turned on their heads. Indy succumbs to their powers, and it is Short-Round his young Chinese friend who rescues him. Willie Scott is seen as hollow, materialistic and unable to cope without her Western luxuries. Indy almost experiences a 'King Solomon's Mines' like return to primitive ways, but admittedly is brought back. The film has many exciting set-pieces- the opening chase for diamond and antidote, the cave closing scene, the escape from the plane, the mine-cart chase, and the rope bridge finale are a few. The script again is good with many jokes, and Ford's usual charm is here for all to see. Capshaw spends most of her time screaming, which is what the role demanded, and Indy's side-kick is the best character in the series after Indy himself. He is capable of fighting those bigger than him, often imitating Indy, and is wise beyond his years. Mola Ram is pure evil. There are several scenes which may be scary for young kids- the sacrifices particularly, and there is a fair amount of blood. However, it is enjoyable for all ages, and i continue to find new things now that i didn't see when i was younger. 10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 February 2005","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" My favourite of the series, easily the darkest, and possibly the funniest and most exciting.

But Rocky 5 happens to be my favorite of the Rocky movies ... that I have seen. Granted, I still have yet to watch the original, but none of the second, third, or fourth Rockys had the heart and actual story (albeit a cheesy one) that Rocky 5 has.Rocky 5 is directed by the same man who made the first Rocky movie (John G. Avildsen) and stars Sylvester Stallone (you're kidding!), as now ex-boxer Rocky Balboa. Rocky damaged his brain in his previous adventure, so this film has him in retirement mode. Unfortunately, Rocky's brother-in-law Paulie (the reliable Burt Young) has also managed to inadvertently swindle Rocky out of his money. Nevertheless, Rocky takes his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire), son Robert (Stallone's real life son Sage; who was a young boy in Rocky 4, but is suddenly about 13 in this one, despite the time passage of a month or two, tops), and even hapless Paulie and moves them to the rough streets of Philadelphia -- his hometown -- so that they may start a new, peaceful life.Then trouble comes along in the form of young Oklahoma boxer Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Morrison), who had been more or less stalking his hero, Rocky. Tommy casually meets up with Rocky and asks to stay with him in his home and learn from him. Rock's more than happy to oblige when he sees the boxer's talent. Soon Rocky is caught up in managing this boxer, and keeping his own talent and image up through Tommy (ignoring his jealous son in the process). But some bad guys, led by an ersatz Don King character named Richard Gant, and who can offer Tommy more money than Rocky (plus a red-headed bimbo!)... notice Tommy too, and persuade him to join up with them. Tommy is naive and confused, but he finally does join forces with the Bad Guys. This wounds Rocky's soul. Still, he keeps his faith in the youngster until Tommy commits the never-been-done act of saying (on national television) he has someone to thank ... then pausing, leaving Rocky sure Tommy is going to say his name ... and then, of course, thanking Ersatz Don King instead. Finally Rocky fights his last battle, against Tommy. This climactic scene is perhaps the most entertaining one in the entire movie, courtesy of Ersatz Don King! (Touch me, and I'll sue you!, he warns Rocky.) The action scenes are well done. The acting isn't too bad either-- I'm no Stallone fan, but he's good with the Rocky character, and Morrison gives a fairly auspicious acting debut, considering. Fans of the original Rocky might not think this fifth chapter of his tale does the character justice, but I think many will find this watchable in a campy, guilty-pleasure sort of way.

Nevertheless, Rocky takes his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire), son Robert (Stallone's real life son Sage; who was a young boy in Rocky 4, but is suddenly about 13 in this one, despite the time passage of a month or two, tops), and even hapless Paulie and moves them to the rough streets of Philadelphia -- his hometown -- so that they may start a new, peaceful life.Then trouble comes along in the form of young Oklahoma boxer Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Morrison), who had been more or less stalking his hero, Rocky. Tommy casually meets up with Rocky and asks to stay with him in his home and learn from him. Rock's more than happy to oblige when he sees the boxer's talent. Soon Rocky is caught up in managing this boxer, and keeping his own talent and image up through Tommy (ignoring his jealous son in the process). But some bad guys, led by an ersatz Don King character named Richard Gant, and who can offer Tommy more money than Rocky (plus a red-headed bimbo!)... notice Tommy too, and persuade him to join up with them. Tommy is naive and confused, but he finally does join forces with the Bad Guys. This wounds Rocky's soul. Still, he keeps his faith in the youngster until Tommy commits the never-been-done act of saying (on national television) he has someone to thank ... then pausing, leaving Rocky sure Tommy is going to say his name ... and then, of course, thanking Ersatz Don King instead. Finally Rocky fights his last battle, against Tommy. This climactic scene is perhaps the most entertaining one in the entire movie, courtesy of Ersatz Don King! (Touch me, and I'll sue you!, he warns Rocky.) The action scenes are well done. The acting isn't too bad either-- I'm no Stallone fan, but he's good with the Rocky character, and Morrison gives a fairly auspicious acting debut, considering. Fans of the original Rocky might not think this fifth chapter of his tale does the character justice, but I think many will find this watchable in a campy, guilty-pleasure sort of way.

Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying Rosebud means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the love nest with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!So maybe when Kane says Rosebud he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why Rosebud is the last word he speaks.But if this is true (and it seems quite logical to me) then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it?

But where the horror genre is concerned, it's only important that the fans like the movie, not someone who in a million years, would never see a horror movie they were reviewing if they weren't being paid to do so & thankfully the fans over ruled the critics & as a result, WISHMASTER quickly became a horror fan favourite. It wasn't SCREAM nor did it try to be. Unlike Hollywood, which was tripping over themselves to make money with their SCREAM clones (some of which have been long forgotten) the makers of WISHMASTER wanted to do something different, not material that had to be watered down before a famous television or movie star signed their name to the contract to star in it & then later turned their nose up to the genre & it's fans. It wanted to be a HELLRAISER of the 90's (It even has a Djinn birthing scene, that is similar to Frank the monster's resurrection in that film) & that film is a clear reference of what this film is aiming for, especially in a scene in the Djinn's lair, where we see those who have sold their souls to him in order for their wishes to be granted, being strung up in chains, with hooks that have flayed away their flesh, exposing their insides & some even have their faces ripped off.WISHMASTER is a complete & loving throw back to the horror hits of the 80's, filled with gore, great monster make-ups & a simple horror story that wasn't complicated in the least. Unlike a lot of horror films, WISHMASTER wastes no time in bringing you the gore & getting right to the heart of the matter from the very first frame, as we see people in Ancient Persia being destroyed in every horrible way conceived by the mercilessly evil Djinn, who has them in his power, turning them into hideous creatures & literally ripping them apart, with blood, slime & body parts strewn all about. It never once wastes it's time & always has something going on, be it a really cool kill, or a scene with the films main villain or the heroine unlocking secrets about him & finding out how to stop him. ANDREW DIVOFF for the most part is fun as the Djinn, both in human & in demon form, his performance is devilish perfection & I honestly believe that the film wouldn't have been half as fun without him. Director Kurtzman is a pure horror fan & not someone just doing the job for the paycheck & it really shows here. Kurtzman peppers his film with some very familiar horror movie faces such as TED RAIMI (EVIL DEAD 1-3) ROBERT ENGLUND (Freddy Kruger of the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series) & even has TONY TODD (CANDYMAN 1-3) & KANE HODDER (Jason in Friday the 13th Parts 7-10) in cameo's (Oddly though both Hodder & Todd receive top billing as though they have big parts).

And now, the great answer is that the monolith was really some benevolent interdimensional ambassador, here to bring peace and love, jumpstarting glorious new civilizations if it had some extra time on its hands??? The same monolith that inspired those peaceful little astralopithecines to beat the hell out of anything that moved with those bleached femurs? Initiating the events which led to later, slightly more advanced primates like genghis khan, adolf Hitler, and george w. bush??? Naaahhhh, i don't buy it. The first movie gives a much darker, more uncertain feeling to what the true mission of the monolith was. Not a pessimist by nature, but the finality of the film was just a tad too simplistic.peace.

This is a direct continuation of that story.57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.Ripley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director's cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer\/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.Cameron carries over the crypt\/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite cat fights in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series.

Too many CIA veterans criticized or contradicted Bush's and Cheney's phony claims over Iraq and terrorism. So Bush has imposed a new, yes- man director on the agency, slashed its budgets, purged its senior officers, and downgraded CIA to third-class status.     Rumsfeld's new, massively funded SSB will become the Pentagon's CIA, complete with commando units, spies, mercenary forces, intelligence gathering and analysis, and a direct line to the White House.

U.S. Army intelligence and its covert sub- branches have long conducted black ops, including missions in the U.S. as well as assassinations and sabotage abroad. The Pentagon consumes three-quarters of the total U.S. intelligence budget.     Rumsfeld has skillfully used terrorism hysteria to wrest control of intelligence and make the Pentagon supreme in Washington's bureaucratic power struggles.     The Pentagon's new spy arm will be largely excluded from Congressional oversight or media examination. Its special operations teams will roam the globe, all under cover of deep black missions of which no records will be kept, and no questions asked.     Equally worrying, the Pentagon's new special-ops units are headed up by notorious religious fanatic, Lt. Gen. William Boykin, who calls the U.S. Army the house of God and Islamic insurgents agents of Satan. He warned Muslims, my God is bigger than your god, which is an idol.     Boykin's command will now dispatch post-modern Christian crusaders to cleanse the world of Satanic Muslims and other miscreants. The Pentagon's new special forces will be able to run operations of which the CIA knows nothing.     The 9\/11 Commission called for improved intra-agency co-operation and data sharing -- instead, the U.S. will get far less co-operation, as the Pentagon goes its own, secret way.     Now, George W. Bush, who clearly believes he holds the mandate of heaven after being re-elected by the less mentally active half of American voters, has decided to unleash special forces and all sorts of irregular units, including mercenaries, uniformed bounty hunters, and mutants sporting t-shirts proclaiming kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out. These militarized thugs and video arcade Rambos are sure to run amok, dragging America's once good name ever deeper into the mud.     We have evidently learned nothing from the wars in Indochina and Central America.     Have we reached Seven Days in May?     Not yet, but the second Bush administration has been taking dangerous steps that continue to curtail personal rights, further emasculate the supine, cowardly U.S. Congress, and empower ideological or religious extremists and shadowy agencies with unrestrained powers that endanger Americans at home, and all abroad suspected of troubling the Pax Americana. --------    Eric Margolis is Contributing Foreign Editor to the Toronto Sun.

He describes blood as being more than just fluid in the veins and that is contains feelings\/emotions. Why he forms relationships with beautiful women only to kill them all is weak as is the police investigation after they find one of his victims. Steven's ability to remain cool in the hottest of situations is also a bit unnerving at times. The only real evidence we get to satisfy our cinematic preconceptions of what a vampire should be, other than his biting women on the neck and taking their blood, is one brief scene in which he is able to move quickly. There aren't any effects from sunlight, no garlic, and no fangs.
