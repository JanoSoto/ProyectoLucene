He was a Siberian Husky who led a sled dog team transporting medicine from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. He was a hero, saving many of people who would have died without that medicine and saved his team, staying on a trail through near whiteout conditions. Although he was only one of the many dogs that took place in the serum run, he is by far one of the most famous. Because of this, a statue was placed in Central Park, New York City in dedication to him. Now the story about Balto never once talked about him being part wolf or being a outcast among the people until the run but the movie has a heart all its own. I feel that the version they have in the movie is a bit more fantastic then the original story but isn't that just it with a legend? They will keep saying it over and over again until the fact is twisted and turned around, making it much more amazing then what really happened. I fell in love with the whimsy of Balto when I was young, the year when it first came out and as with some of the shows I fell in love with, I would watch it constantly, watching till the tape was well beyond playable. The legend of Balto was one of the first real legends that I learned and though at the time I thought that all that I saw in the movie was true, it got me into wanting to know more about legends.The story opens in Nome, well the cartoon part. It is basically played as though a grandmother is telling this tale to her granddaughter in the middle of Central Park as they look for the true statue made in honor of Balto. We have Balto, his love interest Jenna, and Steele (the antagonist). We also have a Russian goose who is Balto's adoptive father and two polar bears that are like his siblings&#x85; and this is where I must remind you that when I was thinking this was real, I was about 7 years old or so. Anyway, the personalities are as followed; The outcast longing to be one of the others, the lovely and popular love interest, the macho jock who wants love interest and hates outcast, the overprotective father, and the comedy relief. It's at this point that you may point out that almost every show has this when it is based for children and I would say yes and that it why I liked it and still like it. As much as the new age shows make me want them to change tactics, I fell in love with the older shows because that was it. It was simple to pick out who the villain was and who the person we had to cast our votes for to get the girl. It's nostalgia I guess.The animation is very nice for the time. I would think it was probably even better then the time in some aspects as I would probably put it up in the same lines as Disney with its beautiful bright colors and clean look. One of the only problems that I had was that Boris, a goose mind you, has teeth. Seriously, even in a child's movie, why would you give a goose teeth? Oh well, its only one thing out of the show I don't really get. The rest is so well done that I fell in love with it.The voices are simple for the most part and yet I fell in love with them. Years after first watching the show, I looked up who voiced Balto and to my surprise, it was Kevin Bacon. I would never of guessed it would be him who voiced my favorite character from the show as must of the movies I see him in are a bit over rated. I love how we have a rather English speaking Polar bear with a 'mute' one. It makes me laugh a bit more which is what they are supposed to do.

Back then, everything about this movie scared me, whether it was the goblins, Jareth, or even that cute caterpillar at the beginning. I didn't understand what was happening but I knew that I didn't like it. Fast forward to about twelve, I kept thinking of a movie but I couldn't figure out what it was called. After a while of searching I finally find the movie that I was thinking of; The Labyrinth. As I watched it for the second time I remembered how fearful I was eight years ago. I couldn't believe how scared I was of a movie that was so fun. Since then I have watched it about ten more times raising it to the top of my favorite movie list.When people ask why I like the Labyrinth so much they need to prepare for a ten minute speech. The storyline is impeccable; a teenage girl's brother being taken by a goblin king leading her to go through a Labyrinth meeting different creatures and doing different tasks. Not only does this scream intense, but it also is made to be funny. There are twists and turns all throughout her adventure that keep you on your toes. Not only is the story great, but the cast was chosen perfectly. Jennifer Connelly perfectly portrays a seemingly innocent teenage girl being thrust into an unexpected world. David Bowie shows that he not only is an amazing singer but an actor as well. For me, if Jareth were to be played by anyone else, the movie would not be as great as I believe it to be. The effects were great for the time period, special effects have advanced since the 80's but I find it to be very well done for the things they had accessibility to. There are a few goofs in the movie such as continuity issues and equipment being shown on camera. They weren't able to access much of the technology that we have today to prevent these mistakes. Overall, the Labyrinth brings many different genres to the table such as mystery, action, and even a bit of romance. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys anything. It's a classic in my book and it needs to be more well-known than it is.

Well,even though, as usual I preferred the book, I did like the film as well. Very much. Meryl Streep was unbelievable, I just loved every quote that she said. She managed to show the peculiar Sarah's character and to create a very interesting character for Anna, as well. Jeremy Irons was great also. Generally, all the cast played good. However, I didn't like Lynsey Baxter as Ernestina. I think she didn't appear as young as it was supposed too, and that she was saying the lines sooo slowly that it get annoyed after some time. I also didn't like the idea of adding Anna's and Mike's world in the story. I'd rather prefer just to be in Sarah's and Charles' reality. It's true that John Fowles often interrupt the narration to comment something or to compare the two centuries. However, Anna's and Mike's existence didn't touch his comments at all. In the first half of the film their scenes last too little so they are not useful. In the second half their story becomes more interesting but at the end it seemed to me that it was a small and fast-made movie, violently put into J.F's story. In other words, I'd like to see Anna's and Mike's story in a different movie! Additionally, It wasn't justified -to my opinion- Anna's behavior at the end that reminds us Sarah! Yet, I have to admit that I was impressed because Meryl and Jeremy could easily play themselves as Anna and Mike. But, I was not seeing Meryl and Iron on the screen, even they were playing two characters so common to their reality, they find their own character's personality -a personality different than theirs. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. In conclusion, I believe that if I hadn't read the book and haven't seen the movie on the laptop (I couldn't find it in a DVD) I'd like it much more! It is a story that you have to learn either from the film, either from the book, they both have their own magic!

But when the news breaks out that a notorious killer whom the marshal sent to prison years ago is returning on the noon train to exact revenge, the sheriff returns to face him but finds himself completely alone as the people he has protected for so long coldly turn their backs on him.Excellently directed by Fred Zinnemann & deftly written by Carl Foreman, the entire story is narrated in real time & gets better as the film progresses. It's much different to a typical western as the characters & their inner conflicts with themselves is the element that's given more priority. Cinematography is finely carried out while editing cleverly paces the film's story so that it runs parallel to real time. Music is structured around a single song, which wasn't bad, that keeps resonating throughout the film but is at its best with a new track during its third act.As far as acting goes, Gary Cooper delivers the standout performance amongst the cast as Marshal Kane & completely owned his character. However, my favourite moment in the film is the little montage that shows the various happenings in town when the clock is about to hit 12 o'clock, indicating the arrival of the train. That scene is tense, expertly shot & vehemently supported by a brilliant score and I liked it even more than what happens in the subsequent climactic showdown.On an overall scale, completely taking me off by surprise & scoring much better against my initial expectations, High Noon is a wonderful example of quality cinema that tries to approach its genre in a rather unconventional manner & is a must for fans of western cinema.

It's much different to a typical western as the characters & their inner conflicts with themselves is the element that's given more priority. Cinematography is finely carried out while editing cleverly paces the film's story so that it runs parallel to real time. Music is structured around a single song, which wasn't bad, that keeps resonating throughout the film but is at its best with a new track during its third act.As far as acting goes, Gary Cooper delivers the standout performance amongst the cast as Marshal Kane & completely owned his character. However, my favourite moment in the film is the little montage that shows the various happenings in town when the clock is about to hit 12 o'clock, indicating the arrival of the train. That scene is tense, expertly shot & vehemently supported by a brilliant score and I liked it even more than what happens in the subsequent climactic showdown.On an overall scale, completely taking me off by surprise & scoring much better against my initial expectations, High Noon is a wonderful example of quality cinema that tries to approach its genre in a rather unconventional manner & is a must for fans of western cinema.

So, my comments will cover some things that I didn't see in reviews. Blake Edwards used a lot of past events in this movie &#x96; from Hollywood and elsewhere, to lampoon those events and some topics of the times. He used the real Great Race of 1908 as his overall comedy vehicle (a pun by coincidence?). The real event probably had very little comedy for the participants. Although when one reads the details of the finish, it seems obvious that at least one entry tried some shenanigans. The race was a big deal in its time, and we have some interesting artifacts from that event, which I'll mention later. I'm sure some similarities with the movie will be obvious here, as well as some scenes that may have been inspired by the real race. The real race was sponsored by the New York Times and Le Matin of Paris. Six cars were entered in the race from four countries. France had three entries and one car each came from the U.S., Italy and Germany. The race was to cover 22,000 miles. The best of roads at the time were poor by today's standards, and most places had no roads at all. Wherever possible, the cars straddled and followed railroad tracks. Where there were no tacks, the cars drove cross country. The original plan was to drive the entire distance by crossing the frozen Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia. But it was changed to ferry the cars from Seattle to Valdez, AK. Then, when the leading car arrived there, the Alaskan conditions were so bad that it was impossible to proceed further by land. So, from Valdez, the race went by ship to Japan, then by ferry across the Sea of Japan to Vladivostok, Siberia.So, who won? The U.S. entry, the Thomas Flyer, driven by George Schuster, was the first to cross the U.S., and it entered Paris on July 30 &#x96; 169 days after starting. The German Protos had arrived in Paris four days earlier, but was penalized 30 days because it didn't go to Alaska. The Italian Züst was the only other car to finish the race. It arrived in Paris on September 17. None of the three French entries made it past Vladivostok. The cars had teams of three or four men, and some of the men were replaced along the route. George Schuster was the only American to go the entire route. When the Americans returned to the U.S., they had a heroes welcome and ticker-tape parade in New York City. Now for the artifacts. The winning Thomas Flyer and the race trophy are in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, NV. The trophy is a large pyramid made out of marble from the four nations that had cars competing. I saw these and many cars and other items when I spent a day in the museum in 1997. This world-class museum was begun with 175 of the nearly 1,400 automobiles of the William Harrah auto collection. The museum opened in 1989 and ranks among the top five automobile museums in the U.S., and in the top 16 in the world. That's according to AutoWeek magazine. The Great Race cost $12 million to produce over five months. It was then the most expensive comedy ever made. This globe-trotting farce didn't go quite as far as Around the World in 80 Days, but it sure is a close second. It was filmed in Vienna and Salzburg, Austria; Paris, France; Frankfort, KY; the Oregon coast; and in locales and studios up and down California. Before the big race begins in the movie, we get some hilarious comedy warm-ups. We see a number of individual performances by The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). Kennan Wynn and Peter Falk play their sidekicks, Hezekiah Sturdy and Maximilian Meen. These hilarious scenes have some goofy gimmicks and interesting inventions. Fate is a great &#x96; if diabolical inventor. We have scenes with a bicycle- powered dirigible, a railroad track rocket, a mini-submarine and a land and water mobile torpedo. Other adventurous scenes add to the humor, with Fate's attempt to beat Leslie by trying to cause Leslie's stunts to fail. The hijinks continue during the race. I had to pause my DVD when I laughed so long at this exchange. General Kuhster The Great Leslie has escaped. Prof. Fate Escaped? General With a small friar. Fate Leslie escaped with a chicken? General No, you idiot, with a friar. A monk. A priest.Henry Mancini's music for this film is excellent. The ominous theme each time Fate comes on the scene prepares us for some sort of hijinks that are sure to make us laugh. Jack Lemmon is riotously funny in his double performance in this film. He and Falk make an unbeatable comedy pair. I can see that match up as Blake's tribute to Laurel and Hardy. Lemmon should have been nominated for an Oscar that year. His role was much funnier, and much more demanding, than that played by Lee Marvin who won the best actor Oscar for Cat Ballou. The Great Race won the Oscar for best effects and sound effects. It received four other nominations in one of those years that had many great films. This is a wonderful madcap comedy adventure that will delight the whole family.

Even the best sci-fi movies (Blade Runner, Metropolis, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, etc) have moments that weaken the film's atmosphere due to hindsight whether it's the futuristic billboards advertising Pan Am or John Conner's Public Enemy t-shirt. But this film, which is almost two decades old, remains staggeringly fresh and oddly believable despite the film being set at the very death of the twentieth century. Maybe it's because the film isn't really about the millennium at all. It's actually a sweeping and ambitious neo-noir covering redemption, voyeurism, racial tensions and corruption. It might not tick all the boxes but I believe this film should go down as a stone-cold classic.December 30th, 1999 and business is good for smarmy deadbeat Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes). Ignoring the violence tearing society apart, Lenny peddles illegal mind-taps which record the memories and feelings of the person recording and allows users to replay them. But Lenny's position of influence in LA is at risk when he receives a blackjack - a snuff tape of a young woman being raped and murdered from the killer's point-of-view. Persuading his cop buddy Mace (Angela Bassett) and best friend Max (Tom Sizemore) to help him catch the sick killer, Lenny fears his ex-lover Faith (Juliette Lewis) could be next but she wants nothing to do with Lenny as she is busy cosying up to sleazy producer Philo Gant (Michael Wincott) in order to get her recording career off the ground.I can think of few films as well-made as Strange Days which does an incredible job of portraying a city where the plot is one of merely many stories happening concurrently. You feel part of the crowd as the streets explode into a vast party, ticker-tape raining down as cops chase suspects and violence breaks out at the drop of a party hat. You also completely buy into the concept of the SQUID device replaying the experiences of different people - indeed, it's hard to believe that it won't be long before it's patented in real life. Completing the film's powerful grip on your attention are the cast - Fiennes is convincingly slimy as Lenny, who'd rather offer his fake Rolex to avoid confrontation. By contrast, Bassett acts as the true hero and she displays an aura of confidence, determination and strength that Lenny sorely lacks. It's such a positive and refreshing change to see a black woman play the hero instead of the white male sidekick, something which sadly still doesn't seem to happen that often in Hollywood.

Of course, we have seen scenes of violence in movies for years but by bringing you into the action far better than a pair of 3D glasses ever will, the safety of the fourth wall has gone and it does make you feel uncomfortable. But technically, these sequences are a tour de force by Bigelow - utterly enthralling, brilliantly shot and completely believable, leaving me wondering exactly how they shot them. To be honest, I'm surprised no-one has thought of using the technology for an entire movie by now. It also runs out of steam towards the end and can't sustain the innovation throughout which is a pity, falling into genre stereotypes too easily. But overall, Strange Days is a truly magnificent picture. I'd forgotten how good it really is when I caught up with it yesterday and even though real life has obviously overtaken the events in the film, that shouldn't detract too much from what is a dark, imaginative and stunning piece of science-fiction cinema.

Directed by Jerry Zucker, the movie is take a new interpretation of the Arthurian Legend, giving the film, a new look into the old tales. Some of the film foundation comes from tales like Wace's Roman de Brut, Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, and others. The movie takes most of its story from the tales from writer Chrétien de Troyes whom credit for adding Lancelot, and the Holy Grail myth to most Arthurian tales. The movie is mostly based on Troyes's 'Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart' poem where Lancelot fall in love with Lady Guinevere. While, the poem has them, Courtly Love, (AKA love of honor & merit), the movie makes it feels they love each other with passion. The film opens with Lancelot (Richard Gere), as a vagabond and skilled swordsman nomad who travel town to town, to challenge anybody for a duel for money, rather than a noble Knight. On his way back from one such visit, he comes around Guinevere (Julia Ormond), the ruler of Leonesse, whom just decide to marry King Arthur of Camlet (Sean Connery) partly out of admiration and partly for security against Malagant (Ben Cross), who been terrorize her land. When she is kidnap by Malagant, he seek to rescue her. On the way back to Camlet, both falls in love with each other, and soon enough, an affair blossom that would hurt her kingdom and King Arthur forever. Can Lancelot and Guinevere keep their love, a secret or will King Arthur find out? Watch the movie to find out. Without spoiling too much. The romantic sub-plot wasn't that bad. It wasn't too cheesy. I really believe the morals of honor, and the misunderstood of love. I have to say, Richard Gere works his charm and I really didn't think he need the English accent. Julia Ormond is beautiful, and courageous. She is fine actress. You can see her torn between her love for King Arthur and Lancelot. There are a few things, I didn't like. The movie has this type ending if you are a good and true and honest person, you get killed and the guy who you did everything for, runs off with your one true love. Certain people were really upset by that. Still, Lancelot knows what is right and wrong with this. He didn't want to undermine it. Also, by not, having Lancelot, not being a knight in the beginning, the movie somewhat hurts the 'Significance of the Cart' part of the poem. The cart is significant to the story because it proves just how far Lancelot will go to rescue Guinevere. He does not think about his reputation being destroyed when he chooses to ride on the cart. By ruining his reputation, Lancelot also tarnishes the reputation of the king he represents; but his love for Guinevere outweighs all other issues that may arise from his actions. The action, we do see is amazing. I love the whole obstacle course scene. Still, some of the gauntlet is a little bit too dangerous & unrealistic. Lot stabbing swords. Come on, even with the provided protective gear that would kill you. I doubt anybody in real life was willing to get kill just to win a kiss from Guinevere. The action battle scenes are just entertaining to watch. I love the sword fight cinematography. The Battle at Leonesse was brutal and the Battle for Camlet was just amazing shot. The act of defiance against all odds, never surrender. This is probably my favorite final battle because there are so many movies where the two main people will fight the entire time whereas in this one they are realistically separated by other combatants. I love Lancelot's Blade Spam-and-disarm technique. Richard Gere really put some work into those sword fights. While Guinevere is distressed in Damsel, pretty much for the entirety of the film, she does put up a good fight during her abductions. Ben Cross is just chilling in this role. Sean Connery is wise and he really commands the movie. Just watch his speech before the Battle for Camlet. Awesome stuff. The smart dialogue is very memorable. What I did like about the movie is how absence the magical elements are, the film doesn't even have the magician, Merlin. I don't mind the demystification of the story as much as other people do. The score by Jerry Goldsmith was great. It's amazing what he got done in three days. Still, it's a bit short, but alright. Also the movie was beautifully shot. The Pyre at sea is how I like to go.

How could you screw up possibly the most anticipated film of all time to the levels of this film The Phantom Menace. Now as a massive fan of the original Star Wars films I even struggle to watch this film because of how bad it is and what it represents in the ideology of Lucas for Star Wars films. We had our warning with the Ewoks in Return of The Jedi that we should have realised that Star Wars was being turned into a kids film and not a very good one at that. This film is set about 30 years before the original Star Wars and sees two Jedi Qui-Gon-Jin and Obi-Wan-Kenobi attempting to save the planet of Naboo from a hostile takeover from the Sith while also running into a boy who could possibly bring balance to the force. The main negative of this film is the script and just how wooden some of the dialogue is between characters that just shouldn't be, also the main reason I Love Star Wars is because of the characters and how we are meant to identify with them and care about them, in this film you will not really care about anybody even when you are truly meant to. But the straw that breaks the camels back is Jar Jar Binks oh my god this my be the most childish and annoying character ever put on the screen and if people hated The Ewoks then they haven't seen anything close to Jar Jar Binks. There are some positives though like I believe Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor put in good performances as our two Jedi's but that wasn't enough. The main positives for me is The Pod race which I find incredibly cool and exciting and also the final encounter between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. This is one of the best lightsaber fights in Star Wars and it is great because of all three participants. A huge positive as well is that this is Star Wars and the music is always great and this is no different even in this bad film. I am glad we have future Star Wars films and now that Lucas isn't directing I am optimistic that these new films will return Star Wars to its glory days.

I watched the majority of it first time around but because the disc was faulty, it froze at the part where Rumi, wearing one of Cham's costumes, is pushed onto a shard of glass, making me think that was the ending due to the disc skipping to the credits but that part was in fact the climax. I found the original Japanese language version with English subtitles on YouTube and decided to watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. Despite the English dub of my first viewing differing slightly from the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles, I did indeed find this film as good as I remembered first time around but found certain parts very disturbing.The animation is decent and not as choppy as that in 'Paprika' but there were times where I thought the background characters needed more life and the lip-sync was very basic. The backgrounds are worthy and while the colours are not quite as bright as those in 'Paprika,' the characters are richly cel-shaded. The story is gripping and easier to follow than that of 'Paprika' but it does have several intense elements that are undoubtedly aimed at a more adult audience such as rape, nudity, pornography and bloody images. For me the main plot is the best part that involves Mima leaving her band to focus on her acting career and a ghost of her past stalking her and encouraging her to re-join the band. There are quite a few memorable scenes such as Cham performing their last song with Mima at the beginning of the film, Mima returning home to discover her goldfish are dead, Mima's ghost stalking her and Mima kneeling in the bath. While I preferred the pop songs when they were sung in the English dub, the music during the climax is atmospheric and haunting. I found the ending surprising because it differs from what I originally thought if was but I'm glad it was less intense than what I thought it was if it was abrupt.Overall this was a gripping and intense yet memorable anime directed by the late Satoshi Kon although my number one choices for anime films would be those produced by Studio Ghibli ('Spirited Away,' 'My Neighbour Totoro,' 'Howl's Moving Castle' etc). 8\/10 for both the English dub and the original Japanese language version.

The ways things are presented in this movie are in Scorsese style; The plot is interesting, the first 30 minutes were used by Scorsese to make the viewer familiar with the setting and characters, after that moment you know what type of movie you're going to watch, a movie which has the style and feeling of a Scorsese movie, and to be a honest, one of the first movies I've watched where we are told a story of blackmailing and stalking in which we come to realize that some of things that the antagonist does things that ourselves are able to do if we are betrayed and let to rot in a prison for 14 years just because the lawyer made a decision to hide some case details away from the grand jury in order to make sure that his employer gets to pay the prize for his crimes.To make this short, a man (De Niro) gets out of jail after a 14 year sentence and seeks revenge by stalking and blackmailing his lawyer (Nolte) for the things he hid away from the jury. The acting is great, but De Niro fits the role perfectly and plays it in the same way, making me feel uncomfortable in some scenes, almost as if he was messing with my mind. Nolte and his family are perfect picks too; the whole cast of this movie was downright great.It's a very interesting thriller which seeks to intrigue the average viewer by presenting a plot that is very plausible to happen and I really hope that some day you will be able to watch this movie if you haven't already.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 2014","score":"","review":" This is another great piece of cinematography from the brilliant Scorsese in association with De Niro.

My brother always told me to watch Psycho but i was like An old movie like that, NO!!! One day i watched it and i was like wow that is a masterpiece, i could not believe that a black and white movie could make me love it so much. The plot is flawless, it makes you anxious and satisfied in the end. The bathroom scene (which is one of the most famous scenes worldwide) was amazing. Anthony Perkins interpretation was so good. I am a huge fan of movies that conclude crazy main characters. To those who hasn't seen it yet i recommend to choose one rainy night and watch it. Also i believe that psycho is one of the must see thrillers such as Stanley Kubrics The Shinning, Hide and Seek, Lost in Highway and the others.

Call it snobbery, but I rather was! I've had opportunities in the past to watch this before I actually sat down and did. That's years lost where I could have been rewatching!This movie has everything I like in a musical. Incredible singing, and dance numbers that tie in beautifully to the plot being the chief thing I look for. I like the music numbers to mean something, and here they did. I found my face on the verge of breaking from how hard I was smiling and as soon as I finished the film, I was on youtube rewatching my favorite scenes. I fell completely in love with the three lead characters and their relationships to one another. They are your classic story telling triumvirate, each adding something to the puzzle that the others couldn't. Good Morning was my favorite, not because of the song itself, but because I got to see these three let loose together and have fun. It goes without saying how absolutely stunning the visuals were. The colors blew me away and the only film today that I think comes close to its beauty is Moulin Rouge. This film though had the room to play around with so much more color wise given how it was right on the edge of when color films were becoming the norm making it really stand out.I'd rec this to anybody who loves musicals or feel good films. So glad I finally saw this.
