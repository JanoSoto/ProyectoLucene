But, after having seen the film, I regret to say that my emotions are mixed at best. First off, THE PLANET OF THE APES, doesn't have the feel of a Tim Burton film. The one thing I love the most about his films, are the characters in them. You really get to care for a Burton character. But the only character in this film that might resemble a previous Burton character, such as Edward Scissorhands or Jack Skellington, is Ari. She's the typical outcast in her society, set aside by her revolutionary ideas that humans should be treated equally as monkeys (sorry, apes&#133;), but other than her there really aren't any other characters in this film that can evoke care and emotions. The film doesn't visually have the Burton-esque style to it, either. There are occasional shots where some of that Burton magic shines through, like when we see the ape-city at a distance (it looks bewitched), but for the most part the visual style of the film is typical Hollywood extravagance. It would actually seem fair to compare this film with BATMAN. Both films are financially huge projects, where the producers seems to have put a lid on Burton's imagination, perhaps in fair of loosing the bigger audience. &#145;Tis a shame&#133; Also, the film doesn't feel grand. I, personally, was expecting a huge film. After seeing the intense trailers, I though THE PLANET OF THE APES would be a film that could give us a taste of what's to come, with LORD OF THE RINGS looming in the distance, speaking in terms of huge CGI made battles and such, but alas&#133; There's only one such scene, and it's over in a flash.There are also several things that bothered me in the script. First off, the beginning, which was too short too explain why a pilot would risk his life going after an ape lost in an electromagnetic storm. More time should have been spent, or been spent more efficiently, on this bit. There was also stuff in the characters development, which didn't fit. *SPOILERS* There's a scene in the film where Ari sneaks back into the camp of the vicious Thades, to conduct some sort of peace meeting, where she ends up being branded by Thades with the mark of humans. The film doesn't explain why Ari would attempt such an act in the first place, or why Thades would just let Ari and Sandar, who accompany her, leave afterwards, and the scene isn't followed up later in the film. It's only there to give Thades a chance to mark Ari. The writers should have thought of another way for this to happen. Also, towards the end of the film, we see Colonel Attar suddenly betray his patron, Thades, after, for the most part, being a pretty grim ape himself. It didn't seem like a logical course of action for this character. They should have sown the seeds for such an act earlier in the film. I also thought the filmmakers dispatched Sandar too easily. He was the former superior of Thades, but cast into shame when Thades betrayed him, and in the battle scene, where he's supposed to fight his previous protégé, he's intervened by Colonel Attar and defeated in a minute or so. I would have thought such a character, as Sandar, would have deserved a better exit.The ending, high above all things, must be discussed. Naturally, there was a huge amount of pressure on the filmmakers to come up with an ending that would match the original 68-ending, and take it's audience by surprise. It seems to me, that in their desperation to concur such an ending, they exit the film with more questions than answers. *HUGE SPOILER* I see only two possible answers to the end (a) Everything took place on earth all along, and Captain Leo Davidson has only been traveling back and forth in time, as in the original film, or that (b) we are talking about two different planets. If it's the first, (a), then Captain Leo Davidson should have been able to figure all this out, by calculating coordinates and such, but if it's the second, (b), then how in the nine hells did Thades make his way to earth? Puzzling.Tim Roth, who stars as Thades, makes it clear that he's one of the meanest villains out there. Mark Wahlberg is a fine enough actor, who's done better before, that pulls of the part of Captain Leo Davidson quit nice, not being especially heroic, but not too much of an anti-hero either. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Ari, is, next to Tim Roth, the best actor on the cast. Putting Michael Clarke Duncan behind the make-up of Colonel Attar was also a good move on Burton's behalf. First off, because he's big enough to fit the role, and second, because his melancholic eyes are perhaps the only thing that lends credibility to the fact that he chooses to disobey his patron, Thades. Paul Giamatti was superb, creating comical relief with Limbo, the slave trader. Estella Warren, in her skimpy Xena outfit, was incognito at best. So, all in all, as I arrive upon my conclusion, it must be said that THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. The film is clearly less political than it's predecessor. It seems to have no ambitions. It only wants to entertain. And so it does, many thanks to a good cast, great make-up, enough funny scenes, and, last but not least, an excellent villain.

It is amusing to be sure, and downright funny at times, but only in the way that life is in general, even in the wake of tragedy; hence the saying, `That's life.'\tThe story centers on Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere), a gynecologist with a wife, two daughters and a successful practice, who is well liked and admired by his patients.  And he should be; he's good looking and charismatic, but most importantly, he's a good doctor.  But his personal life is quickly becoming something of a shambles.  His eldest daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), is about to be married, his youngest, Connie (Tara Reid), is a conspiracy theory activist and his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), to whom he is devoted, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  He makes a valiant attempt at holding it all together and trying to please everyone, but as always happens in a situation like this, eventually something has to give.  And when it does, it leaves the good doctor at loose ends and forces him to take stock of his life and what it all means, if anything.\tThe first fifteen minutes or so of this movie is so hectic it is nerve-shattering and guaranteed to increase adrenaline levels, and your first reaction may be to scream `Enough already!' as the agitation and anxiety that fills the waiting room of Dr. T's office threatens to explode off the chart.  But discomfiting as it may be at the moment, it really puts you in the story, and in the final analysis it's a good piece of filmmaking by Altman, because it's the turmoil of the waiting room that becomes the manifestation of Dr. T's inner state of confusion and enables you to relate to him, which in turn gives a vital and necessary perspective to the film.\tThe performances are solid, though only a couple stand out as especially noteworthy.  Gere is believable as the doctor (quite unlike Tom Cruise in `Eyes Wide Shut,' who came across as an actor playing a doctor), and maintains the reality of the character by avoiding any superfluous dramatics; he plays him as a man who is what he is and nothing more.

And Farrah Fawcett does a nice job as Kate, but lacks the screen time necessary to really develop her character; the perspective you get of her is established mainly through Dr. T and some of the other characters as they speak of her.\tHudson, Reid and Liv Tyler (Marilyn) are all credible in their respective characters, but there is certainly nothing endearing about any of them.  Not that they are unlikable, but because of the way that Altman presents his characters, these are people about whom it is easy to adopt an ambivalent attitude.

It's a performance that may have worked in live theater, but for the intimacy of film it was too much (Olympia Dukakis had the same problem in `Steel Magnolias).\tRounding out the supporting cast are Robert Hays (Harlan), Matt Malloy (Bill) and Andy Richter (Eli).  Altman has a rather stoic, almost aloof way of telling a story, which makes `Dr. T and the Women' difficult to embrace emotionally, but it is a good story, and the subtlety of the presentation may invite a reflective moment or two.  If you want comedy, look elsewhere; but for an interesting-- though somewhat quirky-- drama, this may fit the bill.  I rate this one 6\/10.       \t  \t \t   ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"11 August 2001","score":"","review":"  This movie by its title is an ordinary and original love story.

The story is based around the Andrea Gail, a fishing boat and her crew of seven.   Though certain parts are well developed, there is something empty about the film.  Some parts of the film are under developed, such as the yacht caught in the same storm, and the injuries that the fisherman get during the hurricanes, they are tossed around the boat like rag dolls, and yet sustain no injuries - HOW?  Two of the fishermen get quite serious injuries, and yet five minutes later they are working again as if nothing happened, how realistic is this?  Not very. The acting is poor, and the only totally convincing character is the weathered old seaman, with the beard, tatty clothes, and an old sailing hat, who is always sitting at the bar reminiscing about the 'good old days'. But then there is one of these in every film, story etc, about the sea. The two main fishermen, Wahlberg and Clooney, look like Hollywood stars trying to be skilled fisherman and act all macho, but they fail miserably - their clothes are too pressed and clean to belong to men that has been at sea for about three weeks. Some of the other actors are more convincing, but not much more, but their clothes are more realistic. The only thing that Wolfgang Peterson gets totally right is the storm.  As the title says, this storm is perfect, but for two reasons.  Reason one, i n real life it was the worst ever recorded storm, and it could not have got any worse.  And reason two, in the film; it is the only thing that Peterson makes actually amazing, the waves, the thunder the lightening, I felt like was in the storm - then there was the acting - what has happened?The film starts with poor acting, the storm commences - now I think that it is going to get interesting, and then the acting is back, oh dear the films back to its no very good storyline. Like in most films about mother nature, there is always a few scenes set in a weather station, with bad actors saying that this storm cannot possibly get any worse, then, yep you have guessed it, it does!  Well, in The Perfect Storm, the actors are exceptionally bad, and there is a man saying 'this can't possibly get any worse', and his secretary is looking like we are all feeling - bored and, like most of us, she does not really care. There is water, water everywhere, but not a plot insight. Wolfgang Peterson has only done one thing correctly.

And what caused the dizzy, shouty one to change to a dizzy one who sometimes only talks loudly?As this was made in the tail end of the 80s the dodgy politics that plagued the early ones are thankfully absent, and there's a better atmosphere too. Okay, Steve Guttenberg no longer being in it automatically takes the smugness level down 50%, but years of critical slating have lent humility to the cast. There's a real air of so bad it's good playing here, rather than the first few where the actors seemed to genuinely believe they had decent material.But it's not all positive, and the absence of other cast members is a worry. Didn't there use to be someone funny in Police Academy? Maybe I imagined it. Still, the loss of Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinksy is something to be noted, and we're left with a pretty asinine bunch. Possibly the worst is Bruce Mahler as Fackler, an accident-prone cop instigating wearily mistimed and predictable slapstick sequences.What's great about the Police Academy series is how it unites everyone - the humour is so low-brow that even really thick people don't find it funny.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"11 August 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  City Under Siege is the sixth of the Police Academy movies, a series of satires on modern America almost Swiftian in their subtlety.To be honest, as a film anorak, I was tempted to give this one a miss, as I hate watching movies out of sequence. Over the years I've possibly seen all of the Academy franchise, but never in order. So coming to this one fresh I felt like I was missing out on all the finely tuned story arcs and character development. Like how did the guy who makes sound effects with his mouth all the time go to just making sound effects quite a lot? And what caused the dizzy, shouty one to change to a dizzy one who sometimes only talks loudly?As this was made in the tail end of the 80s the dodgy politics that plagued the early ones are thankfully absent, and there's a better atmosphere too. Okay, Steve Guttenberg no longer being in it automatically takes the smugness level down 50%, but years of critical slating have lent humility to the cast. There's a real air of so bad it's good playing here, rather than the first few where the actors seemed to genuinely believe they had decent material.But it's not all positive, and the absence of other cast members is a worry. Didn't there use to be someone funny in Police Academy? Maybe I imagined it. Still, the loss of Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinksy is something to be noted, and we're left with a pretty asinine bunch. Possibly the worst is Bruce Mahler as Fackler, an accident-prone cop instigating wearily mistimed and predictable slapstick sequences.What's great about the Police Academy series is how it unites everyone - the humour is so low-brow that even really thick people don't find it funny. I did get a few ironic laughs at how poor some of it was - like Harris running when his feet are stuck through the bottom of a moving van. Generally, though, it's of the strictly lame variety.There are people that could make it work - think of Chaplin, Laurel, Lloyd or Allen superglued to a chair and, even though it's a cheap gag, you might laugh.

Most people consider it to be the best Kevin Smith movie (though the critics and the box office don't agree), but it's bad.  It's still damn funny, but that doesn't make it good.First of all, the plot is horrible.  Now, let's look at Clerks for a second.  It had no plot, which made it get.  IT just followed two guys around.  Anything could have happened.  But Mallrats sticks itself in the side by throwing in a boring and rediculous plot.  What is it, you ask?  Two guys try to win their girl friends back.  Well, it doesn't sound that bad, but the fact the whole movie circulates around a dating game show that is taking place in a mall is sad.  It really is.  It hurts me to think that this was the best plot idea Kevin could think of.  A dating game show in a mall?  Good god that is awful.Another really bad idea was Jerremy London.  The kid can't act.  It isn't all his fault because his character is the basic straight man who's only purpose in the film is to bounce the hilarious jokes from Jason Lee.  I wish Smith had taken some more time with this character, because he sucks.Third bad point it looks and sounds like Universal just didn't care.  The music is, well, too big.  It's hard to say what I mean.  The music is really dramatic and it really doesn't fit the movie well.  There are also these weird, cartoony sound effects that come in that are just awkward.  Also, Jay's performance is a bit over the top.But, on the plus side, Mallrats is hilarious.  There are tons of funny jokes (though they sometimes aren't delevered well do to bad acting), there are some great characters (TS aside), and the witty, offensive Kevin Smith humor is all over this film.Some specific good points The magic eye guy, the escalator joke, the cookie stand speech, Jay and Silent Bob (as usual), when Brodie is on the game show, and the ending scenes (especially when Jay and Silent Bob walk off into the sunset).Overall, the movie is weak, poorly executed, and poorly acted.  It seems more like Smith's first movie than Clerks, even though it isn't.  The whole movie seems like it was made by an amateur, which is weird, because Clerks was so well made (mostly).  But, despite this, the movie is still funny.  While it is the worst Smith movie by far, it isn't the least funniest.

Kevin is a pointless character, he doesn't do anything except talk to his old girlfriend Vicki the whole time, constantly asking her to Catch up and hang out.

The worst part is when the opening scene runs and people have seen the previews and still laugh very hard- why, people?  It doesn't make sense.  Out of all of the scenes in the movie the audience has definitely seen that before.AND YET, between the predictable script, the rerun jokes, the low brow bail out humor (guys kissing, football down low, little kid swearing, monkey drinking alcohol), and the painful acting of Jason Biggs, American pie 2 will somehow make a lot of money.  It makes you wonder....IF they make a third one, I hope they invest a little time in writing characters that we care about and get rid of characters we don't (Shermanator, Jessica, etc.).

With this movie, though, they didn't.American Pie 2 was probably the weakest of sequels in a summer full of sequels.  The jokes are the same, maybe changed just a little.  The characters have nothing no new motivations- they are all just battling the same things as in the first movie.  From Stifler's mom to parents catching Jim in personal moments, the sequel steals, er, borrows from American Pie 1 without a second thought.The result?  One dumb movie.  First of all, Jason Biggs (Jim) is horrible to watch.  You just want to punch him for being so stupid.  The scene where he plays the trombone?  Not the least bit funny.  People laughed- WHY?  Finch is annoying as ever, constantly speaking like he is 50- not in a funny way- but in a really bothersome way that sees him featured for a good part of the movie when he is better as a supporting character- a very small supporting character.  Kevin is a pointless character, he doesn't do anything except talk to his old girlfriend Vicki the whole time, constantly asking her to Catch up and hang out.  This also means Vicky is a waste of time, as is Oz, who somehow became a complete neutered male from the beginning of the first film.  He is an entirely different person even from the end of that one- does anyone care?  Jessica and Heather- great to see people from the first one, but do they add anything?  No.The only thing this movie does is play Stifler well.  He essentially has to strap the movie on his back and carry it because everyone else is boring. How does he do this?  He says the F-word- a lot.  This even loses humor after 50 times, so by the end you wish you never spent the 6.50 to watch this junk.

Okay, so the way the hospital is run is pretty ridiculous - seven doctors in a hospital THAT of that size is a bit stupid, but Michael Myers' continuation of October 31, 1978 is just as scary as the first. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are as excellent as ever, as are the rest of the cast. The movie has some cool make-up effects for the era and this film (along with Halloween (1978), Halloween 4 (1988), and Tenebrae (1982)) are the only horror films I have found truly scary. Even though the plot has been extended from Part 1 - one of the scariest things in the first - it still scary to see THAT mask, THOSE defenseless women and hear THAT scream. This is definitely one for a group of friends. Everyone that's watched it with me has screamed, jumped, or seen Michael Myers emerge from the shadows in their bedroom that night. An under-rated classic, and probably (along with Aliens) one of the only sequels that lives up to the original. Here's to Halloween 8!

The show featured a half-man, half-robot, half-witted policeman (voiced flawlessly by Don Adams of Get Smart fame) and his adventures solving crimes with MUCH assistance from his niece Penny and faithful dog Brain. Having loved the TV show immensely, I immediately saw the film upon its release. Now there's one 5 dollar bill I'd like back.I should have known how bad the movie version would be - having seen the bad commercials and the inevitable McDonald's promotional tie-ins. And to top it all off, the movie was produced by Disney - notorious for butchering perfectly good source material for their own profit. Just look at The Jungle Book and The Little Mermaid, movie adaptations that are far from what the original authors of each respective work had in mind. Disney has once again chopped up its source material - this time one of my favorite cartoons.Matthew Broderick is the predictably youthful choice to play Gadget, the man with more inventions than a swiss army knife and less brain cells than an organ grinding monkey. Had Disney wanted to make a movie more pleasing to a broader audience the natural choice to play Gadget would have been the voice of Gadget himself - Don Adams. Even considering that this is a kids movie, Broderick is extremely hammy and not at all funny as Gadget. Equally bad is Rupert Everett as Claw - he's about as intimidating as a housewife with a bad manicure.The good news is the supporting cast is solid. Michele Tractenberg makes a good Penny (although the cartoon Penny was blonde, not brunette) and Dabney Coleman is good as Chief Quimby. Cheri Oteri as the mayor and DL Hughley as voice of the Gadget mobile are also solid for the few scenes they appear in. Joely Fisher is good as Gadget's love interest.The worst news is that the movie ignores almost everything fans loved about the cartoon. Penny is nowhere near as smart as she was in the cartoon and Gadget nowhere near as dumb. It is apparent that no one involved in the making of the film knew anything about the material upon which the film was based. The Gadget-copter is called a Gadget-chopper and even Gadget's catch phrase Wowsers! is sans the 's'. While some criticize the cartoon as being empty-headed and formulaic, the movie is dumber and scatterbrained. It seems like the filmmakers filmed a bunch of stuff they thought would be entertaining and filled in the gaps as they went along. The plot is so scattered - the evil Gadget subplot seems tacked on - that it makes no sense whatsover.No doubt kids, who care nothing about plot and will laugh at anything will find this movie entertaining. The old fans of the cartoon will groan in pain though. The movie gets a 9 for some nostalgic value and a -1 for entertainment value.
