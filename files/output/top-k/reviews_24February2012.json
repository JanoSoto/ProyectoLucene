Now, if this was a recent movie it would be a much more believable film, seeing that Elijah Wood (let's face it here) mostly plays wussies and Macaulay Culkin, well... looks like a psychopath. But this movie came out in 1993, thus Elijah was about twelve and Culkin about 13 years old (even though he still looks like he's going to put his hands on his cheeks and deliver an over the top scream at any moment throughout the whole film), so you can imagine how that works. It doesn't, I would say if it didn't, but it strangely does.Now, don't get me wrong, I was never really frightened by Culkin in this movie, but firstly whoever expects of someone to make Macaulay Culkin look bad ass, has a big freaking faith in mankind and secondly Joseph Ruben manages to make him at least a little intimidating throughout most of the movie (you have to give him credit for that, whoever that guy is) and by most of the movie I mean roughly the first half. But I think that's because of the human nature. Man, at some point had to realize that this guy who threatened to pull down his loincloth all the time was just a plastic puppet, made by big Hollywood corporations to make money. In other words; at some point in the movie that varies from human to human Macaulay Culkin stops looking intimidating and just starts to annoy the f**k out of you, until you just want to strangle him to death. And you know why? Because you CAN! For granted if you showed this movie to a six-year-old, he will most likely get scared, but anyone older than eleven is just too much. I mean what would you do if Macaulay Culkin just came over to your house trying to play sick games with you? That's right! You would give him a punch in his god damned face and that would most certainly shut him up for good. So, I'm sorry for talking about Culkin for so long but it just has got to be addressed what a miscast this is. Giving a boy who's one and only strength is to look cutesy in front of the camera a role in which he has to do anything BUT looking cutesy in front of the camera is something that should be reconsidered before you wake up after a long night with various contract assignments nobody can remember and you notice it's too late.So how about that Elijah Wood guy? I heard he was in this movie too! Well he is and he is our main hero. The whole story is told from his point of view (which left many people to think that in fact Macaulay Culkin was the good son and Wood just changed the story to his advantage, although the writer never confirmed it and there would be some plot holes if this was the case) and he's pretty good in his role. He's not great, but he sure as hell is not bad. He's supposed to be the innocent one, who gets drawn into the s**t Culkin produces, but oddly enough he has his psycho moments too. I won't spoil it for you, but you will definitely know which scenes I mean once you get there. He is kind of shallow, but you still care for him. Nothing more to say than a nice main character, but nothing more.Okay, now on to the story. I can imagine that writer and great novelist Ian McEwan did not have the face of Richie Rich in mind when he wrote the script, so I guess he did a great job. The ones who screwed it up in that part were the filmmakers. This could have been a real gripping and horrifying movie, but instead they just went up to the first hobo they saw on the highway who did not have a shotgun with him. I think Ian deserved better, because he couldn't have known that the cigarette would be smoked by every momma's dream Culkin and would become my wallpaper for the next five years.So anyway, the story itself had real great potential, mainly the ending is really good and it actually did translate well to film, but it has some things to it that stand in the way for a real coherent movie experience. For what it is you get a good, entertaining movie, that's neither too short nor too long and that's while not being gripping throughout the whole movie partially really intense.

Another one of David Lynchs strengths is to get top rate performances from otherwise mediocre stars. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty are the two middle-weight male leads and in my opinion this is both of these gents greatest performances, both oozing mystery and a large portion of suave, its almost as if they had transported straight from a 40's noir movie. For me though its Patricia Arquette who really nails it in Lost Highway, an actress who I previously have never found attractive or found especially entertaining but in Lost Highway she is completely transformed into a Goddess and you find it hard to take your eyes from the screen whenever she appears. This film isn't as good as either Mulholland Drive or the earlier Blue Velvet but if Lynchs movies are your thing then this film will be right up your street.

Some off the scenes are hard to bare, such as the rape and torture and attempted murder off little Tanya, a scene that was portrayed to show the true horror of the act and yet it was not filmed in an overly explicit or indecent manner. Many peoples problem with this film seems to be that Carl Lee acts as a vigilante, he takes the law into his own hands and serves out a punishment that while illegal the movie still portrays him as the good guy. But isn't he? Yes he shot those to men (I use this word lightly) and yes he feels no regret but would any one is his shoes? I understood his reasoning, those men raped, tortured and tried to kill his daughter twice, first by hanging then by throwing her from a bridge and while his daughter may have survived, she is undoubtedly damaged, not only mentally but also physically as she is not able to have children after the attack. Could any parent stand that happening to their baby and not be driven to actions that they would normally consider themselves incapable of, especially if there was a good chance that the people responsible would walk free, if not instantly in a few short years? The question is, when the law fails to uphold justice, whose responsibility is it to punish the guilty? Who has the right to be judge, jury and executioner? Can anyone really say his actions where unjustified, can any parent say that they would do otherwise in his situation, not only as revenge but to prevent it from happening again. I do not favor violence, I do not consider myself aggressive but I felt nothing but satisfaction watching those two men die and why? Because they deserved to be punished and there was to high a chance they wouldn't be with the judicial system.The acting in this movie is superb, the only characters I thought a little 2D where the KKK members, it was as though saying These people are in the KKK, they are bad, they are bad because they are in the KKK was enough, that, I found unsatisfying. Otherwise every character had depth, good qualities and flaws and they all went on their own journeys that all begin the day that little girl is subjected to the most unimaginable cruelty. She sparks change and struggle and the struggle of the other characters can be paralleled to the struggle she will face for the rest of her life. This film makes you think, it gives you time to question and it gives you time to come to your own conclusions. The pace is perfect, The score chilling. The morals admirable. The story heartbreaking. This film is about race, but it is about more than that. It's about family, love, hate, revenge and human nature. I loved almost everything about the film, having said that it was not perfect, claiming insanity was foolish as the act was clearly premeditated several hours before the fact thus he was of sane mind, the closing statement is unrealistic and it does not keep in ties with the Insanity plea, it is more an emotional appeal. The KKK as I said before are a bit 2D and some off the scenes are a little cliché but the overall movie is still brilliant. If there is one way to wrap this movie up, it is the scene between Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson, when Spacey's character (the Prosecutor) asks Jackson's character (the defendant) whether or not he believes in a sane state of mind, the two men he killed deserved to die, unwilling to answer at first as he is trying to act as though he killed them in an state of mind where he was unstable, Jackson does not answer at first however driven to anger by the prosecutions repeated questions he bellows in response, Yes they deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell. and if you watch this movie, wait till that moment and see if you disagree with him.

I purchased the movie on iTunes a few days later and found myself unable to turn away from the screen, no matter how badly I wanted to. Some off the scenes are hard to bare, such as the rape and torture and attempted murder off little Tanya, a scene that was portrayed to show the true horror of the act and yet it was not filmed in an overly explicit or indecent manner. Many peoples problem with this film seems to be that Carl Lee acts as a vigilante, he takes the law into his own hands and serves out a punishment that while illegal the movie still portrays him as the good guy. But isn't he? Yes he shot those to men (I use this word lightly) and yes he feels no regret but would any one is his shoes? I understood his reasoning, those men raped, tortured and tried to kill his daughter twice, first by hanging then by throwing her from a bridge and while his daughter may have survived, she is undoubtedly damaged, not only mentally but also physically as she is not able to have children after the attack. Could any parent stand that happening to their baby and not be driven to actions that they would normally consider themselves incapable of, especially if there was a good chance that the people responsible would walk free, if not instantly in a few short years? The question is, when the law fails to uphold justice, whose responsibility is it to punish the guilty? Who has the right to be judge, jury and executioner? Can anyone really say his actions where unjustified, can any parent say that they would do otherwise in his situation, not only as revenge but to prevent it from happening again. I do not favor violence, I do not consider myself aggressive but I felt nothing but satisfaction watching those two men die and why? Because they deserved to be punished and there was to high a chance they wouldn't be with the judicial system.The acting in this movie is superb, the only characters I thought a little 2D where the KKK members, it was as though saying These people are in the KKK, they are bad, they are bad because they are in the KKK was enough, that, I found unsatisfying. Otherwise every character had depth, good qualities and flaws and they all went on their own journeys that all begin the day that little girl is subjected to the most unimaginable cruelty. She sparks change and struggle and the struggle of the other characters can be paralleled to the struggle she will face for the rest of her life. This film makes you think, it gives you time to question and it gives you time to come to your own conclusions. The pace is perfect, The score chilling. The morals admirable. The story heartbreaking. This film is about race, but it is about more than that. It's about family, love, hate, revenge and human nature. I loved almost everything about the film, having said that it was not perfect, claiming insanity was foolish as the act was clearly premeditated several hours before the fact thus he was of sane mind, the closing statement is unrealistic and it does not keep in ties with the Insanity plea, it is more an emotional appeal.

Classic Samurai films, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Buck Rodgers. He took a clash of the greatest adventures of the first half of the twentieth century and brought them all into a single, sublime movie.Read\/seen\/played a kid with his parents\/guardians murdered by the bad guys? Or a slightly mysterious\/wise\/cooky old teacher to teach the protagonist the ways of whatever? Or perhaps a grinning, sarcastic buddy that gets the protagonist out of trouble? Odds are if it was made sometime past 1977 you have Star Wars to thank for that.Heck, the very idea of background characters being named and rising to prominence is thanks to this movie.

Isabelle Huppert runs with the ball. She's a distinguished professor of music in Paris. Students compete for admission to her Master Class in piano.I'm not sure why. She's evidently an inspiring teacher. She obviously loves music. But, my God, is she demanding. And stern and distant and icy. Her hair is severely swept back and she never smiles. She has no sense of humor, no role distance, and her ordinary social graces are no better than perfunctory. You get a feeling that if she stared at you too long you'd turn into an ice sculpture than only faintly resembled your original self.I had judged -- from the DVD case cover, showing her struggling in a kiss with a younger man while kneeling on a bathroom floor -- that this was going to be a sort of Lolita with the genders reversed, some kind of pathetic tragedy. Beautiful sexual interludes with softly billowing curtains and scented candles, ending with a funeral in the rain.But, no. It's pretty good. As for the performances, we have the central figure of the middle-aged spinster Huppert, locked into her frigid respectability. And then there is Annie Girardot as her disputatious and domineering mother, Girardot who was a sexy presence all over the screen in the 1960s, now become a magnificent wreck. The passing years do that to everyone except me. I seem to grow more youthfully radiant with every passing day. Benoît Magimel is tall, muscular, handsome, and a talented if flippant pianist in her class, but if at first he's an ardent admirer, maybe a little too ardent, he becomes a cipher.Well, we know ahead of time that Huppert is going to bust loose. She has to, otherwise we have a pretty dreary film experience ahead of us. And she does bust loose, but not in ways anyone might expect. She's utterly sexless until she boldly walks into some sort of porno shop, rents a booth, and watches skin flicks without any expression. Then she picks up a discarded tissue from the floor and holds it against her nose. A little twisted, if you ask me. And not just that, but she perches on the rim of her bath tub, spreads her legs, reaches up into her crotch, fiddles around and winces. Okay. We're all adults so we think we know what's up. But then she withdraws her hand and we see that it's holding a razor blade, and we notice a trickle of blood running into the tub. This is many leagues away from soft core porn.The first half ends with her responding to Magimel's protestations of love but again not in the way we might expect. She deliberately arouses Magimel physically on that bathroom floor but leaves him hanging, exiting with an expression of disdain. Later, despite her mother's strenuous objections she takes Magimel into her bedroom. She takes him; she doesn't invite him. And she makes him read aloud the terms of her agreement with him before they engage in any hanky panky. She wants to be blindfolded, slapped, tied up really tight, and made to rim him. That's -- how you say? -- degoutant.That's about the half-way point. After that the movie more or less collapses and throws logic and character to the winds. Magimel, after reading her list of demands, calls her pathetic and sick. He tells her she needs treatment. Then he stalks out of the bedroom, offended, revolted. Any normal kid his age would try to talk her down, negotiate with her. How about if we eliminate Demand Number Five?, or something. But his change in attitude is instantaneous and resolute.It gets worse. He barges into her apartment in the middle of the night, locks the howling mother in her room, and begins slapping and kicking Huppert around on the floor before more or less raping her almost lifeless body in its blood-splashed nightgown. She lies there numb while he makes some stupid remarks about this being what she wanted. Then he leaves her flat. I won't give away the climactic scene.That first half is very good, though, partly because there are some satisfying snatches of classical music -- Bach and some others but most Schubert. Some of today's younger audiences might expect to be intimidated, bored, or both -- but would they be right?

The names of Rex Harrison, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and many others, drew attention, and swayed opinion in terms of show business.So it was that Cleopatra was produced. Originally envisioned as a quick turnaround and stop gap measure to earn a quick buck (relatively speaking), the project became a colossal endeavor. Egos drove the project forward, and with interesting results.What we have here is a film created from, by and for the hubris of those involved and downright popularity. As such we have elaborate sets that only loosely resemble what may have been the Ancient World of Rome, Greece, Egypt, Macedonia, Germania, et al. Art-deco meets ancient Rome, complete with interior design and architecture that Frank Lloyd Wright himself might've influenced during the design of the sets; along with feminine fashions drawn right out of early 1960's fashion runways. Was this really how Classic People lived and dressed? Probably not.There are of course Burton and Taylor, or Taylor and Burton (whichever way you choose to put it), who added much needed pre-publicity to a project that was costing millions in early 1960's dollars (when we were still on the gold standard). Result; in the end what you have is a kind of overblown high-school production in terms of the emotional maturity of both those participating in it, and those who desired to see it. But, they pull it off nevertheless.The low points are the battle scenes. For a film that spent much on bringing new heights to the sword-and-sandal epic, the actual military engagements aren't much to look at. We're not watching Spartacus here, a film that gave a lot of attention to dramatic and historic detail, nor even Ridley Scott's more contemporary Gladiator where gritty realism was the order of the day, but rather production hubris in terms of striving for popularity than a true first class production. We see few troops engaged in battle, only a smattering of formations, and model boats interspersed with footage of Egyptian and Roman war galleys. Yet, for all that, it is an impressive production in terms of what went into it. I'd heard much about the film growing up, and saw portions of it here and there (all be it chopped up for broadcast). In the end it is, as with all films, a product of its time. It's not a film that I think has any great import other than the media splash it created back when it was being made.

The acting is borderline melodramatic, the special effects are what they are The live effects are impressive, while the miniatures are paltry. Composition of shots are respectable; actors must carry the scenes as opposed to quick edits so prevalent in today's offerings.Like I say, I'm not a huge fan of the film, but it is an impressive effort for what it is.

Cleopatra was made in the day and age when star-power had more command than ever before or since, and dictated what people watched, wanted, and desired more of. The names of Rex Harrison, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and many others, drew attention, and swayed opinion in terms of show business.So it was that Cleopatra was produced. Originally envisioned as a quick turnaround and stop gap measure to earn a quick buck (relatively speaking), the project became a colossal endeavor. Egos drove the project forward, and with interesting results.What we have here is a film created from, by and for the hubris of those involved and downright popularity. As such we have elaborate sets that only loosely resemble what may have been the Ancient World of Rome, Greece, Egypt, Macedonia, Germania, et al. Art-deco meets ancient Rome, complete with interior design and architecture that Frank Lloyd Wright himself might've influenced during the design of the sets; along with feminine fashions drawn right out of early 1960's fashion runways. Was this really how Classic People lived and dressed? Probably not.There are of course Burton and Taylor, or Taylor and Burton (whichever way you choose to put it), who added much needed pre-publicity to a project that was costing millions in early 1960's dollars (when we were still on the gold standard). Result; in the end what you have is a kind of overblown high-school production in terms of the emotional maturity of both those participating in it, and those who desired to see it. But, they pull it off nevertheless.The low points are the battle scenes. For a film that spent much on bringing new heights to the sword-and-sandal epic, the actual military engagements aren't much to look at. We're not watching Spartacus here, a film that gave a lot of attention to dramatic and historic detail, nor even Ridley Scott's more contemporary Gladiator where gritty realism was the order of the day, but rather production hubris in terms of striving for popularity than a true first class production. We see few troops engaged in battle, only a smattering of formations, and model boats interspersed with footage of Egyptian and Roman war galleys. Yet, for all that, it is an impressive production in terms of what went into it. I'd heard much about the film growing up, and saw portions of it here and there (all be it chopped up for broadcast). In the end it is, as with all films, a product of its time. It's not a film that I think has any great import other than the media splash it created back when it was being made. After all, that is what show business is all about.Technically; shot in ToddAO, the film has a slightly more realistic look in terms of the cinematography than other sword-and-sandal films being shot and released at the time. The acting is borderline melodramatic, the special effects are what they are The live effects are impressive, while the miniatures are paltry. Composition of shots are respectable; actors must carry the scenes as opposed to quick edits so prevalent in today's offerings.Like I say, I'm not a huge fan of the film, but it is an impressive effort for what it is. Certainly worth a look if you've not seen it before, but I'm not sure it's worth viewing again unless you're from those times, and reliving past glories.Watch at your own risk.

Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his varied disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the alias Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage.He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped.Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protects both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys.The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

Friday has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel Next Friday (2000).Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, Friday is somewhat of a parody of films such as Boyz N the Hood (1991) and Menace II Society (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of Boyz and Menace (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood) and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that Friday still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, Friday critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana).A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in Friday, which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny Zeus Lister, Jr.).Friday really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie.Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop\/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked G-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk\/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 1995's Friday is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s.
