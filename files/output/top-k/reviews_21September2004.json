There are a lot of great films, great because of the way they advanced the art of film, which don't burn their way into your brain and heart the way Kane does, finding new ways to amaze every time you watch it. The wonder of Kane 63 years later is not only its greatness, but how much doggone fun it is.Orson Welles made a film so electric, so outrageous, so simultaneously joyous and sad, it's a wonder it did as well as it did, getting nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and winning the prize for best screenplay. So ahead of its time in so many ways, it's a wonder too RKO ever released the thing, even without significant pressure from William Randolph Hearst to destroy the movie because he believed, not completely correctly, that it was all a big dig at him.Kane manages to be entertaining from first to last. Its quick cuts and clever transitions have only benefited from the MTV generation like few films of its time, yet it also retains a certain classic Hollywood grandeur, in its gaslit sets, black-and-white compositions, Joseph Cotten's marcelled hair, and the endlessly quotable dialogue.And it's often hilarious, too. Sometimes in very overt, slapstick ways, like Signore Matiste's music lessons to the impossibly amateurish Susan Alexander Kane. Sometimes in cleverly sardonic ways, like when we see Bernstein examining the alternative headlines the morning after Kane's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. There's more subtle jests, some which require multiple viewings. I just caught one, where Kane first makes the acquaintance of Susan Alexander by taking her up on her offer of hot water. She provides the hot water alright, as Boss Gettys makes sure.Welles performs the rare trick of making intelligence fun, his own as well as the viewer's. It's a magic show that has lost none of its power all these decades later.Welles was only 25 when he directed and starred in this, his first real film role, but he already made his mark on popular culture as something of a trickster in 1938, when he convinced millions of radio listeners the Earth was under Martian attack in his adaptation of The War Of The Worlds. Kane starts out with similar trickery, putting up a fake newsreel of the kind moviegoers were accustomed to seeing back then. Welles himself was quoted as saying the whole identity of Rosebud was a bit of a blind alley, dime-store Freud he called it, but the notion works, not only in setting up an air of mystery to the proceedings (shades of film noir, the genre that immediately succeeded Hollywood's Golden Age that concluded with Kane) but asking a question that Welles' own life seems to beg in retrospect. When is greatness enough for its own sake, and when is it just a way people isolate themselves from the rest of humanity?It's a shame that Kane didn't launch a series of Mercury Theatre productions, not just the truncated Magnificent Ambersons and the weird Journey Into Fear but a slew of other films, as Welles and his team once envisioned. It fed a bit of a myth, of Welles as an artistic martyr. Welles did suffer from his vision, but he also suffered from being Welles, impossible, petulant, and mercurial. Kane suffers a bit, too, seen too often as a start not followed through on by its prime creator than as a brilliant individual achievement that has fed so many other great minds since its release.A couple of reviews down, someone calls this another boring black and white film, and I almost peed in my pants.

Not from anger, but laughter. People can think what they want about Kane, and they will anyway, but as Matiste would say, some people have it, and some don't. Give it a chance; you won't be sorry.

They are three drag queens. The best in Sydney, who want to spend the next four weeks traveling to this casino to perform their performance of a life time. There is Adam Whitely, also known as Felicia Jollygoodfellow (Guy Pearce). He is the classic drag queen. Constantly looking for a good time. Very comfortable in his lifestyle, and always looking for a chance to be in the spotlight. Pearce adds most of the comedy to the trip and perhaps some of the best costumes that these ladies have to wear. There is also Anthony Tick Belrose (Hugo Weaving), also known as Mitzi Del Bra. He is the secretive drag queen. We learn that he is married, he has a child, and that he is afraid of his profession. Quite possibly the best performer in the group, he provides a sense of leadership to the group. He is the one that organized this trip, and the one who's wife works at the casino, and set up this gig for them. Finally, there is the elder of the group. The experienced drag queen, Ralph, also known as Bernadette Bassenger. He is almost like the Yoda of the group. Shouting out lessons that need to be learned, he plays the complete opposite to Pearce's character. After buying a bus it to travel through the outback, they christen it Priscilla. After a few road bumps such as stops in other locations, a Chinese ping-pong lady, a group of violent mates, and even love. As they make it to the casino, our group hits their final snag as they struggle for acceptance in an unchanged world.This was a horrible film. Not just horrible, but also confusing, plot less, motionless, and uneventful. Yes, I realize many of those words mean the same, but they all happened in this film. My first problem was that I had trouble trying to see who the stand-out character was. Normally in films, you have that one character that has more screen time, more sub-stories, more character development. While I first thought that it was going to be Weaving's character, during the bus trip through the outback, I began to question my initial guess. I feel that if we wanted to have the emotional impact at the end of the film for Weaving's reuniting with his son, then perhaps we should have spend less time with Stamp as we traveled. I felt that midway through the film, Stamp became the central character because of his love towards Bob. If this is the case, was the director trying to create the theme of acceptance towards same sex characters, or was he trying to show the theme of acceptance of who you are and not to be afraid to be proud. I felt that these themes broke down like Priscilla in the outback.Not only were the themes jumbled, but so were these characters. I realize that Stamp was nominated for some awards for this role, but I honestly felt like he, along with the rest of the cast, were just walking through some lines and blocking. During their songs, I felt that they were acting. I never once felt a connection to these characters. Colorful costumes do not make a better actor. Terence Stamp hardly smiled in what I felt was supposed to be a fun character. I need to also say this, if you are going to make a film about lip singing to songs, make sure that your actors know the lyrics. About ten times I saw them, especially Stamp, flub his lines.Finally, there was not enough development at all with Pearce's character. I felt that if anything he was just annoying. Not really contributing anything to the actual story other then the occasional joke or reference, he seemed to just float through every scene on just his physical appearance. Did he need to have his shirt off for every scene? Overall, the costumes were great...but don't make this the focus of your film. I enjoyed the beauty of the costumes in the desert...seemed to strike me as religious in some way.

This time it's the traveling carnival complete with creepy funhouse serving as the back drop for said peril. Four teens agree to sneak inside the funhouse and spend the night. OK brilliant!! They witness a murder within the funhouse, committed by the barkers freak son. The son is the deformed product of a sexual liaison between the gruff funhouse barker and a cow?!!? Talk about the plot thickening. If you pay close attention you also learn the monster was a twin, the other child not surviving birth and thus being put on display in a formaldehyde jar and appropriately named Tad. The teens are discovered by the father and son and the terror begins. Despite being a slobbering albino freak-a-zoid (come on and wind him up) the deformed monster son is the only character you feel for. The murder he commits is out of simple mindedness and sexual frustration. It is the father who is really the more sinister villain of the pair and he generates further sympathy for the monster by being quite abusive to him, his son. This movie is fairly maligned and it shouldn't be. It's one of Tobe Hoopers better efforts. People need to realize that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre really isn't as fantastic as they try and paint it. It's a great film but peoples love for it more comes out of the(then)bold subject matter and few strong shocks than the films direction or style. I'd wager if it had come second or third in Hoopers career it'd not be so widely cherished. The Funhouse would be just as strong a film had it been as streamlined as TCM. Its main flaw to me is its runtime, padded early on with needless dialogue and a few scenes that do not add anything to the film.

'Jeepers Creepers' exploited this, by bringing you a terrifying road movie with a twist. Roadkill (or Joy Ride &#150; US Title) takes the road movie down a slightly different route. Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn) are two brothers heading to pick up Venna (Sobieski), a friend of Lewis'. On the way, they decide to have a bit of fun with the CB Radio, and wind up the lonely truckers. Using the alias 'candycane', they get in contact with 'Rusty Nail'. They decide to take the joke a little further. After fuller has a particularly nasty encounter with a guy at a motel, they invite rusty to the guys room. Lewis and Fuller are in the room next door, waiting. When muffled noises and thuds can be heard, they soon realize that the joke will soon be on them. The next morning, the police are surrounding the place, as the guy in the next room is viciously attacked. It soon becomes apparent 'Rusty' doesn't like jokes, and a game of cat and mouse ensues, as the vengeful trucker chases them down.The movie has an interesting premise, and has all the ingredients to be successful, but somehow falls flat. The script doesn't always hit the right notes, and can leave you feeling a little bit flat. However, there are some genuinely tense moments, and the ending had me biting my nails until the conclusion.

He has a very interesting possibility relating to the role of religion as yet another alternative to drab existences. He also has an opportunity to delve into the compelling world of religious fanaticism and the kinds of forces that would prompt a mother to kill her child. Tolkin's movie offers tip of the iceberg glimpses of both themes but ultimately fails to deliver real satisfaction on either score.I'll address the religious theme first. Many reviewers seem to think that the religious group that Sharon (Mimi Rodgers) joins is a fundamentalist Christian sect, portrayed in a non-judgmental way. Some of the beliefs depicted in the film do share points of contact with American fundamentalist Christian groups, but nothing more than that. The emphasis on the importance of the mysterious child, for example, is not something that any fundamentalist Christian group would espouse. Similarly, the lengthy exposition of the pearl of great price is not a major point for American fundamentalists. Therein lies part of the problem with Tolkin's take on American religion. He seems to want to portray a fundamentalist sect, but gets the details rather garbled and ends up with a mishmash of ideas and beliefs which individually can be found in some identifiable Christian groups, but are nowhere found in the combination in which they are presented in this film. Rightly, many fundamentalist Christian groups were highly offended by this caricature of true believers. Sharon is a born again Christian in no sense other than the sense created by Tolkin for purposes of making the movie. Being true to a particular version of American Protestant Christianity is beside the point, however, and that's why Tolkin would have been better advised to avoid some of the mangled theology he attempted to present and focus instead on the dynamics of fanaticism. Clearly, there is no more fanatical act than killing one's own young child for the sake of religious belief. Yet that theme is not only present in this film, it also presents itself in one of the oldest recorded tales of the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament to Christians). In the book of Genesis, the story is told of Abraham being ordered by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Abraham does not understand the command. God gave Isaac to Abraham and his wife, Sarah, in their old age and promised Abraham that Isaac would carry forward the promise of God to Abraham to make a great people of Abraham's descendants. In the biblical story, God tests Abraham and Abraham proves faithful. He carries out every preparatory step to sacrifice Isaac to God, but then God calls off the killing of Isaac and provides a lamb for sacrifice instead. In Tolkin's vision, God does not call off the sacrifice. The question is, did God call for it in the first place? Of course it was the little girl who came up with the idea, but what kind of adult would agree to the scheme?There's the religious story of this movie that Tolkin leaves largely untouched. For the sake of space, I won;t launch on the rapture itself. Suffice it to say that Tolkin chose to depict those events in a manner fairly close to the literal unfolding as presented in the Book of Revelation. I am curious as to what Tolkin thought was happening in those scenes. There are many fundamentalists who adhere to the notion that a literal unfolding of the events depicted in Revelation is bound to happen. They also maintain, however, that true believers will be taken up into heaven either before anything bad happens, or in the midst of the evil events, or not until the very end (pre-Tribulation rapture vs. mid-Tribulation rapture vs. post-Tribulation rapture). While Tolkin could not let himself get bogged down into those sometimes obscure details, Sharon's continued presence on earth would suggest to the pre-tribulation rapture believers that Sharon was not a true believer at all. Finally, I wanted to address the other theme in this movie that Tolkin failed to follow through to its conclusion. That is the theme of monotony. At the beginning of the film, Sharon is depicted as being stuck with a mind-numbing repetitive job with long-distance information. In an effort to bring some excitement in her life, she engages in a random acts of sexual adventure with multiple partners. But in the main scene depicting such an encounter, Sharon looks just as bored and unfulfilled by random group sex as she is by answering telephones all day. Into that mix comes this life-changing religious conversion. The fascinating question would have been whether that new life would also have bogged down into monotony had it carried on for a time. Tolkin does not probe that issue, suggesting instead that perhaps religious fanaticism is the answer to boredom in life.

If you are a die hard collector like myself and want to make sure you get all the sequels then my suggestion is spend as less money as possible on it. Anything over $5.00 would be looney. If you can tape it off of television when it comes on that would be best then you only out a blank videotape.

It is true that this isn't his best work (that would be Annie Hall), but The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is still a very nice movie. It lacks the depth that most of Woody's body of work has, but the void that is left by the lack of depth is filled by a great sense of fun; and that is a welcome replacement. As usual, Woody Allen stars, this time as C.W. Brigs, an insurance claims investigator. Woody Allen is his usual, neurotic self and his character makes a nice change from the sort of detective we are used to; i.e. strong, tough and dangerous. As it happens, this stereotype of an investigator comes out more in his opposite number; Helen Hunt. Hunt plays Betty-Ann Fitzgerald; a woman who has been brought in to streamline the company that Allen works for. Helen Hunt's character is one of those 'strong women', she herself says that she can do anything a man can do, and judging by her character; she probably can. Starring alongside these two are Dan Akroyd and Charlize Theron; in the roles of a fellow insurance man and a femme fatale respectively.The story is rather silly, and it follows Woody Allen and Helen Hunt, who are hypnotised into doing the bidding of a criminal mastermind. It is rather strange seeing Woody Allen in a film like this, mostly due to the fact that we're used to seeing him in more realistic films. Helen Hunt is a welcome addition to any film; she has a great persona, and she works well with Allen here. The two are very believable as a couple of people that hate each other, and that, coupled with Woody Allen's dialogue makes for a very nice partnership. Woody Allen has written better films than this one, but the dialogue here is worth a mention. Some of Woody's lines are priceless (you'd take your word over mine?), and a lot of the other dialogue had me in stitches. He has written funnier dialogue than this; but that's not to say that the dialogue here isn't hilarious. The support cast don't come off as well on the dialogue front as the two leads do, as Woody Allen has grossly underwritten them. His characterization isn't brilliant in this film, not even for the main characters; but as I said, this movie is clearly meant to be fun, and therefore it doesn't matter as much as it would if he had underwritten his characters in one of his more serious movies. From it's two fantastic leads, to it's hilarious dialogue; The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a winner all the way. Don't watch it and think of how great some of Allen's other movies are, just look at it what it is; an entertaining crime caper with a neurotic central character. You won't be disappointed if you do.

I'm convinced that Disney had to tear us down just so they could build us back up, my goodness, we are Disney Marines! Bambi is one of the training videos to make us tough, because if you can make it through this film without crying that proves that you have no heart and are dead inside. Bambi despite being one of the saddest movies of all time still has a lot of heart and is one of the best in the Disney classics. With it's beautiful animation, charming characters and breathtaking story this is a movie that no one should miss.In a forest thicket, a doe gives birth to a fawn whom she names Bambi. After he learns to walk, Bambi befriends Thumper, a young rabbit; then, while learning to talk, Bambi meets a young skunk whom he calls Flower. After Bambi has completely learned how to talk, his mother takes him to the meadow, a place that is both wonderful and frightening. Bambi's mother warns him that deer are unprotected in the meadow as there are no trees or bushes to hide them, so they must take great care for their own safety. Bambi and his mother go to the meadow and discover a patch of new grass, as they eat, his mother senses a hunter and orders Bambi to flee. As they run, gun shots ring out.

They told me that since it was written by a Canadian that that alone made it great. Suspicious of wartime romance movies, I declined. After its release on video I decided to give it a try. An hour into it I knew why I had skipped this awful, stereotypical movie. I could not subject myself to 2 more hours of unnnnngggghhhhh!'The English Patient' is nothing more than an overrated, formula-using wartime romance with a pace that more resembles geological time scales than human. The plot itself - battle-injured soldier develops romance with nurse - is a cliché-ridden, often-used formula. Admittedly, there are some deviations from this - the man's terminal injuries, the additional characters of the young Sikh and the thief, but they are not enough to save this long-drawn-out, thoroughly DULL film. Nor is the photography, which so many people and critics laud as contributing to this film's misplaced 'masterpiece' status.
