[{"date":"30 April 2005","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"30 April 2005","score":"","review":" Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an unwanted, hated ogre that lives deep in the forest. But soon his quiet, secluded life is disturbed when heartless ruler, Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) when an law is passed to remove all fairy creatures and dump them in Shrek's swamp. While in this chaos, Shrek meets Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) and reluctantly sets off on a journey to Lord Farquaad's palace to get the creatures moved. After an encounter with soldiers in Farquaad's Disney-designed palace, he is told that they must go on a journey to retrieve Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) from a castle so Farquaad may marry her. This is the only way Shrek may get his swamp back.Shrek, the film, is filled with Disney characters such as Three Blind Mice, Sleeping Beauty, Pinnochio, and Robin Hood (I'm not sure if he is a Disney character or not). Shrek, the character, is voiced by Mike Myers in a Scottish accent and is funny as the over-sized, green ogre. Donkey has the most laughs in the film, he is filled with comedy and is visually amazing with the design of massive castles, a fire-breathing dragon who falls in love with Donkey, and Shrek's unique hut.Most of the jokes are tended towards kids with a few adult jokes (Fiona fighting off the Merrymen Matrix style) and the film is a great for family audiences. Mike Myers goes from his goofy roles in Austin Powers to an angry, Scottish ogre whose best friend is a talking donkey.Shrek. Starring the Voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and John Lithgow.4 out of 5 Stars.
