It's well worth watching if you want a good film that doesn't rely on these plot devices. However, before I get to the film in general, there is one odd thing I noticed early in the film. I knew that David Niven had been given the Oscar for Best Actor for this film, but I was bowled over by how incredibly broad and transparent his character was in the first five minutes of the film. To put it bluntly, he was the worst part of the film because I knew one of his big, dark secrets almost immediately--he simply came on too strong to possibly really be who he claimed to be! While 1959 was a pretty poor year for this Oscar category, to me Paul Newman clearly had a better performance of the nominees--clearly.The film is sort of like a slower paced and more subtle ensemble soap opera--kind of like what you might have seen if The Love Boat or Peyton Place had been written better and with less of the hysteria. And, instead of a small town or cruise ship, the location for this film is a rooming house in England. The concoction is very agreeable due to excellent writing and acting (aside from the one mentioned above). Burt Lancaster and Rita Hayworth were very agreeable and worth seeing--and it's odd Lancaster wasn't nominated for the Oscar instead of Niven (who, incidentally, seemed to have a lot less screen time!). However, my favorite in the cast was Gladys Cooper. This elderly actress was simply superb as the puritanical and overbearing resident. She was thoroughly hateful and this visceral reaction was why I liked her in the film so much.The film is so well done that it would a great film for young film makers to see (along with great 50s films like Marty and 12 Angry Men).

For one it's a syrupy movie and I usually am not a fan of those types of movies. Peter Sellers is a comical actor that I greatly admire, especially as bumbling police officer Inspector Clousseau from The Pink Panther series. And his transformation to morph into three different characters in Dr. Strangelove is absolutely hypnotic and was absolutely hilarious in Lady Killers. However,there were a few stinkers that he has been, that I regretted ever seeing. Being There marks the last film of Sellers' career and came out shortly before his death in 1980. What's flabbergasting was that this film was on the sidelines for about nine years and Sellers fought hard to have this film made. This movie is probably one of Sellers' best performances as he plays a more restrained character as opposed to the slapstick roles he's famous for.Sellers plays the role of Chance, a simple-minded gardener who lives in a townhouse of a rich, reclusive millionaire. Chance hardly ever leaves the home as he has free food, free bed and access to their television that he watches quite frequently. Suddenly, his master\/mentor dies and now Chance has no alternative but to go off on his own and fend for himself. Homeless and no direction to go, Chance encounters a gold-digging socialite named Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine)who is wed to an aging business tycoon name Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor)and they take the simpleton to their estate, because they think he's a bigwig in the upper class. During his stay he leaves a lasting impression on these upper class civilians even the President himself (Jack Warden). The message delivered in Being There tells you that people only listen to what they want to hear over what needs to be heard. The incoherency between the characters was brilliantly exhibited and I was impressed that the novel it was based on by Jerzy Kosinski was depicted fairly accurately. For that reason I give kudos to Hal Ashby for his wonderful direction by creating Chance as both a sorrowful soul and at the same time, not too sugary of a character. This defines that wherever Chance goes or what he says, people will listen because they mistake him for a sophisticate and this happens throughout the film. The acting is overall genuine gold and when acting is executed immaculately, I rate films higher than those that are bad or mediocre. Sure Sellers is the best actor in the story, but everybody else supported Sellers very nicely and didn't try to usurp him in any way. I highly recommend you go and see it. For the excellent direction, the brilliant star quality and a change in character for Sellers going from slapstick comedy to a more subtle low-key comedy with some drama involved.

What's flabbergasting was that this film was on the sidelines for about nine years and Sellers fought hard to have this film made. This movie is probably one of Sellers' best performances as he plays a more restrained character as opposed to the slapstick roles he's famous for.Sellers plays the role of Chance, a simple-minded gardener who lives in a townhouse of a rich, reclusive millionaire. Chance hardly ever leaves the home as he has free food, free bed and access to their television that he watches quite frequently. Suddenly, his master\/mentor dies and now Chance has no alternative but to go off on his own and fend for himself. Homeless and no direction to go, Chance encounters a gold-digging socialite named Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine)who is wed to an aging business tycoon name Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor)and they take the simpleton to their estate, because they think he's a bigwig in the upper class. During his stay he leaves a lasting impression on these upper class civilians even the President himself (Jack Warden). The message delivered in Being There tells you that people only listen to what they want to hear over what needs to be heard. The incoherency between the characters was brilliantly exhibited and I was impressed that the novel it was based on by Jerzy Kosinski was depicted fairly accurately. For that reason I give kudos to Hal Ashby for his wonderful direction by creating Chance as both a sorrowful soul and at the same time, not too sugary of a character. This defines that wherever Chance goes or what he says, people will listen because they mistake him for a sophisticate and this happens throughout the film. The acting is overall genuine gold and when acting is executed immaculately, I rate films higher than those that are bad or mediocre. Sure Sellers is the best actor in the story, but everybody else supported Sellers very nicely and didn't try to usurp him in any way. I highly recommend you go and see it. For the excellent direction, the brilliant star quality and a change in character for Sellers going from slapstick comedy to a more subtle low-key comedy with some drama involved.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd. It has some very fine moments and some great ideas in its form, but unfortunately, Part III comes across as being the weakest of the entire trilogy for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it lacks the zest and gusto that so wonderfully induced the first two movies.After Doc (Christopher Lloyd) is accidentally whisked back to 1885, Marty (Michael J. Fox) discovers the flux capicator-inhibited DeLorean buried in Hill Valley's soil, buried by the Doc years ago before he was murdered by a notorious gunfighter (Thomas Wilson). Marty recovers the DeLorean and travels back to the Old West to rescue Doc, who has become smitten with a frantic schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen), who was supposed to have died until they interfered.I think you can see what my first real complaint about Part III is. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the screenwriters made the mistake of throwing in a sappy love story for Doc when one was anything but necessary. The first two movies dealt with their romantic subplots with care and tender brilliance, but best of all, they strayed away from Doc. This character needed anything but a love interest. The romantic subplot is sappy, boring, uninteresting, and makes one roll one's eyes and look toward his watch, begging Zemeckis to move along with the more interesting stuff. And also, I'm sorry to say, Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are a very awkward screen couple.Part III also suffers because it simply does not have the same inexorable timing and suspense that made the first two movies so magical. Instead of whipping along, it plods along like a man dying in the heat of the sun. And the climax, which is once again drawn-out with suspense intended to build, comes across as dull and routine with tensions everywhere but on the rise. There is also, I'm sorry to say, a lot of hokey dialogue in the screenplay.Now, however, there *are* some good elements to Part III. In fact, some of them are brilliant. The idea of Marty assuming the name of Clint Eastwood in the Old West is a fantastic idea and the obvious homage to the climax of A Fistful of Dollars is fun and smile-inducing. Performances are once again good. Michael J. Fox's performance is buttoned up and solid; Lloyd is funny when he's not being sappy as Doc; Thomas Wilson is once again sinister and convincing; Mary Steenburg turns out a solid, if whimsical performance, as the schoolmarm; and there are a lot of fun Western cameos by names such as Pat Buttram and Harry Carey, Jr. who can be seen playing poker in the saloon that plays prominently in the movie. All of these good, fun elements do save the movie from being a complete failure, but unfortunately they also make your heart sink as you realize that the rest of the movie falls short of them.Perhaps the change of direction was the fatal flaw of Back to the Future Part III. Perhaps the blend of the Western and science-fiction genres was too patchy and whimsical for it to work. And maybe Robert Zemeckis and his crew were running out of steam with this franchise. In the end, Part III is not really a very bad movie, but it is uncharacteristically dull and dry for a Robert Zemeckis movie and unlike the first two movies, is rather forgettable save for its few brilliant elements.

","genre":"Comedy, Horror"},{"date":"22 June 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I suppose the proper way to take this movie is to look at it as a joke, which is explained a number of times here in the reviews. But jokes that need to be explained are not particularly funny jokes, and while yes, this movie is bizarre and contains some flashes of the first film's genius, it's an overall tedious and poorly conceived project. Even a bad movie taken as satire should be entertaining, and TCM2 is only marginally enjoyable.The first big problem is a nonsense opening sequence where a pair of moronic kids are sawed up by Leatherface in one of the most improbable death scenes in movie history. Due to the fact that the kids were on their car phone at the time with a local radio DJ, the DJ records the murder, which is really nothing more than some chainsaw sound effects and screaming followed by a car crash. Dennis Hopper arrives with a personal vendetta against the chainsaw family, and he lures the pretty female DJ, nicknamed Stretch, into playing the audio over the air constantly until the chainsaw family hears it. Leatherface and his other brother, a freak known as Chop Top, arrive at the station to terrorize the DJ. Leatherface takes a liking to her, though, perhaps due to her short-shorts, and he lets her live. She can't leave well enough alone, and she follows them home to their secret hideout an abandoned amusement park. Seriously! They live in a series of underground tunnels below the park, which is absolutely littered with skeletons and rotting corpses. Surely the family's cannibalistic shenanigans would demand a less conspicuous home base? Another memorable aspect of this movie is Dennis Hopper's kooky performance as a revenge-obsessed nutso who decides to fight fire with fire and brings along a chainsaw of his own while chasing after the clan. The film goes horribly wrong, though, by being utterly contrived and silly. Even if it was supposed to be a satire, it could have at least been funny. It's more shrill than anything else, with meandering dialogue and scenes that go nowhere. The old man character especially gets stuck with a lot of drivel that just goes on and on, whereas in the first film he was used sparingly. Leatherface has none of the menace or morbid fascination that he once had, but instead is played for laughs, especially when he falls in love with the heroine.

And yet, being a time of greater honesty of expression, they were also a period in which humanity could perhaps begin to deal frankly with the most harrowing events of the century. But was the new generation of filmmakers up to the job? In some ways, yes they were. I am using the term filmmakers in its broadest sense, meaning everyone who contributes to the making of a motion picture. Lead actor Rod Steiger delivers a performance of incredible weight. It could be thought of as easy, portraying Sol Nazerman's emotional flatness, but in fact what Steiger is doing is portraying suppressed emotions, and he does so with exceptional control. Even when his character is at his most blank, Steiger is still presenting him as feeling on some level. This is testament to the commitment and realism of the Strasberg generation. But much as I admire Steiger, I would have preferred to see a man who actually petitioned hard for the role but never got it &#x96; Groucho Marx. At 74 Marx may have been a little old (although Steiger is theoretically too young), but I think he would have brought a certain level of feeling to the part, drawing from his life experience and the fact that comedians often have a contradictory knack for poignant dignity. This is something that a thorough professional like Steiger could not have achieved.The source novel by Edward Lewis Wallant appears to be an occasionally intelligent, respectful and even moving exploration of the effects of colossal emotional trauma. However it distractingly deals too much with the politics of the New York underbelly, and if there is some attempt to parallel the horrors of the holocaust with the deprivation of Harlem, this is an insulting piece of reductionism. From here on it is one poor judgment after another. The direction of Sidney Lumet, typically inventive but still a little unsteady at this point, veers off the rails completely here, with some unpleasantly bizarre and showy techniques. For example, when Brock Peters shows off his stolen-goods lawnmower, we can tell he is an intimidating character and that this is a confrontational moment &#x96; so why labour the point by putting the camera on the floor? Artsy self-indulgence is bad enough at the best of times, but it is monumentally inappropriate for a picture like this.And this is not all. The rambling Quincy Jones score relates not at all to the tone of the material (you couldn't even really say it is the sound of Harlem), and is surely only there because all independent avant-garde productions of the sixties had to have a free jazz score. And then there are the supporting roles &#x96; Jaime Sanchez's hammy Hispanic act would be fine in, say, West Side Story, but it's not for a serious picture. It's all such a shame because bits of The Pawnbroker are quite startlingly deep. There are certain things however that if done at all need to be done just right.

But, money isn't everything, for their son Martin has an incurable illness and is in a cryogenic state. Monica, still grieving greatly, comes to read to him every day. Also in vogue are very human-like robots, who are servants and prostitutes for the wealthy. Now a top scientist (William Hurt) announces that he is going to make a child-robot who will actually feel love for his mother. When an underling ponders a situation in which robot-child is not loved back, he has a useless answer. At once, Henry sees an opportunity to help Monica and he buys the first robot boy, David (Haley Joel Osmet). In his instructions are a set of verbal commands which will imprint David's love for Monica irreversibly. Initially opposed to his acquisition, Monica grows to love him, as her heart is hurting. Unexpectedly, a cure for Martin's disease is discovered and he comes home, completely well. Immediately, Martin begins to taunt and trick David as they both compete for their mother's love. Eventually, Martin has a serious accident, at David's hands, so Monica knows he cannot stay. But, although the company's instructions were for the robot-boy to be returned and destroyed, she can't do it. Instead, she takes him out to the woods and abandons him and his supertoy talking Teddy. The real horror is about to begin, for not only does David need the love of his mother but the poorer folks gather wandering robots and destroy them in an ancient Roman type arena. David is seized and so is Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot who was framed for murder. What will be their fate? The plot is so complicated, it is difficult to do it justice but it is fairly fascinating. And, the movie starts off with a real jolt and continues on until the final quarter, where it loses steam and credibility. The cast is really great, with Osmet a wonder as the robotic child and beautiful O'Connor an object of pity and scorn as the confused mother. Law, too, is quite fine as the futuristic robot-lover and all other cast members do nice work, too, although Hurt has only two major scenes. The look of the film is an even stronger asset, as its artistic direction and special effects are terrific, creating a world like few others and a marvel to behold. The scenes of robot destruction are fairly potent, as the robots look like human beings, so be cautious about letting young children watch it. Also, the ending is controversial, with the likelihood that some viewers will like it, others will not. But, if you adore science fiction, Spielberg or well-crafted effects, you should do the intelligent thing and rent this one in the near future.

Tony Perkis, for example, is the spitting character image of Stiller's White Goodman from Dodgeball and yet to me he is just as amusing doing his patented whispery intimidating voice now despite my countless repeated viewings of Dodgeball.There's also a classic overnight camp comedy sense of humor in Heavyweights like the kids getting beat in sports by their rival camp, an awkward dance mixer with a normal girls camp and when the kids unload the candy stashes they've snuck in camp into secret compartments -- as well as the run-of-the-mill fart jokes.

I also thought that the relationship between Ice and his girlfriends little brother was pretty cool. Nothing wrong with a little positive cool guy role model.

There was actually a plot unlike what some have said. Granted the plot was stupid but come on thats the fun of these kinds of movies. I thought Ice was pretty cool. Not to over done.

Lots of flying bullets and male camaraderie, perhaps more than what most women can deal with without bursting out in giggles. Very male dominated cast, and back to old school buddy lines.

A bit long with a tad too many twists, and one or two goofs in the script, or maybe I am just stupid. Stupid or not, I sat through the entire thing.

The package includes two discs. Contrary to what is indicated on the back of the case, the Blu-ray high-res version, encoded in MPEG-4, is not on the same disc with the bulk of the special features. Rather, the MPEG-4 high-res version is on one disc, and the special features that are listed on the case are on the disc that has the DVD version.Even though high-res version is encoded in MPEG-4 (vs. MPEG-2) and even though it is encoded at a bit rate about 10x greater than the bit rate used for the MPEG-2 (DVD) version, it is not very much sharper at all. In truth, it is just barely possible to tell any difference at all. I had to switch back and forth several times to convince myself that there was any difference at all, and prior to doing that I was ready to conclude that they had simply taken the DVD version and re-encoded it in MPEG-4 at a higher bit rate (which is technically possible). The Blu-ray version also suffers a terrible annoyance that the DVD version does not have each and every time that you press the pause key or the fast forward key, there is a large progress bar that covers up much of the screen. The capability for the disc to implement this progress bar is one of the features of Blu-ray (which I feel is entirely pointless), but this annoying progress bar is much larger and more annoying than any other such progress bar that I have seen to date, on any of the Blu-ray discs in my collection of several dozen.The bottom line is that this Blu-Ray is not appreciably better than the older DVD version, and not worth the additional cost, even for someone who does not own the DVD version and who, for whatever reason, wants to own a copy of this ridiculous movie. The only attraction here is Elizabeth Berkley, and there just isn't any reason to buy the buy the Blu-Ray version. If you have to have it, save yourself a few bucks and get the DVD version.

If you were expecting deep story lines and involved, fully developed characters then you clearly didn't read the title let alone the back of the box! And another thing about this movie....comedy is not entirely the word that best describes it. 'Nothing but trouble' is pretty damn scary when you really think about! The whole family are psychopathic, the setting is like a twisted fairground from hell and the sense of isolation is actually quite uncomfortable. As for the ending, and maybe this is just me, but I think this has one of the creepiest endings of a film from it's time. The end is far scarier than most of the laughable horrors from the late 80's early 90's.I recommend you give this movie a chance, especially if you grew up through the 80's (younger audiences probably won't get the 80's kitsch style) Just don't expect anything other than tasteless madness. bear in mind this is a movie that has a pickle-firing train (yes you heard me right) and a judge with a nose that looks suspiciously like the business end of a mans baby maker!
