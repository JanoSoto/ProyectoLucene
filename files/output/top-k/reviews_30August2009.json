While I did not find the film at all slow moving, I just thought that the plot was a bit odd, and the whole idea of people turning into Cat's was juts far too surreal for my liking. As you may know, this film was based on a version from 1942. At this time films of a horror genre were very popular and ideas of Frankenstein, Mummies and mutant like beings intrigued people, so this was probably why the idea of 'Cat People' was chosen. However, by the time this version was released in 1982, the idea was a bit old, and it was nothing particularly groundbreaking nor spectacular. While as far as I could see, the acting was hardly weak, yet I did not really get 'sucked in' as it where to the film's plot, as a good film should, simply because I thought the whole idea seemed like the sort of stuff you might see in comic books or cartoons. If the 'cat people' where some sort of violent religious cult, then perhaps it may of been more believable. As well as this, the amount of nudity surprised me, whether the director wanted to somehow relate cats and their jumpy, frisky nature to sex may perhaps be the reason but I do think that the film uses sex as one of it's bases. And so, while the film is an interesting watch, it is by no means a film of any significance. If you did enjoy this film however, try watching 'An American Werewolf in London' or 'Conan the Barbarian' (why I suggest this film, I do not know, i think because it shares an equally unusual plot along with some bizarre characters).

I thought George Lucas was aiming for a much younger audience, setting them up for the next one and the next one after that. It was a kid's movie, much like Lord of the Rings.

I got bored with all the action sequences, and I love sci-fi action movies (Commando, Terminator, Blade Runner, 2001, The Rock, Total Recall, Star Gate, The Abyss, Men in Black, U-571, Matrix, Speed, Independence Day, Time Cop). These characters are wooden, except for the engaging Natalie Portman. Nobody gets a scuff on their face. Nobody shows any sign of emotion. It looks like the actors expected their emotions to be added in digitally after they read their lines. The scenes look gorgeously fake.

The Man With No Name, or in the film, refereed to as Joe, is quickly introduced to mafioso style families who are laying claim to the town. One is the family of town sheriff John Baxter who are trying to protect the citizens from the cruel and gruesome brutality of the Rojo Brothers, the other family. Consisting of Don Miguel Esteban, and Ramon the main antagonist of the film brilliantly played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would go on to play another villain in For a Few Dollars More.The Man with No Name is very clever and calm. He is also a man you do not want to mess with. He is played by Clint Eastwood. Clint is fantastic as usual, and creates the coolest bad ass ever here. And one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema. Clint went on to play the same role, The Man with No Name, in the two following prequels of the film. Gian Maria Volontè displays a brilliant villain, Ramon. He could not have been any better. And he really lets his character come to life.While this may not be considered Leone's best achievement but you cannot deny the impact this film brought to the world of westerns and the art of cinema.This film also marks the first brilliant soundtrack provided by the brilliant and talented Ennio Morricone who would go on to provide the brilliant soundtracks for the next two films in the trilogy and the new Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds. I am a sucker for westerns, more so spaghetti westerns, not only because of the story but because of the atmosphere and cinematography. The way that Leone captures all of the surroundings is just amazing.And we are also introduced to Leone's signature style in the film. Close ups. This film certainly revolutionized the genre of westerns and oh man they were plenty more alike to follow. The ending scene is so full of tension and suspense that you will be cringing on the edge of your seat. This is also the same for For A Few Dollars More and The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Full of suspense, humor, tension, violence, and anger this film is and always will be timeless. It can be enjoyed and be fun to watch any day. This is without a doubt overlooked and underrated not receiving as much praise and recognition as it should. But all I can do is give you the same advice I was given. And that advice is what I hope you will also follow. I took the advice to go and see the film and the outcome was overwhelming.

But it is still regarded as a classic. And it was the start of something new and creative. Spaghetti Westerns. A Fistful of Dollars starts off with a a gunslinger arriving at a small Mexican border town named San Miguel. We are introduced to the Man With No Name. The main character in the film. The Man With No Name, or in the film, refereed to as Joe, is quickly introduced to mafioso style families who are laying claim to the town. One is the family of town sheriff John Baxter who are trying to protect the citizens from the cruel and gruesome brutality of the Rojo Brothers, the other family. Consisting of Don Miguel Esteban, and Ramon the main antagonist of the film brilliantly played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would go on to play another villain in For a Few Dollars More.The Man with No Name is very clever and calm. He is also a man you do not want to mess with. He is played by Clint Eastwood. Clint is fantastic as usual, and creates the coolest bad ass ever here.

There is nothing at all funny about the situation the two leads in the film find themselves in, but there is something distinctly charming about the way in which they deal with it.While not essentially British, a given thanks to the over emphasis on how wonderful it was for the characters to witness the Irish football team pull back a goal and hold on for a draw against the English, while most of the other matches go unnoticed. However, it is directed by an Englishman and the film does posses rather a few items that were written about in regards to some growing fears and concerns simmering at the time within the British film industry, with particular attention to the comedy genre. If we recall Claire Monk's writings in the late 1990s, we might think of films such as Brassed Off and The Full Monty as being films depicting jobless British males turning to alternate methods of money making to get by; effectively rendering the crisis of post-industrialism (closure of mines and steel mills) as a crisis of masculinity. She also writes about these films transitioning problematic situations into comic solutions. These ideas and scenarios might be applicable to The Van, a film that spins job-loss and perceived men in crisis into a series of jokes and gags; a film that, like said examples, see the leads turn to either an entertainment or cultural supply and demand industry, in which they eventually come to relish.One of the two leads in The Van is Bimbo (O'Kelly), a man who has lost his job and gets by off of his redundancy money. The other is Larry (Meaney), and between them, they aim to get a portable fast food outlet up and running. Whilst it's not about becoming strippers or brass-band musicians, it is essentially about two men turning to cooking and meal preparation by way of getting by. Its set up; a male panic, followed by a lot of sitting around complete with head scratching before hitting upon an idea to move into what is a form of the cooking industry, sees the two leads adopt a culinary position; something that Monk may have been alluding two when she describes early 1990s 'new men' as having to now share the once sole motherly burdens; this of course includes cooking and meal preparation. Yes, it's a fast-food van but the progressive realisation that the only way to deal with the 'panic' is to do something thought of initially as somewhat unthinkable and hapless, is certainly explored; the last resort, 'you'll never see me doing that\/in one of those things' notion is tested before becoming the source of humour. One character refers to burger vans as portable 'food poisoning', before succumbing to working within one later on.The van of the title acts as both a physical representation for the nucleus of the two leads' study, but also as a cinematic space in which it is able to play out. When we first encounter the van, it is located in a desolate and sorry place; a place that sees its characters struggle to push their way through all the other hazards around it just to catch a glimpse. The van is broken, worn-out and decrepit &#x96; it's seen better days. But the van is transformed; it is updated and goes through a process of modernity before, in time, is back up and running and solving the characters' problems. The process the van goes through is similar to that of the main characters, as these beaten and well-worn individuals whom have seen better days suddenly becoming success stories again; garnering a final day in the sun.But if The Van is supposed to be a comedy, blending in the harsh and realistic working class life of terrace house living; cramped conditions; redundancy and frustrations with one's overall life with what is, I think, supposed to be a 'feel-good' approach; then it's not a terribly funny one. One of the film's stranger scenes applies a very visceral sense of humour whilst exploiting what little knowledge these perceived men in crisis actually know about the kitchen 'space'; that being when Larry scolds himself whilst trying to deep fry fish and fry eggs, with the fat popping and jumping up onto his forehead and hands thus scolding him. It's an odd scene; a scene in which the male is ill-suited to his culinary surroundings, we are invited to laugh before realising that if he doesn't get back in there, give it another crack and get it right then his life will get doubly worse in an instant.But The Van has charm, although its charm isn't really enough. It doesn't invite us to laugh at two people on the skids as much as it does invite us to marvel and be entertained at the manner in which they refuse to buckle and hit rock-bottom. The film's humour is too wavy, either settling for scenes in which its characters are under the influence of alcohol or instances in which the burger van is mobbed by a sea of customers all shouting and ordering at once which, and granted, I haven't ordered many meals from many burger vans, but I'm smart enough to know, just doesn't happen. However, you might say its inconsistencies and its broad, uneven feel help in adding to its overall charm of two people just trying to get by; and I wouldn't really begrudge anyone for being fond of it for that.

Standing in Barnes and Nobles, I saw the DVD potent with its front cover of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of some of his movies, but I've never been a huge Brad Pitt fan, and have always thought him (for no particular reason, most likely due to his epic media coverage) to be very commercial in what roles he chooses (oh how ashamed I feel of my judgment). However, only the year before had i watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Absolutely astounded by his performance, i decided to give this movie a go. After watching the whole 178 minutes of it, i finished the credits, stood up, walked into my apartment bathroom, cleared my eyes of tears, both fresh and hour-old, and looked in the mirror whilst thinking never again will i doubt this man.When you think about it, Pitt is not really a commercial actor at all, although he is constantly abused by this term. In actual fact, he is one of the most underrated actors of this industry. Se7en, Fight Club and countless more of his films have shown high quality and calibre. Th only film i could possibly dig on him would be Mr and Mrs Smith, and even THAT wasn't a complete horror. Meet Joe Black, however, could possibly be the best performance he has ever accomplished.From the very beginning, this man is likable and captivating. He immerses the audience, both women AND men alike, with his unique charm, and I must say, i felt quite depressed when I realized i wouldn't be seeing this character through the majority of the film. Yet, as soon as Death came out into the field, i caught attention once again. How he has depicted two completely opposite characters, yet given both a likability any person watching would desire, is astonishing. His portrayal of Death is ultimately simple yet so, so deep. And, not only with a supernatural seriousness, but Pitt layers this character with humour and affection, both aspiring to absolute chemistry with fellow leads Hopkins and Forlani. Every actor is triumphantly amazing in this picture, however, if not simply due to the unnecessary and unjustified criticism he gets, Brad Pitt is the ruby on the golden crown, and i walk away from watching this film with he as one of my favourite actors of all time, and Meet Joe Black as one of my favourite movies of all time.

The film ends nowhere, pretty much where it started.Where do they get the gimmicky so-deep-and-clever title? To rope in box office dollars of course--in the story, a pizza parlor. And a town.

No exceptions.Remarks in the rear of the comments section belittling Arsenic are pretentious, seemingly written by film students hoping to become the next Costa-Gravas or Wertmuller. They consistently describe Uncle Teddy when he is Jonathan's and Mortimer's brother. Another dismisses Capra as a director unfamiliar with comedy. despite It Happened One Night - the only contender as the funniest film ever made - being the first to win the top five Oscars Best movie, director, actor, actress and writer.Cary Grant sat on stage one evening reminiscing with the audience. He considered Mortimer Brewster his worst performance. He was wrong and I know why. Cary judged his films by their box office and his performances by the critics. His best films, in his judgment, made a lot of money. Allyn Joslyn, a fine, somewhat prissy, leading man and light comedian on the stage and occasional films, originated the role of Mortimer Brewster on Broadway. The critics thought him wonderful. It was part of the play's joke that Joslyn played Mortimer completely unruffled by all that beset him, the calm center in a cyclone of larger-than-life performances around him. This was much on the same order as William Gillette, the Master of Undercting, played Sherlock Holmes in the famous stage play of his own creation in 1899. It worked well on stage - it might not have on film. Capra saw the movie version of the play in the same fast-paced light as the writers, Julius and Philip Epstein. Capra began his Hollywood career as a silent film screenwriter who understood setting up a gag as building one chuckle on another until the last, the capper, set the audience howling with laughter.Another consideration of directing Arsenic at breakneck speed was to bring it in at under 2 hours, saving money on film prints. Frugality was a virtue at Warners. I first saw Arsenic in the late 1950s on KCOP, channel 13 in Los Angeles, the least important station of the seven servicing Southern California back then. Because the station management had such a small audience it sold lots of cheap commercial 10-second spots to local restaurants, re-upholsterers, grocery stores and other small businesses that could never afford a full minute or a 30 second commercial from the six other local stations.Problem was, KCOP trimmed movies badly, very often keeping the projector running under the twelve 10-second spots shown at each break. When returning to the movie, several scenes and a lot of plot had been eliminated. Since the breaks occurred at different times each broadcast it took at least four showings to actually see an entire film.This handicap aside my brothers, sister and I, even as small children, recognized Arsenic was a side-splitter from beginning to end. Many years later I was honored to be asked to play Teddy in a production of the play and discovered that, as wonderful as the play is, it lacks the pizazz of the film. The reason is the brothers, Julius and Philip Epstein had not written the play. The Epsteins added situations and hilarious lines into the play's dialogue that, even today, make it sparkle even if the jokes are topical And that will be the end of the Roosevelts in the White House - That's what you think. Another line pays a kind of back-handed homage to the Brooklyn Dodgers who had finished leading the league for the first time that year Yes, says Aunt Martha, ready to go to Happy Dale. The neighborhood's changed so ever since they won that old pennant thing. These lead to the hilarious, madcap climax. Mortimer grabs Teddy's bugle and charges up the staircase. The sequence crackles with James Gleason's exasperation, playing Lieut Rooney of New York's Finest as he looks over the commitment papers only to find, These papers aren't any good - he's signed them Theodore Roosevelt. In the midst of the chaos following Jonathan's apprehension, Mortimer begs Teddy to sign the papers with his real name, Theodore Brewster. Teddy considers a moment then refuses, No, it's chicanery. At the end of his rope Mortimer thinks fast, Brester is code for Roosevelt. This piques Teddy's interest.Take the 'B' away from Brewster, Mortimer quickly asks Teddy, and what do you have? Teddy pauses then brightens, Rooster! And what do roosters do? They crow! And where do you go hunting in Africa?Another moment as Teddy considers then smiles, On the Veldt! There, you have it, Mortimer concludes exultantly, 'Crows-Veldt!' The joke's set-up and punchline never fail to break me up.From the first, I was in awe of the thought devoted to, and the cleverness given this hilarity which comes at precisely the right moment to rev up the funny bone for one one-liner after another which has put audiences in stitches for six decades and more.Very clever, says Teddy, now ready to sign. My compliments to the boys in the code department. MY compliments to the amazingly brilliant Epstein twins. Aside from writing their own scripts they were known as the best script doctors in Hollywood, often called by producers to goose scripts, competent or weak, into masterpieces.Nevermind sending your kids to the goofy, smutty and always inane summer comedies. Get a DVD of Arsenic, invite your kids' friends over, pop some (real not microwave) popcorn and don't forget the REAL butter instead of the horrible mineral oil golden topping so many theatres desecrate popcorn with today. Sit the youngsters in front of the TV. Prepare for the belly-laughter that comes from genuine humor, mirth, merriment and wit.And watch them all JUMP when Jonathan comes through the window!

If you watch the movie with the director's narration on the DVD, you'll see how Chelsom has a talent for infusing a film with a distinctive VISUAL stamp. He was also prescient enough to realize that the initial three scenes in the movie didn't work and insisted that they be re-shot. Watch the initial opening scene on the deleted tracks on the DVD&#x97;the opening scene that ended up in the movie is a thousand times better than the initial offering. Chelsom realized that the energy wasn't there initially, probably because the lead actors, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, hadn't developed sufficient chemistry (the opening scene was shot on the first day they were together on the set). Chelsom also spruces up the film with the clever use of time-lapse photography as well as the judicious use all kinds of interesting music.Despite Serendipity's 'nice look', one wonders why Chelsom decided to make this film in the first place. He sees it as a 'fairy tale' about being 'alive'&#x97;but even fairy tales cannot be mean-spirited. And that is the crux of the problem with Serendipity. Despite the seemingly magical magnetism between Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas, their obsession with each other comes off as self-indulgent. The film's scenarist, Marc Klein, reduces Jonathan and Sara's partners&#x97;Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Lars (John Corbett) to fates they don't deserve&#x97;in effect they have become virtual buffoons. According to Chelsom, Lars was originally supposed to be a Kenny G character but they wanted to push the envelope by transforming him into a new-age parody&#x97;somebody like 'Yanni' but more exaggerated. The Halley character is even more problematic as she is reduced to being the 'perfect' girlfriend&#x97;until being exposed as having a not-so-likable trace of obsessive-compulsiveness as part of her personality.Some people may go for the idea of a relationship based on a serendipitous chance encounter. The idea of love at first sight might actually happen in some cases but most relationships develop over a long period of 'give and take'. I think such an idea is a more realistic way of going about a relationship than having two people instantly fall in love without really knowing anything about each other. But even for those who are enamored with the idea of this superficial but instant love as a result of a chance encounter, Serendipity suffers from a lack of interaction between the two principals. For most of the movie, Cusack and Becksinsale have little screen time together.Instead, most of Serendipity focuses on the comic relief of Cusak (accompanied by his sidekick best friend Dean Kansky played by Jeremy Piven) attempting to uncover Sara's identity through a credit card receipt found inside the cashmere glove that Sara gives to Jonathan as part of the strange pact they concoct when they first meet each other. The receipt takes Cusak to Bloomingdale's where he meets a neurotic salesman played by Eugene Levy. Levy's shtick goes so far; far funnier is the arrogant and pretentious French artist, Sebastian Mignon, whose 'portrait' of Sara turns out to be a Picasso knockoff which is utterly no help to Trager and his buddy, desperate to know what the long missing Sara looks like.While Trager and Kansky's quest to find where Sara lives is mildly interesting, Sara's decision to find Jonathan by flying from California to New York (accompanied by her buddy Eve played by Molly Shannon) doesn't pack any punch at all. Unlike Jonathan, who has a credit card receipt to work with, Sara's trip back to New York is based merely on her intuition. She has no idea where to find Jonathan but believes another serendipitous meeting will take place. As it turns out she's walking around the city without a clue, while the viewer is supposed to be entertained with all kinds of ridiculous moments of déjà vu (for example, when Sara finds the gum on the back of the bench which Trager had left earlier at the golf range). There are even more incredible coincidental moments such as when Halley turns out be Eve's old college friend. Director Chelsom was even going to have Sara and Eve get into the SAME cab as Jonathan and Dean are seen making their exit, but admits to nixing the idea on the grounds that the coincidental moment was just too beyond the pale.When Halley hands Jonathan the book, Love in the Time of Cholera', which contains Sara's phone number, it's a bit of a stretch but in keeping with the direction in which Serendipity has been taking us. But the coincidence of the $5 bill returning to Sara's hands was completely far-fetched given the number of $5 bills in circulation in New York City.Equally perplexing is the sudden disappearance of Sara and Jonathan's respective lovers at the film's denouement. Again, in order for Sara and Jonathan's romance to work, the other lovers must be completely dispensable. That includes all the real-life recriminations between the families we should have been privy to surrounding the calling off of the Jonathan-Halley nuptials.Once Jonathan and Sara are back in each other's arms at film's end, I wonder if this is a couple I really should have been rooting for all along. If the message here is 'true love conquers all', does it have to involve such selfishness? Perhaps it would have been better if Lars and Holly ended up together which might have softened the blow of the respective couples' split-ups.Despite excellent direction and cinematography, Serendipity is a fluff piece which is instantly forgettable.

He sees it as a 'fairy tale' about being 'alive'&#x97;but even fairy tales cannot be mean-spirited. And that is the crux of the problem with Serendipity. Despite the seemingly magical magnetism between Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas, their obsession with each other comes off as self-indulgent. The film's scenarist, Marc Klein, reduces Jonathan and Sara's partners&#x97;Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Lars (John Corbett) to fates they don't deserve&#x97;in effect they have become virtual buffoons. According to Chelsom, Lars was originally supposed to be a Kenny G character but they wanted to push the envelope by transforming him into a new-age parody&#x97;somebody like 'Yanni' but more exaggerated. The Halley character is even more problematic as she is reduced to being the 'perfect' girlfriend&#x97;until being exposed as having a not-so-likable trace of obsessive-compulsiveness as part of her personality.Some people may go for the idea of a relationship based on a serendipitous chance encounter. The idea of love at first sight might actually happen in some cases but most relationships develop over a long period of 'give and take'. I think such an idea is a more realistic way of going about a relationship than having two people instantly fall in love without really knowing anything about each other. But even for those who are enamored with the idea of this superficial but instant love as a result of a chance encounter, Serendipity suffers from a lack of interaction between the two principals. For most of the movie, Cusack and Becksinsale have little screen time together.Instead, most of Serendipity focuses on the comic relief of Cusak (accompanied by his sidekick best friend Dean Kansky played by Jeremy Piven) attempting to uncover Sara's identity through a credit card receipt found inside the cashmere glove that Sara gives to Jonathan as part of the strange pact they concoct when they first meet each other. The receipt takes Cusak to Bloomingdale's where he meets a neurotic salesman played by Eugene Levy. Levy's shtick goes so far; far funnier is the arrogant and pretentious French artist, Sebastian Mignon, whose 'portrait' of Sara turns out to be a Picasso knockoff which is utterly no help to Trager and his buddy, desperate to know what the long missing Sara looks like.While Trager and Kansky's quest to find where Sara lives is mildly interesting, Sara's decision to find Jonathan by flying from California to New York (accompanied by her buddy Eve played by Molly Shannon) doesn't pack any punch at all. Unlike Jonathan, who has a credit card receipt to work with, Sara's trip back to New York is based merely on her intuition. She has no idea where to find Jonathan but believes another serendipitous meeting will take place. As it turns out she's walking around the city without a clue, while the viewer is supposed to be entertained with all kinds of ridiculous moments of déjà vu (for example, when Sara finds the gum on the back of the bench which Trager had left earlier at the golf range). There are even more incredible coincidental moments such as when Halley turns out be Eve's old college friend. Director Chelsom was even going to have Sara and Eve get into the SAME cab as Jonathan and Dean are seen making their exit, but admits to nixing the idea on the grounds that the coincidental moment was just too beyond the pale.When Halley hands Jonathan the book, Love in the Time of Cholera', which contains Sara's phone number, it's a bit of a stretch but in keeping with the direction in which Serendipity has been taking us. But the coincidence of the $5 bill returning to Sara's hands was completely far-fetched given the number of $5 bills in circulation in New York City.Equally perplexing is the sudden disappearance of Sara and Jonathan's respective lovers at the film's denouement. Again, in order for Sara and Jonathan's romance to work, the other lovers must be completely dispensable. That includes all the real-life recriminations between the families we should have been privy to surrounding the calling off of the Jonathan-Halley nuptials.Once Jonathan and Sara are back in each other's arms at film's end, I wonder if this is a couple I really should have been rooting for all along. If the message here is 'true love conquers all', does it have to involve such selfishness? Perhaps it would have been better if Lars and Holly ended up together which might have softened the blow of the respective couples' split-ups.Despite excellent direction and cinematography, Serendipity is a fluff piece which is instantly forgettable. Proof for me is that I had initially forgotten that I had seen it back in October 2001 while watching it for a second time recently on DVD.

But they weren't too far off. There's barely an action segment until the finale. In the time of 'Alien' and especially 'Star Wars' (that this took a lot from), I would expect a lot more action, suspense and special effects. It even had one of movie's oldest plot lines involving a mad scientist's diabolical plan vs. true-hearted people. So, it appears to me, that Disney was just nervous about putting more money into this and simply dumb down the recent boost for space-adventures for a family audience. It's harmless, and not a terrible flick, but predictable and though some of the effects looked good, most were comical (even for 1979. Foil paper hats anyone?) And always keep in mind (like the 1950's B-movies this resembles) it's science FICTION, emphasizing on the fiction part. I guess, not only can no one hear you scream in space; they can't die there even without a suit. Space travelers with a floating R2-D2-Ripoff unit stumble across, you guessed it, a black hole, but also a rouge, lone scientist bend on unlocking the secrets behind the hole's deep, well, hole. They need to repair their ship, which always seems to break down at the most inopportune times, or when these types of plots call for it, and they have dinner with the scientist as he reveals only the good about his evil plan.

Despite the literal roller coaster these people are on (at times) it certainly wouldn't hold up for today's kids or adults, and it is definitely a movie I wouldn't mind seeing remade.

Being primarily a horror movie junkie, I consider this milestone to be the pioneer in the delicious 'nature revolts' sub genre. For reasons that remain unexplained throughout the entire movie, birds spontaneously launch virulent and aggressive attacks against the inhabitants of Bodega Bay; a little seaside town 90 miles away from San Francisco. Still several years after the release of this film, clever and ingenious independent horror film directors borrowed this formula and used it as an excuse to manifest practically every species of the animal kingdom as vicious killing machines, usually because of the ongoing pollution by mankind. But The Birds remains the original classic even though the story develops itself very slowly and the script refuses to give any type of explanation whatsoever. For nearly a full hour, the film simply focuses on the bizarre love-story between the spoiled daughter of newspaper owner and an arrogant crime attorney. She drives out to his parental house in Bodega Bay, where he spends all of his weekends, to play out a practical joke. The Birds then subsequently unfolds itself as a strangely compelling romance between the two aforementioned characters, but also the embittered local school teacher and the attorney's frigid mother. The interactions between these four unusual characters are often downright eerie and there isn't even a bird in sight at that moment! Meanwhile, however, the menace of our 'feathered friends' is continuously present and noticeable. The attacks gradually increase in number and intensity, like the birds are putting up some sort of strategy even though there's no obvious motive.

It was perhaps the first horror movie to bring such new elements as demons, possession, religion in it. Granted, it's not very scary now, but try and think as someone from the 70s, who had no idea what to expect and were treated with a shocking movie.The story is set in Georgetown. The protagonists are, first of all, Ellen Burstyn (Chris MacNeil), an actress and a proud mother of a girl, Regan (Linda Blair). One day strange things start to happen at the local church. At the same time, Regan's behavior makes a sharp turn towards the dark side as she starts talking rude and hitting people. As she gains new powers and as her face deteriorates, psychiatrists can no longer be of help and Ellen considers an exorcism.The second protagonist is Father Karras (Jason Miller), a priest and former psychiatrist, who is part of a sub-plot, which eventually leads him to the main plot. The final mini-protagonist is Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), someone we will see more towards the end.Commenting about acting in this movie is useless, mainly because it cannot be complained about. But I do have to mention Jason Miller, since he really managed to give life to the depressed, but perseverant Father Karras.The plot evolves slowly, but seeing the possessed girl is somehow rewarding. I know that back then it was very scary, but I think the possessor is hilarious, all his dirty talking made me laugh. But the exorcism scene is a unique one in cinema history and it has its place among the most memorable ones.With all honesty, it is a masterpiece, The Exorcist is an essential part of the horror genre and it will still remain an example in the years to come.Final Score 5\/5 or 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Exorcist was one of those movie which revolutionised the genre.
