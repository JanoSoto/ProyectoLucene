It was my favourite film for ages. And now at 19 years of age, although it may have been replaced at the top of my film list, I love it just as much. It is an epic film and the T-Rex breakout scene is one of the best of all time.So when I was sat in the cinema screen awaiting the start of this sequel I was, naturally, extremely excited. It was never going to be as effective as the classic first film (and it certainly isn't) but for 2 thirds it is entertaining and engaging action fare.It was a clever idea to upgrade Goldblum's Ian Malcolm from bit part player to central protagonist. He was easily the best character in the first, possibly the only person with character in the first, excluding the dinosaurs. His witty dialogue was a joy ('It's an impact tremor is what it is, I'm fairly alarmed here!) and here we are given the opportunity for plenty more humorous lines. Actually, the human characters in this film do, in general, have more personality. The one true flaw you can accuse the original of is the dullness and lack of development of the characters. Laura Dern is replaced by the much more capable Julianne Moore as the leading lady in this sequel, and the under-developed Sam Neill character was rightly left out.The result is a much more light-hearted perspective of events on this new island, as Goldblum's witty repartee illuminates the dangerous dinosaur scenes. And it becomes a very good action film. The stars of the first, the Rapters, take a back seat for the T-Rex and the small but deadly little green ones to steal the limelight. However the rapters in the long grass sequence is probably the best scene in the film.But as soon as they manage to escape the island this film franchise lost all it's appeal. The T-Rex in the big city ending is atrocious. It makes a mockery of the dinosaur as we see him chasing buses, drinking from swimming pools and chewing on dog kennels! After one and a half films of gripping, edge of the seat dino action this ending is a total joke. I still don't know what happened to the crew on that ship.

It is especially common for sequels of enormously successful movies to fall flat, particularly in the horror and science fiction genres (remember The Exorcist II?). The first sequel to Ridley Scott's spectacular 1979 film, which set the standard for science fiction for years to come, is placed into the capable hands of James Cameron, who clearly takes some knowledge from Halloween director John Carpenter. Once this movie gets going, it goes full speed and doesn't let you rest for two and a half hours.The movie starts off exactly at the same point where the first movie left off. Well, 57 or so years later, but otherwise the same. Ripley has been in deep sleep and drifting aimlessly in space, and was discovered, as one man describes it to her, by dumb luck. She wakes up to a series of significant and inevitable shocks. Her daughter, whom she had promised that she would be home from her mission, the one from the last movie, has grown up and died an old woman. It's a strange scene to see Ripley looking at a picture of her daughter, now decades older than her own mother.It's not long before Ripley learns that the planet on which they found the strange craft with the alien eggs in it is now inhabited by an entire subculture of families, living on the planet in order to cultivate the atmosphere so that it will be breathable for more people to go live there. Needless to say, she's not entirely impressed with the idea of families living on the planet where the aliens came from, but these people have a lot of money invested in populating that planet, so no one's going to call off the whole project based on the ramblings of some woman who has been floating in space for five decades. And there you have the premise for the movie, already having justified its existence and separated itself from its predecessor enough so that it owns the rest of its own plot. Many good sequels still only tell another story under the same basic plot outline or involving the same characters. In this one, only one character remains from the original story, and the rest of it is simply a continuation of the original story. James Cameron later went on to develop something of a reputation for making good sequels. Alien fans can rejoice because they made another movie but did not sell out. There's a big risk in successful movies being followed up with a sequel just for the money, you see it all the time &#150; Predator, Texas Chainsaw, Darkman (Durant survived that helicopter crash???) etc. Aliens starts right off knowing that it's not wise to throw in another alien and film it chasing and killing people. The movie starts out with Ripley facing serious consequences for official misconduct for that expensive ship that she destroys. She has to convince the board that she had no other choice at the same time as she has to credibly explain the deaths of her entire crew and convince them that those families living on that planet, LV-426, are in grave danger. Not only are they skeptical of her story, she's a suspect in a criminal investigation.Suddenly, all contact is lost with LV-426, and Ripley's story begins to take on a little merit. They offer her a clean slate if she'll accompany their military forces to the planet to check out the situation. She agrees as long as they are going there to destroy the alien, not capture and study it. There is an interesting new crew in the movie, except in this case Ripley has to convince them of her reason for being there. She's not combat trained like they are, but she knows what they're up against, and it's not until they learn about that that they begin to realize how important she is to their mission.My favorite is Bill Paxton's character, Pvt. Hudson, a tough-talking, loudmouth showoff who is reduced to a whining baby, just about wetting himself with fear when the group is confronted with the alien. He was the toughest talker and the loudest mouth going into the mission, but the first to give up hope on himself and the entire crew. This is one of the ways that the story develops unique personalities, people that we can identify, if not identify WITH, just enough to care about what happens to them. And in a movie like Aliens, it's very important that the audience cares what happens to the characters. When they get to the island, it's not long before they encounter a young girl named Newt, who has survived when the rest of the planet was decimated by the aliens, and doubts the crews ability to fight a growing number of aliens with such a small force, and Ripley takes her under her arm. Ripley becomes the mother that Newt no longer has, and Newt becomes the daughter that Ripley no longer has, and it sets an interesting tone for the rest of the movie. The aliens are trying to protect their offspring, and Ripley is essentially trying to do exactly the same thing.One of the things that makes the Alien movies so successfully tense is the setting. They are enclosed within a ship in outer space, trapped with a much more powerful creature. If both sides were unarmed, the aliens would do away with the humans in minutes. Cameron uses this setting to its full potential, employing motion sensors to heighten tension and using spaces in the ship, like the space above the ceiling, to allow the aliens to get extremely close to the humans, even while the humans are watching their movement on their monitors and wondering why the monitor shows them in the very room but they can't see them yet. In another lesson that Cameron seems to have taken from John Carpenter, he keeps the aliens mostly out of sight during the movie, feeling that the less we see them the more menacing they become and remain. He's exactly right about this, too. It maintains a sense of mystery and danger surrounding the aliens that transcends simply their viciousness and obvious physical superiority, and always keeps the viewer straining to see more. But like the crew, we know very little about these creatures other than how deadly they are. Oh, and if you want to see what happens when a director doesn't understand the need to keep the killer in the shadows, watch Halloween II. This is, unfortunately, the last movie in the quadrilogy before it makes a precipitous creative turn downward with the sub-par second and third sequels, but Alien and Aliens are spectacular enough that they fill the void left by their two predecessors. Two such powerful movies may make it even more difficult to take that the good ones seem to be over, but these two remain landmarks. Also keep your eye out for (among several other Cameron regulars) Jenette Goldstein, a lesser known actress whose impressive versatility becomes clear when comparing her character in Aliens with her character, say, in Titanic!

She has to convince the board that she had no other choice at the same time as she has to credibly explain the deaths of her entire crew and convince them that those families living on that planet, LV-426, are in grave danger. Not only are they skeptical of her story, she's a suspect in a criminal investigation.Suddenly, all contact is lost with LV-426, and Ripley's story begins to take on a little merit. They offer her a clean slate if she'll accompany their military forces to the planet to check out the situation. She agrees as long as they are going there to destroy the alien, not capture and study it. There is an interesting new crew in the movie, except in this case Ripley has to convince them of her reason for being there. She's not combat trained like they are, but she knows what they're up against, and it's not until they learn about that that they begin to realize how important she is to their mission.My favorite is Bill Paxton's character, Pvt. Hudson, a tough-talking, loudmouth showoff who is reduced to a whining baby, just about wetting himself with fear when the group is confronted with the alien. He was the toughest talker and the loudest mouth going into the mission, but the first to give up hope on himself and the entire crew. This is one of the ways that the story develops unique personalities, people that we can identify, if not identify WITH, just enough to care about what happens to them. And in a movie like Aliens, it's very important that the audience cares what happens to the characters. When they get to the island, it's not long before they encounter a young girl named Newt, who has survived when the rest of the planet was decimated by the aliens, and doubts the crews ability to fight a growing number of aliens with such a small force, and Ripley takes her under her arm. Ripley becomes the mother that Newt no longer has, and Newt becomes the daughter that Ripley no longer has, and it sets an interesting tone for the rest of the movie. The aliens are trying to protect their offspring, and Ripley is essentially trying to do exactly the same thing.One of the things that makes the Alien movies so successfully tense is the setting. They are enclosed within a ship in outer space, trapped with a much more powerful creature. If both sides were unarmed, the aliens would do away with the humans in minutes. Cameron uses this setting to its full potential, employing motion sensors to heighten tension and using spaces in the ship, like the space above the ceiling, to allow the aliens to get extremely close to the humans, even while the humans are watching their movement on their monitors and wondering why the monitor shows them in the very room but they can't see them yet. In another lesson that Cameron seems to have taken from John Carpenter, he keeps the aliens mostly out of sight during the movie, feeling that the less we see them the more menacing they become and remain. He's exactly right about this, too. It maintains a sense of mystery and danger surrounding the aliens that transcends simply their viciousness and obvious physical superiority, and always keeps the viewer straining to see more. But like the crew, we know very little about these creatures other than how deadly they are. Oh, and if you want to see what happens when a director doesn't understand the need to keep the killer in the shadows, watch Halloween II. This is, unfortunately, the last movie in the quadrilogy before it makes a precipitous creative turn downward with the sub-par second and third sequels, but Alien and Aliens are spectacular enough that they fill the void left by their two predecessors. Two such powerful movies may make it even more difficult to take that the good ones seem to be over, but these two remain landmarks.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Aliens avoids the all-too common fate of sequels, to live forever in the shadow of their predecessors, and usually for good reason. It is especially common for sequels of enormously successful movies to fall flat, particularly in the horror and science fiction genres (remember The Exorcist II?). The first sequel to Ridley Scott's spectacular 1979 film, which set the standard for science fiction for years to come, is placed into the capable hands of James Cameron, who clearly takes some knowledge from Halloween director John Carpenter. Once this movie gets going, it goes full speed and doesn't let you rest for two and a half hours.The movie starts off exactly at the same point where the first movie left off. Well, 57 or so years later, but otherwise the same. Ripley has been in deep sleep and drifting aimlessly in space, and was discovered, as one man describes it to her, by dumb luck. She wakes up to a series of significant and inevitable shocks. Her daughter, whom she had promised that she would be home from her mission, the one from the last movie, has grown up and died an old woman. It's a strange scene to see Ripley looking at a picture of her daughter, now decades older than her own mother.It's not long before Ripley learns that the planet on which they found the strange craft with the alien eggs in it is now inhabited by an entire subculture of families, living on the planet in order to cultivate the atmosphere so that it will be breathable for more people to go live there. Needless to say, she's not entirely impressed with the idea of families living on the planet where the aliens came from, but these people have a lot of money invested in populating that planet, so no one's going to call off the whole project based on the ramblings of some woman who has been floating in space for five decades. And there you have the premise for the movie, already having justified its existence and separated itself from its predecessor enough so that it owns the rest of its own plot. Many good sequels still only tell another story under the same basic plot outline or involving the same characters. In this one, only one character remains from the original story, and the rest of it is simply a continuation of the original story. James Cameron later went on to develop something of a reputation for making good sequels. Alien fans can rejoice because they made another movie but did not sell out.

So we have Nicholas Cage, as a private detective, visiting the home of an affluent elderly lady (and her attorney- more of him later), who has discovered what seems an authentic death of a young girl recorded on video tape. This could have been developed along the lines of say, The Big Sleep, as a hardboiled detective story with unpredictable twists. Unfortunately the writer, having devised this potentially interesting plot, does very little with it except the obvious. We see Cage search through records and befriend a porn shop employee in his quest for the girl. So far, the film, though uninspired and routine, is watchable. However it will subsequently take a turn into first the ludicrous then the disturbed in its attempts to maintain interest. The ludicrous comes when the attorney is revealed to have a hand in the manufacture of the film. There is a scene which could be described as comic-book were it not for the unnecessary murder of the pornshop employee who has helped Cage. No sympathy is shown towards him; he dies simply to tie up a plot strand. Apart from this, the rest of the scene could be from Home Alone or some other kids' film, with the villains unconvincingly turning on each other while Cage resourcefully escapes. None of this is helped by the banal direction. The needless death of a character should of set alarm bells ringing for what subsequently happens. I hope I am giving nothing away, but Cage ruthless beats one of the villains, ties him up and, after phoning the mother of the murdered girl, sadistically kills him. I found this one of the most shocking scenes in a modern Hollywood film, and indicative of the sickness which seems to have overtaken that once great film-making industry of late. It might be argued that this murder is caused by desensitivation of pornography. If that was in the writer's mind, it certain did not make it onto film. All we see is a nasty man getting his just desserts by the American hero. This way of thinking has lead to Guantamo Bay and that Iraqi prison where the inmates were tortured. It seems ironical that a film against snuff should have a snuff scene (ie one served up for the gratification of the audience) in it. The climax of the film is trite and conventional.

The animation is gorgeous and a lot of the subject matter profound. Many critics have complained about the talking gargoyles messing up the movie and taking it further away from Hugo's original novel, but the only problem I have with them is their song (A Guy Like You), which attempts Be Our Guest and Under the Sea status, but really does lack the melody. Other than that, they fit right in with Hugo, who told in his novel that Quasimodo would sit for hours holding solitary converse with the statues. Of course, this was all in his mind, but hello, so are the gargoyles in the movie. No one else ever sees them talking or moving (with the exception of Djali), and they are animated to give Quasimodo some friends, just as he did on his own in the book. Of course, there are many other parts of the movie that are WAY different from the book, but not as many people complain about them, so I won't mention them. The main reason I love this movie is the villain, Frollo, played to perfection by Tony Jay. His sinister atmosphere and lust for Esmerelda are elements of the like we have never seen in any other Disney movie, prior to or after Hunchback. The song Hellfire is the crown jewel of the movie, and makes the entire thing worth watching. I was so surprised by the graphic lyrics and animation of this scene, and could do nothing but yell THIS IS Disney!!!!!!!!!! But it was a good surprise, not a bad one. Frollo is decidedly the deepest, and most evil of all Disney villains, and is definitely my favorite.The music in this movie is also the best that Disney has ever produced. Though the songs are not as catchy as those found in other memorable Disney movies, they are nonetheless the most powerful. In this movie, we find large-scale choral music in Latin, huge orchestral works, religious themes, and Broadway\/Classical style arrangements that put most of the other Disney movies to shame. It truly is magnificent.I definitely recommend this movie to all audiences, and I give it a 10\/10. This is the Disney movie that deserved an Oscar nomination more than any other, and it is a shame that it has been so underplayed and all but disowned by Disney since its release. SEE THIS MOVIE.

If there is something John Woo does know, it's how to direct action scenes that look great. And Van Damme is in good form beating, kicking, shooting and maiming people left and right. Also Lance Henriksen and Arnold The Mummy Vosloo are very entertaining in an over-the-top way as the bad guys.So, despite it's flaws Hard Target is an entertaining ride.

When I discovered this, I feared the worst as I tend to like Allen's movies for his character and not much else (aside from 'Annie Hall', which may well be the most perfect film ever made), but, to my surprise, I found that there's a lot to like about this surreal fantasy. The plot is weird to say the least (although it's less weird if you've seen The Last Action Hero). I feared that Allen might miss the mark with such a strange plot (like he did with 'Sleeper', another surreal fantasy), and although some of the jokes and ideas don't work; I most certainly do think that Allen has hit the nail on the head with this film. Well, almost. The plot follows Cecilia, a bored housewife in 1930's New Jersey. In an attempt to fill a void in her life, Cecilia visits the cinema. A lot. However, she gets an unsuspected surprise one day at the cinema while viewing the new film which is, strangely enough, titled; 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', when a minor character (but one that holds it all together), Tom Baxter gets up and walks off the screen, only to fall deeply in love with Cecilia. However, all is never rosy, as Gil Shepard, the up and coming actor that plays Tom Baxter in the movie is non too pleased that he has a doppelganger walking around, and so turns up in Cecilia's life as another challenger for her heart...Where this film works is when it's concentrating on the film character in the real world. Seeing him learn about the difference between the real world and the world of the movies is always amusing and it allows Woody Allen to make some amusing observations between the two. However, Woody Allen seems too intent on being as surreal as possible, and some of the more weird things in the movie - such as the rest of the movie cast talking to the audience about the predicament they are in - come off being unfunny and therefore don't really work. I can see why Allen would have included that idea in the movie, and it's a good one that could potentially garner lots of laughs, but Woody didn't handle it right and the result just doesn't work. Furthermore, without Woody Allen, it just doesn't seem like a Woody Allen movie. To be honest, I don't think the film would have fit Allen's character - the two lead roles certainly don't fit him, but I like to see Woody Allen in movies, so him not being here is disappointing, for me anyway. That being said, the rest of the cast, particularly the two leads, do a wonderful job of carrying the movie. Jeff Bridges, a massively underrated actor, is a perfect fit for the dual role of Tom Baxter and Gil Shepard and he really does the film proud. Mia Farrow is another inspired casting choice for her character; she's a sublime actress &#150; and you could certainly imagine her being a bored housewife (no offence, Mia...).And now I come to the 'point' of the movie.

Is Woody trying to tell people that their unrealistic fantasies won't come true, and even if they did; they still wouldn't come out perfectly? Is he trying to say that the world of fiction and reality shouldn't collide? Is Allen trying to tell us that nothing is perfect? That everything belongs in it's place?

In the early 90's, it pretty much died down. Then Scream came, in 1996, and rejuvenated the genre with a film that was half-slasher, half a parody of slashers. Over the last few years, there have been quite a few slashers, most of them mediocre. When I found out that this was done by Jamie Blanks, the director of one of my favorite of the new slashers, Urban Legend, I immediately wanted to see it. It wasn't that disappointing, but it wasn't really great either. The plot is decent, but the pacing isn't very good. On repeated viewings, many of the early scenes(and plenty of the later ones as well) are kind of dull and boring. The acting is decent, but several of the big names are kind of disappointing, compared to earlier roles. The characters are pretty much just the typical clichés and stereotypes of the genre. The script is somewhat poor, and doesn't manage to keep your interest on more than one viewing(if even that). The film does have some good scares, some decent suspense and a little tension. The twist is far too obvious, though. On my first viewing, I saw it with a friend, and about half-way into the film, he had figured out who the killer was. The film has some pretty good death scenes, some of the best of the newer slashers, in my opinion(much like Blanks' other film, Urban Legend), but they are also the only really great thing about the film, and they are not really worth paying to see the film for.

However, I suspect the only reason I am disappointed is because of the things I had heard about this film - supposedly, people were not just crying but WAILING in cinemas when seeing this film. Sure, it was sad, but come on!The ending was just a bit too cheesy for my liking, which is a shame, because the film itself wasn't too shabby. It's the sort of film that leaves you thinking - why did this character do that ? Why did Jan ask Bess to do these things? Was he really deprived and depraved or was it because he thought it was the only way he could get Bess to move on? The characters are complex and you feel like you really get a chance to know them and the performances are all fantastic. This film wasn't as great as I was led to believe it was, but I still enjoyed it. If you like happy films, stay away from this one.7\/10.

However, 5 years later, I can appreciate where Lucas was coming from when he made TPM and I can understand the decisions he made. That doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with them wholeheartedly.I think the main problem is that the film lives up to its title of Episode I too much. It is the very beginning and no mistake and, consequently, is really only a prologue to the rest of the saga. With Episodes II and III profiling the Clone Wars and IV-VI the Civil War, TPM will stand very much separate from the the other 5 films once the saga is completed.

One of the reasons it received the criticism it received is that it wasn't what the audience expected at all.With Lucas deciding to set TPM so much apart from the other films, it means that Episode II Attack of the Clones also serves as an introductory film. One can't help wondering if the the first two episodes could have been condensed into one or if Lucas should have made four new films with AOTC being Episode I and TPM being a stand-alone movie sitting outside of the saga rather like the Ewok movies and Droids cartoons, and Episode II taking place during the Clone Wars before the events that we'll see in III.However, none of this excuses the fact that, as a film, it was badly made.

I am astonished. I often imagine our future somber and dark. I love movies like Brazil, Mad Max, On The Beach and so on. Post-apocalyptic tales, visions from the future of our world, nuclear nightmares. Warnings. I think that we will be destroyed one day. Destroyed by our own greed, arrogance and self-confidence. And what is sad is that most of the people overlook these warnings. They accept such books and movies as entertainment. They do not see beyond. It's like we all know that we are going towards our doom, but nobody cares to change the direction. If after several centuries a man watches these movies he will probably say The bloody bastards knew that it would happen and still did nothing to prevent it. Then we deserve to be extinct... At least I hope that we won't be ruled by Apes! A girl from my class heard me once talking about 1984. This is probably the most stupid and boring book I've ever read!

It does not represent the whole idea of Orwell's 1984 world. The audience needs to be familiar with all those things like 3 world powers, telescreens, propaganda and so on. For example when Winston admires the song he says that it is written by a machine, but the woman makes it sound beautiful. And if you are not familiar with the book you'll probably wonder what is this machine, which writes songs. And the movie is full of such moments. The style is good, the costumes too. The sets are very good-looking. But the movie as a whole in my opinion is a number of scenes with no logical linking. Probably the best thing in this movie is the music. My advice - read the book.

She had just had a horrible encounter with a hideous alien creature, and now she's been floating around in space for sometime. Pretty soon, her shuttle is boarded by a team of scavengers. They discover Ripley and Jones are alive so they bring them to Gateway Station, a magnificent space station orbiting the Earth. It takes Ripley a few days to recover. She meets one of the head administrators, a little greedy weasel named Carter Burke. He informs Ripley that she had been out there for 57 years! Ripley continuously tells everyone about the alien creature and how it wiped out her entire crew but nobody believes her. The head administration council decided to hold her responsible for the destruction of the Nostromo, which was worthy a pretty penny! They also inform her that the planetoid where the alien creature was found, LV426, was now inhabited with colonies of space engineers and craft workers, much to Ripley's disbelief. Later, Burke and Lt. Gorman visit Ripley at her apartment to inform her that communications to LV426 have been knocked out for an unknown reason and that a team of space marines would be flying down there to investigate. He wanted Ripley to accompany them, but Ripley said it was absolutely out of the question. No way in hell would she ever return there. However, Burke gave her back her old title of Ship Officer and she accepted the job.Ripley and the marine corps soon arrived in orbit of LV426. They were headed by Lt. Gorman and Sgt. Apone. The troops consisted of Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Private Hudson, a tough-as-nails gunner Vasquez, Drake, Frost, Farro, Spunkmeyer, Dietrich and Wierzbowski. Accompanying them was Bishop, an android. Ripley was reminded of the android she encountered on her last mission (Ash) and so she was very weary of trusting Bishop. Soon, the marines all board a shuttle that takes them down to the planetoid surface, then with Bishop at the controls, they drive a terrain armored transport up to a communications complex. They go inside and find destroyed equipment, wires hanging from the ceiling. Who or what could have done this? Upon further inspection, they discover a human child. A little girl, hiding. Ripley tried to coax her out but she ran. Ripley later found the little girl in what appeared to be her hideout. She discovered from a picture that the girls' name was Rebecca Jorden; Sgt. Apone, Corporal Hicks and the rest soon discover people! Most were dead, but some were still alive, begging for mercy. That's when a little alien creature burst right out of one of the people's stomachs. Luckily it was burned alive in no time flat. But that's also when a mass of monstrous, grown alien creatures dropped from the ceiling and started to attack. The men shot their hi-tech firepower all around the room. Frost, Dietrich and Wierzbowski were killed by the aliens. Hicks, Drake, Hudson, and Vasquez ran for it. Drake was taken out next. Unfortunately, Sgt. Apone was also victim to the aliens. They board the terrain vessel and shoot out of there in a hurry, with Ripley at the controls; The little girl tells Ripley that her real name was Newt. She had a family once, but what happened to them, she didn't tell. Whatever it was certainly scared her. Well it was time to go home, unfortunately as Farro and Spunkmeyer boarded the shuttle to go pick them up, an alien stowed away on board and killed them, causing the shuttle to crash and blow up. Now they were stuck.They seek refuge inside the communications complex. Ripley devised a plan to use the complex's extensive equipment to radio the mother ship in orbit and have the spare shuttle sent down. Bishop was the only one qualified for such a task, so he accepted. He crawled through a pipeline that lead to the main dish. Tension began to build among the marines, especially Hudson. There were smaller alien creatures in the medlab that were there to be studied. Burke wanted to keep them alive because the research labs back home would pay a lot of money for them. So while the others checked on Bishop's progress, Ripley puts Newt down for a nap, but she was too afraid to go to sleep for fear of bad dreams. She was also afraid that monsters would get her...How right she was, for a few minutes later, those grotesque little alien creatures broke free and tried to latch themselves on Newt. Ripley came to her rescue and one alien tried to get her. Luckily it was Hicks to the rescue. He and Hudson blasted the aliens to smithereens. When they discover Burke was responsible for all this, they wanted to blast him next, but before they had the chance, they discover the place was overrun with monstrous aliens! They attack. Hudson is killed. Lt. Gorman and Vasquez run down a tunnel, but soon find themselves surrounded. Gorman takes out a grenade and he and Vasquez and the aliens in the tunnel are blown up; Ripley and Newt head down a different passage way, only Newt accidentally fell down a shaft and into the sewer systems. Meanwhile, Bishop finally got the second shuttle radioed down, but Ripley would not leave without Newt, so she grabbed an arsenal of alien- destructing weapons and went back in the complex and down to the deepest levels. She finds Newt alive, luckily, but then she also finds a nest of alien eggs and finally gets to see the Mother Alien herself! She was enormous and just as hideous as the other aliens. Ripley burned the eggs and a few other aliens then she and Newt ran for it. They boarded the elevators, then boarded the shuttle and they were off. They docked in the mother ship in triumph, just as LV426 was blown to bits, due to a faulty coolant system in the complex that combusted with all the other equipment. Well, they were all safe for now, except Hicks was injured from the alien attacks. Soon, they discover another stow away Mother Alien! She grabs onto Bishop and pulls him apart. That's when a quick thinking Ripley puts on her fork-lift suit and knocks Mother Alien into the floor cargo doors and opens them. Mother Alien is sucked out into space and gone for good.Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and what was left of Bishop all enter their hypersleep chambers and head for home. They would sleep easier knowing the alien menaces were finally gone and it was all over...Or what if this was just the beginning? Aliens, the high-powered sequel to Alien. I thought Aliens was a lot more involved than Alien, probably because there are more of those alien creatures and the effects didn't look as cheap this time. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley. She is as tough and sexy as ever. Michael Biehn is Hicks. Bill Paxton is Hudson. He would star in another space disaster movie in 1995 Apollo 13. Lance Henricksen is Bishop. Biehn and Henricksen also starred in the 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator, also directed by James Cameron. Everybody was good in their performances and Bill Paxton delivered much comic relief. Aliens had great special effects, lot's of cool action scenes, and the scenes with Ripley and Newt were very sweet and touching. It was followed by Alien 3 in 1992, Alien Resurrection in 1997 and just this summer the Alien went against the Predator! The results were disastrous- in both movie and box office. But anyway, if you loved Alien, you gotta see Aliens! There's more of those slimy little disgusting creatures than you ever imagined! Watch out for them, because once again, they could be anywhere! Maybe even in your living room! I recommend Aliens! See it, if you dare...

Ripley burned the eggs and a few other aliens then she and Newt ran for it. They boarded the elevators, then boarded the shuttle and they were off. They docked in the mother ship in triumph, just as LV426 was blown to bits, due to a faulty coolant system in the complex that combusted with all the other equipment. Well, they were all safe for now, except Hicks was injured from the alien attacks. Soon, they discover another stow away Mother Alien! She grabs onto Bishop and pulls him apart. That's when a quick thinking Ripley puts on her fork-lift suit and knocks Mother Alien into the floor cargo doors and opens them. Mother Alien is sucked out into space and gone for good.Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and what was left of Bishop all enter their hypersleep chambers and head for home. They would sleep easier knowing the alien menaces were finally gone and it was all over...Or what if this was just the beginning? Aliens, the high-powered sequel to Alien. I thought Aliens was a lot more involved than Alien, probably because there are more of those alien creatures and the effects didn't look as cheap this time. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley. She is as tough and sexy as ever. Michael Biehn is Hicks. Bill Paxton is Hudson. He would star in another space disaster movie in 1995 Apollo 13. Lance Henricksen is Bishop. Biehn and Henricksen also starred in the 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator, also directed by James Cameron. Everybody was good in their performances and Bill Paxton delivered much comic relief. Aliens had great special effects, lot's of cool action scenes, and the scenes with Ripley and Newt were very sweet and touching. It was followed by Alien 3 in 1992, Alien Resurrection in 1997 and just this summer the Alien went against the Predator! The results were disastrous- in both movie and box office. But anyway, if you loved Alien, you gotta see Aliens! There's more of those slimy little disgusting creatures than you ever imagined! Watch out for them, because once again, they could be anywhere! Maybe even in your living room! I recommend Aliens! See it, if you dare... ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 October 2004","score":"","review":" CONTAINS BIG SPOILERSWe find out heroine, Ellen Ripley, where we left her last aboard her escape shuttle in hypersleep with her cat, Jones. She had just had a horrible encounter with a hideous alien creature, and now she's been floating around in space for sometime. Pretty soon, her shuttle is boarded by a team of scavengers. They discover Ripley and Jones are alive so they bring them to Gateway Station, a magnificent space station orbiting the Earth. It takes Ripley a few days to recover. She meets one of the head administrators, a little greedy weasel named Carter Burke. He informs Ripley that she had been out there for 57 years! Ripley continuously tells everyone about the alien creature and how it wiped out her entire crew but nobody believes her. The head administration council decided to hold her responsible for the destruction of the Nostromo, which was worthy a pretty penny! They also inform her that the planetoid where the alien creature was found, LV426, was now inhabited with colonies of space engineers and craft workers, much to Ripley's disbelief. Later, Burke and Lt. Gorman visit Ripley at her apartment to inform her that communications to LV426 have been knocked out for an unknown reason and that a team of space marines would be flying down there to investigate. He wanted Ripley to accompany them, but Ripley said it was absolutely out of the question. No way in hell would she ever return there. However, Burke gave her back her old title of Ship Officer and she accepted the job.Ripley and the marine corps soon arrived in orbit of LV426. They were headed by Lt. Gorman and Sgt. Apone. The troops consisted of Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Private Hudson, a tough-as-nails gunner Vasquez, Drake, Frost, Farro, Spunkmeyer, Dietrich and Wierzbowski. Accompanying them was Bishop, an android. Ripley was reminded of the android she encountered on her last mission (Ash) and so she was very weary of trusting Bishop. Soon, the marines all board a shuttle that takes them down to the planetoid surface, then with Bishop at the controls, they drive a terrain armored transport up to a communications complex. They go inside and find destroyed equipment, wires hanging from the ceiling. Who or what could have done this? Upon further inspection, they discover a human child. A little girl, hiding. Ripley tried to coax her out but she ran. Ripley later found the little girl in what appeared to be her hideout. She discovered from a picture that the girls' name was Rebecca Jorden; Sgt. Apone, Corporal Hicks and the rest soon discover people! Most were dead, but some were still alive, begging for mercy. That's when a little alien creature burst right out of one of the people's stomachs. Luckily it was burned alive in no time flat. But that's also when a mass of monstrous, grown alien creatures dropped from the ceiling and started to attack. The men shot their hi-tech firepower all around the room. Frost, Dietrich and Wierzbowski were killed by the aliens. Hicks, Drake, Hudson, and Vasquez ran for it. Drake was taken out next. Unfortunately, Sgt. Apone was also victim to the aliens. They board the terrain vessel and shoot out of there in a hurry, with Ripley at the controls; The little girl tells Ripley that her real name was Newt. She had a family once, but what happened to them, she didn't tell. Whatever it was certainly scared her. Well it was time to go home, unfortunately as Farro and Spunkmeyer boarded the shuttle to go pick them up, an alien stowed away on board and killed them, causing the shuttle to crash and blow up. Now they were stuck.They seek refuge inside the communications complex. Ripley devised a plan to use the complex's extensive equipment to radio the mother ship in orbit and have the spare shuttle sent down. Bishop was the only one qualified for such a task, so he accepted. He crawled through a pipeline that lead to the main dish. Tension began to build among the marines, especially Hudson. There were smaller alien creatures in the medlab that were there to be studied. Burke wanted to keep them alive because the research labs back home would pay a lot of money for them. So while the others checked on Bishop's progress, Ripley puts Newt down for a nap, but she was too afraid to go to sleep for fear of bad dreams. She was also afraid that monsters would get her...How right she was, for a few minutes later, those grotesque little alien creatures broke free and tried to latch themselves on Newt. Ripley came to her rescue and one alien tried to get her. Luckily it was Hicks to the rescue. He and Hudson blasted the aliens to smithereens. When they discover Burke was responsible for all this, they wanted to blast him next, but before they had the chance, they discover the place was overrun with monstrous aliens! They attack. Hudson is killed. Lt. Gorman and Vasquez run down a tunnel, but soon find themselves surrounded. Gorman takes out a grenade and he and Vasquez and the aliens in the tunnel are blown up; Ripley and Newt head down a different passage way, only Newt accidentally fell down a shaft and into the sewer systems. Meanwhile, Bishop finally got the second shuttle radioed down, but Ripley would not leave without Newt, so she grabbed an arsenal of alien- destructing weapons and went back in the complex and down to the deepest levels. She finds Newt alive, luckily, but then she also finds a nest of alien eggs and finally gets to see the Mother Alien herself! She was enormous and just as hideous as the other aliens.

I've seen my share of Ingmar Bergman, and I even though I loveBergman's movies I've found them tough to get through sometimes(though they're absolutely worth it, most of them).This movie was nothing like that though. Just a pure delight fromstart to finish. Such a beautiful movie.You see static scenes, from a non-moving camera.. which all ofthem seems to have been timed and calculated to the extremeeven though you don't notice it on the actors at all..All the scenes are all taken in one shot, which also is stunninglydone. The thing that makes it so easy to watch though is that it relies onhumor, even though they're quite dramatic settings. The dialogue is sharp as needles and the whole movie works likea puzzle.. because some way or the other things here seems toconnect to each other. Like, there's this huge traffic jam in the city which has lasted for 8hours and nobody knows whats holding it up. Something tells uslater that its symbolic probably. The scenes at the madness institute is really funny. Where thisone guys talks about how Jesus was hanged on a cross, becausehe was a nice person. Everything in this movie seems so plannedto the detail that its simply a gasping experience all up to the lastscene which might be the most fantastic of them all. The best of it is that it doesn't really give away anything, and itshumor and depth is so well hidden. Its an amazing movie only.I don't think I have any complaints at all. Expected it to be some kind of weird little thing with some goodmoments, but I ended up with one of the best movie I've seen outof Scandinavia this far.
