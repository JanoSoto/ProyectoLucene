Together with Bob (Alec Baldwin) and Stephen (Harold Perrineau) he has to find a way to survive the harsh environment and find his way out, while all the while all three of them are being stalked by a huge man-eating bear. Baldwin was a bit of a strange choice for this role. Bob was supposed to be a fashion photographer and I have trouble picturing Baldwin in that kind of role. Baldwin also usually plays strong, in control, leader types, but here he's clearly (both as an actor and a character) playing second fiddle to Hopkins' Morse. He pulled this untypical (for him) part off pretty well, but I still had trouble in my mind making him fit the part. The scenes in which the three (or two, after Stephen is killed by the beast) are doing battle with the bear are pretty good and exciting. The rest is pretty standard for this kind of movie. The biggest weakness of the movie is that - to me at least - Morse was too much of a good guy, and those last twenty minutes or so that I referred to took that aspect of his character and blew it way out of proportion, giving an air of unreality to what was happening. The moral dilemma that was introduced at the end didn't have to be introduced, and I felt it detracted from the movie rather than adding to it. In the end I thought this went out with a whimper rather than a bang, but overall it's pretty good.

What I mean by universal appeal is this; you could put anyone (who likes movies) of any age and sit them down in front of North by Northwest and they will likely enjoy themselves. This movie has something for everyone, it has excellent pacing and scenery&#x85;and of course it has the old master at the helm.North by Northwest certainly doesn't look like it's over 50 years old. That's something that a master like Hitchcock adds to a film; his expert use of lighting, camera positioning and sound give this movie a crispness that defies its age. This adds to that universal appeal I mentioned, alas many movies from the 1950s don't look near as good as North by Northwest. It amazes me how many recent movies have forced me to abort due to inferior camera techniques&#x85;excessive camera movement (this can actually make me dizzy), too many close-ups and weird angles, and poor lighting and editing. Heres the deal; many of todays film directors have NO CLUE how to make a truly watchable and lasting movie...and the bigger problem...most of the dumbed-down audience of today can't tell the difference.Speaking of masters, does any actor today really carry a movie with such grace as Cary Grant? Grant plays Richard Thornhill in this movie, a wall street exec who has been mistaken for someone else by a group of international Art collectors who are also into espionage (what secrets they are transporting is irrelevant&#x85;what Hitchcock called the 'Mcguffin'). Grant moves through the film with his typical easy charm that maybe today's young actors should study, indeed Cary Grant is a natural and this is a perfect role for his style. Thornhill is befriended by the lovely Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint, also well cast) on the 20th century limited, but Kendall may or may not be what she appears to be.The story takes us to Chicago where Thornhill is supposed to meet a man at a dusty crossroads in the middle of corn country as (in case you don't know) one of the most famous scenes in movie history unfolds. Eventually we end up at the Mount Rushmore memorial for one of Hitchcock's patented climaxes in or around some famous, exotic locale.It's a wonderful ride... I think the best test of a classic movie is the test of time. I first saw (and fell in love with) North by Northwest in a hotel room in Utah while on vacation when I was about 15 years old. I've watched it many times since and it always seems fresh. When a master is on the mark it is something to relish&#x85; a gift from the movie gods.Hitchcock was once asked what he did for a living to which he replied producer, when asked what he produced he answered Goosebumps.

We have watched it every Christmas Eve for about 10 years and the whole family knows most of it by heart. It's funnier every time. With its large cast of wacky characters who make the story unfold like a pinball game, it has a lot in common with You Can't Take It With You, another family favorite. I simply can't understand why it is so little known it's a classic screwball comedy, with hilarious ensemble work by some of our greatest comic actors. Madeline Kahn's performance alone should put Mixed Nuts in every comedy lover's DVD library, since her untimely death so cruelly limited her wonderful body of work. She's at her absolute best here.Some of the actors were at a relatively early stage in their careers when this was made, and it is a testament to the judgment of the casting director that they were chosen.Mixed Nuts introduced our family to Liev Schreiber, who plays a gloriously funny role that, taken with the work he's better known for, illustrates marvelous range.

Rarely do I get a sequel where I call it almost as good as the original, but this one lives up to the name. It's formula is almost identical to his predecessor, a bumbling yet lovable cop tries to do a task he is clearly not capable of, but somehow does a great job by being his naive, idiotic self. I love it. If it makes you laugh, enjoy it. Don't find reasons to nitpick it to death. Admit you laughed, and I'm sure, you're not the only one who found quite a few things to laugh at in this must see sequel.I was a bit skeptical pressing play on this film since it seemed like it was identical in plot to the original film. Could this be a dreary, worthless remake of a highly respected parody film? Nope. It's the same old jokes, but they are used in a tireless manor. Too bad movies like these don't have as many sequels as movies like Saw. I'd rather see Nielsen play a hilarious cop rather than watched torture porn consistently.Leslie Nielsen reprises his role as Frank Drebbin, the bumbling police officer who tries to do right, but does much wrong. Drebbin's ex-girlfriend (Patricia Presley, too reprising her role) is found to be apart of a scientist who is using solar energy for harm. Drebbin must win back his ex, whom he still has feelings for, and stop the scientist.Besides Nielsen being the highlight of the film, O.J. Simpson does a great job here as well. I enjoyed him very much in the original film, but for some reason I appreciated him more in this film. I think he had a bigger effect on this movie than the original. Patricia Presley returned as well, so the casting gets a thumbs up right there.Whenever I watch a sequel, I hope for the original cast to return as their original roles. American Pie, Back to the Future Part II, and Clerks II may not have been perfect, but they all get a good cast review from me since almost all of the originals had come back. Not like just doing a sequel for the money over ten years late like Ace Ventura Jr Pet Detective and Son of the Mask. The Naked Gun 2 1\/2 is now welcomed to this category thanks to Nielsen, Presley, and Simpson returning.As far as the movie goes, there isn't too much to say that I didn't say before.

Great sci-fi action, fun characters, and an exciting story with a deep undertone. Wrath of Khan is the sequel to the lackluster Star Trek The Motion Picture. It takes place an unknown amount of time after the first film when Admiral James T. Kirk is pulled from his desk job to once again go into space with the USS Enterprise. What begins as a seemingly simple mission to investigate a program called Genesis becomes complicated when a ruthless villain named Khan shows up to enact his revenge on Admiral Kirk, the man who marooned him on a remote desert world years ago. This movie is everything you could want out of a feature length Star Trek picture. It is one of the highest points Star Trek would ever see in its long history.Wrath of Khan possesses everything that makes Star Trek so enjoyable. It is undeniably melodramatic at moments, and it can definitely be cheesy but, unlike its predecessor, the film contains some great sci-fi elements, but also hones in on all the unique aspects that make Star Trek what it is. For a sci-fi film the movie is much slower than what we are use to today, but it uses this to its dramatic and emotional advantage. The film moves at the pace of a grand space epic and has all the glorious set pieces and soap opera drama that are needed to pull off the unconventional. It is a beautiful film to look at, especially now that all the visual aspects such as costumes and scenery have a much bigger budget behind them to eliminate any of the laughable cheesiness we became so familiar with in the original series. The whole film is very well designed, especially in some of the contrasts between characters and costumes. Kirk and his Enterprise crew are all very prominently dressed in their very sophisticated and official looking Starfleet uniforms, while Khan and his followers wear fur skin clothing, giving them all a much more sinister and tribal look. The film contains much more visual prowess than ever really seen before in Star Trek.But just because the visuals were improved doesn't mean the filmmakers felt it necessary to slack off on the storyline. The plot of Wrath of Khan is everything we love about Star Trek. It is very deep and it deals with a lot of things relevant to modern society, just in the context of a futuristic one. The project Genesis is a device that has the ability to create worlds out of nothing and create its own life. There is obviously a lot of controversy behind a God playing machine like this, and this plays into some of the undertones in this film. But one of the most interesting ethical aspects of the film is its portrayal of Kirk. We have come to know Kirk as the knight in shining armor character, he is the valiant hero who will never leave a man behind and will go down with his ship if he has to. Yet in Wrath of Khan we see a darker side of Kirk. He is still loyal to his crew and his ship, but his moral ground is shaken with Khan's appearance. Khan brings to light Kirk's darker side by telling the story of how Kirk was, in Khan's eyes, responsible for the death of Khan's wife and the reason that Khan is now in the position he is in. Of course in the end Kirk could never be anything less than the ultimate hero, but some of the things that come to light in this film give it a much more human feel.The acting ability in Wrath of Khan is what Star Trek is. It is a science fiction melodrama and the acting plays it up just right. I will say that I thought Shatner's acting ability peaked in this film, and the rest of the cast felt more real to me than normal. Then of course we have the intimidating presence of Ricardo Montalban as Khan himself, who brings the greatest acting of the film to fruition. Montalban's performance is powerful and riveting, and the utter presence of the ruthless Khan can shake you to your core. If Khan was on screen, so were my eyes. Not to say my eyes weren't on the screen when Khan wasn't tearing up his role, but even more so when he was. He makes the film a lot of fun, but also a much deeper and more compelling ride.Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a fantastic Star Trek adventure that has everything that makes Star Trek what it is. It is some of the finest and most fascinating sci-fi you will ever see. This film can be enjoyed by fans and non fans alike, but it definitely helps if you're a fan knowing what to expect. It isn't your typical sci-fi shoot em up exploding roller coaster ride, but it is something much more gripping and enjoyable to watch if you can appreciate the beauty of sci-fi as an art form, and less as escapist entertainment. This is a must see for science fiction fans. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2010","score":"","review":" This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Star Trek is all about!

He pretends to be crazy to get out of working, and ends up in an institute where things just get more crazy. His ability to capture the attention of the audience is very prevalent. He brings a certain charisma to the screen, one that makes you truly identify with his character. The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role. I think that it was artfully constructed to invite the viewer to think beyond Nicholsons humor in the movie and investigate a moral issue.

The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role.

Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film. It has all the ingredients to make a good&#x85; drama&#x85;dialog&#x85;good background score.

Most of the prisoners live but two escape--John Jackson (Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier). They're also chained to each other. Naturally they hate each other but (sigh) slowly learn to respect and care for each other.What a dated movie. Seriously--THIS won a Best Screenplay Oscar? I find it hard to believe that even in 1958 this was considered daring. The talks and insights are thoroughly predictable and I actually rolled my eyes a few time at how obvious this was getting. Also there are glaring lapses in continuity---after Jackson and Cullen are caught in a raging river AND running through the rain, Jackson's cigarettes AND matches are completely dry and we get to watch him smoke nonstop. To make matters worse they run into a woman (Cara Williams) at the end and the film comes to a screeching halt (and it was already slow to begin with!).On the plus side--the acting was great. Curtis and Poitier play well off each other and make their change from hatred to caring seem realistic. Also it was fun to see Lon Chaney in a rare dramatic role and he was great! It was well directed by Stanley Kramer and won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography. But, all in all, I found this boring, heavy-handed and slow-moving. Time is not kind to all movies and this is proof positive of that! I give it a 5.

Extremely wacky. Yes, it's one of Bruce Lee's trademark action movies and you get to see him go toe to toe with a ton of bad guys, but there's a lot of both intentional and unintentional humor. Obvious setups like Bruce fearfully fleeing from a gorgeous and aggressive topless woman are followed by the absurdity of Bruce beating bad guy after bad guy so easily that you wonder why they bother to fight him at all. He honestly doesn't get hit until his final battle, and then he's in trouble for all of 12 seconds before he's contemptuously dominating again. And the beyond awful dubbing of the voices is funnier on its own than half the comedies that are released today. The story concerns Bruce coming to Rome to help out a woman who's restaurant is being threatened by some kind of absurdly diverse mob. There's a pretty Chinese girl for him to rescue, a bunch of comic relief fighters to keep the bad guys busy until Bruce is ready to smack 'em around, and a hilariously offensive Asian stereotype running things as the number two for the sinister bad guy. There's not much serious about Return of the Dragon, so I wouldn't put it on par with Enter the Dragon (which is a classic, in my opinion). But, the fights are fun and there's nothing wrong with seeing a martial arts movie that tries to make you laugh, every once in a while.
