It's not that it's a great movie, it's just that whenever it's on I feel I have to watch it.  And maybe I'll pick up on something I didn't understand the first time I saw it.  Because there are some things that just don't come together.It starts of slow, with Robert De Niro revisiting his childhood home in New York.  I suppose he hasn't seen it in a while, and everything has changed.  But instantly you are taken with the score.  I believe the score of the film to be one of the best in history.  I was really taken with it.  The scenes when Robert De Niro and his pals are kids is perfect.  I would give those scenes alone a 10.  When we first see him spying on (the very young) Jennifer Connelly while she is dancing (and that beautiful score plays), the second time I saw this movie it made my eyes tear up.  Just out of pure brilliance and knowledge of what was going to happen in the future with the young kids. But when the cast gets older the movie starts to fall apart.  It still has that heartbreaking score that pulls at your strings, but sometimes things happened so fast you got lost.

Ryan Phillipe is a beautiful Sebastian- tragic and anguished and supurbly passionate. I'm not a huge Reese Witherspoon fan, but she was perfect for the role of Annette.

Its classic, robust, and sophisticated. The elite world of New York's East Side and the Fifth Avenue high class.

Further, you know how you would never take that story and spend millions of dollars on translating it verbatim to film with no adult editorial input? You know what I mean?I really, really wanted to like A.I., and perhaps setting my expectations so high only contributed to the crushing disappointment I felt watching this film.  I found the concept of robots becoming more  integrated with society because they do not eat or require much in the way of living quarters (in the wake of over-population due to melting ice-caps) to be though provoking. However, my first danger signal came as David, an artificial boy who is introduced into the home of  a couple who's biological son is in a coma (or dead, or whatever), is initially rejected by the wife who is horrified at this ersatz replacement of her own son.....and suddenly, for no real reason, not only accepts David but begins to love him. Indeed, this transformation is important to the story but it comes out of left field with no development whatsoever. David comes into the household as a cold, semi-vulcan like automaton, but the mother activates David's  love circuit causing his cold stare to soften. He immediately starts calling this woman Mommy... and the woman just melts and accepts him. Uh, who's the robot here?Suddenly, ta-dah, the couple's biological son is restored to health and comes home, creating a sibling rivalry situation. The returned son has a mean streak in him and starts tormenting David. Through a series of misinterpreted fear responses in David, his parents deem him dangerous. Knowing that returning David to the company that made him will result in his destruction, the mother instead drives him into the woods and dumps him there at the mercy of a world in which robots are hated, feared, and destroyed for entertainment by the mass majority of people. Nice. Kinda like someone who would rather let thier pet die slowly instead of having them put to sleep at the vet.Anyhoo David, familiar with the Pinochio story, decides that his mommy would love him more and wouldn't have abandoned him if he were a real boy. In order to achieve this, he must seek out The Blue Fairy. He does indeed find her at the long-submerged Coney Island amusement park, where his repeated requests to the Blue Fairy's statue go unheard. And so he sits at the bottom of the ocean for two thousand years until aliens dig though the ice and find him. And the aliens clone his mommy for him so he can spend one day of happiness with her. Yay.This would be a very emotionally involving tale if it were not for the lack of character building and progressively treacly story telling. Between the mommy's willingness to abondon her child to the cruel world and  David's cold treatment at the hands of the very people who created him to feel emotions, the central message of this film seems to be that people suck.

I found the concept of robots becoming more  integrated with society because they do not eat or require much in the way of living quarters (in the wake of over-population due to melting ice-caps) to be though provoking. However, my first danger signal came as David, an artificial boy who is introduced into the home of  a couple who's biological son is in a coma (or dead, or whatever), is initially rejected by the wife who is horrified at this ersatz replacement of her own son.....and suddenly, for no real reason, not only accepts David but begins to love him. Indeed, this transformation is important to the story but it comes out of left field with no development whatsoever. David comes into the household as a cold, semi-vulcan like automaton, but the mother activates David's  love circuit causing his cold stare to soften. He immediately starts calling this woman Mommy... and the woman just melts and accepts him. Uh, who's the robot here?Suddenly, ta-dah, the couple's biological son is restored to health and comes home, creating a sibling rivalry situation. The returned son has a mean streak in him and starts tormenting David. Through a series of misinterpreted fear responses in David, his parents deem him dangerous. Knowing that returning David to the company that made him will result in his destruction, the mother instead drives him into the woods and dumps him there at the mercy of a world in which robots are hated, feared, and destroyed for entertainment by the mass majority of people. Nice. Kinda like someone who would rather let thier pet die slowly instead of having them put to sleep at the vet.Anyhoo David, familiar with the Pinochio story, decides that his mommy would love him more and wouldn't have abandoned him if he were a real boy. In order to achieve this, he must seek out The Blue Fairy. He does indeed find her at the long-submerged Coney Island amusement park, where his repeated requests to the Blue Fairy's statue go unheard. And so he sits at the bottom of the ocean for two thousand years until aliens dig though the ice and find him. And the aliens clone his mommy for him so he can spend one day of happiness with her. Yay.This would be a very emotionally involving tale if it were not for the lack of character building and progressively treacly story telling. Between the mommy's willingness to abondon her child to the cruel world and  David's cold treatment at the hands of the very people who created him to feel emotions, the central message of this film seems to be that people suck.

The problem is that this fifth installment in the series is only marginally better than the previous disaster. There might be some spoilers coming up, so beware from here on in. Everything in this movie is stale. It's been done before in the series. We even have Burgess Meredith back in this one, with either some old film that was cut from the original movie, or some new footage that he shot especially for this, as Rocky flashes back to some of the wisdom Micky shared with him (and that we've never seen before) as he prepared for his first fight with Apollo Creed. Burt Young gets to play Paulie as a drunkard again, Talia Shire (who seems particularly uninterested in playing Adrian again and doesn't seem to put much effort into the role) gets to yell Rocky! one last time and she offers a couple more pep talks, and Rocky (after being somewhat more cultured in the last couple of movies) regresses to his almost incoherent form from the original. They all seem to be playing caricatures of once great characters. There's even a caricature of Don King, in the character of the evil promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant.)Anyway the storyline is a bit silly, but here goes. Rocky is brain damaged after his fight with the giant Russian in Rocky IV. (Rocky brain-damaged? Who'd have guessed it!) So he retires, but Duke has a particularly rude fighter named Union Cane (now there's a name for a fighter) who wants a shot at the title (shades of Clubber Lang here - I told you there wasn't much original to this.) But Rocky retires, ends up managing an up and comer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who then dumps Rocky because he gets tired of being seen as Rocky's protege (now did he really think that as an unknown being trained by an ex-champ he'd ever escape from Rocky's shadow?) and the two of them - well, if you can sit through it you'll find out what happens in one of the dumbest endings I've ever seen to a movie.A couple of problems with the story that really bugged. (1) OK, Rocky loses all his money because of a crooked accountant. I can see that. Paulie thinks he should do endorsements. Sounds right to me. He's a two-time heavyweight champion of the world, a hero to the common folk. Who better to endorse various products? But his handlers say no. Seems no company would want him as a spokesman because of a minor criminal conviction many years ago. But then his people argue for a return to the ring, based on his immense popularity. Huh? If he's so immensely popular why couldn't he get endorsements? That doesn't make sense to me. (2) After having to move back to the old neighbourhood, Rocky is worried that his son is going to be the target of toughs at his new school. A reasonable concern. So, to make him him seem really tough I guess, Rocky walks him to school the first day and in front of the school toughs calls out Daddy loves you. (?) That's really going to help. And Rocky Jr. seems a bit too old for all the hugs and kisses dad gives him - my opinion anyway.Anyway, it's very sad to see how far the Rocky franchise fell after an Oscar-winning beginning and two relatively entertaining sequels.

It was these points that made him the greatest superhero ever created (thank you Mr Lee) and none finally he has the film to do his greatest justice.Before I saw this film I had heard many complaints about it, the effects don't look upto scratch, he should have mechanical webshooters etc,etc but my excitement and loyalty remained undeterred and I was dually repaid Raimi and co. did a fantastic job. Firstly, Tobey Maguire, who of which I can't imagine anyone else in his place, was absolutely fantastic in this role he brought the warmth, awkwardness and charm needed to carry the role of Parker\/Spider-man off and clearly enjoyed himself. Whoever said he couldn't do it because he has no 'star appeal' were wrong and those who suggested the walking irritation that is Freddie Prinze Jr for the role need shooting. His love interest MJ the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst did very well in her role with what little material she was given to deal with outside her position of screaming victim, she is a great talent and should have been used more.

I also want to take a moment to thank David Koepp for providing a near flawless script, something ususally missing from the event movie and give the film something different.The man though, who deserves all the credit must be the one, the only Mr Sam Raimi for providing us with this. He judged everything perfectly, the fight scenes where brutal over glamorous, the scenes with Spider-man swinging through the streets of New York, breathtaking, as he looked like a man that was barely in control yet knowing his every move to precision, as he fell only to fling himself back up again.

The love affair between Peter Parker and Mary Jane was well comtained and the final scene between the two was a heartfelt, beautiful scene and a credit to all those involved.

They get there only to find some horribly mutilated bodies and some angry enemies (humans) which they have to fight first. Soon, the real terror in the jungle is revealed and as the trailer said, it is something that never before has been on Earth. Let me introduce you a PREDATOR!This film is brainless, but in pretty enjoyable way so I definitely didn't feel myself bored after this second viewing. There are many shootings and explosions only to show people some action and entertainment, and they really make no sense. There are some irritating moments like to horrible patriotic music playing background during one soldier missing his dead friend who was also a soldier. The characters are as thin as possible, but at least they act decently and pretty believably, but not in all cases. This film cannot be enjoyed if viewed with too much criticism, and I try to concentrate on the merits this film has. Trash or not, a film may still have some merits and cinematic achievements.The cinematography is stunning and creates great atmosphere in many cases and segments. The director really knows how to direct action thrillers, as Die Hard proves, too. There are two totally great little details and scenes in Predator, and I definitely want to tell about them. The first, and greatest, is when Predator fixes himself\/itself and uses his tools with agony as he is wounded. As he shouts, there is one image\/angle that lasts perhaps one second, but catches the sun very effectively from one little hole in tree and it shines very brightly through that hole and looks totally fantastic. As I mentioned, this image is only one part of the fixing scene and that image is very brief and I think it's left for viewers to spot. This little detail really blew me away with this second viewing, it is that inventive and effective. The other detail spoils a little, so I won't tell too much about it, but it deals with a camera angle which is used after Predator has shot one of its victims in the head. The angle and tension is very great before and after that killing, and it would've been much less effective in the hands of not so talented director. There are also other great examples of cinematography and visual talent of the director, so this is one important element and achievement in this film, and due to this, I appreciate this film pretty much, despite the film being pretty stupid.The effects are plenty and gory as Predator kills and shoots its victims with bloody results. This is pretty violent film and it is interesting to see this got an R rating at the time without any cuts. Still, this is a mainstream film so it is no use in expecting some over-the-top splatter film, but as a film from a big studio, this is pretty gruesome, but also cartoonish. The effects about the monster itself and its ability to change colors and copy its environment are very fantastic and even more convincing than the make up effects. Also, the monster itself is pretty damn ugly and disgusting and created with care by Stan Winston.Predator is great film for lovers of big budget action and (unintentional) trash cinema and of course a must for those who love Arnold's charisma on screen. This is a great example about this genre's abilities and McTiernan can be proud of this film, too. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2002","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  John McTiernan directed this alien gore fest starring the legend Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, a hard boiled military officer who gets a job to go with his men to somewhere in South America's jungles and hunt down some platoon that has disappeared strangely.

The characters are as thin as possible, but at least they act decently and pretty believably, but not in all cases. This film cannot be enjoyed if viewed with too much criticism, and I try to concentrate on the merits this film has. Trash or not, a film may still have some merits and cinematic achievements.The cinematography is stunning and creates great atmosphere in many cases and segments. The director really knows how to direct action thrillers, as Die Hard proves, too. There are two totally great little details and scenes in Predator, and I definitely want to tell about them. The first, and greatest, is when Predator fixes himself\/itself and uses his tools with agony as he is wounded. As he shouts, there is one image\/angle that lasts perhaps one second, but catches the sun very effectively from one little hole in tree and it shines very brightly through that hole and looks totally fantastic. As I mentioned, this image is only one part of the fixing scene and that image is very brief and I think it's left for viewers to spot. This little detail really blew me away with this second viewing, it is that inventive and effective. The other detail spoils a little, so I won't tell too much about it, but it deals with a camera angle which is used after Predator has shot one of its victims in the head. The angle and tension is very great before and after that killing, and it would've been much less effective in the hands of not so talented director. There are also other great examples of cinematography and visual talent of the director, so this is one important element and achievement in this film, and due to this, I appreciate this film pretty much, despite the film being pretty stupid.The effects are plenty and gory as Predator kills and shoots its victims with bloody results. This is pretty violent film and it is interesting to see this got an R rating at the time without any cuts. Still, this is a mainstream film so it is no use in expecting some over-the-top splatter film, but as a film from a big studio, this is pretty gruesome, but also cartoonish. The effects about the monster itself and its ability to change colors and copy its environment are very fantastic and even more convincing than the make up effects. Also, the monster itself is pretty damn ugly and disgusting and created with care by Stan Winston.Predator is great film for lovers of big budget action and (unintentional) trash cinema and of course a must for those who love Arnold's charisma on screen.

They get there only to find some horribly mutilated bodies and some angry enemies (humans) which they have to fight first. Soon, the real terror in the jungle is revealed and as the trailer said, it is something that never before has been on Earth.

Not so.We aren't told the story from the soldier's point of view, because we aren't told the story, period.  Nor do we really get the soldier's point of view.  Scott shows us ample footage from the point of view of the odd Somalian sniper, and from the point of view of command central, and (albeit rarely) from the point of view of a civilian, and from no particular point of view at all; he focuses just as much on what the soldiers aren't looking at as he does on what they are looking at.  There's an unmistakable attempt to pull off a god's-eye perspective.  It doesn't succeed.  Actually, it's more as though Scott found himself in the middle of a REALLY COOL war, and he photographed all the REALLY COOL stuff around him as though he were shooting a beer commercial, making a mental note to edit it all later.  Then he edited it as though it were a beer commercial.  And who's surprised?  That's how he makes all his movies.That's why the movie fails on the second count, too - showing us what it was like to be there.  There's no what it was like anywhere in this film.  Actual soldiers who fight side by side can, at least when staring one another in the eyes at a distance of half a metre, recognise one another, which is more than we can do without straining our eyes and struggling to remember if this is the guy who makes coffee or the one who made that phone call earlier, you know, the one next to the pin-up - assuming the coffee guy and the pinup guy were distinct, which isn't certain.  Besides, ANY real life event has a continuity missing here.  Maybe the soldiers were as confused as I was about what was going on, but they couldn't have been as confused as I was about what (at any one point) they were trying to do.  The early parts of the mission, in which everyone knew what was going on and what they were doing, are shot in precisely the same bewildering, arty, choppy fashion as the later bits, in which the bewildering, choppy artiness is allegedly meant to convey the soldiers' own confusion.

A good film could be made - possibly in the vein of Kafka's The Trial - in which we don't know what the war is about or how it started or what the soldiers were doing there.  But if you're going to TRY to tell us the story, or ACT as though you're telling us the story, then it's as well to get it RIGHT.  The half-a-dozen sentences of context at the beginning are completely unhelpful.  And misleading, if not actually false.  The Americans weren't there to provide famine relief.  They weren't, as the film obliquely suggests, obstructed in any way by UN troops - in fact, the chutzpah of the Pentagon, who had control over the script, claiming such a thing, blows me away.  Twenty-two countries obediently pooled their forces under United Nations command, but the United States, as always, refused to do any such thing - partly to leave the US army free to indulge in whatever war crimes it pleased.One or two moments are unintentionally revealing.  A fresh soldier arrives and innocently refers to Mogadishu, but an older hand immediately corrects him Firstly, it's 'The Mog'.  Nobody calls it 'Mogadishu'.  No, nobody, except perhaps the people who live there.

I haven't read the Edith Wharton novel myself, so I'm not sure whether the story is dull to begin with or whether it was poorly rendered onto the screen.For starters, the weakest element by far was the lovelorn tension between Newland Archer (Day-Lewis) and the Countess Olenska (Pfeiffer). This is PIVOTAL to the story. From where does this forbidden attraction sprout? You mean to tell me that they chat a few times at social functions, giggle at a few trite insults they trade at the expense of some of New York's gluttonous upper crust (of which they are a part), and that's it? They become utterly spiritually and erotically consumed with one another? Sorry, don't buy it. I suppose there is such a thing as love at first sight or some variation of it, but I couldn't make that leap of imagination here either. There lacked, I thought, that intangible chemistry between two lovers. (I think of Calista Flockhart and Robert Downey Jr. in that one episode I saw of Ali McBeale. Hard to describe, but that's chemistry.)As for the erotic scene, I had to suppress chuckles. This could have been very highly charged if only the chemistry between them was there--either by having set up the attraction more plausibly or by casting more appropriate actors--and since it wasn't, it looked ridiculous. One minute they're talking, next minute he's sniffing her slipper.Day-Lewis' performance was starchy from beginning to end. I thought, at first, that it was a way to show what a person became in a society such as that--stiff, wooden, bland. But then I thought, people had souls even then. They may have been strictly bound by formality in public, but in private they were still human and could get angry, be passionate, be distraught, etc. I could see Day-Lewis trying to do that at times, but that stiffness just wouldn't go away.

Big deal.Winona Ryder's performance was very good. It may have been just Winona being Winona as opposed to great acting, but she played the part of the dainty, rose-cheeked, innocent (but scheming when it comes to keeping her man), New York Victorian bride to a tee.The narration was very irritating, the voice grating on my ears.
