So, I knowingly lowered my expectations for this third entry in the series. Even with those lowered expectations, I still wasn't prepared for how insipidly stupid it would be. Yes, there was plenty of Superman action. Yes, the special effects were as good as ever. The acting was fine. But the story? Oh my god! Richard Lester was merely a hired gun on SUPERMAN II, due to Richard Donner being fired. Here he was in charge the whole time, and the sillier aspects of that film were given too much free reign here.The plot this time around is certainly one of the weakest aspects of the whole film. In short, an evil corporation that has ambitions for economic domination taints Superman with synthetic kryptonite (laced with tobacco tar), and this splits him into evil Superman and good Clark Kent. All of the best parts of the first two films are either shoved to the side or left out entirely. This means hardly any Daily Planet, and Lex Luthor is nowhere to be found. The replacement just doesn't compare favorably, no matter how much I didn't like Lex Luthor's characterization before. That being said, Superman having an identity crisis was an intriguing idea, but the way it's executed is so hamfistedly literal that it kills whatever impact it could have had.However, in the interest of not coming off like I absolutely hated the film, I will say that the technical aspects of the film were really good. All of the special effects were handled well, and the flying sequences were deftly handled, even if it's fairly apparent now how they were achieved (front projection). I also thought the cinematography was excellent, with a number of beautiful shots of landscapes and scenery. As previously stated, the acting was fine. In the TV special on the making of SUPERMAN II, Christpher Reeve talked about how he preferred playing Clark Kent because he was more relatable as a person. Here, the plot allowed for him to explore a darker side to Superman's personality, which I'm certain he had a hand in seeing as he's the film's star and it probably gets tiresome playing the same character over and over again. That one aspect of the plot is something I'll give the writers kudos for. If only they (and the director) hadn't made the film so silly...What's wrong with the film is nearly everything else. Richard Pryor plays an opportunistic con man and computer genius (who discovers his talent in a computer programming course). There is absolutely nothing wrong with Richard Pryor. I quite like his standup act. However, he seemed extremely out of place here. In general, the silly tone just rubbed me the wrong way and there was too much reliance on slapstick for laughs. A perfect example of this is the opening scene which just went on far too long. At some point, it felt like I was watching a Keystone Kops movie than a Superman film. Beyond that, some elements of the story were nonsensical and just plain stupid. First of all, is this the same Clark Kent\/Superman who reversed time to save Lois Lane and gave up his power to be with her (temporarily, at least)? If so, then why does he go back to Smallville and almost immediately hook up with childhood friend Lana Lang? Also, compared to the villains' schemes in the previous two films, the plot to turn Superman into a jerk (so that they can dominate the coffee industry?) seems like a step back. Not only that, but they bungle the one clever plot element by having Superman literally fight Clark Kent, and then having the evil side just disappear when Clark Kent puts a choke hold on him. And when you think about it, kryptonite is pretty stupid as it is. I could go on, but hopefully I've made my point.Overall, SUPERMAN III feels like a huge step back in storytelling when compared to the previous two, which I didn't exactly love to begin with. Entertaining? Yes, in some respects, but this one was borderline painful to watch. The idiocy displayed on screen was barely tolerable. Richard Lester was allowed to indulge in his slapstick tendencies to a degree which wasn't possible in SUPERMAN II (since he had to use stuff that Richard Donner shot), and the result was rather unflattering. Having watched nine of the original Superman cartoon shorts, at times this felt like a return to that style, which I was not a fan of. I'll give the filmmakers credit for making a visually appealing film that displays some technical prowess. I also still get goosebumps when I hear John Williams' iconic theme.

I remember my Dad had it perched at the top of our TV planner for about four years. Who knows why he deleted it, probably not enough room for all the Coronation Street.Any time he had it on and I was just passing through, my Mum would always tell me not to watch it. It wasn't until I discovered a pirate copy at the back of our DVD draw years later when looking for Shrek 2 that I understood her reasoning.It starts off pretty safe&#x85; the character of Yolanda sets the tone for what is to come in the next three hours utter madness. Actually that's another thing I didn't expect, a film to exceed the three hour mark without losing my attention. Although, I am basically calling out LOTR there.One thing which I really loved about it was John Travolta's performance and how it kind of was his second break. It is certainly better than what he was doing before anyway, the kind of rubbish family movies. Samuel L. Jackson, marvelous as ever. Probably my favorite performance from him actually. And, yes, that is including his voice as Frozone in the Incredibles...I know...tough to beat. I'm not kidding there either, The Incredibles made my childhood. I think I actually saw that at the cinema five times in about three weeks because I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. Little did I know that illegal streaming was on its way&#x85;I hadn't heard much of Uma Thurman before this so I was looking forward to how she did. I had heard her name in various Tarantino interviews about Kill Bill so was interested to actually see her in a film. No I haven't seen Kill Bill either... don't judge me, okay. She did well; her character didn't seem quite as pivotal to the plot as Travolta's and Jackson's did and that was something that initially bugged me, in the same way that Bruce Willis' character wasn't quite given a resolution. I thought a lot about it and came to the conclusion that it didn't really matter. We do see Willis interact with Travolta, in a scene that really made me laugh. Travolta getting obliterated by his own gun just after taking a dump, and the audience not being given any previous inclination that he was there. That both confused me and had me in hysterics; only Travolta could have pulled that off, mainly because when contrasted with Sam Jackson's character he is easily the less mature of the two. If Willis had shot Jackson then it would have been a tragic demise, but the fact that it was Travolta made it almost tongue in cheek. Very good.The entire Willis section&#x85; I mean, you could write about it for days. First of all, his Dad keeping the watch up his backside for five years, and then his mate having it for another two. Then he just hands it to Willis as a kid like Oh don't worry, it's clean, I ran it under the tap. I'd be saying You dirty rotten&#x85; Only Tarantino would come up with that. Although it did serve as a great narrative device to push Willis' character forward. So now we get to the rape scene. At first it made me uncomfortable, not the actual shot of the guy getting raped&#x85; I was surprisingly fine with that, maybe I should see a psychiatrist when I've finished with this. The Officer doing Eenie Meenie Minee Mo on Willis and the black guy really made me uncomfortable, because the sight of the two completely vulnerable guys tied up with the Officer having the power was like&#x85; eugh. Then Willis escapes and what follows really made me laugh loud. I won't be able to convey the humour that comes of Willis going to the hammer&#x85; then the bat&#x85; then the chainsaw. Then the camera pulls back, and you see Willis looking up. That moment of anonymity was beautiful, and then he looks up and sees that huge Samurai sword. That got me going as well.I actually went into Film Studies class on the Monday, I watched it Sunday evening and my teacher asked us 'what was the last film that made you feel an emotion?'. You've got people saying they cried at Fast 7, people laughed at The Inbetweeners 2. So obviously I say I laughed loads at Pulp Fiction, and suddenly I get people looking at me like I've said 'Oh yeah, I love torture me'.What's left? I think that's it&#x85; Oh yeah! Now&#x85; you get directors that occasionally grace the other side of the camera with their presence. I'll admit all day that Tarantino's a top class director and a writer. But his acting, it probably seems off to me because I'm used to watching his interviews when he's telling some guy on channel 4 that he's shutting his butt down. I dunno&#x85; it seemed a bit wobbly. I watched a bit of Reservoir Dogs and from what I saw, he plays a more central role in that so I'll judge his acting on how he does there.So overall really enjoyable movie. Definitely one I will watch again. It seems like one of those movies you can just have on and still really enjoy it. I've added it to my list of 'have on films' (I'll think of a better name) alongside Wolf of Wall Street and Grease, which I've also watched numerous times in the past few weeks.

Thanks for reading ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"11 June 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Whale! Whale! Whale! What do we have here? It's Free Willy and I love blubbering about Free Willy. It's a whale of a tail. It's one of my favorite nostalgia, early 1990s kid films. Directed by Simon Wincer, Free Willy tells the story of a delinquent boy, Jesse (Jason James Richter) who become friends with a captive killer whale, Willy (Keiko). Seeing that Willy was upset due to the absence of his family and the fact, that Willy didn't like his small living conditions; Jesse set up a plan to kidnap Willy, and tries to set him free in the wild. Can Jesse and Willy escape from the cruel owners of aquarium or will Willy end up, being fish food? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; I found the movie to be a bit predictable. After all, the title of the movie, kinda gives it, away. It's not like the movie posters, DVD covers, and trailers, pretty much spoils the outrageous end of the movie, as well. The film's ending has been spoofed several times in popular culture, due to how over the top, it was. It was a bit unrealistic. The movie also suffers from overused clichés. I really didn't like the sub-plot of Jesse's handling of his new foster parents. It seem a bit forced and underdevelopment. I really didn't buy into the whole surviving on his own, as a runaway bit. Around thing that was hard to believe, was the chemistry between the whale and the main actor. It was too similar to previous movies of a child bonding with a wild animal like 1966's Namu. I really found the whole idea of Willy connecting with the child, a little impractical. For a creature that been left alone in a small dark tanks for hours, I would have, thought the orca would be a little more aggressed and bite Jesse's head off or try to drown him. It's seem a bit, off. After all, they are killer whales! I guess, Keiko was just that well-trained. While, the film does make a good persuasive case against keeping these creatures in captivity for the purposes of human entertainment by highlighting incidents that Willy has. The movie is a little one-sided argument about whales being in captivity. I find it a tad odd that this movie is basically condemning the very thing it is exploiting which is using captive wild animals for entertainment purposes. The movie also fails to tells how important, some aquariums are, for sick killer whales. Now, every aquarium seem a bit evil. Like the 2013's documentary, Blackfish; viewers of this movie, might not understand, that some places, like SeaWorld honestly, tries hard to keep whales, healthy, enough to return to the wild. Still, when this movie did came out, I was one of those, who really believe that the whale that play Willy should have been free. At least the filmmakers followed their own preaching, and campaigned for the freeing of Keiko, the actual killer whale who stands in for an animatronic Willy in many scenes. The plan for Keiko to return to the wild was a topic of much controversy at the time. Some critics felt that a return to the wild, was somewhat impossible, because of the years of him being in captivity. They were somewhat right, most of the attempts of him going back into the wild were mostly unsuccessful, due to the fact, that he often return, seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back. He was so dependent on humans that he really couldn't connection with other whales. In 2003, Keiko sadly die in one last attempt in the wild at the young age of 26 due to Pneumonia. He will be miss. Despite, him, not living long in the wild, I still came out from this movie learning more than I came into the film. I love the fact that this movie help spark the Save the Whales Foundation into a success organization. I love the fact that this movie had singer Michael Jackson produced and performed Will You Be There, as one of the theme songs for the film, which can be heard during the film's credits. The song won the MTV Movie Award for Best Song in a Movie in 1994. It was also included in Michael Jackson's Dangerous album. It's one of his best songs, ever. It really help the save the whales program. The main theme by Basil Poledouris was also amazing and majestic. Even the harmonica music that Jesse plays, wasn't that bad. While, the music was good. The acting, not so much. While, some of the characters strongly express of human emotion like James Jason Richter who work well, on-screen with Keiko. Others were kinda one dimensional. The worst, had to be the over the top money hungry, villain played by Michael Ironsides. He was really hammy. The movie made great use of stock footage of whales. It was really nice, seeing them, in their natural habitat. The movie was followed by three sequels 1995's Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home, 1997's Free Willy 3 The Rescue, and 2010's Free Willy Escape from Pirate's Cove, and a short-lived animated television series. I don't recommended watching the sequels, but I do want you to check out 2010's Keiko The Untold story. It's a documentary film about Keiko that is worth seeing. Overall Despite its cheesy nature, Free Willy is great movie for fans of Marine life. I really enjoy this film.
