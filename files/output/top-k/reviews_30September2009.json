After you watch the movie and know what Andy actually was upto, you would want to actually watch it again to see how good actors (especially Andy) acted in those scenes. Movie revolves around Andy who is a hot shot banker, convicted for his wife's murder and subsequently sent for two life sentences back to back in Shawshank Prison. Andy who by his level of education and IQ gets gifted with both friends and enemies inside the walls, gels up well with Red, who gets a lot of things done for Andy. Warden also is impressed with Andy and starts a scam with his help to launder money into his pocket. In between, the brawl with gang of sisters the homosexuals who try to assault Andy and Reds group, with who Andy starts to get along with pretty well, play a very important part in the story.After twenty years, a young boy who somehow knows and could testify Andy's innocence comes to Shawshank Prison for committing some felony. Warden gets him killed and covers up the crime with 'that boy trying to break free' story. By this time Andy gets ready for his revenge with Warden and his final step. Story unfolds.I would like everybody who watches this to watch this movie twice, so that they can understand the true essence of storytelling. Must tell you that, I was more thrilled when I watched it for second time, as I could understand things which were puzzling me for the first time.

The first half might drag a modern viewer through boredom to an actual nap. The conflict in the nice, happy lives of these upper crust Britons amounts to who will win a local rose competition. It's all sweet and well made, but that's hardly enough. The acting is sustaining, for sure. The two leads, played by a wonderful Greer Garson (the first Mrs. Miniver of three) and her husband, a likable Walter Pidgeon, are completely convincing, warm, and eventually admirable. The supporting roles of the son (played by Richard Ney) and neighbor's daughter (Teresa Wright, a year after The Little Foxes and a year before Shadow of a Doubt) are first rate if somewhat typecast. The scene is England, and the year is 1939.Eventually the action turns, and the hardships begin, and death visits the family as it did so often in the south of England early in the war. That first hour of calm pays off now by contrast. And as a sidebar, watch when mother and son kiss, on the lips, a little too warmly for mother and son. That's because Garson and Ney are hitting it off and they will soon marry (for all of four years). Director William Wyler makes a highly professional job of all this. Certain moments will affect you if you let them, like the bombing around the family in their little shelter. This is the fear of every sweet and ordinary family in war, helpless and afraid, but doing their best to survive with calm and even humor. The cheer of the townspeople between bombings, and even as the warning of more planes is given, makes you swell up with admiration. If there seems to be a lack of warmth of effusive love all around (this is the typecast British style, of course) there is instead total goodness, steadfastness, and loyalty. There is the implication of love, and of caring, and doing what is right.And that, above all, is the point of the movie. War time movies, Hollywood, European or British equally, had to support the cause. Sometimes it comes off metaphorically, as an artistic parallel to the truth, as in Casablanca, which really is a kind of support the troops movie. And sometimes it is more literal, showing soldiers in action or a population mobilized in every small way, and this is Mrs. Miniver, which has the lasting advantage of a human drama beyond mere fighting. Even the rose competition ends up as a lesson to the old guard to be willing to change with the times, to embrace your countrymen across class barriers, and do what is right.Taken out of context, this is a commonplace drama made extremely well, a great entertainment. Its predictability (we don't know who will die but we know someone will) and its stylized, calm handling of really awful and terrifying scenes (a wounded Nazi in your kitchen!) make this something less than it might have been in other hands. Wyler is all about restraint, but even he might have made a more gut-wrenching version ten years later, once the war is won. But of course, that's not fair, because when it was shot it wasn't known who was going to win. To appreciate the movie, you have to see how a viewer with relatives on the battlefield would see it. Everyone is desperate to have their love affair while they can. People of all stripes had to wear an attitude of perseverance and survival. This movie ignores those who didn't play along, the down side to war, the civilian misdeeds. Yes, this is a positive movie, what the enemy would call propaganda.

The Untouchables is an admirable actioner in which, as of course, it should, good beats bad and we can all sleep soundly in bed at night knowing that guys such as Eliot Ness are out there fighting the good fight. It would be tactless to point out here that back in the real world, at the time Ness was operating, the cops were more intent on brutal strike-breaking and beating up the unemployed than nailing gangsters such as Al Capone, but then this is real life as seen through the Tinseltown lens, not real life as experienced by many on the dole queues. Anyway, this is Hollywood, and DePalma does point out that he has created a fiction based on fact and is not trying to show what really happened. And what he has created is a decent film, loads of action and great moments of suspense. I first saw The Untouchables when it was released and liked it. Twenty years on, it doesn't satisfy quite as much. In retrospect, and compared with similar work being produced these days, it is remarkably one-dimensional. There is precious little characterisation, precious little motivation and the ease with with Ness and just three sidekicks manages to nail Capone is all rather too glib. Capone, the unofficial mayor of Chicago, had, after all, the chief of police in his pocket, the city council, much of the judiciary and Lord know who else. But in the DePalma's version of events, Ness does it and does it seemingly with ease. A more satisfying film and the film a more modern director might have attempted would surely have shown a little more of the moral ambiguity which made it all possible, the process by which Capone held such supreme control. And I doubt it would have gone for what can only be described as the cartoon option of giving Ness three partners straight from central casting the gruff, tough and straight Irish cop, who isn't above taking a dram himself despite buying alcohol being illegal; the kooky egghead accountant who discovers the joy of firing a shotgun and is also not above enjoying an illegal snifter; and the 'ethnic' from the wrong side of the tracks. Historically, Ness had a far larger squad of 'untouchables' and, ironically, wasn't actually responsible for putting Capone behind bars the accountants did do that, finally nailing the seemingly invincible Capone because he hadn't paid any income tax, and the Volstead Act banning alcohol was eventually repealed. But what the hell, this is avowedly fiction and fiction is what we get. Subsidiary quibbles might be that however great an actor Robert De Niro is, on screen he is not Al Capone but invariably De Niro acting well. Ditto Sean Connery (who must be the first Irishman with a pronounced Scottish brogue). They suffer from the unfortunate fact that it is so difficult to suspend disbelief when they are on screen. Kevin Costner was a relative unknown when he starred in this film and Charles Martin Smith as the kooky accountant is one of those actors who face seems familiar but you can't quite place him. It seems unreasonable to quibble, but just how moral was the untouchable Eliot Ness when, as he does here, he takes justice into his own hands and hurls from a great height the, admittedly very nasty, Capone henchman who had brutally gunned down Sean Connery. This is morality American style. But what the hell, this film was made 20 years ago and cannot really be condemned for not pressing all the modern buttons as well as one might have liked.

First of all because Al Pacino cuts a character he is in no way close to being in real life. He plays a retired lieutenant-colonel which is nothing, but a blind one. His blindness is the symbol, and result, of both a heroic career and a sad end because he was passed over for general. This mixture of so many emotions and feelings and frustrations is marvelously conveyed by the actor. His tone, his behavior, his general stand, his unpredictable reactions, his decision to leave this world and his second decision to stay can be read in the way he speaks, the words he uses, the expressions his blind face carries, his attitudes toward other people, etc. He is a millionaire in emotions. But it is a masterpiece for so many other reasons that I am only going to quote a few. First it is a journey, the journey of a prep school teenager, a student on a scholarship mind you, from Oregon to Cambridge, Massachusetts, then to New York, a round trip with the colonel he is taking care of for the Thanksgiving long week end. This journey, and particularly the lap to New York and the subsequent events, are an initiation. The young chap is to learn what principles are in life and that you have to stand by them, especially if you are poor and fragile in body and social status then be strong in soul and mind and spirit. Your ethics are your only asset and power in life. He also has to learn how to understand his colonel companion and feel when he has decided to send him buy cigars while he is putting an end to his life and the gun loaded with his bullets are an impressive key to the solitary tower of growing up with death in front of you. He saves that man with a crazy idea of a ride, for a blind man, to drive a Ferrari in the Bronx or somewhere under the Brooklyn Bridge, and with all the frills of such a ride including the cop who catches him speeding but does not realize he is talking to a blind man. But this film is also a film about the elite education these Ivy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow. There I will not hint too much at that side of the story. Let's say an act of vandalism which is a student prank and nothing more, leads the headmaster into menacing the two student witnesses (our poor one and a rich kid) with the worst punishment going as far as trying to buy the cooperation of the poor student. The final disciplinary hearing is absurd in its logic. The three culprits go through because there is no clear cut witness, the rich one, with his father, pretends he did not have his contacts on but gives the three names with a maybe, and the poor one, Charlie by the way, refuses point blank to be a fink, a stool pigeon. And there the intervention of his would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee colonel saves the day. That you will have to find out by yourself. In many ways it is a lot stronger than the Dead Poets Society and the drama is avoided. It is better because it is the vision of a poor scholarship student and not the vision of one rich kid, in recent society and not in the 1920s or so. The point of view makes it a lot more powerful about society and courage, even if less dramatic as for the relations between the rich kid and his father. The loser all along is the headmaster who did not know how to recognize a prank and over-estimated it into an act of vandalism.

He's ordered to take leave, but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town San Paulo, where a murder has occurred similar in vein (bullet to groin and between eyes) to his case. There he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge.To be honest, I wasn't all that crash hot on Eastwood's take, but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'Magnum Force'. This well-assembled plot actually gives Eastwood another angle to work upon (even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time), quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging.

It's a striking sight that builds fear! Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor. It seemed to come off.

But then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the all-star cast, which is composed nothing more of faded Hollywood stars, TV actors and none-too-popular B actors.

On board is reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that his boyfriend, renowned weapons manufacturer Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), is selling their weapons to terrorist.

The film is like an inspirational teacher, the one in high school that changed the way you thought about life and knowledge. It reflects this in Mr. Keating, the teacher who touched the lives of a group of teenage boys for the better despite the monstrous obstacle of conformity in all their paths.Directed by Peter Weir (Gallipoli) and written beautifully by Tom Schulman, Dead Poets Society stars Robin Williams in one his first great dramatic performances as Keating, an English teacher at an all-boys boarding school who inspires his students with poetry and by encourages their own free thinking with the simple motto of carpe diem (seize the day).But the film is really about the boys and their various struggles. Todd (Ethan Hawke) is quiet and keeps to himself -- he's scared of personal expression. Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) is living in the iron grip of his father (Kurtwood Smith) who insists he become a doctor when his passion is really acting. Knox (Josh Charles) discovers infatuation\/love and the courage it requires and Charlie deals the barriers of free speech. Keating's lessons inspire their actions and bring out new parts of themselves and together they hold Dead Poets Society meetings in a cave in the woods.The clique of rebellious teenage boys and their unusual teacher are not motifs foreign to film, and neither are themes of fighting conformity and making the most of life. Most adults know all about these ideas -- they're not exactly profound and original -- but Tom Schulman tells Dead Poets Society in such a way that allows you to rediscover them and reawaken memories of what that personal experience was like. We see the rigid culture and system of the school and the classroom and then suddenly Keating comes in and makes learning what it should be. Suddenly we remember who our Keatings were and what it was like when we finally learned the value of our own perspectives, ideas and most importantly, desires.The cast of young men is excellent. They make sure no character entirely falls into a teenage stereotype despite their many personalities that make up the group dynamic.

It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990. I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing Rainbow Connection, a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated Rainbow Connection at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, Movin' Right Along, and I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. Never Before, Never Again, the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter. Also, it's not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing Muppets from Space (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it! However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. The Muppet Movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable. I highly doubt there's much left to say about The Muppet Movie that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.
