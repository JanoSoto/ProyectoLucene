The exposition is nearly perfect, introducing all the characters very well and setting up the story adequately. It moves a little too fast after that, though, bypassing a lot of the story in favour of quick kills. Still, the visuals are solid and the direction is quite innovative - I liked the high contrast showing how bright it was on the planet.

The movie tells a story but without much sense for the right emotions, except with its soapy dramatic elements in the beginning and the middle of the movie. The sinking itself is nothing too powerful or even spectacular looking, though the final sequence in which a large group of people, including some of the main characters are all going down signing, while the boat is starting to sink rapidly and all knowing that it's the end, is a pretty effective last sequence for the movie.The movie is filled with lots of melodramatic plot-lines and moments and follows (too) many different character. Luckily the movie is too short to ever allow any of this to become distracting.The movie follows all of the usual most famous passengers such as John Jacob Astor, Isador Straus and of course the captain Edward John Smith and First Officer Murdock. The movie throws in a lot more fictional characters that all aboard the Titanic with each their own reasons and problems, both in the upper- and lower classes. It's the reason why the movie tends to become over dramatic at times, which also causes the movie to not hold you interested entirely for its running time.Nevertheless the movie features some still some good moments and well developed characters.The overall sinking might be perhaps a bit of a deception. I mean, when the Titanic hits the iceberg, almost immediately the order is given to board the lifeboats. No time for panic or real disbelief. Everything happens so calm and rapidly at the same time. But again you have to watch the movie in perspective. In the '50's this was a normal sort of approach.Added to that, the movie is not that good looking with its effects. They used miniatures for most of the time. The sets and atmosphere on the other hand is good. The movie does a good job at re-creating the atmosphere of the '10's and the atmosphere at the time on board of the ship. Also the interior sets are good looking.The movie has a decent cast with Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck and an almost unrecognizable young Robert Wagner in an early role. It's the sort of movie in which none of the actors excels, which is sort of fine and suiting for a movie with some many different characters and actors performing them in it.All in all a fine and perfectly watchable genre movie, as long as you can appreciate the '50's style of film-making.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 March 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" You always have to watch movies in the perspective of its time and for '50's standards this is a pretty good genre movie.The movie is not very heavy or effective with its emotions.

In these movies, and other similar movies, the hit-man (or hit-woman) was nicely dressed, clean cut, well spoken, and had seemingly unlimited resources. In contrast, Leon lived in an old apartment, he dressed shabbily, and had a heavy accent that he could not hide. Your affinity for Leon wasn't because he had and was everything you wanted, but because he was a regular guy just like you and me. You got a good feeling of the type of person Leon was even with the few words he spoke.You got an even better insight of Leon when he developed a relationship with Mathilda, who was played by a young yet bold and somewhat enticing Natalie Portman. The movie centered a lot around their relationship. Leon took in Mathilda after her family was killed by some crooked cops. She actually wanted Leon to teach her how to kill so that she could exact revenge. Mathilda was a multi-layered character as well, even though she was a child. As the bond between Leon and Mathilda developed and grew, and the movie funneled towards its apparent end, all that happened before with Leon and Mathilda steered Leon towards his ultimate act of self sacrifice.Leon's end game move did not diminish the movie one bit, on the contrary, it immortalized the movie. Everyone loves a hero, and more often than not the hero lives in the end after having saved the day, leaving everyone jubilant and happy. Very seldom is the hero killed, or more precisely, takes his own life just for the one he loves. Leon and Mathilda may not have been romantically involved, but they definitely forged a strong bond.

I had also heard his movies were excessively violent, had a gratuitous amount of language, and a lot sexual content and dialog. Upon seeing this movie, I have determined that the first two are totally correct. It has some very gruesome images (the infamous 'Ear Scene' takes the cake, the frosting, and the plater as far as the violence goes) and there is about as much language in this as about any two other non-Tarantino, non-Scorsese movies put together.The plot is pretty simple criminals create a plan, criminals execute that plan, plan falls apart rapidly. Nothing new, right? Well, then the movie takes another path used before as well. One of the criminals is an informer. From here, the movie gets wild and unpredictable.The movie is told out of order, but it never feels jumbled and mixed up. It always makes sense and it always keeps your attention. The story is told masterfully with few, if any, needless scenes. All of them tie together brilliantly.The writing is also pretty good. The dialog is simple, but not childish. You hear all you need to hear without a lot of idle chit-chat. Only one scene really seems pointless, but when you think about it, it makes perfect sense.However, there is one thing above all that makes this movie what it is the acting.The acting is stupendous. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and even Quentin Tarantino star and all do an excellent job. Eddie Bunker and Eric Baltz star in it as well, but their performances do not stick out as well. In fact, the only reason Eric Baltz is memorable is actually because of Michael Madsen (SPOILERS) cuts off his ear with a razor (END SPOILERS). However, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and Tim Roth easily do the best jobs. In just the first ten minutes, Tim Roth alone will have done an incredible acting job.The only flaws with the movie a sudden ending that ends faster than you would expect, an extreme amount of language, and possibly the most blood per person killed (SPOILERS), particularly Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange. They bleed a ton, as does Marvin Nash. (END SPOILERS) Overall, this is a wonderful film that deserves a spot on just about everyone's top ten list.

Our main character is on an airport track and is going forward on a conveyor belt set to a great tune. Fantastic use of the camera and a great song to go along with it, but then once you get to the movie, beyond the stylized and interesting opening, the film starts to slow down and goes on for 2 1\/2 it didn't need to.The thing that defines the film from Tarantino's other work is that is not his own creation (or his own ripoff of someone else's creation) but a legitimate adaption of a novel. Tarantino's style was never that conventional and when you see him working within conventional cofines, which is sort of what this is, despite being a vibrant-feeling piece, his whole style just doesn't work and he can't acomodate proper pacing. Tarantino's style is suited to fast-pased thrillers or just things told of out of sequence. When he tells a character-driven crime story in a rather linear matter, his very superfluous direction and writing ends up chugging the whole thing down, when it should be either speeding the thing up or directing more so its focus. The opening is more in line with his type of films, but once it gets into relationships and more complex elements of story and character, the thing just kind of drags.It's got so much good in it, with great acting and great dialouge, but Tarantino just doesn't pace it right cause he can't handle a story of this type and the movie ends up feeling a bit boring, by the time you're finished. Still, though, it's got so much good in it, that it's not necessarily a bad way to spend an afternoon but maybe there'll be a point, where you wish it were it over, when there's probably still a good amount to go.

I recently rewatched the first Highlander, and saw the two sequels for the first time and came to the conclusion that yes, there should really only have been one.The core concept behind Highlander is a good one immortal warriors fighting over centuries until only one is left, who will win the Prize, the nature of which varies over the various entries of the franchise, but is usually described as the power of all immortals who ever lived. The only way an Immortal can be killed is by removal of the head, usually via sword.This made for a good film an epic story spanning hundreds of years, cool swordfights and a good performance from Christopher Lambert made the original Highlander one of the better 1980s films out there. At the end of the film, he had supposedly won the Prize, and that was that.However, because it was so successful, it spawned sequels the hilariously bad Highlander II, and the one being reviewed, Highlander III The Sorcerer.The film starts with Connor MacLoed (Christopher Lambert) going to Japan a couple of hundred years ago to learn from the sorcerer Nakano who has the handy ability to make illusions appear from thin air. Nakano is also being hunted by Kane(Mario van Peebles), a villain who is virtually a carbon copy of the Kurgan (is a barbarian, likes to kill women and children, etc) who wants the power of illusion to do bad things. Kane catches up with Nakano, Connor escapes and Kane is buried in Nakano's cave.Skip forward a few hundred years Connor is living with his adopted son in some Middle Eastern country, until Kane is released from a cave by an archaeologist obsessed with ancient Japan (a variant on the love interest from the first film). Connor becomes aware that Kane is back, and then goes back to New York to kill Kane. Apparently he didn't win the Prize after all, and is in actual fact an Immortal who thinks he is mortal (which he was meant to become at the end of the first film). What follows is pretty much a retelling of the first film. There are two scenes that are really blatant copies of ones from the first film Kane taunts Connor on holy ground where Immortals cannot fight. The first time he does this they fight and they actually explain what happens when you do fight on holy ground, and the second time is virtually the same as the scene with the Kurgan in the church in the first film.The second time you get a sense of deja vu is when Kane kidnaps Connor's son, and then proceeds to drive around terrifying him by playing chicken with various vehicles. The exact same scene was in the first film, when the Kurgan kidnaps Connor's love interest and speeds through New York. However, any sense of danger in the scene in the third film is removed by the fact that all of the things Kane pretends to collide with are illusions, which cannot actually harm the occupants of the car.Connor and Kane fight, Connor kills Kane, and then wins the Prize again, at least until the next sequel Highlander Endgame, which at least was trying to do something new. And even the effects of Connor's quickening (the process by which Immortals take the power of those they have killed) were just lifted from the first film and cleaned up a bit. It's just plain lazy film-making.Mario van Peebles makes for a rather camp and unthreatening villain as Kane, who you never believe Connor will have any difficulty in defeating. He does try in some places make his performance different from that of the Kurgan, but the script demands he attempts to mimic the first film's villain.Christopher Lambert just seems rather bored throughout the film, which isn't surprising as he contemplated walking off of Highlander II (which he made through gritted teeth). He probably only agreed to appear in this due to getting a rise and the prospect of some easy money. The other actors are rather forgettable.I sometimes persevere with a bad film if it makes me laugh. Highlander III did manage this, but only in a few bits. Most of the time it just bored me, and the only reason I didn't put it off was so I wouldn't ever want to waste more time watching it at a later date. It isn't really worth bothering with as such - the first film or Highlander Endgame are better choices. Of course, if you have the boxset, then you already have it, so I'd advise you watch one of the other three films. They are all better than this tired cash-in.

Kane catches up with Nakano, Connor escapes and Kane is buried in Nakano's cave.Skip forward a few hundred years Connor is living with his adopted son in some Middle Eastern country, until Kane is released from a cave by an archaeologist obsessed with ancient Japan (a variant on the love interest from the first film). Connor becomes aware that Kane is back, and then goes back to New York to kill Kane. Apparently he didn't win the Prize after all, and is in actual fact an Immortal who thinks he is mortal (which he was meant to become at the end of the first film). What follows is pretty much a retelling of the first film. There are two scenes that are really blatant copies of ones from the first film Kane taunts Connor on holy ground where Immortals cannot fight. The first time he does this they fight and they actually explain what happens when you do fight on holy ground, and the second time is virtually the same as the scene with the Kurgan in the church in the first film.The second time you get a sense of deja vu is when Kane kidnaps Connor's son, and then proceeds to drive around terrifying him by playing chicken with various vehicles. The exact same scene was in the first film, when the Kurgan kidnaps Connor's love interest and speeds through New York. However, any sense of danger in the scene in the third film is removed by the fact that all of the things Kane pretends to collide with are illusions, which cannot actually harm the occupants of the car.Connor and Kane fight, Connor kills Kane, and then wins the Prize again, at least until the next sequel Highlander Endgame, which at least was trying to do something new. And even the effects of Connor's quickening (the process by which Immortals take the power of those they have killed) were just lifted from the first film and cleaned up a bit. It's just plain lazy film-making.Mario van Peebles makes for a rather camp and unthreatening villain as Kane, who you never believe Connor will have any difficulty in defeating. He does try in some places make his performance different from that of the Kurgan, but the script demands he attempts to mimic the first film's villain.Christopher Lambert just seems rather bored throughout the film, which isn't surprising as he contemplated walking off of Highlander II (which he made through gritted teeth). He probably only agreed to appear in this due to getting a rise and the prospect of some easy money. The other actors are rather forgettable.I sometimes persevere with a bad film if it makes me laugh. Highlander III did manage this, but only in a few bits. Most of the time it just bored me, and the only reason I didn't put it off was so I wouldn't ever want to waste more time watching it at a later date. It isn't really worth bothering with as such - the first film or Highlander Endgame are better choices. Of course, if you have the boxset, then you already have it, so I'd advise you watch one of the other three films. They are all better than this tired cash-in.

Combining equal parts dirty-cop\/mob drama with the emotional tale of a man taking in an orphaned youngster, Leon is both thrilling and heart-wrenching to watch.Leon (played by the ever stoic Jean Reno) is the hit-man of choice for the Italian mob of New York city. When a dirty DEA agent named Stansfield (Gary Oldman) kills the family of his young neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), he takes her under his wing teaching her the ways of the assassin as she teaches him of the love for life that he has been missing. But Mathilda's desire for vengeance puts herself, Leon and Stansfield on a collision course for a violent confrontation.Luc Besson certainly brings to vibrant life New York City with beautiful cinematography while crafting a tasteful crescendo of a script. Watching such an excellently composed script play out on the screen with such tasteful imagery is a real treat. As well, the score by longtime Besson collaborator Eric Serra is hypnotic and beautiful in its own right. I have often found myself coming back to the score on its own as it is at times both emotive and pulse driving.Combined with the production aspects are a collection of precision performances. Portman's screen debut certainly demonstrates why her career took off, as she grabs the viewer's eye and heart from her first appearance and holds her own with her fellow actors.

Add to this an electrifying and intoxicating performance by the master of scene chewing, Gary Oldman, and a subtle and captivating turn by Danny Aiello as an Italian mobster, and this film is certainly worth the price of admission for the performances alone.Leon is a picture perfect example of a film that expanded far beyond the confines of its genre.

After spending a fortune, he finally makes a movie with Scientology. This is what it's like to burn money.Battlefield Earth sucks in many ways. First, the movie has literally no plot at all. Next, Travolta and Whitaker(What was he thinking?)look like Klingon rejects. You can even notice during some scenes that these two are having trouble walking. They are supposed to be tall, so they are on stilts. It's so bad.The Earth people are like cavemen. They suddenly become brilliant. No explanation as to how. They find Harrier jets hidden after a 1000 years with gasoline intact! Inane. How can one bomb destroy an entire planet?These Psychlos have to be the dumbest alien race ever. Let's give these slaves the info they need to wipe us out. Well, that's not how it was said, but was perceived.If I die, this will be sent to the home office.
