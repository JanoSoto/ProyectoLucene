It was a dumb TV show, and the movie was meant to be camp as a way of making fun of that, and as a way of paying tribute to it. I get it.This being said, it was still an incredibly bad movie.All men were portrayed as spineless imbeciles who had no thoughts other than sex. All women were portrayed as manipulators who had no way other than showing their cleavage to get what they want. Yes, I know this was meant to be farce, but it was still an even more unrealistic portrayal of the world than in a James Bond movie (or even Austin Powers). The plot seems nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse to glance on every sexual fantasy known to man. We sees the angels dressed as domintrices, geishas, German milkmaids, even as men. We see them drive race cars, doing stunts which were so obviously CGI enhanced they were ludicrous, and scaling walls in cat suits. What we don't see is any indication that they know why they're there.We can't blame them, though, the script seems to have been written, on-the-fly as it were, as if the writers said Hey, we've got these geisha costumes, let's have a seen where the girls pretend to be geishas! What vestiges of plot exist are stolen, lock stock and barrel from Mission Impossible, and James Bond movies.Let me just say this one more time, I KNOW! You don't go to this movie to see an original plot, you go there to ogle Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore. Well, great, couldn't they have been given a decent script to work with? It seems both sloppy and cynical to give three of the best actresses in Hollywood such garbage to work with, under the assumption that most people will just be there to stare at their breasts.And while the actresses might have been great, the director was horrible. He had no discipline whatsoever. At the end they show out-takes, and a lot of the scenes looked completely different from the finished version. Its like he just let the actors get up there and do whatever they felt like doing. I've looked him up in the database and he's never done any other film, and I hope he won't.My final criticism should speak more eloquently than any other about this movie Tom Green has a speaking part in it. I like Drew Barrymore, I think she's a talented actress, but any woman who can actually get Tom Green a part in ANY movie has far too much power in Hollywood.

The man is a genius (especially when he and Pitt unite!) When I saw this film for the first time, I was completely blown away! I wanted to immediately rush back into the cinema and watch it all over again! But I thought, No, I'll wait for the video\/DVD. So I bought it and have since watched it at least 20 times, and guess what? It gets better every single time! You see things that you completely missed before. Lines take on different meaning's. It's full of in-gags and self mocking.Based on the not so well known novel at the time, Fincher created a 'hit' that really 'hit' home. (pardon the 'hitting' puns!) I have since read the novel four times, and it too gets better with each reading, but the film is a wonderful transfer from book to film and wins out due to a few alterations that make more sense compared to the book.The concept seems relatively easy to grasp when a virgin viewer is prone to watching the film, but I guartantee they will come out thinking What the hell?! which is what this film does, it makes you think, or at least it SHOULD.The title is kinda misleading. It does tell us what the film is about, and what we can expect, but it doesn't REALLY tell us what the film is about.Many critics have slammed the film for it's gratuitous use of violence, what ARE they on about?! Grow up is it??!! In my opinion, the title 'Fight Club' doesn't really lead you to believe that you're going to watch a U certificated Disney film are you?! It's an 18, and deservedly so, but their point I believe is that the film would spawn a thousand Tyler Dyrden's ready to start their own fight club's.I like the use of self mocking in the film.

Earlier we have seen Dyrden's impeccable torso and abs. Not to sound gay but, what a body! This tongue in cheek, self mocking, is one of many examples in the filmI really like the overall message of the film  'You are not your job. You are not you're bank account.' the message being, let's stop being so bloody materialistic. Dyrden  You know what a duvet is?Narrator  ComfortDyrden  No man, it's just a duvet!Quite rightly said.

It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English -). We must go on!There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it's coming to me. It's coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she's leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can't believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn't see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let's go to what there is to see.I saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don't know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I'm never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don't have to say much about this, but so that you know it Howard Shore's score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it's magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time... No, Bilbo, stay away. IT's MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS! It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won't leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don't want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees what is to come). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can't say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn't played for long, but I began to realise. what's next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn't believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there's evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there's no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it.Koola from NorwayA small PS The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it's just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven't said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter.I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good.

Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire.

This film achieved that very easily. Other film's that achieved this was Basic Instinct, and Se7en.From the moment the film is over, you NEED to see it again. Was it a dream? Was it a nightmare? Did what you just see happen, or was it your own imagination? That's how good this film is. It introduced us to Dr Hannibal Lecter, arguably the greatest screen villain ever. Who could forget those claustraphobic scenes between him and Clarice Starling? That frightening noise of his Liver slurping antics? And that eerie Good evening Clarice.It won all five 'major' Oscars, and deservedly so, even though it was realeased as early as February! A gripping storyline, and performance's make this a must see film. Just as me and my teenage friends talked about this film many years ago, many of our discussions continue to this day. That's a sign of a good film. Psycho is another! The way the focus is thrown from Starling, played magnificently by Jodie Foster, to Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins (need I say more?!), and Buffalo Bill, a splendid Ted Levine. We are forced to observe their actions, be they honourable, horrible, or homicidal, these are the key factors that make this intense viewing.Of course another stroke of genius is to have a woman as the hero, heroine. Starling, is a student at the FBI, so we feel for her as she tries to unravel the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and her encounters with Lecter. Never has there been such a strong overwhelming performance from a woman since Ellen Ripley graced our screens. Starling also has a past, all hero's usually do, and this serves as an underlying psychological issue in the film. It's also what interests Lecter. He is very fond of her.Director Demme, never lets us and Starling forget that the world she occupies is mostly a 'man's world', and this makes us identify with her whether we're male or female. We WANT her to succeed. (PLOT SPOILER!) In a perverse way, we want Lecter to escape and succeed too, but the way in which he does so is shocking, very shocking. That scene where he discards the officer's face is gruesome, but neccessary to further Lecter's character.A taughtly directed thriller\/horror, this film delivers on all levels. From acting, to set and costume design. Hands up who thinks the dungeon setting for the Starling\/Lecter conversations is very atmospheric and oppressing? And credit goes to whoever created that Lecter face mask - ingenious.If you've been living in a cave for the last 10 years and haven't had a chance to check out this great classic.

Never has there been such a strong overwhelming performance from a woman since Ellen Ripley graced our screens.

After nearly 20 years at the top of my list of Films best watched in reverse a little Canadian sleeper called Lost and Delirious has knocked you from that top spot.  I was amazed that I had never heard of this movie until long after it's short stint in theaters. Not that I expect to have heard of all movies at the time they were released but I would have had to be in a coma to not have heard about this movie. Why should I have heard of this movie?  Because for as much as I would like to hope that someday movies in which Hollywood's best and brightest young stars, Perabo, Barton and Parre in this case, find themselves involved in a lesbian relationship will be such commonplace and not reason enough to see it and certainly not reason enough to order the DVD from Canada more than a month in advance of the US release that is not the reality today.  Now having seen this movie it seems even less likely to happen within my lifetime. By now some people reading this are probably thinking, this is supposed to be a movie review not a diatribe on the lack of lesbians in film (probably in language not suitable for this site).  Unfortunately, this film showed me just how far society hasn't come.  A fact made further evident by the majority of the other reviews posted on this site. This is a lesbian movie.  It's a love story but it's a movie about two young women in love with each other.  This is what drives the entire plot of the movie.  Take away the lesbians and there's not much of a love story left, not much of anything left.  The heart wrenching and ultimately tragic consequences that ensue do so as a direct result of the inability of all of the film's characters to deal with the fact that they are involved in a lesbian relationship. While Perabo and Parre are the lovers all three of the characters including Barton are very much involved in the relationship. In fact Mouse\/Mary B. (Barton) is the only character in the entire movie who really attempts to address the issue that perhaps the girls are lesbians only to be told by both of the girls that they aren't lesbians.  They just love each other and they have sex, often with Barton in the room but they aren't lesbians. These girls aren't just lost and delirious they are delusional.  They believe that Barton is asleep and oblivious to them making love night after night in a small boarding school room.  The first two times I watched the movie I thought how ridiculous it was to have these girls who are so afraid of people calling them lesbians making love with a girl they hardly knew just a few feet away. As I watched the third time I realized that they probably did believe for the brief moments they may have thought about it.  It's not stated just how long the two had been involved, the implication is that it had been going on for some length of time and that the school's Head Mistress and many others were aware of it as well.  It had gone on so long that they had become passionately in love with one another and in the process created for themselves a little bubble in which their love could thrive without ever having to face the reality of what it meant to be a woman in love with another woman.  When the bubble bursts neither of the girls have developed the skills to deal with the reactions of others. Lost and Delirious is for the most part a good movie.  The script was by far it's weakest link with the dialogue sounding somewhat unnatural and as a viewer you become completely aware that they are actresses and you're watching a movie.  It works itself out though and I fell quickly back into the storybook after these bumps.  The actressâ?Ts performances were generally at least up to par with what I would expect from young talent, which all three women most definitely possess.  I found Parre to be a little weak and unbelievable at times in her delivery but that was also the nature of her character and often during scenes in which she was delivering some of the more poorly scripted lines.  Perabo showed her true talent by delivering one of the most passionate performances I've seen in a long time. Sometimes it hurt to watch because I could feel her pain as if it were my own. Mischa Barton is definitely one to watch.  She has a true star quality, the indescribable thing possessed by so few and coveted by so many. Overall Lost and Delirious is a good movie which ten years ago I would have been just thrilled to have seen made.  But ten years ago I thought that by now there would be not just more lesbian movies but at least a few more with happy endings if not in the theatrical release at least on the DVD.  The ending hurt me more because I thought of all the young girls who had written such great things about this movie and put up fan sites for it not because it's the greatest movie they've ever seen but because it showed mainstream actresses portraying lesbian characters that they could identify with.  My generation had Personal Best with a beautiful young Margot Hemmingway as the non-lesbian woman in love with and having sex with another woman.  Of course since none of the characters in either of these movies are lesbians  - unless you watch the movie backwards.  Lives can't be lived backwards and people shouldn't feel that they have to try to live them that way in order to have a happy ending.  Until art imitates life, and at there's at least one movie (aside from small indie films) where the girl gets the girl and they live happily ever after I'll keep watching this one backwards.

Instead it has a screwball feel to it - although it can't hold a candle to the films of the 50's that it clearly aspires to be.It's a shame because for a light movie it has a very heavy cast of well-known faces. Keaton is as good as he always is, but him and Davis lack a great chemistry and their romance isn't convincing, neither is the conflict between them. The support cast is full of well known actors - Bonnie Bedelia, Ernie Hudson, Charles Martin Smith, Mitch Ryan and Christopher Reeve. Even Steven Wright and Harry Shearer pop up for a cameo as sitcom stars Chuck and Eddie. It's a shame that such a face-heavy cast don't have better material to work with.This is a very light romantic comedy. The romance doesn't work due to the lack of spark between the two likeable stars, and the comedy isn't that funny because it isn't sharp. The director and script-writers miss a fantastic opportunity with such a great cast and a good set-up (Ron Underwood! - were City Slickers and Tremors early flukes?). The film brings out some political claws towards the end but even then they're blunted by the need for a romantic conclusion.Nice romance with some funny moments - but could have been much funnier.

No truer words have spoken on this hard lesson of love, lust and relationship. Thanks to `Spy Game', we now learn there is another arena where &#145;players' play &#150; espionage. And it involves three individuals Robert Redford &#150; the player, Brad Pitt &#150; the played, and Catherine McCormack &#150; the bait.The film opens with the capture of an espionage agent Tom Bishop (Pitt). News of his capture reaches a retiring CIA operative Nathan Muir (Redford), his one-time teacher. In a cross-examination by the CIA brasses, Muir narrates the career profile of his one-time protégé via a series of flashback sequences. Espionage looks exciting, if Bishop's life is any indication &#150; tremendous explosions, people getting killed, many heated arguments with superiors, and sleeping with a total stranger. A good director also helps, and Tony Scott is to be commended for his visually stunning treatment of the sequences. Each is a riveting yet grim presentation of a day in the life of a spy. You'd think you're watching a full-length episode in each sequence. Within 24 hours, Muir plays the biggest game of his life to rescue Bishop, after finding out that his mission was to rescue, of all things, a female prisoner Elizabeth Hadley (McCormack) who is imprisoned in China and whom Bishop frequently sleeps with. Errr&#133; no, they are not in love, not really. There are no exchanges of `I love you' between the two.`Spy Game' shows that Muir can still play the game very well even in his retirement. If the movie attempts to convey that true love conquers all even in the world of espionage, it is overshadowed by Muir's playing ways. Scott needed a conclusion that does not ooze a romantic happily-ever-after schmuck to screenwriter Michael Frost Beckner's masterpiece. So he had the leading spotlight on Muir, and in the process relegating Bishop to a flashback character by downplaying Bishop's daring prison rescue. Little of Bishop is shown after his capture, except in the flashbacks. And Scott makes it clear that Bishop's own rescue is Muir's design. Clearly, Muir is the biggest player of all. He played Bishop and the CIA bosses, though one would wonder if he played himself by spending his retirement savings to spring Bishop and his partner from prison. More importantly, why would he even care for someone whom he no longer is on speaking and professional terms with for more than 5 years? Bishop, as smart as he thinks he is, never realizes that he is being played by Muir and, to a lesser degree, Hadley &#150; no better bait than sexual temptation. Speaking of Hadley, her character background is unknown. Aside from a brief explanation why she had to flee London and her global charity service, that is little factoid about her. Her presence in the film is clear to feed Bishop's sexual fix. It seems that the only reason why he goes out to rescue her from a communist prison is so that he can bed her once more. But wait a minute! Why is a woman imprisoned in an all-men's prison? (Look, I know this is China, and last time I checked, the Chinese do not practice co-ed housing!) But seriously, McCormack's talent is wasted here. She is quite alluring as Bishop's squeeze sporting a British accent, but nothing in her performance stands out or is remotely memorable. Pitt, on the other hand, is a fantastic character actor. He is in fine form here, and works very well with Redford in heightening the tensions between their characters, and is very convincing in his own scenes too. Redford, unfortunately, is an old bag by himself. He is clearly past his prime and would have been stiff if it was not for his cast members that shared scenes with him. His best moments are with Pitt, though there are not many of them. He is also good next to , who plays his secretary.

He should have been presented for the first 30-40 minutes with some mystery, some build-up, some method to his madness as he presides over Whoville and comes to despise the sounds of Christmas' approach until he can't take it any more. What we get instead is instant gratification, throwing the Grinch at us in all his glory in the first 5 minutes of the story, then it allgoes downhill faster than his rocket sled from there. Until the last half hour anyway. The finale, as the Grinch decides to steal Christmas sticks mainly to the cartoon despite a modification or two, and is actually quite entertaining. What came before though was quite simply a mess.Having the Grinch's sad childhood depicted was just the worst possible direction the story could have gone in. Why do we care what the Grinch's backstory is. It could have been hinted at in the dialogue instead of shown. Howard has repeatedly shown in his films that he has no idea how to develop a character through thoughtful direction. Instead, like a previous member said, he just pulls out the giant mallett and hammers the character into our heads. Also, why couldn't the Who's have been depicted more like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz, just there to forward the plot along and not saying anymore than they should. Who cares about the overbearing schmuck of a Mayor or Cindy Lou Who's parents, or the fact the whoville beauty queen is in love with the Grinch. It's obvious Howard went after a kind of Munchkinland feel to Whoville, but again he hasn't got a clue what made that movie great either. There's just too much useless dialogue and subplots. Superfluous, as Cindy Lou says.If someone like Rob Reiner or Robert Zemeckis had directed this it would have been given the comedic treatment it deserved. Howard needs to take a trip back to Mayberry to relearn what funny and sophisticated comedy is.In addition to the overdone antics, the Grinch is shot looking straight at his face too often. The best angles are his profile or at an angle. The make-up does not resemble the Grinch at all looking directly at him. There are moments when the production DOES look spot on but they are few and far between.Carrey is a pretty good choice for the Grinch, if someone would ever tell him to keep his yap shut, but the first hour should have been erased and redone. Ron Howard must be the culprit for the tatty way this production was handled.The attractive production design, Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou ( what a little sweetheart!) and a few of Carrey's better moments aren't enough to save this one from sliding over the cliff.

Armageddon was good because the writers and producers knew what it was a slam-bang action thriller with definite comedy and science fiction elements. Deep Impact is good because it takes a look at the possibility from the other end of the spectrum how would we truly act as citizens of the Earth if we thought it might be destroyed? It's always been interesting to me that I enjoyed both films fairly equally. Whenever I'm asked to compare them I have to tell people that they are two completely separate movies, rather than two movies about the same thing. And that's what I'll tell you. If you're looking for that roller-coaster ride of a movie, see Armageddon. If you want a true drama that shows how we as humans might react in a very serious situation, I highly recommend Deep Impact. I must add this note I agree completely with the previous reviewer who said that Morgan Freeman's performance as the President in this movie is perhaps the finest performance of anyone in that role, and more screen time for him would have made the film even better.

I bought the video two days after renting it, then watched it every day for about two weeks. Now it's December, and almost a year since I fist saw it (I saw it on Jan 13th 2001)and I'm not really bothered about it now. Yeah, it's ace. But after watching it 42 times, yes, that's right, 42 times, I've kinda got bored.
