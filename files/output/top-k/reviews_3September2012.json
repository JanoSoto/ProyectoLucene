His trademark Gothic style is heavily presented in the design of Gotham City and its various occupants, most of which are either tormented and dark heroes or complete monsters trying to pass as normal citizens. Unfortunately Burton's flair for over the top character is also present, which at times makes it hard to take this film seriously. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is probably the biggest offender in this regard. Some of his scenes are downright terrifying, with him wobbling around and acting more like a wild beast than a man. But then he wobbles some more, this time clad in nothing but his dirty pyjamas, and the illusion of terror shatters almost instantly. The same applies to his dialogue. It's an odd mix of silliness and threat that either works brilliantly or utterly fails, there's very little middle ground with this character.This same ambivalence is present in almost all of the characters, with the exception of Batman (Michael Keaton), although he has his own flaws as well, the biggest being that he's not really the focus of the film. This film is more about the Penguin and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman is just there to move the plot along, which makes him rather uninteresting, which is a cardinal offence in my books, as this is a Batman film after all.All that being said, the plot of this film isn't that bad. Batman The Animated Series once did an episode about the Penguin trying to join the normal, civilized society, trying to combat his inner weirdness and the prejudice of the common folk, who fear his odd appearance and animalistic themes. That episode really worked in my opinion and why not, as it is a very good idea for this particular character. The Penguin, like so many other Batman villains, is all about duality - in his case about the battle between his noble heritage and his savage upbringing, which makes for a great tragedy. And while the movie doesn't explore these themes as well as it perhaps could have, it touches upon many of them and at least makes the effort to try.Still, I just can't get past all those silly scenes where the previous Gothic mood completely shatters and the whole process starts all over again with the next scene. If you're a fan of Burton or Batman, you should give this one a try as it is a rather touching film and good one in its own way, but if you can't deal with sudden mood changes and a certain level of random silliness, this movie really isn't for you.

She is obliged to remain in bed with the telephone as her only link to the outside world. One evening, she gets a crossed phone connection and accidentally overhears a conversation between two men who seem to be plotting a murder. This film is sometimes described as having been shot in real time, but it is very different from, say, Hitchcock's Rope, also made in 1948. Rope has a simple structure, observing the classical unities of time, place and action; the action not only takes place in real time but also takes place in a single location and tells a single story, with no subplots and no flashbacks. In Sorry, Wrong Number the main plot line, taking place in Leona's bedroom, may take place in real time, but there are also numerous flashbacks. These all occur in the context of a telephone conversation between Leona and some other person, and they relate what has happened in the past or what is happening in some other place. One such flashback, for example, tells the story of how Leona met and married her husband Henry, whom she seduced away from her college friend Sally. For a film which lasts for less than an hour and a half, the plot is a fairly complex one; in its complexity and its use of flashbacks it reminded me of another American drama from the late forties, John Brahm's The Locket. Much of the drama surrounds Henry, an uneducated but ambitious young man from a working-class background. After his marriage to Leona, he was made a vice-president of the company controlled by her wealthy father. He soon realised, however, that this job was little more than a sinecure, and his marriage to the spoiled, demanding Leona quickly went sour, especially after her illness left her an invalid. Bored and restless, he concocted a dishonest scheme to siphon off money from the company, a scheme which led to his becoming dangerously involved with a ruthless organised crime gang. Some have complained that Burt Lancaster is miscast as Henry, although I suspect that is because they think of him either as the action hero of the fifties or as the socially liberal Hollywood heavyweight of the sixties and seventies. In the early part of his career in the late forties, however, he tended to specialise in crime dramas and film noir, the best-known example probably being his debut film The Killers. Henry is therefore typical of the sort of role that Lancaster was playing around this time, and his performance is a perfectly good one. One of the problems with the film is the lack of any characters with whom the audience can sympathise. Henry and his associates are obvious villains, and Leona is so spoiled, wilful and hysterical that she forfeits the sympathy we would normally feel for her because of her illness. (It is, in fact, revealed that there is nothing organically wrong with her heart; her symptoms are purely psychosomatic ones arising from her neuroses). Barbara Stanwyck's performance is, technically, a good one- it won her a Best Actress Oscar nomination- but I felt that the film could have been improved if Stanwyck had toned things down and tried to make her character more likable. Another weakness arises from the structure of the plot. Because the various flashbacks are related to Leona's various telephone conversations, there are occasions when the people she is speaking to tell her far more information than they would have been likely to do in real life, which occasionally makes the film seem rather unrealistic. Another plot hole comes when Sally's husband Fred, a lawyer with the DA's office, has a sensitive and confidential conversation with a colleague from his own home telephone in the full hearing of his wife. It struck me as highly unlikely that he would have done this, especially as the conversation concerned his wife's ex-boyfriend Henry, who is under investigation by the police. Nevertheless, director Anatole Litvak handles his material well, making use of typical film noir conventions such as low-level lighting, looming shadows and circling camera shots, as well as a spooky musical score (even if this occasionally becomes a bit too intrusive). The final scene, after Leona has come to realise that the murder she has overheard being discussed is her own, is unbearably tense. Overall, Sorry, Wrong Number is a very effective piece of suspense, reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's works. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Leona Stevenson, a wealthy heiress, travels from her home in Chicago to New York to obtain medical treatment for the heart condition which has left her a bedridden invalid.

And he is fully aware of his unholy destiny as the Antichrist, the false prophet. He has carefully been studying the signs for Jesus Christ's return to Earth and has decided the time is near. He sends his disciples all across Great Britain when an alignment of stars signifies his birth to kill any baby boy born on the morning of March 24, between the hours of midnight and six o'clock. Even one of Damien's closest assistants son is not exempt from this decree.But Damien's human side is getting the better of him as he starts seeing the popular journalist Kate Reynolds and they begin a relationship. He also forms an attachment to her son Peter, whom Damien takes under his wing and manipulates for his own evil.While this is going on the seven daggers of Megiddo have been rediscovered from the rubble of the old Thorn Museum which was burnt down in the last film. They are bought out of an auction and are sent to the Monastery that Damien's father visited when he was investigating the truth behind his son. Seven priests led by Father DeCarlo go to Britain and resolve to finish what Robert Thorn and his brother Richard started by killing Damien and reassuring the second coming of the Messiah. The plot for Omen 3 has a lot going for it but there's a lot of things that could've been done that weren't even touched upon. The relationship between Kate and Damien could've been an emotional struggle to the story, since it could allude that Damien might achieve redemption due to their relationship. Even one of his associates say that Reynolds is dangerous to be around but Damien is resolute in his path and not even 'love' can affect him. The priests are underdeveloped as well. Six are killed off rather quickly and DeCarlo isn't as strong a protagonist as Robert or Richard Thorn. The once brilliant supernatural death scenes that The Omen series is famous for are sort of replaced by intentional murders and accidents. Some are still impressive but they lose the sense of demonic intervention that the other two films had. Instead it is either Damien showing off his power, or one of his disciples that commits a murder. There's not a lot of speculation in them in that they all don't look like they could be common accidents. However, the film does have its fair share of disturbing scenes. There's a scene where a woman sees a vision of her baby burnt. She then takes an iron and approaches the baby and the rest is left to our imagination. Another scene involves Damien on a hunt with a group of Beagles. Two priests ambush him and while he kill one of them off himself, he tells the pack to kill the other and they proceed to tear him apart. The acting in the film is also quite good. Sam Neill as Damien provides a dark and rather frightening performance for the now adult Antichrist and he does an excellent job throughout the movie. The rest of the cast perform their roles well but there's nothing that really stands out in the ensemble. Jerry Goldsmith provides us with another excellent score that builds up suspense and makes it clear that evil is at work. For all three movies his score remains as one of the best in the Horror genre.Overall The Final Conflict has a lot of problems but the film isn't entirely bad.

And he is fully aware of his unholy destiny as the Antichrist, the false prophet. He has carefully been studying the signs for Jesus Christ's return to Earth and has decided the time is near. He sends his disciples all across Great Britain when an alignment of stars signifies his birth to kill any baby boy born on the morning of March 24, between the hours of midnight and six o'clock. Even one of Damien's closest assistants son is not exempt from this decree.But Damien's human side is getting the better of him as he starts seeing the popular journalist Kate Reynolds and they begin a relationship. He also forms an attachment to her son Peter, whom Damien takes under his wing and manipulates for his own evil.While this is going on the seven daggers of Megiddo have been rediscovered from the rubble of the old Thorn Museum which was burnt down in the last film. They are bought out of an auction and are sent to the Monastery that Damien's father visited when he was investigating the truth behind his son. Seven priests led by Father DeCarlo go to Britain and resolve to finish what Robert Thorn and his brother Richard started by killing Damien and reassuring the second coming of the Messiah. The plot for Omen 3 has a lot going for it but there's a lot of things that could've been done that weren't even touched upon. The relationship between Kate and Damien could've been an emotional struggle to the story, since it could allude that Damien might achieve redemption due to their relationship. Even one of his associates say that Reynolds is dangerous to be around but Damien is resolute in his path and not even 'love' can affect him. The priests are underdeveloped as well. Six are killed off rather quickly and DeCarlo isn't as strong a protagonist as Robert or Richard Thorn. The once brilliant supernatural death scenes that The Omen series is famous for are sort of replaced by intentional murders and accidents. Some are still impressive but they lose the sense of demonic intervention that the other two films had. Instead it is either Damien showing off his power, or one of his disciples that commits a murder. There's not a lot of speculation in them in that they all don't look like they could be common accidents. However, the film does have its fair share of disturbing scenes. There's a scene where a woman sees a vision of her baby burnt. She then takes an iron and approaches the baby and the rest is left to our imagination. Another scene involves Damien on a hunt with a group of Beagles. Two priests ambush him and while he kill one of them off himself, he tells the pack to kill the other and they proceed to tear him apart. The acting in the film is also quite good. Sam Neill as Damien provides a dark and rather frightening performance for the now adult Antichrist and he does an excellent job throughout the movie. The rest of the cast perform their roles well but there's nothing that really stands out in the ensemble. Jerry Goldsmith provides us with another excellent score that builds up suspense and makes it clear that evil is at work. For all three movies his score remains as one of the best in the Horror genre.Overall The Final Conflict has a lot of problems but the film isn't entirely bad. It's worth watching to bring a conclusion to The Omen series but will probably leave a few fans wanting a better ending.

Platoon stars Charlie Sheen and Willem DaFoe in the 80's. They are soldiers in the Vietnam War. They experience the full blown hell that war produced. Platoon was directed by Oliver Stone and most of his movies are very long and have extreme detail. Platoon is no exception having a deeper meaning than what is shown. Vietnam veterans suffered greatly during and after the war. Platoon shows the suffering during the war. I thought it was interesting how towards the end a soldier is talking the Sheen and he says if they survive the war they will go home heroes and life will be easy. In reality it was the exact opposite and I wonder if soldiers really thought that or if that was just for comic relief. Either way the story was basic, fight the war and survive, but it turned into something more. It turned into what is right and wrong in warfare and how or who to fight. Soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to drugs and Platoon shows how soldiers would relax by taking drugs and smoking cigarettes. The reactions to these drugs and the warfare itself drove soldiers insane and caused them to commit terrible acts that Platoon portrays. Platoon was historically accurate as well and that is very important. Situations the movie showed really happened. The scene where they raid the village and terrorize the farmers actually happened. It was a historically known massacre that really happened; I just can't remember the name. Soldiers didn't know who the real enemy was so they attacked everybody. Innocent people suffered because American soldiers could not control themselves and the pressures of the war got to them. They raped, murdered, and pillaged the village and that was just the beginning. They weren't only fighting the Vietnamese; they were also fighting each other. Barnes and Elias had their differences and they fought constantly but the betrayal of Barnes where he basically murdered Elias was just epic. That scene was just so bone chilling. Barnes chases him down and they stare each other down. It's a showdown and they look like they can read each other's minds. Barnes shoots and Elias falls down to the ground. Barnes tells Chris, Sheen, that he is already dead. Chris and Elias were good friends and shared similar opinions on the war. Barnes and Chris retreat to the helicopter but as they go up they see one of their own running towards the helicopter. It was Elias. He ate so many bullets and was bleeding everywhere. It was the ultimate betrayal. He was killed by his own squad and he raised his arms and looked up to the sky which became a classic pose from the movie. He falls over, dies and the helicopter flies away. Throughout the movie there is music from the Vietnam era but in every sad or serious scene the same tune of violins plays and makes the scene so much better. I always say the music can be the most important part of a movie. It sets tone and mood. It can make or break a scene and every time those violins played the audience knows the scene is important. Let me make one thing clear. I hate Charlie Sheen. I don't think he is funny; he is crazy, and a terrible actor. He should not be allowed to make anything else in the industry but that is just my opinion. Luckily this was before all of that garbage and he really did a good job. In parts of his acting I laughed and thought it was ridiculous but about an hour into the movie he stepped it up and did an amazing job. It made me respect the man more for his acting and what he had in his young career. It is a shame he let drugs ruin his life. My problems with the movie were that there were a lot of characters, possibly too many. Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp were in the movie but they disappeared. They were important for a scene and then I don't know what happened to them. Did they die? Did they leave the war? I don't know. Maybe somebody can let me know so please comment. For a war movie it wasn't the best I've seen but it wasn't really about the war between the Vietnamese but more about the war with themselves and the betrayal of soldiers. It was more emotional than physical and in a movie about Vietnam that should be portrayed so kudos to Platoon for that. Overall it was a fantastic movie that was more than a war movie but an emotional tale of soldiers in the Vietnam War. They suffered greatly and this movie probably most accurately portrays the devastation of the war. Action, acting, emotion, music, and overall performance were all good. Platoon easily gets the WillyT seal of approval but Charlie Sheen needs to just go away. I really just don't like the man or anything he is in, other than this movie. I could watch this movie again and again and can be viewed alone or with friends. Don't let young kids watch it obviously; listen to the rating on the movie because it will probably not end well but still a great film for mature audiences.

Mohandas K. Gandhi is unarguably one of the most worthy topics of a biopic in all of history, and this film does him much justice. As far as representing a man's life goes, this is top notch.This is a film about the man- his ideas of politics, how to fight, his relationships and then his work. He who would play such a person must be able to live up to his legacy- and Ben Kingsley delivers. One of the greatest performances of all time. The voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the weight loss&#x85; it completely sells the character. The uncanny resemblance doesn't hurt either in the TV footage I couldn't tell if they used real news clips or old-style filming. His performance is the best part of the film. What is covered? After a Lawrence of Arabia-like start, the first of several parallels, the film cuts to a 30 year old Gandhi being booted of a train, and we see the beginning of his philosophy. From there there's a fairly smooth telling of his life and accomplishments, with wonderful decoration, costumes, and incredible makeup. It certainly feels like a 3 hour film, but despite being heavy on drama and not action, the film moves well.Being very much centered on Gandhi, very little room is left for support. I maybe caught 3 other characters' names. Also, there are spots where actions don't make sense, and sometimes words too. Also there's the fact that while the film is incredible, lesson-teaching and very well made, other films exist that have done that too while being more *interesting*.

A delightful fairy tale. It reminded me of one of those Ealing Comedies from the 50s about peasants outwitting the establishment, something along the lines of Whiskey Galore or The Maggie. The establishment here isn't particularly stuffy. It's in far-away Dublin, while this is set in your typical Irish village, full of stone cottages, pig farms, fishermen, and a dark and friendly pub where everyone knows everyone else.Once upon a time there were two old men who hatched an ambitious scheme to defraud the Irish lottery of almost seven million pounds and spread it among the fifty-two families of the village. One of the men is Ian Bannen, who has never given a less than interesting performance. He's the instigator. David Kelly is his partner in crime. He has a skeletal body -- which we see running around naked -- and a face made for the camera.The winning Lotto numbers are announced on TV and after a bit of investigation Bannen discovers that the winner is someone in his own village, Tully More. Bannen and his wife, Fionnula Flanagan, who was a marvelously sexy teen-aged temptress as Nausicaa in Joseph Strick's otherwise dead version of Ulysses, would love to find out who the winner is and brown-nose him a bit, perhaps into giving some of his winnings to friends in need -- like Ian Bannen. The winner has yet to come forward.Bannen takes Kelly into his confidence. They'll throw great parties at the pub and at home, inviting the entire village, hoping that the winner will reveal himself by picking up the tab. No such luck. We're out forty pounds and one meat pie, Flanagan glumly tells her husband.They finally pin the winner down to good old Ned Devine, the old man who lives alone in his cottage and has no living relatives. They burst into his home to shower him with hugs and protestations of undying fellowship but only manage to spill the chicken dinner on him because Ned Devine is sitting in front of the TV -- dead of shock, and holding the winning ticket in his stiff fingers. (I'm almost laughing too hard to write this.) I can't get into any detail because of considerations of space, but it's decided that good old Ned's body will be ignored for the moment and Kelly will assume his guise. Complications arise and it becomes necessary to involve all fifty-two families, the winnings to be shared equally among them.The ending, which I won't describe, involves the intersection in time and space of a young man representing the Lotto authorities, a bitter and greedy old witch from the village, and the priest returning from a journey to Lourdes.I wasn't expecting too much. God knows we've had happy peasants before, most of them given to hearty living and earthy values. Hordes of Zorbas have flourished on the screens. But this one is as successful as any of them, humane, quietly hilarious, with recognizable characters. The music of the ceili band is in itself a slight rush. The tunes themselves are quite complicated, especially for the fiddle. I only know this because it was explained to me by Rabbi Miles Krassen who was at one time probably the most accomplished Irish fiddler in the United States.Anyway, the beginning of this inexpensive comedy is a little slow.

The plot? In dynastic China, a young girl named Mulan assumes the identity of a man in order to fight in the Emperor's army against marauding Huns. Mulan is portrayed as a budding feminist, a spunky young woman who abhors rigid gender roles, fights against sexism and believes that women should be celebrated for their brains and brawn rather than their bodies, bodices and\/or domestic\/sexual duties. In this regard she puts on pants, grabs a sword, slays barbarians and saves the lives of several men, most notably the Emperor of China. Significantly, in her final showdown with a muscular Hun, Mulan (and her male comrades) wears a dress. Her sidekicks are a lucky insect and a pint sized dragon, both creatures who, like Mulan, are underestimated and forced to conform to the rigid preconceptions of others. Like most supposedly progressive or feminist films, female empowerment here boils down to women proving that they can be as violent, barbaric, base and hyper-masculinist as men. This is not feminism, as conflict exists where none should.The film's intent and content clash in other ways Mulan's supposedly feminist actions ultimately stem out of a duty toward her father (and his duties to the Emperor), idealised male and female bodies discriminate against anything less than ideal (almost everyone other than Mulan and her lover is a buffoon), the film is packed with stereotypes, portrays Mulan's victory as a victory of Western ideals over those thought to be more traditionally Chinese, is resolutely white, in real life the Emperors of China were as brutal as any Hun, and the early dynasties were themselves as sexist to men as they were women (hordes of men were castrated and made eunuchs to fulfil specific effeminate roles in dynastic politics). The film is less sexist and racially insensitive than is typical of Disney, but still grates.Disney has a history of taking stories from different cultures and sanitising them of anything too ethnic. Here the film is based on the legend or ballad of Hua Mulan. The character has been ascribed to different dynastic periods (Sui, Tang, Ming etc), but Disney instead opted to set their film during the Han Dynasty. This allows the filmmakers to get away with creating a nice Emperor (China was somewhat progressive during this period) and use a type of Han Dynasty iconography that resembles more traditionally Japanese iconography (rose petals, samurai attire etc), which perhaps plays well to geographically confused Western audiences. The date of the movie is odd, the film conflating events and invasions that took place in different dynasties (bizzarely, its emperor, Zhou, and chief warrior, Shang, are named after separate dynastic periods).The film banalizes totems which mainstream culture oft associates with oriental or asian cultures. So we have lots of bamboo, dragon statues, great walls, plum blossoms, Chinese gardens, kung-fu, Chinese lanterns, Chinese fireworks, chopsticks, ink brushes, Chinese hair combs, pandas etc. It's wonderfully drawn, but all feels like the result of a corporate brainstorming session. As with most Disney films, anything remotely alien, alienating, hostile or strange is made to seem resolutely familiar and\/or cleansed of all cultural and racial background.Mulan, the first Disney princess with a body count, would lead to a period in which Disney made a greater effort to target male audience members. She, and the princess of Tangled, seem to mark a change in Disney princess body-types (younger, less womanly, less curvaceous, more spunky and teenage; the new sexual ideal). The film is wonderfully animated, very cool, some of its animation work has a primal quality, reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, only more abstract, and at times resembles minimalist Chinese ink paintings. The film possesses several exciting action sequences, its song-and-dance routines are less grating than usual, our lead has wonderfully expressive eyes, and a strong sexual undercurrent exists, as is typical of Disney.7.9\/10 - Worth one viewing.
