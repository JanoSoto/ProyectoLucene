It has so much fun with itself and its star Arnold Schwarzenegger you just have to smile occasionally. It borrows an idea like we have seen in Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' where fictional movie-characters and real people are suddenly in a world together. Here we have a boy in the real world named Danny (Austin O'Brien) who is suddenly, with the help of a magic ticket, in a film that contains his favorite character, Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The boy realizes this pretty soon and he tries to convince Jack that it is only a movie.The movie within a movie, 'Jack Slater IV' deals with villains such as Benedict (Charles Dance) and a mafia-family and from a previous 'Jack Slater'-movie we have The Ripper (Tom Noonan). The story is never that clear, but the film is more about the idea than about the story that carries the idea. There is a lot of fun at times when Danny tries to explain why it is all a movie. All women are beautiful, coincidences happen a lot, when the villain pops his glass eye out we see he has two normal eyes, things like that. A lot of the little things are actually pretty clever, especially the little continuity mistakes. Maybe not all of them are on purpose, a lot definitely are.A lot of the fun also comes from Schwarzenegger himself and the way he mocks his own image. He has proved a couple of times he can handle comedy; here he is at the top of his game. Cameos from actors like Jim Belushi, Chevy Chase, Sharon Stone, Robert Patrick and Jean-Claude van Damme (which makes this the best film he is in) all help on this aspect and a scene with Schwarzenegger's wife Maria Shriver is simply hilarious.The movie is not perfect, certain things like the story could have been a lot better. But that movie already exists with 'The Purple Rose of Cairo'. This one only wants to have fun and it has a lot of it. It makes fun of itself, its star, other movies from the genre and it contains a lot of jokes that require a little movie-knowledge. There is even an encounter with Death from Ingmar Bergman's 'Det Sjunde Inseglet', here played by Ian McKellen. 'Last Action Hero' is underrated, probably because a lot of people do not get the joke or do not care for it. I do both and I like it.

The debut piece of the now legendary Nick Park (who'd go on to create a series of captivating short films featuring a certain cheese-loving inventor and his well-read canine cohort, whose names I'm sure you don't need me to spell out for you here), it's now a widely-regarded classic in stop motion animation history, and there are some pretty good reasons for that. No other Aardman project, great as they frequently are, has managed to combine such high levels of whimsy, charm and poignancy quite as deftly as this one. The bright idea of taking real-life recordings with members of the public and aligning them with talking plasticine animals in the style of vox pop interviews (in this case, zoo animals commenting on their general living conditions, as extracted from discussions with residents of retirement homes, council housing and student halls) was so fresh, so ingenious and so delightful that the five minute running time designated here simply wasn't enough. It was a concept which begged to be extended, and it spawned a much-deserved franchise in the early 90s with TV ads for the UK's Heat Electric and, more recently, a long-awaited TV series in 2003. A franchise which in turn helped to establish Aardman's now-firm reputation for colourful, offbeat cosiness, as opposed to some of the more downbeat and sombre shorts they'd been working on for much of the 80s (many of which were good enough in their own right - Peter Lord's 'Going Equipped', which debuted alongside 'Creature Comforts' in the Channel 4 series 'Lip Synch, in particular is more than worth a look).Compared to a lot of the output that followed it, the animation here may look a little primitive by today's standards (the depressed gorilla, for example, is quite clearly riddled with the animator's finger prints), but it's an easily forgivable fault, and doesn't detract from the visual joy that this short is swimming in from start to finish. Get a load of all those wonderful sight gags - the elderly bush-baby's gigantic magnified pupils, the unidentified birds with beaks held on by elastic bands (the antics of the non-speaking characters hovering about in the background have always been something to keep an eye out for in the 'Creature Comforts' realm), the treadmill-running terrapins, the dozens of shrieking, flailing baby rodents&#133;all of it gold. Earning Nick Park an Oscar in 1990 for his efforts, it's endearing and comical to the bone - and yet there's also a mild tinge of sadness to it that I doubt 'Creature Comforts' would have been nearly as memorable without. For all the quirky cuteness that those clay-built critters possess, the anguish of a few of the original speakers remains persistent in their voices, and shines through in their pertaining characters quite dynamically. Most of the animals, it would seem, are perfectly contented with their lives in captivity, but there are a few who feel the sting of alienation, the homesick wild cat from Brazil being the standout personality on this one - the high range of exaggerated mannerisms that Park uses to bring him to life are unforgettable.A lovely film and a wonderful concept, what makes 'Creature Comforts' such a striking experience is, in part, how it touches upon some of the helplessness and frustrations of having to live in a world you feel out of place in.

This one doesn't seem to have quite the same pace as the first two. It kind of meanders about with little bursts of energy here and there before it comes to its thrilling grand finale.When last we left our heroes and villains Darth Vader had just told Luke Skywalker he was his father and Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite to be taken away by bounty hunter Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Here, Luke will deal with Han first, Vader later. We begin on Luke's old home planet of Tatooine where we learn Han is being held, still frozen, as a captive of the giant slug-like creature Jabba. Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO will all be involved in a mission to free Han. Suffice to say things don't go quite according to plan and among other indignities Leia ends up wearing a skimpy bikini and chained to the monstrous Jabba as his slave girl. Soon Luke arrives and we see his powers with the Force have grown but not to the extent that he can avoid finding himself in quite a predicament himself. We end up spending quite a bit of time on Tatooine, perhaps a bit too much as the film struggles to really get going. Finally (and inevitably as otherwise we'd have a really short movie) our heroes manage to free themselves from Jabba's clutches and we can move on to what will be the central theme of the movie. Luke Skywalker's attempt to redeem his father, Anakin Skywalker, and turn him from the evil he has become, Darth Vader, back to the good man he once was will be the main focus from here on in.Before he can confront Vader, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training with master Yoda. Here he learns his training is in fact complete. All that stands in the way of his being a Jedi Knight is to confront (and presumably defeat) Vader. After the stunning revelation in the last film in which we learned Vader was Luke's father another branch of the Skywalker family tree is revealed here. Not quite as stunning but something that certainly will change the perspective of some of the key characters when they learn the truth and also change how the audience perceives them.Travelling with Han, Leia and a rebel party to the forest moon of Endor, Luke will be part of a mission designed to bring about the destruction of a new Death Star the Empire is constructing. Those on the moon will be responsible for bringing the battle station's shield down so the rebel fleet can attack and destroy the Death Star. If the mission fails it will be the end of the rebellion and there will be no hope of freedom in the galaxy.Unfortunately as we move towards the film's climax we get bogged down on Endor as our heroes encounter a band of Ewoks, tiny primitive bear-like creatures. While they certainly may appeal to kids (and therefore sell a bunch of toys) the Ewoks have no place in this story. They do not bring the requisite level of seriousness required considering all the serious things which are occurring around them. There it seems only for comic relief the Ewoks are in fact not funny. Instead they are incredibly annoying and the film slows to a crawl as we learn more than we could ever want to know about them and their way of life.Eventually, sensing his father's presence, Luke leaves the rest of the rebels (and their new furry friends) to confront Darth Vader and try to turn him away from the Dark Side of the Force. Vader may seem to waver a bit but he is convinced it is too late for him. Vader will bring his son before the Emperor, briefly glimpsed in the last film and now played wonderfully by Ian McDiarmid. The Emperor, determined to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is pure evil personified. Soon, Luke will be faced with a choice. He must turn to the Dark Side or be destroyed.Meanwhile, back on the moon of Endor, Han, Leia and company are running into their own problems. If they don't get the Death Star's shield down the rebel fleet will face certain annihilation. It all builds to a thrilling conclusion as we cut back and forth from the efforts of the rebels and Ewoks on Endor to the confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star to the rebel fleet's attack on the battle station. The ending certainly does not disappoint. It is dramatic, emotional and ultimately thrilling. The Star Wars saga ends with a bang.Return of the Jedi does have its problems, most notably a slow pace and the presence of the insufferable Ewoks. The performances of the actors aren't quite up to their prior standards. Harrison Ford at times seems to be going through the motions as Han Solo although that may have something to do with the fact he's acting with a bunch of little furballs. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia seems strangely emotionless, especially when faced with some rather startling news. Mark Hamill does do well to capture the earnestness of a son who never stops believing there is good in his father despite all evidence to the contrary. McDiarmid is terrific and even in voice only James Earl Jones gives a terrific performance as Darth Vader. Of course, the visuals and special effects are typically dazzling. After the majesty of the first two films, Return of the Jedi may be seen as a slight disappointment. But all in all it is a worthy conclusion for a grand, sweeping, epic saga unlike any other we have ever seen.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"27 May 2005","score":"","review":" Though not quite up to the standards of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying end for the Star Wars saga. This one doesn't seem to have quite the same pace as the first two. It kind of meanders about with little bursts of energy here and there before it comes to its thrilling grand finale.When last we left our heroes and villains Darth Vader had just told Luke Skywalker he was his father and Han Solo had been frozen in carbonite to be taken away by bounty hunter Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Here, Luke will deal with Han first, Vader later. We begin on Luke's old home planet of Tatooine where we learn Han is being held, still frozen, as a captive of the giant slug-like creature Jabba. Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO will all be involved in a mission to free Han. Suffice to say things don't go quite according to plan and among other indignities Leia ends up wearing a skimpy bikini and chained to the monstrous Jabba as his slave girl. Soon Luke arrives and we see his powers with the Force have grown but not to the extent that he can avoid finding himself in quite a predicament himself. We end up spending quite a bit of time on Tatooine, perhaps a bit too much as the film struggles to really get going. Finally (and inevitably as otherwise we'd have a really short movie) our heroes manage to free themselves from Jabba's clutches and we can move on to what will be the central theme of the movie. Luke Skywalker's attempt to redeem his father, Anakin Skywalker, and turn him from the evil he has become, Darth Vader, back to the good man he once was will be the main focus from here on in.Before he can confront Vader, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his Jedi training with master Yoda. Here he learns his training is in fact complete. All that stands in the way of his being a Jedi Knight is to confront (and presumably defeat) Vader. After the stunning revelation in the last film in which we learned Vader was Luke's father another branch of the Skywalker family tree is revealed here. Not quite as stunning but something that certainly will change the perspective of some of the key characters when they learn the truth and also change how the audience perceives them.Travelling with Han, Leia and a rebel party to the forest moon of Endor, Luke will be part of a mission designed to bring about the destruction of a new Death Star the Empire is constructing. Those on the moon will be responsible for bringing the battle station's shield down so the rebel fleet can attack and destroy the Death Star. If the mission fails it will be the end of the rebellion and there will be no hope of freedom in the galaxy.Unfortunately as we move towards the film's climax we get bogged down on Endor as our heroes encounter a band of Ewoks, tiny primitive bear-like creatures. While they certainly may appeal to kids (and therefore sell a bunch of toys) the Ewoks have no place in this story. They do not bring the requisite level of seriousness required considering all the serious things which are occurring around them. There it seems only for comic relief the Ewoks are in fact not funny. Instead they are incredibly annoying and the film slows to a crawl as we learn more than we could ever want to know about them and their way of life.Eventually, sensing his father's presence, Luke leaves the rest of the rebels (and their new furry friends) to confront Darth Vader and try to turn him away from the Dark Side of the Force. Vader may seem to waver a bit but he is convinced it is too late for him. Vader will bring his son before the Emperor, briefly glimpsed in the last film and now played wonderfully by Ian McDiarmid. The Emperor, determined to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is pure evil personified. Soon, Luke will be faced with a choice. He must turn to the Dark Side or be destroyed.Meanwhile, back on the moon of Endor, Han, Leia and company are running into their own problems. If they don't get the Death Star's shield down the rebel fleet will face certain annihilation. It all builds to a thrilling conclusion as we cut back and forth from the efforts of the rebels and Ewoks on Endor to the confrontation between Luke, Vader and the Emperor on the Death Star to the rebel fleet's attack on the battle station. The ending certainly does not disappoint. It is dramatic, emotional and ultimately thrilling.

This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected.

When it comes to historic and realistic movies, they have used about every possible subject. Think of the American Civil War, the Hollocaust, the Second World War, the Vietnam war,... Each of these historic subjects has been used in a movie at least once. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, as long as it is done properly and accurately, because these movies are often the only source of new knowledge for a lot of people once they have left school (and even at school they hate history classes because they don't seem to understand the importance of it). But why aren't there so many movies about the slave trade and the plantations? Are the studios afraid of that subject or are they so racist, that they have never been able to come to terms with the abolishment of slavery? Amistad tells the story of a group of Africans who start a revolt against the crew of the slave ship La Amistad and get adrift for several weeks after this horrible event. Then they are discovered by some American marine officers, who bring the ship into harbor and hand over the slaves to the local authorities. Soon they have to stand trial for this revolt and the fact that they have murdered the crew. But a couple of honorable men, who want to end the slavery in the New World, will defend them with everything that is within their power ... even if that means that they will offend some other countries or start a civil war.At the same time it's very easy and very hard to say what I liked about this movie. I liked almost everything about it, but explaining why will take some time. Let me start with the story on itself. The fact that it hasn't been told at least a dozen times makes it original, but doesn't make it easy to compare it to other similar movies of course. Still, the quality was more than OK and had a lot of variation to offer. It's clearly well-written with a good eye for detail and even though I'm normally not a fan of court room drama's, I must say that it didn't even bother me that a court room was the place where the biggest part of this movie was set. What I also liked was the acting. From people like Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins you can't expect anything else but a fine performance, but it was the rest of the cast that offered me a nice surprise. Djimon Hounsou for instance still isn't a house hold name, even though he has played in a few excellent movies like Gladiator and In America, but once again he proves that he's a talented actor and I sure hope to see him in many more big productions soon. Even though a large part of this movie was shot in a court room, it also offered plenty of other sets. You'll get to see the fort in Sierra Leone where the slaves were brought together to be shipped to the New World, you'll see a nice representation of the American cities of those days, you'll see the ships of that time... And perhaps it's the slave boat and all the scenes on it that were the most incredible. I don't think the horror of the slave trade was more obvious as it was in those scenes. They certainly aren't suited for people who can't stand the sight of blood or very graphic violence, but excluding them from this movie would not only be a shame, it would harm the sense of reality. And it's that sense of reality that makes this movie so special. Of course Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make a movie feel as real as possible. Think of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, both movies that will always be in my list of the best movies I've ever seen, but with this movie he has proved that he can do more than telling a story situated in WWII. In the end I can only say that this is a movie that every American and every European should see. The Americans should see it because the slaves ones were the reason why the plantations in the South prospered and the civil war was fought and the Europeans shouldn't miss it, for we should never forget that the slave trade will always be a dark page in our long history. This movie is for so many reasons worth to be seen (not once, but at least a couple of times), that it doesn't deserve anything less than an 8.5\/10.

For Sly it's just a case of joining the dots. Rocky doesn't want to fight but he's goaded to\/provoked into\/forced to for honourable purposes but isn't ready so must train harder than ever before while his seemingly unbeatable opponent benefits from superior facilities but is doomed to be defeated because he is complacent\/arrogant\/evil\/not Rocky\/all of the above. The details in-between don't really matter but if you're interested this time it's personal as Rocky's former Nemesis, turned friend, turned trainer Apollo Creed decides he's regarded as yesterday's man and vainly challenges Soviet killing machine Ivan Drago (Dolph Lungren) to an exhibition fight in which he's the only person surprised by his untimely death. The Italian Stallion could leave it there but a)Drago is ill-advisedly unrepentant and b)if he did the movie would be half an hour long so the revenge match is set for Christmas Day back in the good 'ol USSR and...well you know the rest. The forth Rocky is mindless entertainment and a blatant self-parody but although you could write the whole thing in less time than it takes for Apollo's bloody head to hit the canvas it's genuinely enjoyable stuff. From the moment Creed is, as the Scots say, deed, the rest of the film is pure 80's excess - a clip strewn montage, a cheesy power ballad, Rocky coming to terms with his demons by driving his Ferrari through the night etc, etc... When the Rockster gets to Russia (Wyoming apparently) he's got only revenge on his mind and so we get to the final 45 minutes which every Rocky fan waits for in which Stallone's back to basics, low tech approach - cutting logs with a axe, pulling cars, climbing mountains, is contrasted with the Soviet's high-tech, computerised training programme. All your instincts tell you that Rocky is doomed but as he reaches the summit of that slope, the synthesiser score reaching a crescendo you know that somehow Americas going to pull it out of the bag and although you were a hardened cynic just half an hour earlier, you're now watching the most unlikely match-up in boxing history chanting Rocky!

Anyway, once Jaws 3 starts proper we are introduced to Micheal 'Mike' Brody (Dennis Quaid), the son of police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider, who does not appear in Jaws 3) from Jaws (1975) & Jaws 2 (1978). Mike works as the chief underwater engineer at a marine amusement park called Sea World which is dubbed 'The World's Largest Marine Park', somewhere in Florida, as coincidence would have it his girlfriend Dr. Kathryn 'Kathy' Morgan (Bess Armstrong) also works there as a marine biologist. A new attraction called the Undersea Kingdom, which is an enclosed lagoon with transparent underwater corridors that people can walk through, is being shown off to the press & public in a preview weekend. One of the parks workers named Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) dives into the Undersea Kingdom to try & repair some damaged gates, while down there he is viciously attacked by a Great White Shark. Shelby's girlfriend turns up at Seaworld the next day & complains to Mike that he didn't come home the previous night, concerned for his safety Mike & Kathy dive into Undersea Kingdom's lagoon to look for him. While conducting their search they are attacked by a Great White Shark but both manage to escape unharmed. Back on dry land a cocky adventurer named Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) wants to destroy the Shark & film it, but Kathy wants to capture it & persuades Sea Worlds owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) that it would be good for business to have a Great White Shark as an attraction. They successfully capture the Shark but it dies soon after & that makes it's enormous 35 foot plus Mother very unhappy. With an entire amusement park & lots of people to terrorise no one in the water is safe as she seeks revenge...Directed by Joe Alves who was the production designer on the first two Jaws films I quite liked Jaws 3 even if going by some of the reviews & comments most people seem to think that it's just about the worst film ever, well forget about that as it's nowhere near. I will openly admit that the script by Carl Gottlieb, Micheal Kane & Richard Matheson isn't the best ever but it moves along at a fair pace & I liked the setting & overall story even if it's complete total & utter nonsense in a factual & scientific sense. Sharks don't swim backwards, they definitely don't growl or roar & have no maternal instincts towards their young. I suppose you have to take the good with the bad if you know what I mean, & it is just at heart a horror film after all isn't it? Director Alves unfortunately fails to create much tension, excitement or atmosphere during the infrequent Shark attacks although I love the way FitzRoyce was eaten\/crushed with the camera placed in the back of the Sharks mouth showing us what we would see if we were being eaten, a really cool & memorable scene that's probably worth an extra star or two on it's own. Alves also fails somewhat when it comes to the dramatics out of the water with the human cast, the relationships & characters aren't that interesting. The shots which are supposed to use the 3-D effects are fairly obvious & as a result I felt one or two bits here & there looked a little out of place, having said that I quite liked the odd strange shot especially when the Shark was blown to pieces at the end & it's teeth & gums shoot towards to camera! The special effects in Jaws 3 are pretty poor, some of the optical effects are absolutely awful in particular the mini submarine underwater & the Shark 'gliding' towards the control room at the end as it breaks the glass in another obvious 3-D shot. Surprisingly there are a few good gore scenes in Jaws 3, a severed arm & some quite graphic shots of a mutilated body complete with a sea creature sliding out of it's mouth. The huge mechanical Shark looks good for the most part, especially it's mouth & teeth. Technically Jaws 3 is OK apart from those poor optical effects, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either. John Williams unforgettable theme is used at times but the rest of the music by Alan Parker simply can't come anywhere near to matching it. The acting is OK by all involved even if they don't seem to be putting too much effort into it. Overall I quite liked Jaws 3, it moves along at a fair pace & kept me entertained for it's 100 odd minute running time without too much trouble. So what if it's all rather silly, it's only a film after all right? In my humble opinion Jaws 3 definitely doesn't deserve to be in the IMDb's bottom 100 & is certainly worth watching if you can bag a cheap copy from somewhere or catch it on T.V. for free.

In Robert Redford's film, we discover how the producers of NBC's Twenty-One rigged every contestant on the show where eventually somebody would find out.The name of the game is Twenty-One and like Jeopardy! itself, the game show has various categories from history, science, math, movies, etc., and the champion is Herb Stempel (gifted actor John Turturro) a Jew living in Brooklyn who has won over various tournaments with a winning streak of over $100,000 where he knows all of the commercials by heart, and is being bribed by producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) so that way the show can get a new contestant who is better looking and not that hideous to TV viewers.During interviews for contestants, a pretty boy WASP teacher name Charles Van Doran (Ralph Finnees) tries out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough were Enright tries to get Van Doran into the show Twenty-One to beat Stempel, and decides to go through with it, just because Enright B.S'd the cause of education to him.Now after Van Doran has beaten Stempel, Redford shows the audiences the ups and down of a successful individual having fame, getting the answers from the producers, and losing the persona he once had.Attorney Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow, another gifted actor) reads Stempel's article about Twenty-One being rigged, so now Goodwin is investigating whether the incident is true or not and if Van Doran is being fed the answers from Enright instead of looking the answers by himself.Quiz Show is not just a movie, but a document on what goes on the inside of a game show where the next time you watch a game show, you ask yourself Are these people actually smart, or are they just being fed answers like everybody else? Are game shows discriminative towards people of genders and races? Or for the matter, is Ken Jennings really smart, or did Alex and the gang from Jeopardy! feed him the answers and later played him a fool?

Liz Hurley,Liz Hurley and only Liz Hurley.She is the very personification of the devil-tempting,alluring,and devastating in her actions.Hurley gives her best ever performance in this film,and compared to her,Fraser looks indeed more an object of ridicule than an object of our sympathy,precisely because Hurley's act prevents anyone from bearing the slightest amount of resentment towards her character-in fact ,one kind of enjoys the way he gets betrayed again and again by the devil.Of course,Fraser's ability to play a wide range of characters,plus his experience in comedy make his performance quite interesting-but it is Hurley who prevents the script from degenerating into a sort of cheap,farcical series of comic skits.I have been completely bedazzled by her and I am sure I am not the only one.Liz Hurley proves that there is a lot more to her than just being the face of Estee Lauder.Very impressive !
