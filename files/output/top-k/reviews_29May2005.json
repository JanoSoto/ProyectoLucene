Instead of a real ending, it degenerates to a fight scene which spills over into other pictures. Is the ending original? Maybe--but certainly not funny.

The characters were made believable by the phenomenal cast. Eastwood, Linney and Davis were outstanding at times. And the film has several tense and visually very interesting scenes which showed Eastwood's directorial talent nicely. From my perspective, the problem was somewhere between the script, the editing and the directing, but I am not sure exactly where.

Further, when the end finally does come, it moves in pretty abruptly, as something of a less than interesting anticlimax, long after the plot has fully unraveled, and you are left wondering just how much of the script was edited out. In fact, the last half of the film seemed rushed.Absolute Power is a plot heavy film. Less character-driven and less action oriented than most of its genre peers, the film relies on strong but underdeveloped performances, the likability of its antihero (Eastwood) and what could have been a very engaging string of scenarios culminating in a powerful conclusion. Plot heavy films can be good films if they stick to their heavy story-lines. However, and inexplicably, Absolute Power derails about half way through and never really gets back on track. Instead, none of these potentialities are explored fully and we are left with only petty revenge, a little misapplied justice, and the rebuilding of a relationship between the story's most likable characters (Linney and Eastwood).

Saying that, for example, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays were masters of their craft is not a risky venture and neither is an assertion that Shakespeare was a master playwright. But when it comes to directing motion pictures, that assertion is a bit harder to make. For one reason, it is fair to argue that, in the movie-making hierarchy, direction ranks at best, third in order of importance behind acting and writing. But when the actors and writers differ yet a catalog of movies is populated mostly by excellent examples of the medium, it goes without say that any common denominator should be looked at as a reason for the consistent excellence of the same. By that rationale, it can be said that Michael Mann is a master of his craft. His resume certainly indicates a preponderance for great directing. Thief, Heat, and The Insider are all excellent films; so is The Last of the Mohicans New Jerseyan James Fennimore Cooper's novel of the same name has been translated to the screen many times, with varying levels of success. The latest version on film is Mr. Mann's 1992 production starring Daniel Day Lewis, Madelaine Stowe, and Wes Studi. I guess it can be said that it is to my detriment that I have not seen most of the prior productions of this classic story. However, I don't believe that prior accomplishments and\/or failures in telling this story have very much bearing on the merits of the most modern envisioning of the same. Mr. Mann's realization of his and Christopher Crowe's script is as successful a dramatization of elements in Cooper's story as can be expected from a two hour movie. In short, the plot is fine; it leaves little to be desired.The performances of the actors, on the other hand, leave nothing to be desired. Yes, the most visible of all the cast, Daniel Day Lewis comes across as over the top at times. The stay alive exchange behind the waterfall in the third act of the movie comes to mind as far as this goes. But this minor trifle may be mitigated by shortcomings in the writing; a couple of the other lines Lewis' Hawkeye has in the movie seem to reinforce that idea. Nitpicking aside, Lewis delivers a Hawkeye that is supremely confident, charismatic, and almost haughty in his righteousness. It is a performance akin in it's excellence to Lewis' Gerry Conlon, Danny Flynn, and Will Cutting. It is not the best performance of this movie which is enough of an endorsement of the quality of the whole cast. That honor has to go to Wes Studi. His Magua is so irrevocably evil that you can't help but root against the guy. His cold and disaffected predictions of what he will do to the gray hair are indications of a psychopathic nature. Yet, when you hear why Magua hates Munro, you begin to doubt your own feelings against him. Then the revelation during the Huron tribal council scene at the end of the film that revenge is not enough for Magua reinforces your first opinion of the guy.The other performances in the movie are quite good as well. Jodhi May's mousey Alice Munro serves as an excellent metaphor for what war can do to someone as she spends the vast majority of the movie in a state of perpetual shellshock.

All the individual elements of a movie can be excellent but if they're not brought together effectively, then the final product will be muddled. But Mann is a master of his craft. He brings in the right cinematographer. He consults on and writes the right script. He directs talented actors to say and do the right thing.

But when it comes to directing motion pictures, that assertion is a bit harder to make. For one reason, it is fair to argue that, in the movie-making hierarchy, direction ranks at best, third in order of importance behind acting and writing. But when the actors and writers differ yet a catalog of movies is populated mostly by excellent examples of the medium, it goes without say that any common denominator should be looked at as a reason for the consistent excellence of the same. By that rationale, it can be said that Michael Mann is a master of his craft. His resume certainly indicates a preponderance for great directing.

The latest version on film is Mr. Mann's 1992 production starring Daniel Day Lewis, Madelaine Stowe, and Wes Studi. I guess it can be said that it is to my detriment that I have not seen most of the prior productions of this classic story. However, I don't believe that prior accomplishments and\/or failures in telling this story have very much bearing on the merits of the most modern envisioning of the same. Mr. Mann's realization of his and Christopher Crowe's script is as successful a dramatization of elements in Cooper's story as can be expected from a two hour movie. In short, the plot is fine; it leaves little to be desired.The performances of the actors, on the other hand, leave nothing to be desired. Yes, the most visible of all the cast, Daniel Day Lewis comes across as over the top at times. The stay alive exchange behind the waterfall in the third act of the movie comes to mind as far as this goes. But this minor trifle may be mitigated by shortcomings in the writing; a couple of the other lines Lewis' Hawkeye has in the movie seem to reinforce that idea. Nitpicking aside, Lewis delivers a Hawkeye that is supremely confident, charismatic, and almost haughty in his righteousness. It is a performance akin in it's excellence to Lewis' Gerry Conlon, Danny Flynn, and Will Cutting. It is not the best performance of this movie which is enough of an endorsement of the quality of the whole cast. That honor has to go to Wes Studi. His Magua is so irrevocably evil that you can't help but root against the guy. His cold and disaffected predictions of what he will do to the gray hair are indications of a psychopathic nature. Yet, when you hear why Magua hates Munro, you begin to doubt your own feelings against him. Then the revelation during the Huron tribal council scene at the end of the film that revenge is not enough for Magua reinforces your first opinion of the guy.The other performances in the movie are quite good as well. Jodhi May's mousey Alice Munro serves as an excellent metaphor for what war can do to someone as she spends the vast majority of the movie in a state of perpetual shellshock.

To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her HOOKER character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.The ONLY cast I felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. They did such a fine job that I hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. They had real definition, for the minor roles. OK, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.Aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. Either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting Julia Roberts or kissing ass to Richard Gere.This was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.While in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy Madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.The hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.The story is about Julia Roberts being PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.She is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at Disney\/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.Had Richard Gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an attaché case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.Oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or Asian or Spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.I didn't like it 15 years ago, when I didn't understand it and was led by the Hollywood hype. I hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called love.This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.Do I hate it?

People were raving about how it was the definition of cool. I believe someone even told me that it rivaled the likes of a Tarantino film. Well, having seen it, I can say that it's definitely got a lot less style than a Tarantino film, and none of the associated substance. It's basically an empty shell, albeit a pretty-looking one. The film has plenty of acting talent, but not even half of it is put to any use. There are just far too many characters, so many of them spend the better part of the film, following their initial introduction, sitting around, not really doing anything at all. Maybe the film should have been Ocean's Five instead... so we actually got some semi-interesting and well-developed characters instead of these cardboard cutouts spouting hip lines every chance they get. The dialog is witty and at times clever, but it's almost entirely superficial. The plot is decent. Another thing is that there's not really anyone to root for; it's a film about dishonest criminals stealing from other dishonest criminals. The pacing is OK. I found the film to be far too long and drawn-out. It could easily have been cut by at least half an hour. Once again, we don't care about these people. Submit any viewer of this movie to a lie detector test and ask if they saw this for the heist or for the characters. If anything less than 90% prove to have seen it entirely for the heist, I'll be very surprised. Then there's all the unneeded scenes, probably done to establish relationships(between the characters that we don't care about). Add to that, the plot holes and completely random actions of some of the characters. This film reminded me of a Danish produced film... Klatretøsen, or Catch That Girl, as it's international title is. It's a children's film, and I found it far more interesting, involving and plausible than this. Note that I didn't claim it was more entertaining. That's what this film is; entertaining. Nothing else. As a matter of fact, you should probably either see the Danish film, or the American remake(which I haven't seen... yet) as you'll probably find more substance in either of them than this film. If you insist on seeing this, just prepare yourself to be underwhelmed and possibly disappointed. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the stars and people who look for an attractive film rather than a meaningful one. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I finally got to see this, after hearing so much positive stuff about it.

I found the film to be far too long and drawn-out. It could easily have been cut by at least half an hour. Once again, we don't care about these people. Submit any viewer of this movie to a lie detector test and ask if they saw this for the heist or for the characters. If anything less than 90% prove to have seen it entirely for the heist, I'll be very surprised. Then there's all the unneeded scenes, probably done to establish relationships(between the characters that we don't care about). Add to that, the plot holes and completely random actions of some of the characters. This film reminded me of a Danish produced film... Klatretøsen, or Catch That Girl, as it's international title is. It's a children's film, and I found it far more interesting, involving and plausible than this. Note that I didn't claim it was more entertaining. That's what this film is; entertaining. Nothing else. As a matter of fact, you should probably either see the Danish film, or the American remake(which I haven't seen... yet) as you'll probably find more substance in either of them than this film. If you insist on seeing this, just prepare yourself to be underwhelmed and possibly disappointed. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the stars and people who look for an attractive film rather than a meaningful one. 7\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"29 May 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" On the surface, Signs is an alien movie where the human race comes to contact with a foreign life form. Signs might have had a rather large budget, but it doesn't make it a big Hollywood spectacle. This means that there isn't a lot of scenes with the aliens nor does the scenery change much from the farmhouse that the family of Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess lives in. This is intentional.The reason for this is simple Signs is really about family, faith and coincidence. It is clear that M. Night Shyamalan is a man of vision and good taste. As scenes with aliens are scarce, every glimpse of the invaders has a bigger impact. Signs isn't about cheap shots with well placed stingers or visual horror, but relies on its haunting atmosphere that is created by the uncertainty regarding the aliens. Not until the very end does the viewer begin to learn the first things about the invaders. For me, this worked very well and kept me interested throughout the film. However, some viewers will find Signs boring for this very reason.If the film hadn't been directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I doubt that Sign's would have turned out as good as it did. As the film contains a few dramatic scenes, it comes very close to being corny or cheesy, but Shyamalan manages to pull it off.So why only 7 points? Well, to tell you the truth I can't think of a reason why I didn't like it more. Sixth Sense totally blew me away, so expectations were naturally high on this one. 7 points is definitely not bad and there certainly isn't anything wrong with the film. Signs is just one of those movies that are OK and you can't really explain it. I found a lot of good in it, but maybe that just wasn't good enough.

Well, not all do.

Jar Jar seems to be one of the main subjects of hate, but i think he's is a likable and nice character, maybe too clumsy, but its okay with me. Other of the complaints I often hear concerns Anakin. Whats the problem with the main character being a 10 year old boy? I don't see one, does he seem not credible? Not really, remember, he was no ordinary kid, the Force gave him those exceptional gifts, and consider how kids would be if we were in Star Wars time, they would be used to other things and environment, and would be smarter and more skilled in other stuff. There is some political babble in it, but its nothing overwhelming, and the movie never gets boring.Everything in this movie is top notch. The characters are excellent, the music is awesome, the effects, the visuals, the locations, everything is incredible. The CG characters, vehicles and effects are just plain amazing. They're like they were real. There is nothing wasted in this film, and I think it is one of the best looking movies of all time.

It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you re-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy the plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who that person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan McGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify Return of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker saw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin Skywalker needs to live. Alright.

The special effects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I was even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was born, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George.

It's the movie that got me real interested in David Lynch. Before I saw the film, I didn't even really now who this David Lynch guy was. After I viewed the film, I enjoyed it so much I went on a David Lynch rampage, going to the Blockbuster near my house and renting practically everything he did. David Lynch quickly became one of my new favorite filmmakers, after I saw the dark, strange, mystical, and powerful film noir-ish motion picture, 'Blue Velvet'. Although, 'Blue Velvet' isn't Lynch's best work in my opinion, I think it's his most famous work (besides his Twin Peaks television series which lasted from 1990-1991). 'Blue Velvet' is now considered a cult classic, and I have to say, it's probably one of my favorites. I've seen the film about six times, and I own the two-disc special edition DVD.'Blue Velvet' is set in a small town named Lumberton, a town known best for it's lumber distribution. The story follows a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who returns to his hometown of Lumberton after being away at college. He stays at his father's farmhouse, and finds a severed ear in the cornfields. Jeffery takes it to the police station, and forensic science identifies it as the ear of of a man named Vallens. This causes Jeffery to investigate Vallens, and his wife, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini), who he thinks to be involved. Jeffery investigates her with the help of a high school senior (who's the daughter of the town's police captain) who Jeffrey is secretly trying to romance, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern). While investigating Jeffrey falls for Dorothy, and gets in the middle of Dorothy's relationship with Frank Boothe (Dennis Hopper), a creepy, perverted, violent mad-man whose kidnapped her husband and son, so that Dorothy will perform perverse sexual acts for him. The film's story then plunges deep into a world of violence, sex, malice, sadism, and nitrous oxide (which Hopper's character, Boothe, is always sucking down while giving a cold and kooky stare to Jeffrey).'Blue Velvet' isn't a perfect movie by any stretch, but it's a great film that never quits intriguing you for it's whole two hour and five minute runtime. In 'Blue Velvet' the acting is a cut above the rest. Kyle MacLachlan is perfect in his role as the film's hero, Jeffrey. He plays his character with an interesting sense of cool and quick-wittedness, that it is hard for me to imagine anybody being able to do the role but MacLachlan. Isabella Rosellini is fantastic as the aberrant and complex Dorothy, a performance so fine it should have earned her an Academy Award Nomination for Best Lead Actress. Laura Dern is very good as usual, and Quantum Leap's Dean Stockwell have a short but extremely memorable role as Ben (who in the middle of the film lip-syncs a duet of 'In Dreams' with Hopper's character -- a scene that is probably the strangest of the film.) The stand-out scene-stealer of the film is the villain though -- Dennis Hopper as Frank Boothe. Hopper, who gives perhaps the best performance of his career so far, is so absolutely astonishing in his role as the sexual deviant psychopath who is Frank Boothe. Dennis Hopper should not have only gotten an Academy Award nomination for his role, but the actual Oscar itself. Hopper's performance is one of the few screen performances that will be talked about and praised for several years to come. David Lynch provides a once in a lifetime script, and his direction is so fabulous it earned him an Oscar nomination. For all the extraordinary qualities 'Blue Velvet' possesses, it has some bad ones. The film doesn't really add up in the end, and there's a lot of interesting scenarios that are never fully explained or even breached upon. Sometimes you wonder if Lynch is just putting this stuff in his movie to be weird, instead of it serving a higher purpose. That's extremely frustrating to watch, but when all is said and done, 'Blue Velvet's' positive aspects outweigh 'Blue Velvet's' negative aspects by a substantial amount.In conclusion, I highly recommend renting or buying this bizarre cult favorite. 'Blue Velvet' is a very inventive film, and it never borrows from other ones. It's a movie I'd predict is studied in film classes across the globe, because the film is so complex you won't get everything or catch everything Lynch's 'Blue Velvet' has to offer the first time around. It's a film buff's kind of flick, and that's a huge compliment.
