The story, acting, and music are all phenomenal. It truly is a masterpiece.The story is about an Extra Terristrial (E.T.) who gets left behind on Earth on accident. Soon he befriends a young boy named Elliot and the two form a friendship that changes both their lives.The story is a pretty good one. This time an alien that comes to Earth is not a bad guy or a threat. Rather it is peaceful and just wants to return home. At the beginning this film is pretty scary, but as soon as you see Elliot and E.T. become friends the film is really touching and moving and highly entertaining.E.T. is a great character. Peaceful and curious, he just wants to go home. Also he has the awesome ability of telekenisis and can heal things with his fingers. One of the greatest non human characters in film history.The children actors in this film are legendary. Drew Barrymore is great as Gertie. Henry Thomas puts forth a legendary performance as Elliot, true that it no doubt will be his most memorable role and one that always will be associated with him. Also the actor who played Elliots brother was good as well.The music, is legendary. John Williams does a phenomenal job putting together a score that perfectly fits the film at the important points.One of the greatest films of all time. Highly recommended, thank you Steven Spielberg for making it.

His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) has moved in to help him get back on his feet and return to normal life. Graham's children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) have also been enduring deeply depressing times after the loss of their mother and have both lost faith in their father as it seems he has lost his. Many surreal events begin to occur, initially ignored by the family as they try to recover from their bereavement. As the events begin to snowball into a worldwide panic the family are forced to act, uniting and attempting to survive.The most terrifying part for me was the Brazilian home video scene. As the reporter informs the audience that What you're about to see may disturb you and the music begins, you can feel the suspense building. You're watching the video for around 40 seconds and nothing is happening, until the music builds to a climax and all is revealed.

This is the moment when he realises what to expect.The acting is superb, it really is. Gibson leads well and acts just as man would in his character's situation.

Let's see; from Annie Hall (1977) to Everyone Says I Love You (1996) things were good. Then Deconstructing Harry (1997), Celebrity (1998), Small Time Crooks (2000), The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001), Hollywood Ending (2002), and Melinda and Melinda (2004) ALL had problems, sometimes more than their good points. In the middle of both phases is where Sweet and Lowdown exists. Now this is a good movie on all the levels.Why Emmet Ray couldn't be Django Reinhardt ? It's simple. He isn't that bold when it comes to express his feelings. So that's why he didn't tell the girl he loved (who loved him as well) that he loves her, and lost her at the end. I think there is a reason why Allen did a movie about that man, else paying a tribute to jazz guitarist he loves. Allen is the complete opposite of Emmet Ray. Dear Woody just can't get enough of showing himself to the audience through the characters of his movies during the last 35 years (some of them played by him). Or maybe, after all of these years, Woody just sees that he didn't express enough, feeling a bound with Ray as if the last is a symbol for the suppression which could kill a talented artist. We can read this movie as a conscience of importunate fear Allen has.Anyway, I loved it. It was fantastic how Allen, out of some unfinished or uncertain stories, made his own version of Emmet Ray's bio. However, I felt something was missing with the background of the character. His history was a bit vague. I know well that he was poor to the extent that made him afraid of being poor again, so he worked a lot, threw money away for looking rich, having this strange love to steal (he, to some extent, just wants to own). But on the other hand, I didn't understand what the secret of his fear to express was ?, was it some kind of compulsory obsession ?, was it something in his childhood ?, was he that shy of his early poor life ?, another unanswered question  He drank much to forget what  his fear ?, or his inner belief that he wouldn't be great due to this very fear ?There are some nice moments. The ones with his wife were so serene and hilariously comic. Samatha Morton is an angel from heaven. She was sent to do this role. Now I knew that angels can't look like they're acting at all, they can be so realistic and damn believable ! Sean Penn proves that he's a master of characters. He did it nearly flawlessly. However, he was lowdown and no sweet ?!! And finally, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, can be more joyful more than witnessing how the old jazz tracks, that Woody adores, fit perfectly in the movie he directs. Ahhh, I felt deep relief about that apart !It's romantic, funny, sad. And based on true and false stories (as if there isn't a history that suffers from the same thing ?!).

What's he gotta do to be a stand up guy ?James Dean is a hard man to critique. On one hand he may be one of the greatest actors of all time, with iconographic good looks and a smouldering style that influenced a whole generation of movie stars and tough guys. On the other, he only made three movies, at least one of which is kinda dull and he plays a very similar part in all of them. This is his best film and best performance I think, and the imagery of him in his red jacket and jeans, tooling around town in a 1949 Mercury Coupe is pretty unforgettable. He's just Mr Cool, ain't no doubt about it. And although the film personifies the fifties juvenile delinquent era (along with the less wholesome The Cool And The Crazy), its themes and drama are still as potent as ever today. For me, it's a movie all about fathers and failing relationships with their children. Jim wishes his Dad had more resolve, Judy's Dad is too embarrassed to talk to her about her developing sexuality, and Plato simply wants to have a Dad who loves him. The only adult who attempts to understand the kids is Ray the cop. Jim is hotheaded enough to get into trouble whenever someone calls him a chicken, but also mature enough to realise that kind of macho lifestyle isn't really worth a damn. But when he asks his Dad about it he never gets a straight answer. This would make a good strange double bill with Alien, which in a weird way is all about mothers and motherhood. The film is thoughtful and honest about families and the social pressures of youth, and the cast are all very good. Wood (who was only seventeen) is the classic girl next door, and Mineo (sixteen) as the deeply troubled Plato, in many ways steals the movie from Dean with his edgy, homoerotic, little boy lost performance. The well-known sequence where the three of them hide out in the big abandoned house is lyrical and haunting, not least because all three talented actors subsequently met with violent deaths at much too young an age; Dean was already dead before the movie opened.

And although the film personifies the fifties juvenile delinquent era (along with the less wholesome The Cool And The Crazy), its themes and drama are still as potent as ever today. For me, it's a movie all about fathers and failing relationships with their children. Jim wishes his Dad had more resolve, Judy's Dad is too embarrassed to talk to her about her developing sexuality, and Plato simply wants to have a Dad who loves him. The only adult who attempts to understand the kids is Ray the cop. Jim is hotheaded enough to get into trouble whenever someone calls him a chicken, but also mature enough to realise that kind of macho lifestyle isn't really worth a damn. But when he asks his Dad about it he never gets a straight answer. This would make a good strange double bill with Alien, which in a weird way is all about mothers and motherhood. The film is thoughtful and honest about families and the social pressures of youth, and the cast are all very good. Wood (who was only seventeen) is the classic girl next door, and Mineo (sixteen) as the deeply troubled Plato, in many ways steals the movie from Dean with his edgy, homoerotic, little boy lost performance. The well-known sequence where the three of them hide out in the big abandoned house is lyrical and haunting, not least because all three talented actors subsequently met with violent deaths at much too young an age; Dean was already dead before the movie opened. Featuring a nice loud score by Leonard Rosenman and sharp photography throughout by Ernest Haller (despite Dean trying to jump out of the frame all the time). Ray was a talented and socially conscious director who, along with contemporaries like Sam Fuller and Don Siegel, made a lot of good films in the fifties and sixties (check out In A Lonely Place and Johnny Guitar). Written by Stewart Stern and Irving Shulman, from an original story by Ray. Although Rebel was preceded by a few youth-gone-wild pictures (The Wild One, The Blackboard Jungle), it's pretty much the model for every teen angst film since, from To Sir, With Love to The Breakfast Club to Heathers. At the time it was quite the phenomenon and the passing decades have done nothing to detract from its dramatic impact.

And they are succeeding, the rebels are forced back to the planet of Hoth as it is one of their last outposts.

Han Solo and Princess Leia are forced to run from the Empire and attempt to escape whilst Luke must seek out Yoda, a mysterious Jedi master who will train Luke in the ways of the force.The bulk of the film is these two stories being played out next to each other.The two stories ultimately rejoin in Cloud City, on the planet of Bespin. Here, Han Solo and co. are captured by the Empire after being betrayed by Han's lifelong friend, Lando Calrissian. Lando claims that he had no choice into his betrayal as the Empire threatened his home world. Han Solo is frozen and taken away by Boba Fett (A bounty hunter).

The creature is one of the best looking monster-suits of its day and it still looks great; the music is good; the underwater scenes were probably mind-blowing back in the day and still are; the theme of science vs big game hunter is great; the camera work is superb; the ending is sad but we are not sure why...what a brilliant film! Part of the fun is to watch for the wonderful monster movie genre conventions of the 50s as the film unfolds. One of these conventions is that someone remarks that the hero or heroine looks too young or attractive to be a scientist (watch for it twice in this film). Another convention is the respect and awe given to science and scientists, and the necessity of explaining and understanding any creature in scientific terms (usually combined with some really wacky notions). Probably the most fun convention is that the very top of the social pecking order is occupied by young, hunky, testosterone-intoxicated scientist men - the alpha males.On the surface, the plot is about a scientific discovery of a creature living in a remote area of the amazon, and what to do about this discovery. The main subplot of the story, which ends up almost taking over the surface story, is about Kay choosing between two men. Both are alpha male scientists, but one (Mark) is wealthy and successful the other (David) is dedicated and scientific. Because there are subtle relationships between these three people and the creature, the film ventures into deeper waters (so to speak) than most simple monster films.I like to think of Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) as the main character of the movie. Yes I know that the guys get all the macho lines, do all the hero things, solve all the problems, while Kay may at first glance appear to do little but scream and faint and look pretty. But on closer examination Kay is shown to be independent, intelligent, adventurous and courageous. She is more fun, forward-looking, alive and human than either of the two alpha males. Kay dominates the camera shots too, which indicates the pivotal nature of her role. Note that in each scene, who Kay stands next to, and where she is placed in relation to the others is always important within the subtext of the story. The two alpha males don't quite behave as most alpha males of the genre. Usually, the alpha male is unambiguous and aggressive (if not predatory) toward the female. Here however, we have one male bitter and obsessed while the other is oblivious and dedicated. The males are more interested in competing with each other than winning Kay (watch how often the two men are paired in shots, but listen to their dialog as well). In most movies of this genre, the woman is decisive in choosing a mate. Here, because the two males are inaccessible, Kay's choice is necessarily ambivalent, and great complications develop as a result. In the end, Kay ends up with one of the alpha males, but it seems to me she is left with a socially acceptable but emotionally unsatisfying partner. It feels like she deserved better. Hollywood fell in love with Freudian psychoanalysis sometime around the 50s. This can be seen in many films where subconscious evils become physical monsters (Forbidden Planet is an example). This theme is used, if somewhat loosely, in the Creature From the Black Lagoon. Once the adventurers enter the Black Lagoon area, the creature can be interpreted psychologically as Mark's monstrous shadow, or double. Mark is embittered by Kay's rejection of him, he is murderous enough to kill for her (watch for the first appearance of the spear gun), but instead he tries to kill the beast (his lust for her), but is himself killed and the beast triumphs (lust wins over rational ego), so the beast attains full freedom to seize the girl (Kay is abducted only after Mark is killed). The film shows us what happens when two alpha males fight for dominance and the woman does not, or cannot, fully connect with one of them. Kay's hesitation to fully ditch Mark is what brings out the creature. At critical junctures Kay sympathizes with Mark, and the creature immediately appears. This is seen on the boat after the men return from their first dive - Kay expresses sympathy for Mark, but Dave is concerned that Mark might try to take her away from him (note how for David the focus is always on competition between he and Mark). After this scene, Kay goes for her famous swim and encounters the creature.Then at night, after the creature is captured, Kay has a bizarre conversation (in which science attempts to arbitrate love!) with Dr. Thompson about the growing tension between Mark and Dave.He says, Once you admit the simple fact that you are in love, which you have, then it becomes good idea to be the scientist about it. She replies, It's not as easy as you think and goes on to explain how she owes her success and her job to Mark. Right on cue, the creature breaks free and attacks. Again we have sympathy for Mark followed by an appearance of the creature.There are more points to be made about this love triangle + creature, but they remain beyond the scope of this review.

The creature is one of the best looking monster-suits of its day and it still looks great; the music is good; the underwater scenes were probably mind-blowing back in the day and still are; the theme of science vs big game hunter is great; the camera work is superb; the ending is sad but we are not sure why...what a brilliant film! Part of the fun is to watch for the wonderful monster movie genre conventions of the 50s as the film unfolds. One of these conventions is that someone remarks that the hero or heroine looks too young or attractive to be a scientist (watch for it twice in this film). Another convention is the respect and awe given to science and scientists, and the necessity of explaining and understanding any creature in scientific terms (usually combined with some really wacky notions). Probably the most fun convention is that the very top of the social pecking order is occupied by young, hunky, testosterone-intoxicated scientist men - the alpha males.On the surface, the plot is about a scientific discovery of a creature living in a remote area of the amazon, and what to do about this discovery. The main subplot of the story, which ends up almost taking over the surface story, is about Kay choosing between two men. Both are alpha male scientists, but one (Mark) is wealthy and successful the other (David) is dedicated and scientific. Because there are subtle relationships between these three people and the creature, the film ventures into deeper waters (so to speak) than most simple monster films.I like to think of Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) as the main character of the movie. Yes I know that the guys get all the macho lines, do all the hero things, solve all the problems, while Kay may at first glance appear to do little but scream and faint and look pretty. But on closer examination Kay is shown to be independent, intelligent, adventurous and courageous. She is more fun, forward-looking, alive and human than either of the two alpha males. Kay dominates the camera shots too, which indicates the pivotal nature of her role. Note that in each scene, who Kay stands next to, and where she is placed in relation to the others is always important within the subtext of the story. The two alpha males don't quite behave as most alpha males of the genre. Usually, the alpha male is unambiguous and aggressive (if not predatory) toward the female. Here however, we have one male bitter and obsessed while the other is oblivious and dedicated. The males are more interested in competing with each other than winning Kay (watch how often the two men are paired in shots, but listen to their dialog as well). In most movies of this genre, the woman is decisive in choosing a mate. Here, because the two males are inaccessible, Kay's choice is necessarily ambivalent, and great complications develop as a result. In the end, Kay ends up with one of the alpha males, but it seems to me she is left with a socially acceptable but emotionally unsatisfying partner. It feels like she deserved better. Hollywood fell in love with Freudian psychoanalysis sometime around the 50s. This can be seen in many films where subconscious evils become physical monsters (Forbidden Planet is an example). This theme is used, if somewhat loosely, in the Creature From the Black Lagoon. Once the adventurers enter the Black Lagoon area, the creature can be interpreted psychologically as Mark's monstrous shadow, or double. Mark is embittered by Kay's rejection of him, he is murderous enough to kill for her (watch for the first appearance of the spear gun), but instead he tries to kill the beast (his lust for her), but is himself killed and the beast triumphs (lust wins over rational ego), so the beast attains full freedom to seize the girl (Kay is abducted only after Mark is killed). The film shows us what happens when two alpha males fight for dominance and the woman does not, or cannot, fully connect with one of them.

The first story is the build up to this action. The second story is what happens afterwards. The two stories start at different ends and work towards the middle. The result is a fantastically interesting and articulate plot which results in the all characters (including the audience) trying to piece together the pieces of the puzzle.The Non-liner structure I thought worked, but only to a certain degree. I have to say that it was not the best non-linear film I have seen. I still prefer Memento in terms of arrangement. However, as I have said, the process of working towards the middle really worked in a murder mystery film. I can't think of too many other films like it. With the exception of Reservoir Dogs and although I am sure that the film is not a copy, it is very similar to Reservoir Dogs in it's layout and style. The major difference being that you see the action that took place in the usual suspects and you don't in Reservoir Dogs.Another thing to mention is that mystery films do not always work best with non-linear structures. I believe the reason that memento worked was because it turned out that thee was no mystery in a twist ending, it was merely personal vendetta. However in this film, it does become confusing at times and can lose some audience members. I much prefer mystery presented in a linear pattern. For example, I shall use Sherlock Holmes (my dear Watson). In the Holmes novels, the mystery is presented in pattern where the reader begins to solve the case at the same time as Sherlock Holmes. Making it more interesting and engaging. I just felt that the non-linear structure didn't have this attraction.Another things to mention is that all the acting is universally brilliant. I don't say that lightly either, but I totally bought the reality of the characters, without meaning to add favouritism, Kevin Spacey was just fantastic in his role. For not being a method actor I was amazed on the realism he managed to bring to the character in terms of his body movement and vocal style.Finally, what can be said about the end?

But when it came to full-length features, it was always those from Disney which appealed to me. Don Bluth's and other full-length features from other studios appeared as cold, generic and lifeless to me. But with The Swan Princess, the story is another one. The previews of the film looked actually quite promising and the film certainly didn't disappoint when I finally saw it and it's undoubtedly one of the best non-Disney hand drawn films &#x96; at least from the 90's.The Swan Princess has the same tone and feel of Disney film and the lighter moments does resembles the lighter tone from Beauty and the Beast (without the deep love story and dark undertones). Even the enjoyable songs are Broadway-inspired and sounds like they could appeared in a Disney film. Although this film is not equal to Disney's very best, it still come as very close.The main plot may be a conventional fairytale, but it does have a twist; It's a normal component that the Prince and the Princess falls in love with first sight without further question, but in this film the Princess literally asks her Prince if her beauty is the only reason for loving her. A quite refreshing twist and actually a more realistic plot point, which is nice for the kids to see.Swan Princess actually does have a bunch of enjoyable characters. Derek and Odette may not be the most memorable protagonists in a animated feature, but are likable and engaging enough and portrays at least more personality than the Disney Princes and Princesses from Walt's films (pre-90's). The sorcerer Rothbart may not surpass the Disney villains, but he's passable enough. The most memorable characters are - just as with the Disney flicks - the sidekick characters, especially the turtle Speed and the bird Puffin (Jean-Bob was just too self-centered and annoying for my taste). Even the minor characters as Queen Uberta, the conductor Lord Rogers and Prince Derek's friend, Bromley, are quite likable.The animation may not live up to Disney standards, but it's still nice-looking. The score of Lex de Azevedo isn't' despicable, either. Otherwise, if there should be any complains about The Swan Princess, it would be that the film lacks overall the depth that the Disney movies usually have. The screenplay is mostly solid, but does have a few plot holes now and then. In spite of the refreshing plot point about love shouldn't just be all about appearance, the love story between Derek and Odette comes off as contrived and underdeveloped.

Yet, this sequel to Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror movie Alien is beyond anything fans of the series or straight action fans could hope for. Certainly if you haven't see it by now, you owe yourself that favor. While the first relied more on quiet tension and dark corners to introduce its horror, this sequel starts out as such with no aliens even making an appearance until after the first hour. After that though, it's all war.This is the sixth James Cameron film I have seen and his talent continues to amaze and astound me with every movie I watch. His vision is so unique, so ambitious that even if the story is less than impressive (a la Avatar), I cannot deny the incredible attention to detail and outstanding production designs implemented in this film. The buildup Cameron creates is breathtaking. Just when you think boredom will set in, something happens and it isn't a simple alien jumping out at you either. Imagination is crucial here as we are forced to try and paint a picture in our own mind what is happening, only for Cameron to blow us away in the final third of the film with some of the greatest action sequences ever created. Another element that separates Aliens from other standard, cardboard sci-fi action movies is the emotional factor, which most movies have none of. Cameron includes a young girl taken under Ripley's wing to maintain audience emotional involvement the rest of the way through. What also sustains our involvement is the performance of Sigourney Weaver, perfectly cast as Ellen Ripley who maintains her tough exterior but isn't afraid to show her maternal side to the young girl.I really cannot praise this film enough. Sure, some will be turned off by the fact that the last half of this film is essentially one long action sequence that is very violent and over-the-top. However, I praise Cameron for doing this mainly for two reasons it is extremely well- done, and it never loses steam. So many other movies of this genre are poorly made, unable to have any sort of staying power in terms of its suspense and excitement and by the end essentially give up altogether if only to wrap up the film. Cameron is so far beyond what directors like Roland Emmerich are capable of it's not funny. His films demand to be seen, enjoyed and repeated. Aliens is no exception and for my money, stands just behind 2001 A Space Odyssey as the greatest science fiction film ever made.

While the first relied more on quiet tension and dark corners to introduce its horror, this sequel starts out as such with no aliens even making an appearance until after the first hour. After that though, it's all war.This is the sixth James Cameron film I have seen and his talent continues to amaze and astound me with every movie I watch. His vision is so unique, so ambitious that even if the story is less than impressive (a la Avatar), I cannot deny the incredible attention to detail and outstanding production designs implemented in this film. The buildup Cameron creates is breathtaking. Just when you think boredom will set in, something happens and it isn't a simple alien jumping out at you either. Imagination is crucial here as we are forced to try and paint a picture in our own mind what is happening, only for Cameron to blow us away in the final third of the film with some of the greatest action sequences ever created. Another element that separates Aliens from other standard, cardboard sci-fi action movies is the emotional factor, which most movies have none of. Cameron includes a young girl taken under Ripley's wing to maintain audience emotional involvement the rest of the way through. What also sustains our involvement is the performance of Sigourney Weaver, perfectly cast as Ellen Ripley who maintains her tough exterior but isn't afraid to show her maternal side to the young girl.I really cannot praise this film enough. Sure, some will be turned off by the fact that the last half of this film is essentially one long action sequence that is very violent and over-the-top. However, I praise Cameron for doing this mainly for two reasons it is extremely well- done, and it never loses steam. So many other movies of this genre are poorly made, unable to have any sort of staying power in terms of its suspense and excitement and by the end essentially give up altogether if only to wrap up the film. Cameron is so far beyond what directors like Roland Emmerich are capable of it's not funny. His films demand to be seen, enjoyed and repeated. Aliens is no exception and for my money, stands just behind 2001 A Space Odyssey as the greatest science fiction film ever made.

Blazing Saddles stands every convention and cliché in the corral on their respective heads and then gives the genre a boot in the butt. Were you to start watching this western satire and not realize that it was a crude, rude, lowbrow comedy with lots of one-liners, vaudeville routines, campy shticks, sight gags, dopey imitations and comic anachronisms, you might either be appalled or outraged by the intolerance toward African-Americans, minorities in general, and homosexuality. Indeed, when Blazing Saddles came out in 1974, during the heyday of blaxploitation cinema--you know Shaft and Super Fly--use of the derogatory epithet N-word still wasn't considered as politically insensitive as in our current multi-cultural society. Moreover, the epithet faggot was used, too. Brooks has said that his lowest common denominator western spoof truly broke ground, and it broke wind. Mind you, the administrative suits at the studios cringed at the racial degradations as well as the wind-breaking campfire scene where cowboy consume copious quantities of baked beans and break wind. One studio executive wanted Brooks to eliminate this scene and the scene where Alex Karras knocks the horse down, but Brooks refused. Initially, even Brooks had some misgivings about the campfire scene and approach studio executive John Calley who advised him to 'ring the bell.' The campfire scene didn't alienate audiences, and Blazing Saddles emerged as one of the top cinematic box office hits of 1974. Basically, a quintet of scribes, including Brooks and future comic superstar Richard Pryor, appropriate the empire building plot about the evil railroad out to destroy a town in its way. The railroad runs into quicksand and their nefarious boss Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman of The April Fools) decides to destroy the town of Rock Ridge to obtain the right-of-way without paying a dime. Hedley dreams up a surefire scheme, If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge that his very appearance would drive them out of town. He persuades the incredulous Governor William J. Lepetomane (Mel Brooks) to appoint an African-American railroad laborer Bart (Cleavon Little of Vanishing Point) as an all white town's new sheriff. Brooks and company couldn't have made this oater at a better time!One of the railway laborers, Bart, gets into trouble when Taggart (Slim Pickens of Dr. Strangelove) dispatches him and a friend to take a hand car down the line to investigate the presence of quicksand. Indeed, the rails have been laid in quicksand because Bart and his friend sink into the stuff. The railroad foreman pulls the hand car out of the quicksand and leaves Bart and his buddy to die. Bart climbs out of the quagmire and wraps a shovel around Taggart's head. This insolence lands Bart in jail with a date for the executioner, until Hedley decides that he has a better use for him. Indeed, Hedley realizes that he is breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience when he comes up with his scheme. Why am I asking you? He turns away from the camera and heads off to see Governor Lepetomane. As upset as Lepetomane is about Bart becoming the new sheriff of Rock Ridge, Hedley spins the situation so that it appeals to the governor. Yes, he assures Lepetomane about the egalitarian message it will send to one and all about his liberality, the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff. Of course, Lepetomane believes that he can only reap the worst of a bad situation. Hedley struggles to convince him that Lepetomane will win a place in history alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln with his appointment of Bart as the Rock Ridge lawman. A pimped out looking Bart in a leather suit rides a horse with Gucci saddle bags. He rides by Count Basie and his orchestra on the plains as he heads to Rock Ridge. Meanwhile, the dutiful citizens of Rock Ridge have prepared a reception for the arrival of their new sheriff. No, they do not know that he is black. Gabby Johnson (Jack Starrett of Kid Blue), a send-up of perennial western character actor Gabby Hayes, spots Bart riding into town and tries to warn his fellow citizens that Bart is an African-American. A bell cuts Gabby off every time that he says the N-word, and everybody believes Gabby is saying, The sheriff is near. The townspeople are appalled when they see Bart. Bart ascends the platform and states, By the power invested in me by the honorable William J. Lepetomane, I hereby assume the duties of the office of sheriff in and for the township of Rock Ridge. Not surprisingly, everybody pulls a gun on Bart and Bart imitates them by pulling his own gun on himself. The whites put down this revolvers and Bart admires his talent. Later, at a town meeting, the citizens complain about Bart. Harriett Johnson (Carol Arthur of Making It) sums up the sentiments of everybody, The white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge wish to express our extreme displeasure with your choice of sheriff. Please remove him immediately! Indeed, the only friend that Bart has in Rock Ridge is a prisoner hanging upside down his jail cell. Jim (Gene Wilder of Bonnie and Clyde) surprises Bart when he identifies himself as 'the Waco Kid.' He had the fastest hands in the west, an incredulous Bart observes. Jim adds, . . . the world. One day a six-year kid shot Jim in the butt and Jim turned into an alcoholic. Brooks directs Blazing Saddles like a situation comedy.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"25 May 2010","score":"","review":" As the trailer so often says, it's one of the coldest performances you'll ever see. Robert De Niro makes a very terrifying character that you feel could burst at any time. Director Martin Scorsese makes a truly enigmatic main character here. It is New york through a nighttime taxi driver. He sees the worlds dark side, he sees the crime and the corruption, and he's fed up with it. People are shallow and ignore the worlds dark side, and the politicians only give false hope. When he then meets a twelve year old prostitute, he decides to take matters in his own hands.Scorses creates the perfect dark tone for the film, and De Niro completes it with his chilling performance. It's a very blunt film, which isn't afraid of showing us the world as it really is. It's extremely authentic and being a film from the 70's I admire Scorses for the tremendous research he must have done for this film. Pluss he himself have a cameo in the film, as one of the many scum of the earth (as De Niro calls them) that enters our taxi drivers taxi.

A big part of why I love this movie is because I grew up on it. I loved Eddie Murphy as a kid. Whether he's a brilliant actor or not, or whether or not the majority of his movies are very good, he has an energy completely apart from a movie itself. He's simply Eddie, in the face of whatever his characters' adversities are. But this isn't the reason I still love this movie as an adult. Watching now, I'm seeing a sharply written fish-out-of-water story---a clever insight into how a character behaves out of his element---masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster star vehicle.It opens with a way-over-the-top chase between a huge semi-truck and various Keystone-like squadcars, which would be exciting if it didn't function primarily as a Pointer Sisters music video. Neutron Dance is the foreground of this set-piece, not the imagery it's scoring. We're dancing in our seats instead of gripping them. Still, the film's beginning is also drenching us in the utter grittiness of urban Detroit. While also essentially a music video for The Heat is On, the opening credits sequence is comprised of naturalistic, documentary street scenes of real people, housing developments, smokestacks, etc. At the same time the film-making is glitzy and commercial with its soundtrack and obligatory set-pieces, it's truly impressive how it absorbs us in one environment and then, by the end, has completely entrenched us in another one worlds apart.We meet Axel in action, in character undercover, wearing a smart-ass shell when he shows his face at the station after such a disaster, following in the tradition of reckless cops winning scorn from their superiors, in this case a scene-stealing performance by Gil Hill as his no-nonsense boss Inspector Todd. We then see Axel take in a surprise visit from his childhood friend Mikey, who's broken into his apartment, raided his fridge, proceeding to show him some suspicious bearer bonds. Axel doesn't care, doesn't want to know, just happy to see his old pal. We learn that Axel wasn't always into serving and protecting, and although Mikey now has a job as a security guard out in Beverly Hills, Mikey still isn't. This is the reason the night doesn't end so well for Mikey, as well as why Axel finds himself conning his way through Beverly Hills, ostensibly on vacation but really working as an effective cop with the instincts of a street-smart criminal.This is very funny, because essentially the movie's premise is composed of a foul-mouthed inner-city cop showing clean-cut, by-the-book veterans how to catch a killer. We know who had Mikey snuffed as soon as we're introduced to him, which is correct, because what the movie's all about is how the strict bureaucracy and elite judicial system protect the biggest criminals. The culprit here is Victor Maitland, a sophisticated millionaire, one of the most respected art dealers in the country. He's also involved in a complex smuggling operation and ordering hits on little people who take more than they earn just as he does, like Mikey, and gets away with it because Beverly Hills' finest, the customs house, his manufacturers, all do just what they're told, nothing more. The more time we spend with Axel in Beverly Hills, the more we realize the cultural inducements that allow Maitland the luxury of being above even ballpark suspicion. Whenever\/however Axel follows his detective instincts to Maitland, he's breaking rules, charged with felonies, in positions where he must fool everybody, until finally the Beverly Hills police are so jarred from their robotic procedure, and of course inclined to think like detectives, that reason takes over Why would this exotic cop, this foul-mouthed jerk from outta town be so persistent at all this if he didn't have reason to believe something's really up?Indeed, the movie doesn't paint Axel's unlikely cohorts as mean, ignorant, snobbish. We love these guys. In their own contrasting way, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as Taggart and Rosewood are equally funny, perhaps even more so in some scenes, as Murphy is as Foley. And they're better than he is at adopting the gravity of less comical scenes, which makes their Laurel and Hardy relationship more complex and inspired. At any rate, these three are responsible for improvising much of their dialogue, even creating whole scenes, like the supercop bit, the red-meat-in-the-bowels, bringing an inimitable chemistry to their trio. While Ronny Cox is awesome in sinister roles like in RoboCop, he plays Lieutenant Bogomil not as an uptight jerk of a superior, just firm about enforcing regulations; he's got a boss too, and hangs his head and sucks up in his presence like Taggart and Rosewood do in his.And as I said, it's great on a pure entertainment level. There are actually lots of great bit performances. There's Bronson Pinchot's memorable Serge, an effeminate European art salesman, basically the first person Axel meets in Beverly Hills. Murphy's subdued reaction to Pinchot is correct. A Martin Lawrence or Chris Tucker would've probably submerged the scene in some bombastic repulsion, but Murphy's persona in its heyday was much more graceful and well-timed than that. There's also the great veteran character actor Jonathan Banks as Maitland's thug, so matter-of-fact and stone-cold, especially when he pulls the trigger on Mikey. Oh, and Paul Reiser as the fly buzzing around Axel early on at the Detroit precinct. And the soundtrack, including obviously the immortal Faltermeyer synth melody, does give the movie an upbeat energy, though I do have my complaints. It's a real movie about the underdog in the rich man's world, and a ceaselessly entertaining one.
