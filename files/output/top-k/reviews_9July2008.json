I bought it as soon as I could - and in fact still own it on VHS!! I have a degree in history, with medieval Britain and Europe my special interest, yet despite this film's historical inaccuracy, I still love it.The plot is not original, yet the film works because the cast are so vibrant, so obviously having fun, and they utterly inhabit their characters. The dialogue is hilarious and touching (sometimes simultaneously) and the rock music soundtrack works astonishingly well in this setting. Heath Ledger was the biggest name in this film when it came out, and he is a superb lead, but the rest of the cast are also excellent. Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide wonderful and absolutely hilarious support as the closest friends of Ledger's character, William Thatcher, a peasant boy who seizes an unlikely chance to change his stars and become a knight. Laura Fraser is likewise great as the blacksmith who joins their little band after fixing William's armour. Rufus Sewell is a very good villain, suitably posturing and nasty, and although you don't loathe him entirely, his downfall is extremely satisfying. Shannyn Sossaman is perhaps the weakest of the leads but she is still a credible romantic interest. One of my favourite characters is Edward, the Black Prince, who has relatively little screen time (in fact, he appears in disguise for some of it) but who is nevertheless very well portrayed by James Purefoy. My favourite character, however, is Geoffrey Chaucer, played by Paul Bettany, of whom I am something of a fan, mainly due to this film. He is hilarious, clever and witty, and his speeches as he announces William at tournaments are amongst the finest moments in the film. This movie should not work, but Brian Helgeland has somehow managed to create a wonderful, enjoyable, funny film, with great action, brilliant characters and excellent dialogue. I never tire of watching it and hope I never will.

This leaves Keaton at home to take care of the kids and house. This is a film I use to watch countless times when I was little because it seemed it was showing up on HBO at least twice a day. I hadn't watched the movie in at least twenty years before this viewing and it held up well for me even though it's clear that it's certainly not a masterpiece or anything too special. The screenplay by John Hughes is pretty light from start to finish but the majority of the humor works thanks to the performance by Keaton. Keaton comes off very likable and he handles to the change from family man to coach potato very well and he manages several laughs. The best moments are when Keaton becomes obsessed with soap operas, which include a very fun dream sequence.

It's absolutely brilliant from start to finish, mainly due to the excellent direction of John Glen and beautiful score by Bill Conti. One of my major attractions to the film is the soundtrack, which I believe to be Conti's best work since Rocky. The early 80's mixture of jazz and classic tones makes this soundtrack unforgettable.The film itself is eye-candy to any Bond fan. The locations in FYEO are some of the best we've seen in the franchise. The film spans from London, to Greece, to the beautiful Cortina in Italy.The opening sequence is one if the best of the series. We see Bond laying flowers at Tracy's grave, who we have barely heard of since OHMSS, followed by one of the best stunts in an opening scene. The chase is on when Bond is duped into getting into the Universal Exports helicopter by the unofficial Blofeld.Due to the failure of Moonraker, we see how down to earth FYEO is when it comes to plot and action. Although Moore is noticeably aged at this point, he pulls off the down to earth combination of style and substance with ease. Witty one liners and campy villains were left at the door as well. Let me make a point of saying that the Bond girl, Melina (Carole Bouquet), also added to the drastic change in style. Rather than being a useless sidekick used solely for Bond's pleasure, Melina added a grittiness to the plot that makes FYEO comparable to a Dalton film. Melina's back story with her father and the discovery of the St. Georges fuses amazingly with Bond's mission to recover the ATAC system.One of the major high points in FYEO, is not knowing who the actual villain is until the 2nd act of the movie. Aristotle Kristatos (played by the amazing Julian Glover) and Milos Columbo (Topol) play the perfect cold war rivals. By the latter half of the film, three of the major characters (Melina, Bond, and Kristatos) are all on the trail of Kristatos.The action sequences were intense and extremely climactic. Locque and Kriegler's pursuit of Bond on the ski slopes was nothing short of brilliant. Beginning high atop the ski-jump and commencing through the beautiful snowy mountain range, this sequence has gone down in the record books. One part of this scene that I always enjoy pointing out is when Bond ruthlessly places the ski pole on the branch of the tree, knowing the ultimate outcome. That is easily one of the most brutal deaths throughout the film.Who says Bond doesn't kill in cold blood? Emile Locque's death came as no surprise, but was pretty brutal. Preceding Locque's death, Bond says an unforgettable line You left this with Ferrara, I believe.. A line like this brilliantly sums up the theme of FYEO revenge The ending of FYEO is one scene that has every Bond fan on the edge of their seat. Beginning with Bond's ascent to Kristato's mountaintop hideaway in St. Cyrils, the climax already has us drawn in. While the premise is a classic Bond evasive tactic, it is unique in every possible way. Rather than bringing in backup and forcing Kristatos to surrender the ATAC by using air tactics, Bond climbs his way up the mountainside. The scene ends with Kriegler's well deserved 'drop off' and the death of Kristatos which was absolutely poetic.

I really don't know exactly what point John Waters was trying to get across with this; the film takes on a sort of sitcom style and mixes this with a barrage of filth, but there's no real point to the film other than simply showing how it's central characters live. The film is also really amateur and features no end of mistakes; yet in spite of this, Pink Flamingos is still a successful film as John Waters obviously wanted to disgust his audience, and the film certainly serves in doing that. Pink Flamingos focuses on the title 'The Filthiest Person Alive'. This is a title most people would want to avoid at all costs, but it's hotly contested in this film. The holder of this prestigious crown is a woman named Divine - murderer, thief and all round disgusting human being. She faces competition, however, from couple Raymond and Connie Marble, who believe that they are the filthiest people alive.Overall, I'd have to say that this film is not the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, but even so; it is pretty offensive. There are all sorts going on - from nudity (male, female and...errr...'other'), disgusting sex acts and nasty things being eaten. This is all brought up a level by the atmosphere - John Waters has created a truly sordid and filthy essence for his film, and just watching it is enough to make most people feel dirty. The cast is colourful to say the least and features drag queen and John Waters regular Divine at the helm.

It is a crime comedy that curious merges British humor (the Monty Python sensibility led by writer and actor John Cleese) and American humor (the over-the-top performance from Kevin Kline). Often times this works for some great laughs and other times it'll leave you a bit confused, but overall it's a fun movie with an unbelievable set of characters and a plot that only pushes these actors to do their best.The film plummets you right into the action as 4 strange individuals all collaborate to rob a bank of 20 Million in diamonds. When 2 of them, Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of the others, the double crossing, seduction and lying continues in the interest of the characters getting their hands on the diamonds and walking away.These characters are just terrific. Kevin Kline is every bit Oscar-worthy in his role as Otto, the eccentric, clueless, risk-taking,self-assertive criminal (but not stupid...) who thinks he knows best all the time. He stands out as one of the best character roles in a comedy of all time in this film and that's not overstating it. Jamie Lee Curtis, while you wouldn't think to be your first choice for a seductive, manipulating and completely self-absorbed criminal but she commands the attention her role requires so easily. Monty Python greats John Cleese and Michael Palin also add that distinct Monty Python brand humor to the film that makes it so unique. Cleese plays a lawyer that gets wrapped up in the double-crossing and Palin plays a stuttering, fish-loving, sympathizable sidekick. If you can't tell by now, let me reiterate that this comedy is all about the characters.The plot here is enough to keep the antics going and that's what good sketch comedy (which you'd expect from a John Cleese) does. It takes a bit for you to adjust to the humor, but once you get beyond the fact that they're not just being weird to be weird, there's a bit more too it, this film goes from being just okay to really enjoyable. While I think it could have done better in terms of a satisfying plot, it wasn't enough to keep the film from identifying itself primarily as an absurd, off-the-wall and over-the-top crime comedy. Don't expect flashy, slick slight of hand crime comedy here, just some really silly but unique laughs.

When 2 of them, Wanda and Otto (Curtis and Kline) turn in one of the others, the double crossing, seduction and lying continues in the interest of the characters getting their hands on the diamonds and walking away.These characters are just terrific. Kevin Kline is every bit Oscar-worthy in his role as Otto, the eccentric, clueless, risk-taking,self-assertive criminal (but not stupid...) who thinks he knows best all the time. He stands out as one of the best character roles in a comedy of all time in this film and that's not overstating it. Jamie Lee Curtis, while you wouldn't think to be your first choice for a seductive, manipulating and completely self-absorbed criminal but she commands the attention her role requires so easily. Monty Python greats John Cleese and Michael Palin also add that distinct Monty Python brand humor to the film that makes it so unique. Cleese plays a lawyer that gets wrapped up in the double-crossing and Palin plays a stuttering, fish-loving, sympathizable sidekick. If you can't tell by now, let me reiterate that this comedy is all about the characters.The plot here is enough to keep the antics going and that's what good sketch comedy (which you'd expect from a John Cleese) does. It takes a bit for you to adjust to the humor, but once you get beyond the fact that they're not just being weird to be weird, there's a bit more too it, this film goes from being just okay to really enjoyable. While I think it could have done better in terms of a satisfying plot, it wasn't enough to keep the film from identifying itself primarily as an absurd, off-the-wall and over-the-top crime comedy. Don't expect flashy, slick slight of hand crime comedy here, just some really silly but unique laughs.

The plot is kind of Taming of the Shrew, with Kate as a cowboy and Petruchio as a saloon singer, although Kate does the chasing and the taming is more of an uncalculated group effort. Like the best movies, it makes you laugh but develops into a story that is both deep and complex.This movie shows Marilyn's incredible acting skills in a way her more popular movies definitely don't. She's hilarious and adorable in the beginning, when Bo is pursuing her and she's trying to get away. At the end, she's completely convincing as she talks about her (back then) promiscuous past and how she feels Bo is better off without her because of it. Throughout, she shows that complete vulnerability that at times is uncomfortable to watch - it's like she has no barriers around her personality. Even in the funny parts, she seems like she could be squashed by the merest touch. No actress before or since has compared in this area.Don Murray is underrated in this movie. He plays an insensitive bulldozer who pursues Marilyn like she's one of the calves on his ranch, and a man who can be both tender and gentle, and is completely convincing in both roles. He's really obnoxious in the first role, but that's the whole point. Possibly he could have toned it down a LITTLE, but all in all, he does a great job. The chemistry between him and Marilyn is great - especially at the end, you totally believe they just can't keep away from each other.The rest of the cast is fine, with the bus depot operator Grace standing out - very funny woman. All in all, a great movie, and one that shows how much Marilyn was wasted in roles that only let her play an airheaded sexpot.

My answer is definitely! Here are adorable pig is seen with some new colourful friends, lots of them, in a new adventure. Just like the first one, this one too is sheer delight, albeit a little more serious. I don't understand why people are complaining that this isn't a movie for kids. Why not? I think it's an excellent family film. There is no death or blood. It portrays a part of reality (e.g. that accidents happen, that there are others who are less fortunate than us etc) without getting to graphic and that's why it's great for kids too. It's a lot of fun and even suspenseful. I was in my teens when I first saw this film. There's one scene where Flealick follows the van but one he loses hold, he slides onto one side of the street and lies there motionless while the wheels on his 'scooter' rotate. For a moment my heart had stopped beating (as I thought he was dead) and I was so hoping that he hadn't passed away. The sequence that followed brought me back to laughing mode. Magda Szubanski has more to do here and she displays her comic abilities brilliantly. A strange thing I noticed was she had an American accent in the first film but here it's Australian and British. The rest of the voice-acting is done very well and in sync. The fictitious city (it may be Sidney as the famous opera-house was visible in one scene) is suitably dark and mysterious. I found 'Babe Pig In The City' more uplifting than the first movie. I wish there was a third movie that would have made it a complete trilogy.

I think sometimes it's easy to forget the pure genius of Kubrick and to me this was the first of many masterpieces that he'd deliver throughout his career. On a technical level this film is flawless from start to finish and this is certainly one of the greatest movies in its genre. There are so many brilliant scenes here that it's really shocking that such a young and fresh director could come off with something like this. There are many memorable scenes in the film but I suppose to most famous ones are the tracking shots following various men inside the trenches. Kubrick keeps the camera in front of the men and tracks them as they walk and the atmosphere this effect brings to the screen hasn't been matched from any war film that I've seen. This technique really builds a strange and claustrophobic nature that puts you right there in the action and gives you a sense of how tight these quarters are. The actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesn't center on any one piece of the action going on. Instead the camera just floats as the men try to capture their target and the swooping camera really gives you a bigger feeling of the battle. This scene comes off remarkably well considering the budget Kubrick was working with. The film is incredibly powerful with its messages on war and humans and all of this comes together beautifully in the finale, which is very haunting and touching. I think what made Kubrick a genius of his craft was the fact that he had a lot of guts and it's easy to see this with the ending, which doesn't end in a typical way. The final song was something very tricky to pull off yet Kubrick does so wonderfully well and really hits a home run with the message. Finally, the film contains some of the greatest acting you're going to see in the film with Douglas leading the way as the Col. who then must turn defender to try and keep the three men alive. The restraint nature Douglas shows perfectly fits the character but when his rage finally explodes, there's really no one better at doing this type of acting. George Macredy really steals the film as the General who wants the men executed and really becomes one of the most hated villains in film history.

In a systematic coordinated attack right across America starting in Mexico allied Soviet & Cuban forces have invaded the US & World War III has begun. Brother's Jed (Patrick Swayze) & Matt Eckert (Charlie Sheen) along with several of their high school buddies manage to escape the initial invasion & make it to the relative safety of the Colorado mountains. With no option but to fight the teenagers take arms & wage their own personal war against the Soviet Cuban scum who have invaded their homeland & killed innocent Americans...Co-written & directed by avid gun collector & pro-gun activist John Milius one has to say that I really didn't think too much of this overly sentimental teenage action film. The script by Milius & Kevin Reynolds takes itself deadly seriously & is very pro the right to bear arms all the way, it says that the right of each American to own a gun is good because America is the land of the free & in the event of an attack by the Russians or any other evil superpower individual Americans will be able to defend themselves. I suppose Red Dawn tries to tap into the fears people had at the time, fears about Cummunism, about Russia, about World War III, about nuclear warfare, about increasing legislation in owning a gun which Red Dawn repeatedly says owning a gun is every American's God given right & the whole survivalist movement. The character's aren't great, there's the clichéd action film theme of ordinary people being thrust into an extraordinary situation & having to toughen-up & overcome the odds, you know the sort of thing I mean. Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart. The film never leaves the confines of the Colorado town either & I for one never really felt like the whole of the US was at war. At almost two hours it felt like it went on forever, the action isn't anything special & it's hard to believe a group of teenagers could take on & defeat a heavily armed platoon of highly trained soldiers. I read somewhere once that someone thought Red Dawn resembled The Goonies (1985) but with guns & rocket launchers which I think is actually quite an apt description.Director Milius nails his allegiances down here, there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which I found rather laughable. The scene of the teenagers listening to the radio & the American national anthem comes on to keep the nations spirits up is just so forced & cheap it's untrue. Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states, The Flamingo Kid (1984) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it. There is a fairly high body count & a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent & whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable. Amazingly the term 'Red Dawn' was the given code name for the military operation in Iraq that captured Saddam Hussein back in 2003!The film is well made with decent production values, the military vehicles & the like look very authentic I suppose & the New Mexico location shooting has some nice scenery. There are several sizable parts of the film which are subtitled. The acting is in my opinion very poor, the likes of Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen in his film debut, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Harry Dean Stanton & Powers Boothe are capable of much better than this & some of the performances are truly dire.Red Dawn is not a film that I can say I liked, it's pro-war pro-gun patriotic nonsense that has dated very badly & is a bit of a chore to sit through in one sitting.

Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing &#150; such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes &#150; that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).'In a decade when the Western was beginning to fall out of favour, many Italian directors decided to attempt their own interpretations of the genre, none more successfully than Sergio Leone. These Spaghetti Westerns dispensed with all respectability that the genre had once possessed, saturating the cinema screen with sweat, blood and smoke. His films are not particularly intellectual, but generations of audiences have delighted in the director's sheer enthusiasm for providing entertainment, and his Dollars trilogy is now regarded as a classic. 'For a Few Dollars More' was produced second in the loose trilogy, but, chronologically, its storyline is the last to take place. Clint Eastwood returned from his previous star-making performance as the enigmatic Man With No Name though he does, in fact, go by the title Monco, and Gian Maria Volontè is deliciously-evil as the ultimate bad guy, El Indio. Though I had fully expected Lee Van Cleef to be also playing a villain, Douglas Mortimer, a respected colonel-turned-bounty hunter, turned out to be a highly-reputable figure, and his performance is marked by a subtle humour that contrasts well with Eastwood's straight man.The film opens with an ominous intertitle where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared. These bounty-hunters turn out to be the film's heroes, and we can only watch in awe as Manco and Mortimer expertly go about their daily profession, tracking down wanted fugitives, swiftly murdering them (typically after offering an opportunity to defend themselves) and claiming the hefty reward. Beyond their grizzled exterior, each man has a very definite reason for their chosen line of work Monco wishes to amass enough money to retire somewhere quiet, and Mortimer is out to avenge the rape and death of his sister. But what happens when the two professional killers set their sights on the same target, perhaps the most lucrative prize of all? Will they decide to cooperate, or will they end up shooting each other in the back? There is a wonderful sequence where the two bounty-hunters match wits, progressively humiliating each other in a bizarre ritual that involves shooting the other man's hat. Also watch out for Klaus Kinski, in that psycho mode that only he could play to perfection.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"9 July 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" No one will ever know what really happened aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht on that fateful weekend in 1924. Director Peter Bogdanovich recreates it based on rumors in The Cat's Meow, a 2001 film starring Kirsten Dunst, Edward Herrmann, Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard, Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly. The weekend in question is a celebration of producer Thomas Ince's birthday aboard Hearst's yacht with a guest roster that included Hearst, Marion Davies, Ince, his mistress, Margaret Livingston, Louella Parsons, writer Elinor Glyn, Charlie Chaplin and others. Thomas Ince was removed from the yacht, supposedly ill, and died in his home several days later, supposedly of heart failure. Rumor has it that Hearst, suspecting an affair between Davies and Charlie Chaplin, shot Ince by accident, either mistaking him for Chaplin or because Ince happened to be on the dock at the same time and got in the line of fire. Morning newspapers (not Hearst papers) claimed that Ince had been shot; the evening papers did not carry that story, nor did the Hearst papers. No one who was on board the yacht ever spoke of the incident except in the most ambiguous of ways. Louella Parsons' column became syndicated in over 600 papers, and she worked for Hearst until she retired; Ince's mistress Livingston received a whopping increase in salary. She finally retired to manage her husband Paul Whiteman's band.That's the story Bogdanovich goes with, and it makes for a meandering but intriguing story. The meandering part is not so much a fault of the film but done on purpose - it's a weekend yacht party, after all, and Bogdanovich shows us the parties, the conversations and the intrigues of various guests. He captures the atmosphere of the '20s and the splendor of Hearst's yacht very well.It's hard to say how accurate the actors were with their characterizations; for my part, I don't know what Charlie Chaplin, Hearst, Glyn or Parsons were really like. From seeing Marion Davies in films and in photographs, Dunst seems too young, though her acting is good. Herrmann I suspect captures Hearst beautifully - powerful, a good host, a sometimes brutal man and very much in love with Marion. (When he saw Citizen Kane, believing that Susan Alexander was based on Marion, he was most upset at the portrayal of Susan as a drunk.) Tilly plays Parsons as if she was an airhead - I believe externally in real life, Parsons did come off as a silly, ineffectual woman, all the better to gain your confidence; in fact, she was an ambitious person who wielded a lot of power. Tilly captures this; in her last scene, Parsons gets down to business and drops a lot of her act. Lumley's Elinor Glyn is elegant, intelligent and more of an observer (she narrates the film) - I suspect that is true as well. Cary Elwes doesn't register much as Ince, who is portrayed as a desperate man trying to get his career back on track with Hearst's help.Eddie Izzard's Chaplin is problematic. Physically he seems all wrong - Chaplin was quite good-looking and much slighter than Izzard; Izzard hints at a British accent but doesn't really come off as very British or very graceful, which Chaplin definitely was. The writing of this character may be incorrect as well, as it's doubtful that Chaplin would have actually wanted Marion to leave Hearst.All in all, though it's not an edge of your seat kind of film, The Cat's Meow is a good film about a fascinating piece of Hollwyood lore. It seems likely that Ince did not die of indigestion, heart failure, or suicide, but that something did happen and the guests were sworn to silence; it's also more than likely that the police and DA cooperated in covering it up. There is an interesting sidebar to this story - Davies' secretary Abigail Kinsolving, was considered a suspect in Ince's death (strange, since he supposedly died of heart failure). She claimed to have been raped by Ince, and it was noted by guests on the yacht that she had bruises on her body. She had a baby some months later and died in a car accident near San Simeon. Two suspicious things there she was found by Hearst bodyguards, and there was a suicide note that wasn't in her handwriting. Her orphaned daughter was supported by Marion Davies. Did Kinsolving know too much? Whether she did or not, the rest of us know too little.

Tilly captures this; in her last scene, Parsons gets down to business and drops a lot of her act. Lumley's Elinor Glyn is elegant, intelligent and more of an observer (she narrates the film) - I suspect that is true as well. Cary Elwes doesn't register much as Ince, who is portrayed as a desperate man trying to get his career back on track with Hearst's help.Eddie Izzard's Chaplin is problematic. Physically he seems all wrong - Chaplin was quite good-looking and much slighter than Izzard; Izzard hints at a British accent but doesn't really come off as very British or very graceful, which Chaplin definitely was. The writing of this character may be incorrect as well, as it's doubtful that Chaplin would have actually wanted Marion to leave Hearst.All in all, though it's not an edge of your seat kind of film, The Cat's Meow is a good film about a fascinating piece of Hollwyood lore. It seems likely that Ince did not die of indigestion, heart failure, or suicide, but that something did happen and the guests were sworn to silence; it's also more than likely that the police and DA cooperated in covering it up. There is an interesting sidebar to this story - Davies' secretary Abigail Kinsolving, was considered a suspect in Ince's death (strange, since he supposedly died of heart failure). She claimed to have been raped by Ince, and it was noted by guests on the yacht that she had bruises on her body. She had a baby some months later and died in a car accident near San Simeon. Two suspicious things there she was found by Hearst bodyguards, and there was a suicide note that wasn't in her handwriting. Her orphaned daughter was supported by Marion Davies. Did Kinsolving know too much? Whether she did or not, the rest of us know too little.

But this movie is absolutely terrible! So bad in fact, that it makes you wonder why this movie was messed up.The plot of the movie was terrible. After meaningless atomic bomb test on the South Pacific, a creature attacks a ship in the Panama Canal, I think. After being hired to investigate the matter, scientist Nick Tatopolous jumps to conclusion that it must of been a giant lizard created from those pointless explosions, and we know who he is. Godzilla makes his way to New York City and causes mahatma there, so he has to be defeated. Now it sounds simple, but they over-dumbed it by putting in stupid news reporter story stuff. We have an issue about news reporting with characters we're not fully introduce to. It seems like a strange complaint but the news issue was too long. It tended to drag on from 20 to 30 minutes, while I was waiting for another scene with Godzilla which is a little short and not really exciting.All the characters were laughable and unlikable. A example is Mayor Ebert and his aide, Gene (which is really insulting to Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel). The effects will not blow you away and the action scenes are not fun at all. So what could director Roland Emmerich do to make this movie even worse then putting stupid characters, lumpy effects, and boring action scenes? How about messing up Godzilla's design which ends up not looking like Godzilla at all. I couldn't believe how badly they screw up Godzilla's look in the movie. The producers put in the laziest opening sequence I have ever seen. I think they knew they were making a bad movie so they didn't care. All I saw were lizards and explosions which is kind of hard to figure out.The last and big complaint I have is the movie contains no references to the original Godzilla movies, aside from the name and roar, and doesn't have the Godzilla spirit. This could've been a great movie, if the script and Godzilla's design were faithful to the original Godzilla movies.The bottom line is Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made the Godzilla movie all a disaster! The movie will bore and disappoint Godzilla fans.Do not buy this movie, do not watch this movie, do not even look at this movie. It's a sin that this movie was even made.

Also, for anyone who has ever listened to modern music and wondered where the world was going to, Dan Akroyd's motivational speech is something to behold.

I rather enjoyed the opening theme by Duran Duran, even though I strongly disliked the visual aspect of it.Easily one of the worst Bond films in history, AVTAK accomplished the same thing that Connery and Brosnan's last films did for them.With Moore now into his late 50's, we see that he should have called it quits with Octopussy or even For Your Eyes Only. The films starts off with one of the absolute worst sequences with Bond 'snow surfing' to the song of California Girls. I would ask the producers what they were thinking when they decided to have an almost 60 year old looking Bond try to pull off stunts that most 30 year old can't pull off, but I'm sure they are thinking that already. Also, where is the classic Bond score during a scene like this??? What an abomination. I would discuss Bond's escape into a miniature submarine disguised as an iceberg, but I would rather not have you think about it.I won't go into great detail concerning the plot, because I feel like it isn't even worth mentioning. With some Bond films I can easily say that the plot was a great idea, but poorly conceived. This is not one of those times. The plot is extremely choppy, campy, and drags in almost every scene. From beginning to end I kept thinking to myself 1) Is it really getting this much worse? 2) How is it possible that they messed up a Bond movie like this after two great films back-to-back? The climax, or lack there of, was short and completely loony. Watching 57 year old Moore playing Bond in some of the most overblown stunts in the franchise's history was more than laughable. I was more than happy when the credits started to roll.Even though Christopher Walken is a great actor, he played one of the worst Bond villains. He mannerisms and overall appearance were frustrating and ill-timed. Grace Jones, while quite gritty in AVTAK, ended up falling short as well. The one thing that prevents me from watching this movie entirely anymore, is Tanya Roberts as Stacey Hutton. Again, why would the producers allow the footage that they shot of her to even enter into a theater? Her constant shrieking and crying is worse than that of a 2 year old.
