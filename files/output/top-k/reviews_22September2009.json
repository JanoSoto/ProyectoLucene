[{"date":"22 September 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Once again we find two of Los Angeles' daring cops Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)for another epic action romp complete with the car chases, witty dialogue, and death-defying stunts while keeping up the tradition from the other three instalments. In one of the rare moments where Riggs and Murtaugh spend a quiet moment fishing in the lake along with their sidekick Leo Getz (Joe Pesci, who is now a detective as well), realize that their tranquillity is about to come to a close as a rusty old ship happens to make its way and illegal Chinese civilians pass them by. Next thing you know, the we find the cops feuding with these Chinese thugs with old Uncle Bennie(Kim Chan) as their leader and a powerful violence-happy hoodlum (Jet Li) whose passive ways through danger is absolutely staggering. There is some subplot about Murtagh taking immigrants into custody and another family taken in by gangsters, but the action unlike the other three instalments doesn't have the same appeal as it starts to become predictable and at times loses its meaning.One of the more surreal scenes, we see Riggs dragging down the freeway, perched on top of a kitchen table in Murtaugh's car as though he was in a lake doing water-skiing while being attached on some kitchen foil. Of course he's still in one piece with no harm done, and successfully still manages to spew out a few wise-cracks on the way. With more illogical scenes, we find the car crashing through an office building and coming out the other side and the car still has enough composure to successfully make it to the freeway as the chase progresses. I hope no was hurt or killed while all this chaos was happening. I'm not trying to be arrogant here, if you still enjoy the same formula that made the Lethal Weapon franchise a hit I say the more power to you. I just think that at this point in time, the forth instalment offers nothing new and is starting to run low on batteries. The other three movies were very good and I liked how they flowed through the story, but in Lethal Weapon IV, there are no more new ideas and we can tell that Gibson and Glover are starting to get on in age here.

Pryor I think really understood what Death Wish was really all about. In the early 70's starting with Sweet Sweatbacks Badass Song, until about 74, the so called black exploitation films catered to a black audience wanting to see a black superhero killing bad white guys.While Dirty Harry showed Harry shooting black bank robbers, (a first at that time), and Roger Moore as James Bond taking on a black crime syndicate led my Yaphet Kotto (A film with its tongue in its cheek) Death Wish really takes on black on white crime head on. Yes, Kersey's wife and daughter are murdered and brutally raped respectively by white criminals, 6 of the 10 criminals that Kersey kills in Death Wish are black. When at a party someone comments that the vigilante killer is mostly killing black people, a party goer remarks that mostly blacks commit crimes.Having white criminals in the film, was I think mainly used to hide the films response to white resentment and possible fear of the black man as criminal. Growing up in the Bay Area in the 70's I remember the Zebra Killings, and other murders that seemed to be occurring by blacks on whites. In Death Wish, the white criminals are mostly shown to be possibly crazy, and maybe hooked on drugs, while the black criminals are somewhat shown to be more calculating. Having white baddies in the film allowed the film not to be considered racist. Also it was mentioned in the newspapers and on TV that black audiences were also cheering Bronson killing muggers, though when I saw this film in Berkeley California, I don't remember such cheering, though their were African Americans in the audience.Watching Death Wish Many years later, I realized what a cartoonish and silly film it is, much like the Sweet Sweatback Bad Ass Song, if not more polished. Sad it some way, that Bronson's role as Paul Kersey would be the film he would be most famous for in the US, and not his role as Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in The West, or even his other Bronson-Winner collaboration The Mechanic. Yet Death Wish is an interesting film as propaganda. At one time, the idea was to have Henry Fonda in the film. Sadly, I think the film would have been different, but wow, if the film had been with Fonda, in the same form it is now, what would Jane have said?

So after the classic, much appreciated 'The Shawshank Redemption', he chose a fantasy Prison story based on the novel of Stephen King (Once again) as his next venture. The story occurs in flashback which is narrated by an old man in a old age home. The old man narrates his story that goes back to the 1930's when he was 40 and the head Prison Guard of a section of the Prison called 'The Green Mile'. In The Green Mile those prisoners are kept who have been given the death sentence and would be send to the electric chair after some days. One fine day, the 'Green Mile' has a new prisoner who is enormous in size (Almost like an Adult Grizzly Bear Standing Up) and who has been given the death sentence for killing and raping two small girls. As time passes by, the prison guards come to know that this prisoner has got some magical healing powers and he actually has not committed the crime after all. Tom Hanks as the head Prison Guard has given his patent restrained performance. The three actors who impressed me were Michael Duncan playing the enormous prisoner, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison. Overall, the only flaw of this movie is that it is 3 hours long ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Frank Darabont seems to be very much obsessed with Prison, Prison Guards and Prisoner's stories.

Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwynneth Paltrow are superb, as is the surprise appearance of the serial killer in the story -- I won't name him and spoil anything for he is not identified until the final credits even though you will recognize him immediately once you finally see him towards the end of the film. The cinematography is excellent, heightening the suspense all through the film. The musical score again fits perfectly, my only complaint being sometimes it's loud enough to muffle dialog you really want to hear clearly. Other than that, a fine -- if blood-curdling -- film.
