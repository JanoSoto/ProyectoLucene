[{"date":"12 December 2012","score":"","review":" I like the history of Britain. I should thank first of all to this movie that it made me search and learn more about the famous Golden Age, the most promising Queen that Britan ever had that brought them not only an economical strenght but also led Britan to have one of the most powerful battle navy in history at that time. It was very entertaining for me to learn about those things giving the fact that we didn't learn about this in school yet and I don't think we will learn very soon.But what I have to criticize about this movie it's it lack of showing those important things, concentrating the plot more on silly events that probably didn't even occurred, transforming all what would have been a good movie in a pathetic, dull at some points story. They focused the story on Elizabeth's feelings and how she manages to exceed in becoming a good queen. That's a very fine thing for sure, because everybody wonders sometimes how those people lived. But again, we can never be sure that the queen really had an affair with Robert Dudley and didn't die a virgin as she pretends. Remember that she was the most successful monarch that Britain ever had in that century that gossips couldn't have missed. Showing the affair in the movie didn't bother me, though.Another thing that bothered me it's the constant idea that it's implemented from time to time, that Walsingham helped Elizabeth in almost 80% of her reign to succeed, otherwise she would have been destroyed. I have a history book, and when I read about Elizabeth's reign I was completely shocked that it didn't even mentioned Walsingham at least once. From that and from what I have further read and searched it seemed Walsingham's role was over shown in this movie only for Geoffrey Rush. I don't want to be misunderstood for this. Walsingham, had of course a lot of influence and helped Elizabeth a lot granted for his experience in politics, but I think that he had a much larger role in the movie thanks to Mr. Rush. Elizabeth was a strong woman that fought for Britain's reputations and for her people, and I think that, while she sure received some help from Walsingham, she wasn't that helpless and not aware of the danger that surrounded her.Anyway, those are my opinions regarding the history. Not necessary about how the movie really is. It was a good movie, with a good cast, a bit dark but that's what makes it good. But, again, something to say against, I don't think that Cate Blanchett was a good choice. I like how she expresses her authority in some scenes, I really like that side of her Elizabeth, but most of the movie, until she realizes the gravity of the situation, she acts a bit childish. Maybe it's not Cate's fault it's the plot. But she acted great nonetheless. Geoffrey Rush is great as Walsingham, he delivered a great performance. As for Joseph Fiennes, well, he seems like he has only a way of acting. The way he acted in Shakespeare in love he acted here as well. With some differences of course, but he didn't impressed me.All in all it's a good movie. Not as wow as everyone else praise, but still very good and worth watching.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 December 2012","score":"","review":" I like the history of Britain.

And most certainly NOT AN 7 Oscars worthy one! They totally wasted those nominations on this thing! Sure, the acting was good and funny, but it's not a 7 Oscar worthy movie. The movie is funny, is interesting as seen from the perspective of the famous Shakespeare life, but good grace, people need to look more wide at the screen. It transmitted nothing to me. It was almost like a musical at some points. It's amazing how Oscars pop up when actresses begin to take their clothes off and the movie is rated R for sexuality. Gwyneth Paltrow was naked half of this movie. And those passion scenes were so unrealistic and pathetic that they really bored me. And it's too long! I felt like it was never going to end already after an hour of viewing. Geoffrey Rush got nominated for this piece of waste for best supporting actor and he didn't even won. He should have been nominated for best supporting actor in Les miserables and he surely would have won. But as I said those at the Academy Awards were so blind that I won't waste my words anymore for them.I'm not saying it's a terrible movie. Not at all. Watch it people, but it's not a 7 Oscars worthy. And not even a 7,2 rated movie. It's way, way overrated. Put a couple Oscars more and it reaches Gone with the wind! How in God's name would this sound? It's really pathetic. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress and I love her, but this movie didn't suit her. I don't like Joesph Fiennes. He acts like a macho, not an actor, in Elizabeth he acted the same way. He is not the actor that everyone praise, his brother Ralph is way more talented and has a lot more potential. Anyway, as a viewer I was disappointed.

Never ever in my life I have been so mesmerized by a movie in the way this one did to me. This is the movie of my life, a masterpiece, a perfect movie that warms your hearth and changes you as a person if you allow it. In a good manner. This movie also made me read the books. I love this story so much that I will build myself with patience and even go to see the new musical, for which I don't have the high expectations everyone has right now but I'm not going to criticize either. I will go for the story. For the wonderful story of Jean Valijean and Javert. I don't care about the differences. There are always going to be differences, between a movie and a book, but that doesn't matter. The message matters. The message that carries what we all should do more in our life be a better person than others, be able to forgive and give up hating. This is what really matters and a true Les miserables fan will notice and follow that. As for the cast I have no words. Liam Neeson IS Jean Valijean! He's the perfect Jean Valijean that the world will have on screen, no matter what some others say. Geoffrey Rush IS the one and only Javert. He IS and WILL always be the one and only person that could portray the fanatic, perfectionist and twisted Javert. He is the only person by now that could pull all this emotions together and give this perfect performance. If the Academy Awards wouldn't have been so blind at the edition and toss around the Oscars with no sense as they did and would have notice more carefully the wonderful performance of those two the Oscars would have been now at their rightfully owners. But I don't care. For me and for others as well they are the best from that year. Not Elizabeth, NOT Shakespeare in love, THIS! Uma Thurman and Claire Danes are the most talented (especially Danes) Fantine and Cosette. Claire Danes will always be Cosette for me. She was the most sweet person in the movie.

When the second Sarah Connor died I would think that the police would try and bring in the remaining Sarah for protection.

And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime.Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general.The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes.The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones).Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera.The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order.Other than that - well worth a watch....7\/10.

For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera.The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order.Other than that - well worth a watch....7\/10.

Understandable because this is definitely the weakest one in the series, but it is one of those movies that I like but everyone else hates. Does this movie have flaws? Yes, but that doesn't mean that you still can't enjoy it.The film starts as Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif is rebuilt again(which you think they would've learned after the first two movies) 8 years after the events of Child's Play 2. He is raging mad and wants to find where Andy is. It turns out Andy now played by Justin Whalin has been sent to a military camp to straighten him out after his killer doll story. One night Chucky comes across a young boy named Tyler played by Jeremy Sylvers and Chucky decides that instead of chasing after Andy again, he can transfer his soul into Tyler who is friends with Andy.The problems with the film. The first being the doll effects which I consider to be the weakest of the franchise and thankfully they were vastly improved in 1998's Bride Of Chucky. The second being the acting which feels very stale with Whalin. He doesn't have the charm that Alex Vincent had in the first two movies. The third and final one being the tone of the film. This film is very dark compared to the first two. Now the second film went about 10% darker than the first but knew it's limits. Here they go full force especially the last 15 minutes which take place in a carnival. This film was the sort of start of making the films more of a horror comedy.The good of the movie. The first being the voice acting of Brad Dourif which I have praised before and I am going to praise again. he is just that good however he is best in Child's Play and Bride Of Chucky. He is the perfect one for the role and should be nominated for an award for his voice work which I am surprised has not happened... yet.The next are two things. The first is that the doll effects sometimes can manage to be creepy and scary when a scene calls for it. Next we have the army setting which I find very clever that Chucky is running around an army camp and I really do like that his main focus is not his main priority which is good at least for me because if Andy was portrayed by Alex Vincent again I would be saying the exact opposite.Lastly we have the climax which is, like the last film is the best part of the film. The climax takes place inside of a carnival, specifically in a haunted house ride which actually takes apart of Chucky's skin and has a very bloody look on his face. Effective, yes. Realistic, no.The Final Verdict for the film Child's Play 3 is 3 Stars Out Of 4. The film has good effects, great voice work and a cool climax but is held back by stale acting by Whalin, and too much of a dark tone.

Well, it seems that this started out as a Hollywood Films Disney movie which was intended to be more like a Christmas Vacation-style film with more adult humor and still has a few inappropriate lines and comments, here and there. It became Disneyfied.Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Little Charlie grew up and pretty-much disappeared after Santa Claus 3. (Not uncommon for many cute child actors.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the Santa Clause He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit off. It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish Frankenstein quality to it. SC courting Mrs. Claus is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Chet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the potty humor? The rip-off ending from Laurel & Hardys', March of the Wooden Soldiers shows a great lack of originality here.
