I liked it and was in a minority. I believe that I may be in a minority again saying that 'Dark City' is an interesting film, with a lot of strong and original ideas, but also a fast aging piece of cinema.The theme of our civilization falling under the mind control of another civilization was repeatedly dealt with since 1998 when this film was made. Still the combination of detective story, mind control as in 'Eternal Sunshine', and alien contact, all filmed in a style reminding the 30 classic horror movies is interesting, but too heavy in my opinion to be efficient. The film tries to be too many things, a melding of too many styles, and falls eventually in a rather conventional ending, that cancels the surprises and tension built until then.Kiefer Sutherland's fans will enjoy seeing him in a very different role one second before '24'. Williana Hurt is as WIlliam Hurt as ever. The rest of the cast is good. What fail to make it to the screen are the graphics - the strong and original ideas of the movies are mis-represented using second quality graphics. If this was intended to be comics style, it's a bad idea because this movie tries to be more than comics.It's a film to remember, it's a different story than the usual science fiction stuff, unfortunately it's of the kind that fades rather than improves in time.

But he is forced to repeat the Rocky franchise because the other films either fared decently or were flops altogether. As a result, after filming Rocky III (which would be released in Summer 1982), he finally got his chance with a movie called Frist Blood (also known as Rambo First Blood in a lot of countries).First Blood is an extremely dark and grisly story in which Stallone plays a former Green Beret in his mid '30s haunted by memories of the war in Vietnam. He attempts to reunite with a fellow veteran, who is revealed to have died from Orange exposure a few months earlier. So, he strolls about here and there to find some peace, but instead ends up at the hands of a bored Sheriff from a quiet town who's looking for a fight. After enduring beatings and mistreatment from guards (much of this was unintentional), Rambo escapes and has to hide in a forest nearby, where most of the action takes place.Stallone finally showed some talent for the first time since the original Rocky, as he plays and brings this frustrated and marginalised character called Rambo, an ex-Green Beret, to life. The action sequences are very imaginative and powerful, even if they were not intended to entertain. The other two leads, Richard Crenna-- who was Rambo's friend and Boss from the Vietnam war--and Brian Dennehy-- the over-zealous Sheriff--, are dead-on with their roles and give their potential to fit their parts. My favourite scenes are the failed ambush late in the first half, and the cave sequence.Some of the movie's few flaws are that Stallone does not have much to say in most of the film, and many of the supporting characters are flat, and there's hardly any back story to the main characters other than spoken dialogue. The ending, however, in which Rambo tells his boss about one of his most frightening experiences in a Saigon bar, does give the chills and is effective in sending its message without being overtly explicit.The movie became a good BO film, earning over 3 times of its $14 million budget in the US and about $78 million overseas, making it his first big hit outside of the Rocky franchise. This would also inspire to create two comic-book style sequels and eventually another one that is more down-to-earth. Of all the Rambo movies, this one is the one to watch, because of its deeper and more critical storyline, critical because it reflects a strong social connotation apathy towards the Vietnam veterans IS RIFE. Unlike their grandparents and parents before them, who were widely revered as heroes during the World Wars, the Vietnam veterans are not viewed as heroes but rather baby killers and are widely ignored and resented by the media, the government, and even the army itself. In short, despite living similar experiences as those of the previous wars, they become obstracised, and Rambo is pretty much a case in point.

I've seen Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind and loved both. I even appreciated Edtv, so I was convinced that this movie would be yet another hit. But I was wrong. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but it wasn't a really good one either. It really left me with a double feeling, but more about that later on.First I'll tell you something more about the story. The movie is about Tom Mullen, a successful airline owner and the father of a kidnapped boy. Sean Mullen was kidnapped and taken as a hostage for a ransom of two million dollar. But when the drop goes wrong, the business man in Tom takes it over from the father. To everybody's astonishment and horror, he turns the tables on the leader of the kidnappers by turning the ransom money into a bounty for the man's head in the TV news...At first this looked like an ordinary Hollywood production about a kidnapping. Nothing special, but no TV-movie material either. But as soon as he puts that bounty on the kidnapper's head, it all went wrong in my opinion. I can't believe that there is any parent that would ever do such a thing. Jeopardising the life of your child is probably the last thing that you want to do and I'm sure that the police would never let it happen. And that's not the only problem that I had with the movie. The final of the movie didn't add much to the believability either. I'm not going to tell you the details, but it involves a lot of shooting and other action shots.Still not everything about the movie was bad. Mel Gibson's and Rene Russo's performances weren't bad, but in my opinion it was Gary Sinise who was the best actor in this movie. The role he had to play as Detective Jimmy Shaker certainly wasn't the easiest one (again I can not tell you too much about it without giving away too much information), but he did it very well.All in all this is movie that left me behind with a double feeling. It started well and the acting is OK, but the second half really blew it for me. That's why I give this movie a 6\/10.

Intelligent film making? Perhaps. An intelligent film? I think not! In this post Tarantino age of cinema this is what passes for a masterpiece, god help us! It was Tarantino's Pulp Fiction that sparked this brave new age of cinema we are currently suffering, the age of mediocre is the new good. It is so fitting that the so called benchmark for film making in the 21st century should be the personification of style over substance. In fact there is hardly anything worth extracting from this self congratulatory thriller other than the over stylized imagery and technical wizardry on show. This film is stone cold, a lifeless film made purely for your aesthetic pleasure.The premise for the film IS intriguing, the director provided himself remarkable scope in which to create a fantastically gripping thriller by virtue of the protagonist's 'condition' combined with a muddled take on the old reverse narrative. This allowed him the chance to chop up the plot and deliver the punch line from each segment first then show us the events leading up to that point. This is fascinating the first couple of times, but by the 4th I was thinking wow, that's getting old fast by the 8th time I just wanted the punishment to stop. The narrative device is purely and simply a clever gimmick, and one that is clearly wasted on such a banal story. The argument has been used that the connect the dots narrative structure is the only thing that makes it intriguing. Heck, so what? It is possible to take a half decent plot and spin gold from straw with the right narrative structure. Not here though, even told in reverse it had no worth in my eyes because the plot is beyond redemption. A thriller should be thrilling, this film is snail paced and instead of being intriguing the narrative structure quickly begins to resemble someone desperately trying to draw blood from a stone, futile. Further more a thriller or drama should have interesting characters and a bit of intrigue. The plot was not captivating, the situation was not captivating, the characters were not captivating and I did not care about them, especially not Lenny and his questionable motives.There is not one good character in this film, not surprising since the actors don't have any challenging dialog to work with. Also they look like they were sleepwalking through filming, only Pantoliano attempts to bring anything resembling life to this turkey. I can almost forgive Pearce as he is playing a vengeful, obsessive psycho, and he has no short term memory so he might well have zero personality or emotion for good reason. However Moss' character is simply a horrible film noir cliché, the femme fetale, and she performs the role with no style whatsoever, perhaps because she has little work with. All she is required to do is look moody and menacing and be a bitch. Please, can nobody come up with good characters these days? The effect is not good at all, I felt these characters and the swiss cheese style excuse for a thriller\/drama were spat out as the appendix for a Nolan master class in technical magic and whiz bang editing. The cast are rendered pointless by a senseless plot that only exists to be manipulated and rearranged to display the fact you can take a terrible story, mix it up beyond recognition and somehow disguise it as some sort of epiphany, a la Pulp Fiction.Then the ending (sorry beginning?) was just the icing on this grotesquely elaborate cake, I don't want to totally spoil it for those who have not seen it as the surprise of having your head deflated in disappointment is one not to be spoiled. It's suffice to say the preceding events were rendered even more senseless by the anticlimactic conclusion, I had not seen an ending this whiffy since Fight Club (later bettered by Mulholland Drive). I was left apathetic and cold by the conclusion to this 'riddle' that seemingly offered two possibilities, neither of which would validate the rest of the miserable excuse for a film. Why? Because I didn't care! Memento (and it's message) is like ouroboros in the most literal sense - circular, self contained, endless and ultimately pointless. Forgive my apparent artistic blindness, I DO appreciate creativity and inventiveness, my message to Mr Nolan and his peers would be please use it to INVENT a decent story! In reflection, perhaps the most annoying thing isn't that Memento is so mediocre in every way, it's the fact that it has been so widely regarded as a great film, much like the two putrid films that it rooted from - Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. I don't know, my friends say I am a cynic and the harshest of harsh critics, well I simply say I am just reflecting on a harsh and cynical world that thrives on misery and depression like they are going out of fashion. With the rapid development of special effects, filming equipment and creativity in cinema it's easy to look back on the 'golden eras' of cinema and chuckle at the technical integrity and naive world view of some of the oldies. However it almost makes me want to shed a tear that cinema has come such a long way technically but sadly seems to have lost the values that used to be at it's heart. Films used to tell stories, they used to have REAL characters and had soul and substance. Now I look at the 'classics' of todays material world - films like Pulp Fiction, Memento, American Beauty and Fight Club and I see nothing but hate, cynicism, sharp emotionless dialog, 2 dimensional characters and most importantly style over everything else, a sad but accurate reflection of the age we live in? Indeed.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"3 June 2005","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" *Tiny unspoilers within*No, it's not a dig aimed at the formerly great MGM, I talk of Memento. Intelligent film making? Perhaps. An intelligent film? I think not! In this post Tarantino age of cinema this is what passes for a masterpiece, god help us! It was Tarantino's Pulp Fiction that sparked this brave new age of cinema we are currently suffering, the age of mediocre is the new good. It is so fitting that the so called benchmark for film making in the 21st century should be the personification of style over substance. In fact there is hardly anything worth extracting from this self congratulatory thriller other than the over stylized imagery and technical wizardry on show. This film is stone cold, a lifeless film made purely for your aesthetic pleasure.The premise for the film IS intriguing, the director provided himself remarkable scope in which to create a fantastically gripping thriller by virtue of the protagonist's 'condition' combined with a muddled take on the old reverse narrative. This allowed him the chance to chop up the plot and deliver the punch line from each segment first then show us the events leading up to that point. This is fascinating the first couple of times, but by the 4th I was thinking wow, that's getting old fast by the 8th time I just wanted the punishment to stop. The narrative device is purely and simply a clever gimmick, and one that is clearly wasted on such a banal story. The argument has been used that the connect the dots narrative structure is the only thing that makes it intriguing. Heck, so what? It is possible to take a half decent plot and spin gold from straw with the right narrative structure. Not here though, even told in reverse it had no worth in my eyes because the plot is beyond redemption. A thriller should be thrilling, this film is snail paced and instead of being intriguing the narrative structure quickly begins to resemble someone desperately trying to draw blood from a stone, futile. Further more a thriller or drama should have interesting characters and a bit of intrigue. The plot was not captivating, the situation was not captivating, the characters were not captivating and I did not care about them, especially not Lenny and his questionable motives.There is not one good character in this film, not surprising since the actors don't have any challenging dialog to work with. Also they look like they were sleepwalking through filming, only Pantoliano attempts to bring anything resembling life to this turkey. I can almost forgive Pearce as he is playing a vengeful, obsessive psycho, and he has no short term memory so he might well have zero personality or emotion for good reason. However Moss' character is simply a horrible film noir cliché, the femme fetale, and she performs the role with no style whatsoever, perhaps because she has little work with. All she is required to do is look moody and menacing and be a bitch. Please, can nobody come up with good characters these days? The effect is not good at all, I felt these characters and the swiss cheese style excuse for a thriller\/drama were spat out as the appendix for a Nolan master class in technical magic and whiz bang editing. The cast are rendered pointless by a senseless plot that only exists to be manipulated and rearranged to display the fact you can take a terrible story, mix it up beyond recognition and somehow disguise it as some sort of epiphany, a la Pulp Fiction.Then the ending (sorry beginning?) was just the icing on this grotesquely elaborate cake, I don't want to totally spoil it for those who have not seen it as the surprise of having your head deflated in disappointment is one not to be spoiled. It's suffice to say the preceding events were rendered even more senseless by the anticlimactic conclusion, I had not seen an ending this whiffy since Fight Club (later bettered by Mulholland Drive). I was left apathetic and cold by the conclusion to this 'riddle' that seemingly offered two possibilities, neither of which would validate the rest of the miserable excuse for a film. Why? Because I didn't care! Memento (and it's message) is like ouroboros in the most literal sense - circular, self contained, endless and ultimately pointless.

It is a love story like every other love story, but it is like no other love story.A paradox? Maybe, but that's exactly what this movie is.Firstly, let me just say that to fully enjoy this movie, you have to have an open mind. Forget reality and forget conventions. Moulin Rouge! isn't about reality and is as unconventional a movie as can be. Stop trying to understand it, and eventually, you will understand it. Secondly, you must be warned that it's a love-it-or-hate-it kinda movie. You're either a huge fan of the movie and have everything from the 2-disc special edition DVD to your own MR! t-shirt, or you hate it so much that you just want to point a gun to the character's heads. Don't listen to everything critics say. They are most likely the ones who hate this movie, as they spend a whole lifetime trying to understand movies, and when one like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. They give it 0\/10 before even giving it a second chance. A typical case of prejudice. You are not them, and so you at least owe it to yourself to give this movie a try.Now, let's talk about the actual movie. Moulin Rouge! is simply everything a movie should be. It has comedy. It has action. It has romance. It has drama. It has every filming style imaginable, from Disney to Bollywood. It is old vs. modern. I mean, which other movie has beautiful computer visual effects (some of which are reported to be the longest in movie history!) yet also has the old hand-made style of film-making, with unusual (and even wobbly) camera angles, on purpose? Which other movie has men in top hats singing Nirvana and beautiful courtesans singing Randy Crawford songs?The plot in itself is a run-of-the-mill love story, taken from the operas La Boheme and La Traviata, taken from Dumas' La Dame aux Caméllias. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a young, middle-class writer who wants something new in life. He wants to write a brilliant novel with a beautiful love story at the heart of it. The only problem is... he has never been in love. Stuck in a rut in London with his overly-religious father, he decides to move away to Paris, the city of love, to become part of the Bohemian revolution. After an accident involving a Narcolpetic Argentinian, a very sweet and apologetic Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and a falling roof, he meets a group of kind-hearted Bohemians who believe he is the one to help them write a show they are currently in the process of. The show is extremely important to them because it is a show all about their ideals of Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love. However, they have other plans for it they want to show it to the new financier of the Moulin Rouge, a Duke (Richard Roxburgh), whom they hope will agree to fund the conversion of the famous nightclub into a theatre. Now with a new writer for the show, the Bohos need a star for it. They immediately think of the Moulin Rouge's beautiful, top courtesan Satine. Before he can say The hills are alive with the sound of music, Christian is off to the Moulin Rouge to convince Satine to be in the show. He sees her performing her rendition of Diamonds are a girl's best friend and is immediately head over heels in love with her. The only problem is, Satine is needed elsewhere. At the same time, on a table nearby, the Duke is waiting for Satine to finish her show. However, the Bohos had told Christian that Satine would meet with HIM after the show... and you can guess what happens next... yep, you've got it... Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke! Alone in her boudoir with Christian, inside an Elephant, Satine tries flat out to seduce this Duke who is actually Christian. Christian's Orphean soul makes Satine fall in love with him as he sings his own rendition of Your Song. However, after finding out that he is in fact NOT the Duke, Satine tries to take back all the feelings she had. However, true love is not like that, and before you know it, they're kissing passionately on top of the Elephant. Another thing about true love is that it's unmistakable to miss, and before long, everyone else at the Moulin Rouge finds out about Christian and Satine's affair... apart from the Duke. To keep the Duke out of the know, Satine still has to seduce him and the night comes when she has to sleep with him... but she can't do it as she cares too much about Christian, and then it builds into a heart-wrenching climax... you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean!!

'Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' held up wonderfully with age, and is still considered by many even today not only one of the funniest films of all time, but one of the very best films of all time. It's amazing to me after so much time has passed (the movie was in black and white for god's sake), audiences all over the country still get the dry and deadpan humor that 'Dr. Strangelove' so exquisitely expresses, and still are left to ponder the subtle but definitely present political statements at the heart of movie. Since I wasn't alive in 1963 I don't know for sure, but I heard from reliable people around during that time, a lot of Americans (especially in politics) hated this film because it shows them as something less then the geniuses they usually think themselves to be, it kind of just shows them as idiots, or buffoons.The film chronicles what seems like the cold war, a war that could turn out to be World War III. The movie stars the immensely talented Peter Sellers in three roles, that are all different and carefully crafted by Sellers. The first is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, a captain in the United States Army under the command of Brig. General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden - The Godfather), who fears the Russians because they intend to fluoridate water -- oh no!!!!!! General Ripper and Group Captain Mandrake are stranded in an office building under attack from the Russians, and Gen. Ripper goes completely insane in one of the plot lines 'Dr. Strangelove' possesses. The second character Sellers portrays is the president of the United States, Merkin Muffley, whose in the war room during the entire course of the film, trying to decide what to do when the Russians try to bomb the U.S. Merkin Muffney is a short bald fellow, who never seems to quite understand what's going on around him. Helping him make decisions, are the war hungry General Buck Turgison (George C. Scott - Patton), and the ex-Nazi mad genius scientist, Dr. Strangelove (who is also played by, you guessed it - Peter Sellers - in his funniest role of the entire film), who tries to refrain himself from involuntarily giving Hitler salutes throughout his hilarious scenes. 'Dr. Strangelove' is based on a book that isn't presented in a comedic fashion like the film adaptation. Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones co-star in this off-the-wall dark comedy.There are so many wonderful things to be said about 'Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Kubrick provides eye-popping direction way ahead of it's time, and also provides a rich, engaging and timeless screenplay based on the popular novel. Peter Sellers gives his very best screen performance in 'Dr. Strangelove' (in my opinion) tearing up the screen with his three fabulous and ingenious characters. George C. Scott is surprisingly witty and likable as the war room General, Sterling Hayden provides us with solid work as the crazy General Ripper who fears that evil fluoride in water plot the Russians are planning, and Slim Pickens is funny as the Major T.T. 'King' Kong, who actually rides a missile being fired into Russian soil from his fighter plane. The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards -- Best Actor in a Leading Role - Peter Sellers, Best Director - Stanley Kubrick, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and sadly didn't receive awards for any of them. If it was up to me, I'd give it awards for all four categories, because looking back, 'Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is by far the best film of 1963.In conclusion of this film review, I have to say 'Dr. Strangelove' is a terrific accomplishment in regards to film-making. Kubrick really hits it out of the park with this, making it his second best film of all time (the first being 1971's A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess' vision of a horrific future). The movie has minor shortcomings, like moving a little slow towards the first half hour or so, but besides that I have to say it's all near perfect. I think I admired 'Dr. Strangelove' not only because it's very funny and delivers interesting political messages, but because it stars one of my favorite actors of all time (Peter Sellers) and is directed by one of my favorite filmmakers of all time (Stanley Kubrick). If you have a taste for an abnormal dark comedy, and haven't seen this already, go out and rent it. Chances are you might just like it.

The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards -- Best Actor in a Leading Role - Peter Sellers, Best Director - Stanley Kubrick, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and sadly didn't receive awards for any of them. If it was up to me, I'd give it awards for all four categories, because looking back, 'Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is by far the best film of 1963.In conclusion of this film review, I have to say 'Dr. Strangelove' is a terrific accomplishment in regards to film-making. Kubrick really hits it out of the park with this, making it his second best film of all time (the first being 1971's A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess' vision of a horrific future). The movie has minor shortcomings, like moving a little slow towards the first half hour or so, but besides that I have to say it's all near perfect. I think I admired 'Dr. Strangelove' not only because it's very funny and delivers interesting political messages, but because it stars one of my favorite actors of all time (Peter Sellers) and is directed by one of my favorite filmmakers of all time (Stanley Kubrick). If you have a taste for an abnormal dark comedy, and haven't seen this already, go out and rent it. Chances are you might just like it.

I find most of them ridiculous and try to avoid them as much as possible. That's of course not a good start when you are about to watch a movie like The Rock. But before you think that you know where this review will go, I also have to say that this is probably one of the few action movies for which I'll make an exception. That's right, I really like this one and there are many reasons for that. But let me start by telling you what the story is about.General Hummel has spent most of his career carrying out covert operations. Over the years, he has lost many men, because they got killed during one of these operations or because they had to be left behind. Since these operations were secret, those men or their families have never received any recognition or compensation. After trying to get them that through normal channels, Hummel now decides that it's time for drastic measures. Together with a group of renegade marine commandos he seizes a stockpile of chemical weapons and takes over Alcatraz, taking 81 tourists hostage. If the government doesn't pay 100 million dollar, he will launch 15 rockets, aimed directly to San Francisco and carrying deadly VX nerve gas. As time is running out, the Pentagon sends in an elite SEAL team, together with an FBI chemical warfare expert and a former Alcatraz escapee...So even though I'm not a fan of action movies, I must say that for this one I'm glad to make an exception. I like it so much because of the very good acting, the good character development, some fine special effects, the believable action and the unexpected twists in this well-written story. I know that's a lot to discuss, so let's start with the acting. With a top cast like this one, including people like Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, William Forsythe... you can't expect anything less but some top-notch performances, but that doesn't mean that you'll get it of course. Too often you'll see some good actors who don't seem to belong in a certain movie or who just seem to have a day that nothing works. Not in this movie. Every single actor has done a very fine job, which of course is a pleasure to watch. The fact that they had some interesting and believable characters to work with will have helped them with that of course. Think for instance of Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). He is no superhero who will just walk in through the main gate, shooting every bad guy with his eyes shut and rescuing all the hostages at the same time. No, this is a man with no decent military training, good at working with chemicals, but afraid to be confronted with the enemy. The same for John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), he's no superman either. He's a retired SAS commando, so he knows how to kill a foe, but he's also an old man who has spent most of his time in a prison cell. And it's the same about the other characters. No-one of them is just good or just bad and that's what I like so much about this movie. The characters have a certain depth, which is a rare thing for an action movie.Next to the good acting and the interesting characters, I also liked the action and the special effects. Of course there are a lot of explosions and yes there is a major car chase to be seen in it, but then again this is still an action movie. If it isn't allowed in this one, where can you use it in then? And it has to be said, it is sometimes a bit much and too prominent, but it is never completely unbelievable like in so many other action movies. The fact that it all looks so good and that it all seems believable also has a lot to do with the nice special effects. Even though this movie is about ten years old now, it doesn't look dated at all. It adds a lot to the tension and the suspense and it feels like it was made only yesterday and that's something that you'll not find in every movie.So now I'm only left with the good story and the unexpected twists. I'm not going to give too much away about it of course, because that would spoil all the fun for those who haven't seen the movie yet. I just want to say that the story is a nice mix of action, drama, laughter and suspense. It's one big whirlpool that will probably suck you in and will not let you go until the end. I really liked that and that's why I give this movie a 7.5\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2005","score":"","review":" Let me start by saying that I'm absolutely no fan of action movies.

The Hunger was a great first stab at directing and a is a film that showed that Tony had a lot of promise. He went on to direct more commercial films like The Fan, The Last Boyscout, Days of Thunder, Beverly Hills Cop II and Top Gun. Recently he directed the Denzel Washington vehicle Man on Fire. As you can see he couldn't have strayed further from the horror genre. But the one horror film that he did make was excellent and I will go on now explaining why I liked it so much.First off, the story develops around a very old vampire called Myriam Blaylock. Shes lived for thousands of years and from time to time turns whoever she chooses into a vampire. She lives with that person for sometime, but unlike her, they don't last forever. For some reason (unexplained in the film) the people she turns into vampires only live for about 200 years and then they shrivel into a corpse and die. David Bowie is her most recent companion to suffer from the aging curse and he is looking for a way to survive it before he dies.Artsy and Stylistic films are my weakness. I favor style over substance and don't bitch and moan when a film puts its style over its character development or story. I don't think thats the case here though, because even though this films strengths lie in its style its story though simple, is very well developed. Its obvious when you watch this film that Tony is brother to Ridley. In The Hunger you will notice that the film has a noirish style to it, lots of shadows and strobes of light and smoke filled rooms. In terms of look this film looks and feels a heck of a lot like Ridleys Blade Runner. But being heavily influenced by his older brother is understandable here, hey, after all this was Tony Scotts first film.But for a first film, it sure shows a lot of control over the whole artistic aspect of the film. Visuals filled with lots of curtains blowing in the wind, lots of shadowy figures. The use of classical music also fits perfectly with the idea that these old vampires have existed for hundreds of years, and not only that it adds a touch of class to the film. Not to worry though, there's also some cool rockin tunes, hey, the movie opens up in a goth club scene while playing Bela Lugosi is Dead by Bauhaus. Which reminds me that this movie has the look that certain MTV music videos had in the late eighties and early nineties, this is most evident in the nightclub sequences.The movie breaks away from vampire clichés and goes its own route, there's no sunlight that will kill these vamps, crosses or any other traditional ways of killing a vampire are gone. These guys are simply vampires because they feed on blood and can live forever if they take good care of themselves.Susan Sarandon, David Bowie and Catheryn Deneuve all deliver great performances. Bowie of course is perfect for this role since his enigmatic rock and roll persona from his musical past (and present) add a lot to his vampire character. Susan Sarandon was once young and sexy and she flaunts her physical attributes here in a lesbian love affair that sizzles on the screen.The only negative thing I can think of saying on this one is that there's a lot of plot holes in it. I mean there's this monkey that apparently suffers from vampirism and there's these scientists studying it. Why the hell would a monkey be a vampire? Who knows, its never explained. There's a few other plot holes in the film that are never explained and seem to make no sense, but I wont get into them, I don't want to spoil the ending.In conclusion Id say that this movie is not for everyone since it can get slow at times there's no car explosions or guns being shot every five seconds sorry.

But then again, how many movies do fit that description? Not too many and that's why I gave this movie a try. I hoped that, even though it wouldn't be any special, it still would be worth giving a try...The movie tells the story of Sara, a typical white young girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina and who is supported in that dream by her mother. But when her mother dies in a tragic car accident, her dream is suddenly over. She is convinced that she caused her mother's death because if she didn't have to do that audition, her mother wouldn't have been on that road at that moment. Because she has no-one to take care of her, she moves to her father in Chicago, which she doesn't know at all and who lives in the ghetto. Communication with him goes difficult and to make things worse she gets transferred to a new school where she is about the only white person. Still she is able to make some friends and she even finds a boy to fall in love with, but racism and jealousy are never far away. Despite all those difficulties, they'll fight to make something of their lives and together they will reach their goals...As I already said and after reading such a resume you know it too there can be no doubt that this will not be a very original movie. Still I wasn't prepared to see so many corny clichés in less than two hours time. From the first minute on, you already know exactly where this movie will go to, only to see later on that you were completely right. The director has opened a huge can with all the possible clichés and magic formulas Hollywood has to offer for movies in this genre and used about every possible one of them. White girl on ballet, mom dies, she doesn't know her dad or anyone where she moves to, she goes living in a tough neighborhood and falls in love with a black kid, a lot of racism and jealousy from all sides, they believe in each other and will make something of their lives... Is there any possible cliché that they haven't used? I don't think so.Still, there was something positive to be noticed as well. The acting for instance wasn't bad. I'm not saying Julia Stiles did an excellent job, but it was OK. She reminded me a bit of Leelee Sobieski for who I guess this could have been a typical role. They are about the same age, look a bit the same and Sobieski plays the same kind of roles, so if the makers had switched them in the middle of the movie, I might not even have seen the difference. Whether that is a good thing or not, I leave up to you. The other actors like Sean Patrick Thomas, Kerry Washington, Fredro Starr... were all about the same nothing exceptional, but not bad either.If there is one scene that I'll remember and that certainly is worth mentioning than it must be the combination of the ballet audition with the drive-by shooting, almost at the end of the movie. The contrast between these two worlds, the combination of that classical music with that hard urban life show perhaps best what the makers wanted us to see their love for each other saves them and makes sure they will make something of their lives. The rest of the scenes isn't spectacular, original or even worth mentioning.All in all this is just a typical teenage chick flick. I'm sure they will love it, but I wasn't too happy about it.

She is convinced that she caused her mother's death because if she didn't have to do that audition, her mother wouldn't have been on that road at that moment.

Programs like Idols, Big Brother, The Jerry Springer Show,... are never made with professional actors, but with people who will do anything to get some fame and fortune. You probably ask yourself why I tell you this, well this movie isn't about people who compete with each other in one of those series (although some studios are probably thinking about making such a movie right now), but about two men who will do anything to become famous, even when that means they'll have to commit a horrible murder.Oleg Razgul and Emil Slovak are two Eastern European criminals who come to New York to pick up their share of a heist score. But when Oleg steals a video camera and starts filming their legal and illegal activities, they soon want more than the money from the heist, they want to become really rich and very famous. When they learn how the American media circus can make a remorseless killer look like a victim and make him rich by buying his story, they get an idea. They'll choose a famous target, in this case the NYPD Homicide Detective Eddie Flemming who is very known in the media, torture and kill him and sell the images to the local tabloid TV show 'Top Story'...I guess you could say that this movie not only has some biting criticism for all those people who would do everything for a little bit of fame and fortune, but also excellently criticizes the role of the media and some lawyers who will only defend someone when they see some good publicity in it. And I guess the main issue here is that it isn't even exaggerated. The bloodier, the better seems to be the motto for many news bulletins nowadays, especially in the USA (if you don't believe me watch Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine). And even the lawyers who will use and abuse every possible law to keep their client out of prison isn't new. In fact you could say that this movie tells a story that could be based on true events...The story and the acting in the movie certainly aren't bad, especially Robert De Niro did a nice job, but also people like Kelsey Grammar and Edward Burns are very nice to watch. Even Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov play their roles of the Eastern European criminals very convincingly. But somehow this movie never really got away from that typical 'Hollywood' feeling. Although sometimes it certainly offers a more original approach, in the end it's a bit predictable. Of course the villains were dumb and completely amoral foreigners (American bad guys always seem to be smarter in the movies) and yes they didn't hesitate to use excessive violence. Just shooting their victims with one or two bullets wasn't enough, it had to be a lot more complicated than that. Still, that doesn't mean that the movie isn't any good. As I already said, it offers a lot of criticism and that's probably also the main reason why so many professional reviewers didn't like it all that much.

By the time the movie was half over, I knew I did not want it to end.Later, as I thought about it, finding I couldn't get the movie out of my head, I wondered why it had so captivated me... and I decided I would have to see it a second time to figure out the answer. A few weeks later, I watched it again. I was absolutely just as enchanted the second time.Kevin Costner is not a favorite actor of mine. I personally don't think he has much talent, and to me, he seems to play every role almost exactly the same. Yet, Costner was definitely a great choice to play the role of Ray Kinsella, disillusioned as he struggles not to become his father and discovering that his father had dreams too. James Earl Jones absolutely IS Terence Mann, the 60s pacifist\/rebel -- I can't think of another actor who could have played that role so believably. And Burt Lancaster as Doctor Archibald Graham, again perfect casting.So why have I watched it 20 times (and will repeat the experience for the rest of my life)? How can a person watch a movie over and over again and not get hopelessly bored? As a matter of fact, it's like any life experience which is so pleasurable or so much fun that you want to repeat the experience. Why do people ride a roller coaster a second, third, fifth, tenth time? Why does a person choose chocolate every time he gets an ice cream cone? Why do we have sex again and again throughout our lives? The answers to all these questions is the same because it was enjoyable and we want to experience those feelings again.My number one hobby for relaxation\/enjoyment is reading.

I can easily read a book a second, third, or fourth time for the same reason it's a wonderful, thoroughly pleasurable experience which, at some point down the road, I will want to repeat.Field of Dreams is one of those movies you either get or don't get. If you get it, you get it from the very beginning. If you don't get it, you can watch all the way to the end and it won't mean a thing. Read through these 20 pages of reviews and you'll see who gets it and who doesn't.Field of Dreams is immensely watchable, again and again, for the very same reason. It gives you hope.

I love that experience of realizing halfway through that you must slow down your reading pace because you don't want this incredible experience to end. I can easily read a book a second, third, or fourth time for the same reason it's a wonderful, thoroughly pleasurable experience which, at some point down the road, I will want to repeat.Field of Dreams is one of those movies you either get or don't get. If you get it, you get it from the very beginning. If you don't get it, you can watch all the way to the end and it won't mean a thing. Read through these 20 pages of reviews and you'll see who gets it and who doesn't.Field of Dreams is immensely watchable, again and again, for the very same reason. It gives you hope. It makes you smile. It encourages you to dream.Thank you!

At least if you're over the age of seven. This film is an odd one. It's about a guy who moves into an apartment dominated by thousands upon thousands of cockroaches. I checked the director's entire filmography, and it seems like everything he does involves cockroaches... no, revolves around them. I'm guessing he's either fascinated by them or infatuated with them. I'm not sure which I find more disturbing. I wager he's got some counseling in his future... or maybe he's just a very large child, passing for an adult. That is the only group of people this... 'film' could possibly appeal to. The plot is stupid and completely predictable, not to mention formulaic in every sense of the word. Absolutely no originality whatsoever. The pacing is surprisingly poor, for such a short film. The acting is sub-par. The writing is horrid. The songs sung by the cockroaches... don't get me started. The rest of the soundtrack just seems out of place. I know this was produced by MTV, but even for them, this is a new low. But apart from every negative I've written in this review, I must admit that I followed this film from the very beginning pretty much to the very end... something I rarely do anymore, except for when I'm at the cinema. Despite how much I hated it, I never took my eyes off it. Of course, this was probably just because this was aired during a violent lightning storm, and I was afraid if I turned on my computer before it was over, it might attract a bolt of lightning. Of course, if you need to believe otherwise... then go right ahead. I recommend this to children and people who enjoy childish humor. To give a quick example of said humor; one scene has the main character running around town, collecting feces from various animals. Yes, seriously. The film is incredibly poorly done, and very amateurish in just about every aspect, but I suppose the kids won't mind. Personally, I'd choose a cartoon over this any day... but different strokes for different blokes. 1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2005","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" ... of course, that might also mean you need extensive therapy.

The band and caterers and others turn out to be a terrorist group who take over the ship. While? They know there happens to be weapons on there they can sell for big bucks-including Tomahawks with nuclear tips on them. Their leader is a former CIA agent who was double-crossed by his boss. He is William Stranix. The military are struggling to find an answer to respond to Stranix. What Stranix does not know is that the dead Captain brought on his own cook who happens to be a trained Navy SEAL who has been punished for striking an officer. He's been locked in the meat locker by corrupt Commander Krill. He escaped. And now, he's p***** off. He is Casey Ryback.The plot is good enough for what we want, which is violence, blood and swearing. Oh, and a topless woman starring as Miss July '88. Seriously, is it just me or are those tits fake as hell? Steven Seagal is his usual self, magnificent fighter, c*** actor. However this is possibly one of his best films (not that hard). Tommy Lee Jones is his usual show-stealing self as William Stranix. He cackles and plots his way through the movie well. Tommy Lee Jones is close to providing the perfect antagonist to Ryback. Gary Busey is a favourite as he can play either great roles or the easy baddie. He is great in this movie. Slightly surprised he actually cross-dressed in this movie.One problem for me is something that I believe in very much is that in an Action flick, you need a hero who has qualities you like and is believable. You also need a bad guy who is despicable and also is a match for the good guy. When they meet at the end for a rip-roaring a**-exploding finale of complete and utter destruction, the bad guy should respect the good guy, but still want's to kill him. The good guy should battle and it should be a 50-50 contest with both being cut, bloodied and injured before the good guy finally kills the antagonist and gets the girl after a whole movie of flirting.Good guy we like? Check. Believable? No. Bad Guy despicable? Yes. Match for the good guy? NO! When we get to the fight scene, Steven Seagal completely dominates the fight. Tommy Lee F****** Jones get's one cut and then gets Thumb through the eye, Knife in the head and Head through computer screen. Over The Top, One-sided, boring and a major f****** let-down. Oh, and then out of nowhere, Ryback kisses the girl.

It doesn't abuse the tongue in cheekiness though.. It really does take itself just seriously enough to win.European to American Remakes often fall short but this time the same Director made both and well done!
