In the cinema of Alfred Hitchcock, THE PARADINE CASE as he originally shot would have been of great interest. Whether it would have been better is another matter. THE PARADINE CASE is generally conceded as among Hitchcock's lesser films. It's most interesting parts of the performances of the leads (except for Alida Valli, who is quite dull), and the famous sequence of the portrait of Valli whose eyes seem to follow the camera (standing in for Gregory Peck\/Anthony Keane) as it passes from one room to the next.Hitchcock told Francois Truffaut that he felt the casting was wrong. He wanted Greta Garbo for Mrs. Paradine (but Selznick had Alida Valli signed up). He wanted Ronald Colman or Laurence Olivier as Keane (but Selznick had Gregory Peck signed up). He did not want Louis Jourdan as LaTour, but wanted Robert Newton. Again Selznick said no. As a result of our general respect for Hitchcock the suspense film artist we sympathize with his comments, and dismiss Selznick as a bullying producer who destroyed a masterpiece. I seriously question this view.First of all, David Selznick (for most of his career as a producer) was way ahead of the majority of such Hollywood figures because of his taste and ability. Anyone who could create GONE WITH THE WIND, David COPPERFIELD, SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, and other high caliber movies is not one to dismiss so cavalierly. Most of the films he did with Hitchcock (whom he brought to Hollywood in 1939) were very good films REBECCA, SUSPICION, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, LIFEBOAT, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT - they were not crappy. Secondly, he was aware of difficulties in getting performers Olivier was working in England in 1948. Colman was working mostly at MGM, but was a bit too old for the role. And Peck was not an unknown talent He had worked with Hitchcock already. As for Garbo, she had been in retirement for six years, and there was no sign she was interested in a film come-back. The Jourdan - Newton problem is another matter. LaTour, in the film, is Colonel Paradine's loyal batman, now a valet and groom on the estate. Mrs. Paradine has made a play for his affections, and he has rejected them out of loyalty to his master. Hitchcock felt that Robert Newton, with his physical appearance, would have looked more like a man who worked in the mire of a stable than Louis Jourdan did, although as Jourdan remained the Colonel's personal servant that seemed a minor casting point in favor of Newton. Hitchcock also skirted the issue (soon to be handled in ROPE, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, and NORTH BY NORTHWEST) of a homosexual relationship between his characters. LaTour was supposed to be more openly close to the Colonel in Hitchcock's opinion. But it was a 1948 film - how close was the relationship supposed to be? Furthermore, Selznick as producer would be aware of one defect regarding Newton not found in Hitchcock's account to Truffaut Newton's alcoholism. Given the size of Newton's benders he was a poor risk in most film acting roles (no matter how available he was). Not so with Louis Jourdan. The film was brought in under 93 days, and that record would not have been possible if Newton had been in the cast and kept getting drunk. As for the homosexual relationship, it never is fleshed at all in the film. But would a 1948 audience have been willing to accept that? I don't think so.The supporting players, particularly Ann Todd, Charles Laughton as the sadistic Mr. Justice Lord Hawfield, and Ethel Barrymore as Lady Hawfield, gave good accounts of themselves in the film, especially Laughton as the Judge who takes out his frustrations with Mrs. Keane (ANN TODD) to wreck her husband's case. His best scene, where he compares a walnut to a human brain sums up the character's beastliness. I think that what Hitchcock fans fail to notice here is that it is Hitch's only real courtroom film. While his characters face hearings and sentencing in court (like in the start of NOTORIOUS), they rarely are shown being tried. I CONFESS is an exception - and the bulk of the film is not a trial. Here the bulk of the film is the trial of the anti-heroine Mrs. Paradine. It is not typical Hitchcock, and fails to fascinate the audience. The highpoint is the verbal clashes between Laughton and Peck (sometimes assisted by Leo G. Carroll as the prosecutor), Jourdan's collapse in the witness box when Keane attacks him for secretly betraying his master with the defendant, and Valli's final condemnation of Keane in court. But the circumstances and the dialog do not fascinate the viewers. Compare the way the trial in THE PARADINE CASE compares with those in Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, and in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Laughton's Sir Wilfred Robarts enlivens the film, and his tactics in attacking Torin Thatcher's case for the prosecution of Tyrone Power are solid and interesting in the former. Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, in defending Brock Peters on a rape charge in a segregated, bigoted South, are cutting and sensible. The key is the script - both of those films have better scripts, based on better writings (Agatha Christie and Harper Lee) than the Robert Hitchens novel. One can bemoan the loss of the three hour version or the 119 minute version that we lack now, but if it was anything as dull as the slow moving courtroom sequences of the currently extant film, I doubt that any improvement would have appeared.

Oh yes, the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin, and behind this paint you may find an animal.If you then compare it with Italiensk for begyndere (Italian for beginners) or Mifunes sidste sang (Mifune's last song), you see the same but opposite thing A crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare do, you may win.When the film had ended, I thought to myself Oh that's why I haven't seen it before ... The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman, actors, etc is good. But the script could need something more. A plot maybe wouldn't hurt.

The dialog is witty, intelligent, at times touching, and always believable.This Sabrina is a delight. A truly classic romantic comedy in the finest sense of the word. Harrison Ford portrays Linus Larrabee, perfectly blending ruthless billionaire and socially awkward male. Flawless in business matters, he's out of his element and totally unprepared for the consequences of what he originally deems a simple matter, turning Sabrina Fairchild's interest to himself instead of brother David (Greg Kinnear), thereby saving both an impending marriage and lucrative corporate merger.Julia Ormond's Sabrina is just the right mixture of sophistication and innocence. Daughter of the Larrabee's chauffeur, she's grown up on the family estate, yet outside of their social circle, of course. Passionately in love with youngest son David Larrabee, we see her in the movie's opening moments hard at her favorite pastime, spying on David and fantasizing that she is the girl he's currently schmoozing at mother Maude's annual birthday bash. Her father, Thomas Fairchild (John Wood) in an effort to broaden her horizons and get her past this obsession with David, arranges with Maude (Nancy Marchand) to send Sabrina to Paris for a year. He hopes she will learn about life and independence while working in the Paris offices of Vogue.While Sabrina is away, David meets beautiful Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), up and coming pediatrician. Coincidentally, she is the daughter of Patrick Tyson (Richard Crenna), owner of Tyson Electronics, a high technology firm that Linus has had his eye on for some time. As his brother's relationship blossoms, Linus quietly begins buying up Tyson stock.To Linus, everything seems to be proceeding as it should be. David and Elizabeth have finally set a date. He and Patrick Tyson are in serious merger negotiations. Maude and Ingrid Tyson (Angie Dickenson) are planning their children's monster wedding. All is about to change, however. A year has passed. Once again, Maude's birthday party approaches. It's also time for Sabrina to come home.Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job, mixing just the right recipe of romance and comedy throughout. We, the audience, are just as stunned as the movie's characters at the new Sabrina. With a Parisian haircut, in chic black with enormous sunglasses, she is nearly as unrecognizable to us as she obviously is to David. In town to pick up a gift for his mother, David, ever the playboy, offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it's Sabrina, and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride, watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery, David invites her to his house for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate (quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, NY), whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus, who never misses much, also sees trouble. Big trouble, judging by the smitten look on his brother's face. Thomas Fairchild, in turn, watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude's party, doesn't like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude's party arrives, complete with a live band, perfect weather (It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee's wouldn't have allowed it...), and, this time, as an invited guest, Sabrina.Admittedly, there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word beautiful is but a pale description. Even so, I would put Ormand's Sabrina on the party's walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is, literally, breathtaking. And David, to the panicked concern of his mother and brother, is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina, while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That's enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You'll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond, Nancy Marchand's Maude is acerbically intelligent, blending wealthy arrogance (Can't we SEND somebody?) and human compassion for Sabrina, with a deep love, and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David, who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly's Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons, and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack, Linus' watchdog assistant (But he PAYS me to tell him...). Some of the movie's best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant's kitchen, particularly those with Rosa (Miriam Colon).So, in conclusion, I emphatically urge you to rent, or better still, buy this film. Though the Bogart\/Hepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion, I'm sure you'll find it entertaining, heartwarming, and absolutely leisure time well spent!

He's got everything an actor ought to have. He's not plain looking. He has a dancer's physical presence, a voice that twists its phonemes into pretzels, and seems able to compellingly interpret any part he's given. The guy just cannot be ignored on screen.He does his usual superlative job here as a socialized, aggressive type of antisocial personality, convincingly smooth, while he lies his rear end off. You don't rat on your family, he coaches his two sons (both Penns) as if he were Don Corleone, before he murders one of them and tries to rub out the other. The only time he shows what might be REAL emotion in when Sean Penn confronts him at the climax and comes close to blowing his ears off with a .45 automatic. He gives an extremely good impression of being scared.Sean Penn is all bulked up here. I'm not sure it fits him too well. He ought to be skinnier. His muscles don't drape that well. It's as if he's wearing a muscle suit instead of the fat suits we've become familiar with. Penn invariably puts a great deal of effort into his performances but, like his muscles, it kind of shows at times. He's good enough here, but is better I think in weasel parts like those in The Falcon and the Snowman and Carlito's Way. Mary Stuart Masterson is a real filly in this movie. She was about 20 when it was shot. She's not staggeringly beautiful, which is all to the good, but in her boyish haircut and with her sinewy limbs and broad forehead she looks as if she's just finished her adolescent growth spurt. There is something coltish about her. She runs about as fast as Penn can run.There is some evocative photography too. You can just about feel the summer's humidity and hear the locusts buzzing.Landscape aside, the lifestyle we see on screen is pretty lousy, and in fact the movie starts off in a rather leisurely manner. Characters don't rush through their dialog. They pause between statements, the way people do naturally. But (expletive deleted), how dull things are! They sit around and drink beer and watch TV and never talk. Walken is about the only animated person around. No wonder his boys idolize him.But it's a small life. You know the kind of heavies that Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser fought in Walking Tall? The guys that hung out in a saloon and ran some hookers and cheated customers -- that kind of small-time stuff? Those seem to be the offenses that Walken and his cronies commit, so it comes as a big surprise when the FBI enters the scene and starts passing out subpoenas. For heisting tractors? And the murders that follow are even more of a surprise. I missed the beginning of the movie so maybe that accounts for the incongruity.At any rate, though the film has its longeurs, a good deal of attention has gone into putting this production together. It isn't overburdened with a loud score. There are no exploding fireballs. The violence, at least in the print I saw, was muted. The murders are quick and, with one exception, bloodless. The director has passed up a chance to cheapen a rape scene by showing us a lot of skin. Instead, he cuts as soon as we've got the idea.Overall, a pretty good job, a lot better than most of the junk on screen these days.

I thought the concept was inspirational and revolutionary.People get influenced easily by critics and mass populist opinions which I guess was why a lot didn't like it.A film about life.An imperfect simple man showing simple people that they don't have to live by the rules of, and under the oppression of an egomaniacs control, subjugation and perceived power.You must watch this film, the cinematography hawks my mind back to planet of the apes at some points, and if you watch it from start to finish properly you WILL be effected by the corny bits. One must make allowances for these when a director\/film maker has tried to bring to life a concept which is so simple but at the same time to revolutionary and empowering.The final scene with the emotional confrontation and the line It doesn't have to be this way was one of the most powerful lines and concepts depicted on film.

You start to act different, think different, and realize that you are growing up and there is nothing you can do about it. For Jim Stark this is more than he can handle.Nicholas Ray's classic Rebel Without a Cause is a look into the life of Jim Stark (James Dean) and his attempt to try and figure out what he wants to do with his life. Should he try to become an adult or should he enjoy what little time he has left and cut loose?The movie opens with Jim after he has had a few too many drinks. After being taken to the police station his parents are brought in to help find out what he did and why he did it. His parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) are torn over what to do with him. The father is understanding but the mother wants him to learn his lesson and make sure it does not happen again. Their fighting is tearing him apart!.Also at the station is Judy (Natalie Wood) and John Plato Crawford (Sal Mineo). Jim offers his coat to Plato but he refuses. It was just a kind gesture, but given Plato's emotional state, it is a justified response.The next day is Jim's first day at his new school. He leaves the house in a good mood, telling his parents how this might be it for him. After meeting Judy, who appears to be unfazed by the incident she had in the police station, Jim is off to school where he learns of a field trip for that afternoon to the planetarium.It is hear where he encounters Buzz, the leader of the cool crowd. After slashing Jim's tires, it's examination time, or a little knife fight. No jabbing, just sticking. Jim almost loses it but keeps his cool. Buzz challenges Jim to a chicee race at the bluffs. Jim accepts having no idea what that is.The events that follow are like a wild goose chase for Jim and his new friends. They go everywhere from the bluffs, to an abandoned mansion, and the planetarium. It's a wonderfully written script using great dialogue between Jim and his parents. The camera work is also a magnificent display, using great angles and unique shots. Ray had the perfect vision of what he wanted his film to look like.Color is often used to showcase significance or symbolize a certain aspect of the film. Jim's red jacket, Judy's red coat in the beginning, and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films, none the less, he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father, the understanding, somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier, these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's. A movie that to this day is a perfect example of how each new generation is as rebellious as the one before it.

His career in which incoherence and eclecticism get on well together (perhaps that's why he's often slated by French critics) is one of the most fruitful you could dream of, even if French mainstream public often associates his name with les Bronzés (1978), a commercial hit which put him on the map as well as the actors, the famous troupe of the Splendid and tends to overshadow the rest of his prolific career which spawned treasures like Tandem (1987), Monsieur Hire (1989) or Le Mari De la Coiffeuse (1990).This vehicle La Veuve De Saint Pierre (2000) was originally to be directed by another veteran of French cinema Alain Corneau (who sadly shot the insipid Prince Du Pacifique that year, perhaps the nadir of his career) but he turned down the role due to disputes with the producers. So, Patrice Leconte inherited the project. His choice was motivated by the desire to work with one of the two main roles, Juliette Binoche (he had teamed up with Daniel Auteuil the previous year for La Fille Sur Le Pont, 1999)The title of the film has a double meaning the veuve refers to Binoche after her husband's demise. The opening sequence presents her to us in her mourning garb (Leconte's work is served by lavish costumes). The audience knows that she is the veuve and will discover in the long flashback, how she has lost her husband. But a veuve is also a slang word for the sinister guillotine and it has a tongue-in-cheek connotation Saint Pierre unlike France hasn't got a death instrument and must have one. All the time, the island is deprived of a guillotine, it remains a veuve.There are clearly two sides. On the one hand, the officers' who govern the island and are die-hards of the death sentence and on the other hand, the private triangle which encompasses Auteuil, Binoche and Kusturica. Between the two poles, the impending threat of the execution with the recurring images of the ship sailing across the Atlantic with on board the guillotine. The scenario eschews the tempting trap of the Manicheism and the officers aren't caricatures. As a matter of fact, one of the main thrusts of the film is to deride the leaders of the island who seek at all costs to keep the death sentence and their obstinacy is made ludicrous by the postpone of the sentence and the last words of the voice over contain grim details which give a slap to one of Doctor Guillotin's famous words a painless death is a progress for humanity. Moreover, they prove to be unscrupulous because when a new inhabitant settles on the island, they entrust him the role of the executioner without taking care of his opinion.In the private triangle, madame La by guiding Neel on the way of redemption is full of condescension and solicitude but she's a complex character. Her reasons and motivations to redeem Neel are rather elusive even if she says (I don't remember the accurate cue) I think human soul is unpredictable and can be able to become conscientious and intelligent. A little gratifying cue which should have been more construed and fleshed out and remains an inkling. Then, why would she encourage the sacrifice of such a devoted husband to try to save a convicted killer whereas it's doomed to failure? Is it a response to her husband's love? (If Auteuil sacrifices himself it's for love for his wife and respect for Neel). Certainly and if so, Leconte's piece of work is a novel and quirky approach on the relationship between husband and wife, a quite notable feat for an author who has seldom studied this topic in his filmography, except maybe in Le Mari De La Coiffeuse.Buoyed by a more than palatable cast with a special mention to Emir Kusturica who was a discerning choice because he could convey vulnerability and fragility to his persona of great strapping man, La Veuve De Saint Pierre may be derivative if we consider the theme of redemption and the thrust quoted in the fourth paragraph but its treatment is a far cry from Hollywood's formulaic conventions. How to rank it in Leconte's uneven but usually riveting filmography?

And they are all true, there are some parts that are out of place, stupid, and lets not bring up Kevin Costner's accent. But looking past all that, this movie had a great amount of potential and I believe it delivers beautifully.Kevin Costner gives a good performance, not by any means along the lines with Dances with Wolves, but he is very entertaining as the dashing, rogue Robin of Locksley (Robin Hood) And all this drama about his accent. I would most definitely like to hear him speak his normal accent that have to hear him fail miserably at a British one, it didn't take away from the part at all.Morgan Freeman is great. He is VERY convincing as the North African Moor, Azeem, I enjoyed his character a lot, especially how he prays when everything is going wrong, very funny! He is one of the only characters that remind you about the troubles outside of Nottingham and Sherwood forest. Robin Hood Prince of Thieves takes place during the Crusades and it seems that after the short while in the beginning in Jerusalem, the idea of war ended, but the racism towards him from Friar Tuck and some of the men in the beginning reminds you of it.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is very very beautiful and plays a feisty, ballsy Marian. She is a terrific actress, but her character seems very two dimensional. None the less, you still root for her and Robin to get together and its a nice happy ending. And I can tell you, she screams excruciatingly loud, ROOOBBBIIINNNN I had a headache for a week, ;)But the best character of all, is Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham. I have much to say about him. Probably one of the greatest villains to come along in a while. Maybe it's just me, but I grew up with the animated Disney version of Robin Hood where the Sheriff of Nottingham had that really annoying voice, humming along and picking up taxes. Rickman adds a whole new dimension to the character. Had he not been in the role, it would have been a disaster and I can't think of anyone as good as him to play this character. If you are looking for a reason to see this movie, this is it. He completely steals the show. But don't expect a Hans Gruber. The Sheriff is neurotic, sly, completely merciless ( He kills his own cousin!), and almost childish, especially in the scene where Robin cuts his face, he falls back and after at least 2 seconds starts screaming bloody murder, reminds me of my three year old cousin. Rickman steals the movie, no doubt about it. But, don't think that he just a running around yelling at people, conjuring revenge plots. He is extremely kick ass. Especially in the climatic fight scene at the end. Robin Hood Prince of Theievs is rounded out with a great supporting cast, including Christian Slater as Will Scarlett, the outsider and hateful woodsman who has a personal problem with Robin. Nick Brimble, as the brave, jolly Little John. He reminded me of Santa Claus, before the white beard.All in all, this movie is very entertaining.

Nick Brimble, as the brave, jolly Little John. He reminded me of Santa Claus, before the white beard.All in all, this movie is very entertaining.

When I saw The Piano Teacher I felt a strange sense of passion rise inside... A burning desire, to control and to be controlled, to drown in passion... to be seduced. At the same time, I felt slightly nauseated by my reaction that seemed not to correspond with that of Erika. The actress, Isabel Hupper, said that Erika doesn't be seduced, she wants to be loved. Sure, I would want to be loved, but who could resist... such a seduction? By such a handsome, confident, and a little rough-- young man? There are three critical scenes where the power play between Erika and Walter goes back and forth. They are each very seductive and sensual in its own right. The first, when Walter goes to the bathroom and kisses Erika, is really a scene of such tension and anticipation-- the freshness of the first kiss, the urge to feel one another and the sense of -- fearful self-restraint, it's all overwhelming. It is one where Erika dominates, and succeeds. The second scene-- when Erika goes to see Walter in the ice skating link, is stunningly beautiful. I think this is the most satisfying one out of the three; despite the pitiful state in which Erika walks out... she is so vulnerable, walking while almost falling in her high heels on ice... but she is able to conquer Walter in some way. They share their expressions of love, he makes love to her and even though she vomits there is a strange tie between vomit and purity-- she feels pure inside because now he is with her... and he is part of what she always wanted, for him to tell her that she's his little love but command her as he wishes. Power is somehow shared between the two. It seems as if they are on a equal footing; Erika has conquered Walter and he has conquered her. There is a sense of misery as well as victory. The third scene, when Walter comes to Erika's house and he hits her and rapes her, is such an ironic, but very erotic in a violent way. Walter is finally unable to control himself-- he finds himself tormented by ardent desires for Erika. He hits her on the face and tells her, isn't this what she wanted? Erika says no, but somewhere in my mind I kept saying yes... she did want it, she wanted pain and feverish desire-- and in a way she gains it. The rape scene is full of tension and pitiful tag-of-war of control and passion, as Walter kissed Erika's mouth full of blood and comes inside her, who is motionless. The power has shifted to Walter. He now physically controls her, dominates her. Erika had asked for it-- but, he never really is able to conquer her emotionally, which leaves a sense of futility and dissatisfaction. From a different perspective, Erika has succeeded in controlling Walter&#151;-in figurative sense. When he says that he has been masturbating under her window, that is the clearest statement that Erika really has taken over, she has control of Walter's mind. He cannot resist thinking about her, he cannot leave her alone and he feels the urge to have her, he must possess her. During the rape scene, I couldn't help but ask myself, why is she not responding to this? Why is she acting like a corpse? Because&#133; in a way this is really what Erika wanted. After watching the interview of Isabelle Huppert it made a little more sense, but I still couldn't entirely agree. She says that Erika wanted to be loved and not seduced; and she realizes that she would never be really loved. There is a schism between her fantasy and reality. Perhaps. But all that is full of contradiction, Walter denies several times that he loves her, but at other times he swears that he does. In passion there is an element of love, and one can never entirely separate the two. In violence there is a sense of joy, there is pleasure. Reality and fantasy mix. So to me the movie is not only about a failed fantasy. It is more about a fantasy that crystallized, although in a chaotic, disorganized form. In her silence there is a defiance, in his act there is a sense of desperation. In her death there is a sense of emptiness, but also victory; in her taking control of her own life it ensures revenge to the young man who thought he had won. It isn't a true defeat, although it leaves a sense of sadness. At the end she still controls herself and his mind. Walter's obsession for Erika, undoubtedly, would continue to expand because of it.It's a movie that won't let go, just as Erika's presence would never let go of Walter. I believe that she would stay with him forever, like a fever inside his mind-- even if he might pretend otherwise.

But, along the way, the woman decides she's heading to Vegas without him, and has a plan to separate the boyfriend from his share of the money.Conveniently, a private detective (played by Val Kilmer in almost a mockery of 1930s pulp fiction) in Reno, the city in which the con woman winds up, is in dire need of a quick and easy $10 grand, which he in turn owes a bookie. As the protagonist of a noir drama, he is the usual once-innocent character who is tempted with greed and lust before redeeming himself morally (or at least as much as the viewer's sympathies will allow). The con woman shows up at his door and offers him just that, $10 grand immediately to fake her death. It doesn't look as though he buys the story about her abusive boyfriend, but of course, tainted with such foolishness, he acquiesces and falls in love with her, leaving himself open for the usual noir double- and tripple-cross among greedy characters.A simple noir with all its convenient connections, however, soon becomes too convoluted to take it seriously. Once you're to the point of the story where they're trying to fake her death, you might wonder how any of it would work, considering the plan they have is pretty ridiculous and lacks good attention to both detail and logic, even for a fictional film.

At this point, everything that follows just becomes too incredulous considering the events. Suddenly, despite all the conveniences that arise in the story, what started as a decent noir quickly falters.If it is desert film noir or Sin City film noir you are looking for, you're probably better off sticking with Dahl's 'Red Rock West'; it may be routine and the story a series of conveniences, but at least it pays better attention to the detail to make it all work.

All the characters are great, and the story while very similar to the original is still pretty cool, plus Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are simply amazing in this!. The effects by Rick Baker are really cool, and I thought Will Smith carried the film just fine until he found Tommy again!, plus it also has plenty of laughs in it too, especially when Frank (The Dog), is singing out the window. The finale is very good, and I personally felt Rosario Dawson made a great addition to the cast!, plus I feel that critics and movie fans alike are way too harsh on this film in my opinion. It's quite well made, and while it doesn't come close to matching the original, it's still pretty damn good for a sequel!, plus it paves way for another possible sequel. At 80 to 88 minutes, it's a great breezy time waster, and the ending was really cool!, plus all the characters were very likable. This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy Lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Barry Sonnenfeld does a very good! job here with great camera work cool angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Tommy Lee once again, had some really funny lines, kicked that ass, and did the same things that made him so funny in the 1st! (Will Rules!!!). Tommy Lee Jones is also amazing as always, and is amazing here, while we don't see him until after 30 minutes in to the movie, he hadn't lost his touch, and played the straight man once again, and like Smith did the same thing that made him so good in the 1st!. (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Rip Torn is great as Zed once again i really liked him, he was funny. Lara Flynn Boyle is decent here, and looked great, however i didn't find her all that menacing. Johnny Knoxville is OK here, I am a huge fan of this guy, however, he just wasn't all that funny, and didn't have that much to do, and disappeared in the 3rd Act he still rocks though! (Knoxville Rules!!). Rosario Dawson is very pretty and did what she had to do extremely well i really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine.

It's typical of Almodóvar's movies to have current Spanish culture as a background. Other typical aspects of Almodóvar's films that are present in Women on the Verge&#133; are irreverent humor and a different plot.The very original plot of this film begins with a scene of birds, including chickens, on the terrace of Pepa's (the protagonist's) apartment. She talks in the background about her desire to save the birds and also to save her relationship with Ivan; but she doesn't have much success with the latter. We next see a note from Ivan, in which he breaks up with Pepa. Then we are thrown into Pepa's black and white dream of Ivan. In the dream, Ivan confesses his undying love for Pepa. When she awakens, everything is in color, and she has to go to work. We discover that Pepa and Ivan work together, dubbing films. They don't talk at that time, but soon after there is an important development with Pepa's health which necessitates that she talk to Ivan immediately. The rest of the film is about Pepa's attempts to find Ivan, as well as neurotic friends, Islamic terrorists, and uninvited guests.This strange plot at first doesn't seem to have any deep significance, but there are really some important messages. First, there is a very firm feminist sentiment; this movie shows the power of a woman on the verge. By the end Pepa can accomplish anything she sets her mind to. She is an independent woman who ends up deciding to do something very difficult without help for the rest of her life, and shows that other women can also be independent, although perhaps they have to go a little crazy first. Furthermore, there is the main general message, which is the simple fact that there are ridiculous, difficult, crazy things and happenings that surround us every day, and we need to learn to survive, and eventually to prosper, in this environment permanently, like the character Pepa.Technically, the acting, especially Carmen Maura, is surprisingly convincing given the strange plot. The audience can sympathize easily with the characters and their everyday problems. Also the use of color, which seems to be a typical focus of Almodóvar, has impact because, like the plot, it is a little more 'real than reality', like the transition from the dream to the reality of the movie, which is full of brilliant colors. The rest of the technical aspects, like camera work and photography, didn't have a huge impact. They were certainly competent, just nothing special. It is the same with the music; with the exception of the Mambo in the taxi, the music in the background remains strictly in the background.The fact that the technical aspects of the movie aren't emphasized isn't a problem, because the script and the plot are emphasized in their place. These tow last aspects are the main reasons that I recommend to everyone to watch this movie. It is a different sort of film with the strangeness of real life, but with a twist that only Almodóvar can achieve.

The ape looks awesome, the acting is brilliant, and the film is so well made! The most clever part of the film is the great synchronisation of live action with the stop motion animation, it must have taken them ages to get it right! and to achieve such a great result!

After a rather un-exciting first day of filming, when the natives of the island discover the film crew, and don't seem to want them there, the crew return to the ship. But that night the natives sneak aboard the crew's ship, and capture Ann, with plans to use her as a sacrifice to the legendary Kong. A search and rescue team, lead by Jack Driscoll (Cabot) and Denham set out into the forest of Skull Island to try and retrieve Ann.
