She of course is in love not with him but with the relationship he had with his first wife.  The only problem here is that the story didn't give Sam a chance to develop more than a passing physical interest in Annie. This would nave added tremendous depth to the story and probably would have helped later on.The real problem with this movie is the opportunity missed in the final scene for an emotional reaction from Annie. Here she is on the top of the Empire State Building, knowing that she is WAY late. She finds Jonah's bag and... nothing happens. This was a great point for her to realize that he had been there, that it was actually the kid who wrote the letter, that HE wanted this relationship too, maybe more so than the adults. etc. This was the point for her to pour out a lot of pent up and newly formed emotions that would have counterbalanced the emotional buildup earlier on. (She would have had time to do that--the trip down and back up by the boys really would have taken a bit longer than it was portrayed.) Then, her reaction at coming face to face with Sam and Jonah would have been markedly different, more complex. We might have had some confirmation that that magic they were all three seeking actually did exist, especially if we had seen some of the afore-mentioned missing intrigue on the part of Sam. I would also have had her pull her original letter out of the knapsack, along with the teddy bear.So I feel that this was a very good movie, but it really missed an opportunity at the end which would have made it great.

Perhaps that is all one should care about when watching a film of this genre, but I find myself looking for other qualities in a movie -- fine acting, superior script, witty jokes, originality, etc. -- to make the two hours of its viewing more enjoyable. In my opinion, these sorts of qualities are absent here.Willis and Jackson are decent but are far better in other movies, such as The Sixth Sense (Willis) or Pulp Fiction (Jackson). The script is barely above the made-for-TV level, if at all. The jokes, for the most part, lack wit and thoughtfulness, and the slapstick humor is not that funny either. It has the same old black vs. white cliches and jokes, a couple of which are slightly offensive. For example, the n word is used several times in this movie. That would be acceptable if the movie were a serious look at racism, such as Mississippi Burning, but it is rather grating in a movie intended to be lighthearted and entertaining.And I know, the viewer is expected to engage in suspension of disbelief when watching films like this one, but when just about everything that happens is totally ludicrous, it becomes distracting. First of all, are we really expected to believe that Samuel Jackson's character would just drop what he is doing and go risk his life? That's a rather abrupt change of attitude for a character originally introduced to the audience as a small shop-owner and devoted family man. And how about the fact that the entire NYPD is duped into believing that a group of very Aryan-looking men with blatantly German accents whom no one recognizes are cops.

If you are cozy at home flipping the channels and this happens to be on, then what the heck. There are certainly worse movies. But for the most part, this film is weak.

I love Ed Norton.  I haven't seen a lot of movies with him, but he really pulled off the part of the lovable priest well.  I could hear myself wanting him to get Jenna Elfman throughout the movie, and I wanted to know more and more about his character than Ben Stiller's.  At first I thought the movie would focus more on his character, and I was a little disappointed that it didn't.  Overall, all of the actors portrayed their parts well (I got into the roles), and that was one of the movie's stronger suits.2.  I liked the plot- even the ending.  I was glad to see that this romantic comedy had a slightly different twist than other romantic comedies I have seen lately.  Maybe it was because I didn't find this comedy as predictable as others.  I even liked the ending because I felt it was one of the only ways it could REALISTICALLY end.  (Spoiler.)  I mean, come on, I didn't see either of the people in the God Squad leaving their faiths for her, and as much as I wanted Norton to get the girl, he didn't.  It would have just been too farfetched.3.  The camera angles were cool.  Remember the scene where Stiller and Elfman are talking about how their relationship was going to work out? The angles that the shots were taken at were different from any other shots I had seen.  It really made the whole scene more interesting.  The Cloisters, the MMOA, and the shots of NYC really brought out the beauty of the city as well.4.  Strange Humor.  My biggest complaint-and one of my only complaints about the movie-was the constant back-and-forth types of humor.

There are moments in the film that really make it one of the best of 2000. The scene where Ben and Jenna get together and the movie goes into a montage of various activities of them together is perfect. It isn't sappy or dripping with Hollywood flash. The music compliments the scene so well that I walked away thinking of it over and over. The scene where Ben and Edward are walking down the street and the song that is playing is priceless. Some didn't get the tongue in cheek aspect of it. You be the judge. I say it works. The karoke salesman almost steals the show. The characters draw you in and make you care about what is happening.

What can I say about this movie? Well, nothing bad if that's what you're wondering. Julia Roberts' enormous on screen presence and her trademark billion watt smile could have potentially overshadowed the story and everyone else in this movie...but it didn't. This movie was entertaining from start to finish.Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a single mom down on her luck. Despite repeated efforts to land a job she always ends up being rejected. She has a very minimalist way of dress and her skills in the social graces department are a little on the lacking side but her determination and resourcefulness ultimately land her a job with a law firm. Not too soon after her employment she begins to work on a case. What should have been a routine file\/case prep turns out to be something more. After a little research, Brockovich discovers many peculiarities about the case and, with her boss's permission, begins to look into matters a little deeper. Despite her appearances, this woman is obviously very bright. She is not above using questionable means to get what she needs and will not take any bullying from anyone, including her boss. As her investigation continues she discovers that a large corporation is trying to cover-up their illegal dumping practices by offering to buy all the property surrounding one of their plants. Hundreds of people who live in the area are inflicted with life threatening diseases and Erin discovers that the two are not unrelated. The rest of the story depicts the progression of the case but beyond the case, you will find yourself riveted to this woman's dynamic and interesting character.Although the movie focuses around Brockovich's work on this case, the director does an even better job showing this woman's personality. You see this woman pass through the whole gamut of emotions and her effect on those around her. Having never met the real Brockovich, I have no frame of reference but if Roberts' performance is any indication, this is one interesting lady. I've seen most of Roberts' films and I have to say without a doubt, this is her best work yet. Unfortunately this movie came out a little late or I believe you have seen Julia Roberts' name listed as one of the Oscar nomination for Best Female Actor.This movie wouldn't have been anywhere near this good if Roberts' didn't have an excellent supporting cast. This is especially the case for two actors, Albert Finney (plays Ed Masry - Brockovich's boss) and Aaron Eckly (plays George - Brockovich's boyfriend). Quite a bit of the more emotional scenes that Roberts is involved in includes one of these two actors and I found them to be very well done. Especially the chemistry that supposedly exists between Brockovich and her boss, Masry. This definitely shone through in the movie in particular the ending. You'll know what I'm talking about.I can't say enough good things about this movie. There's something here for everyone and the nice thing about this movie is that it does a good job telling the story but also developing the characters.

She has a very minimalist way of dress and her skills in the social graces department are a little on the lacking side but her determination and resourcefulness ultimately land her a job with a law firm. Not too soon after her employment she begins to work on a case. What should have been a routine file\/case prep turns out to be something more. After a little research, Brockovich discovers many peculiarities about the case and, with her boss's permission, begins to look into matters a little deeper. Despite her appearances, this woman is obviously very bright. She is not above using questionable means to get what she needs and will not take any bullying from anyone, including her boss. As her investigation continues she discovers that a large corporation is trying to cover-up their illegal dumping practices by offering to buy all the property surrounding one of their plants. Hundreds of people who live in the area are inflicted with life threatening diseases and Erin discovers that the two are not unrelated. The rest of the story depicts the progression of the case but beyond the case, you will find yourself riveted to this woman's dynamic and interesting character.Although the movie focuses around Brockovich's work on this case, the director does an even better job showing this woman's personality. You see this woman pass through the whole gamut of emotions and her effect on those around her. Having never met the real Brockovich, I have no frame of reference but if Roberts' performance is any indication, this is one interesting lady. I've seen most of Roberts' films and I have to say without a doubt, this is her best work yet. Unfortunately this movie came out a little late or I believe you have seen Julia Roberts' name listed as one of the Oscar nomination for Best Female Actor.This movie wouldn't have been anywhere near this good if Roberts' didn't have an excellent supporting cast. This is especially the case for two actors, Albert Finney (plays Ed Masry - Brockovich's boss) and Aaron Eckly (plays George - Brockovich's boyfriend). Quite a bit of the more emotional scenes that Roberts is involved in includes one of these two actors and I found them to be very well done. Especially the chemistry that supposedly exists between Brockovich and her boss, Masry. This definitely shone through in the movie in particular the ending. You'll know what I'm talking about.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

It should be, but somehow isn't, and the disappointment is bigger as a result of the expectation.  I'm not one of those people that whinges forever when books undergo changes on their way to the screen, but it seems that John Hodge has over-simplified an already relatively simple novel.  Others have detailed the changes and vented their spleens in that direction so I won't go into it, suffice it to say that there are several moments in the film where, as a direct result of those changes, things just don't make sense, and that weakens the movie.That said, I didn't think the changes were as numerous as some people are claiming.  Significant yes, but not that many.  The problem I think lies in the fact that, bizarrely, it seems more realistic when you have to visualise it yourself as you do when reading the book.  Seeing it onscreen it all suddenly becomes so desperately and ridiculously melodramatic that it's harder to suspend disbelief.  Sure, the cinematography is great, but after a while it all becomes too much.  Half the fun of the book is that the beach is a state of mind, and that's just impossible to put on film.The acting honours go to Robert Carlyle, whose ranting madman can't have been onscreen more than five minutes; but next to him every other character seemed paper-thin.  DiCaprio did a serviceable job, given the material. It doesn't so much matter that he is American here (and McGregor is too old for Richard anyway.) The problem was simply that Richard comes across as a total git; maybe that's the point, but in the book he was the one telling you everything, which made him sympathetic.On the upside, there's soundtrack new tracks from Leftfield, Underworld, Orbital and New Order all one CD?!  Boyle has always had a good ear, give or take the odd bum note (Ash, anyone?)  It's surprising, then, that in the film it seems so wishy-washy.  The squeaky drivel of All Saints' Pure Snores (sic) was layered prominently over the cheesy moonlight love swim, whilst a couple of the aforementioned great artists are relegated to a few seconds of background, coming out of someone's stereo.  Which is a shame.  The best musical moment in the film comes when Richard revisits the mainland on the rice run and the tourist-trap neon nightmare is accompanied by The Chemicals' Out of Control.The least one could expect of Boyle is the odd flash of brilliance, and sure enough there is some striking imagery on hand to oblige, such as the trail of blood across the white sand.  And there are a couple of great surreal moments; the video game sequence was amusing - it would have been better if it had been set up more carefully.  The madness arc was for me the most interesting part, sadly it just came out of nowhere and was totally at odds with the lyrical, languid pace and style of the preceding 80-odd minutes.  And the endless Apocalypse Now gags wore thin.  Again, they would have been better had Richard's 'Nam obsession been given even a passing mention beforehand; in fact, this is one area where making him an American could have helped.  Instead it was wasted. The kindest word to describe this movie is uneven.  When it's good it's okay, but when it's bad it's boring.  I'd love to know how much is down to the director and how much the studio interfered.  On reflection, I think they adapted the wrong Alex Garland book.  Just imagine what the Trainspotting team could have made of the multi-faceted philosophical gem The Tesseract!  Maybe next time...

Have you ever sat there and watched that X-Files episode where this guy who could change his appearance made himself to look like Mulder and he basically lived the day and the life of an FBI agent...except he knows nothing about being an FBI agent. That particular episode (and occasionally others) allowed us to see David Duchovny's comedic side and I have to say, it's a talent that shouldn't be hidden.Return to Me is a wonderful little romantic comedy about Bob Rueland (played by David Duchovny) who lost his wife in a car accident and after a couple years, tries to get back into the dating scene. With the help of his friends, he gets numerous offers for blind dates but they never workout until he accidentally meets a waitress (played by Minnie Driver), on one of his blind dates, that for some reason he feels inexplicably drawn to. There's more to this story than what I'm letting on but I don't want to tell you or it will ruin the movie but trust me, the story is a cute one.So what's so different about this movie from all the other romantic comedies? Well, the story for one is a bit more interesting but I think a lot of it has to do with the cast. Beyond Duchovny and Driver, the supporting cast is fantastic. As I sat there watching this movie, it dawned on me that I had not seen one actor there that gave a poor performance. James Belushi played the rough around the edges husband of the best friend of Driver's character absolutely hilariously. Bonnie Hunt who plays the best friend is just wonderful in her portrayal of a protective yet slightly neurotic friend to Driver. And then there was the gang that played cards every night after the restaurant closes. There's too many to name off but they were all good...and quite often they drew the loudest laughs. As I hinted earlier, David Duchovny has a comedic side that is usually hidden on his TV series. You occasionally see it but in this movie you get to see a lot more of it and it's very refreshing. Any X-Files fans will definitely appreciate seeing this side of him and those who are not X-Files fans, you'll still enjoy the movie. Minnie Driver is just as good. Her character is endearing yet slightly paranoid of her situation but she seems to fit with Duchovny perfectly.The only flaw that I could see in this movie was that the director occasionally wrapped up or glossed over some situations a bit too quickly but that may have been due more to time restrictions than anything. But these plot glossovers weren't integral to the movie so it wasn't that big of a deal.You can probably tell by now but I really liked this movie.

He walks with two canes. He is nearly blind. He can't drive a car. His brother just had a stroke. He and his brother haven't talked for over 10 years. Alvin decides that he has to see his brother. So, Alvin sets off across Iowa headed to Wisconsin on a lawn mower. The movie is almost 2 hours of alternating boredom.  First we see shot after shot of Iowa cornfields being harvested and close-ups of asphalt whizzing by under the lawn mower. Interspersed, we are subjected to the homespun philosophy of this old man talking to people he meets along the way. Most of these discussions are melodramatic, trite, or disgusting.  Melodramatic - Alvin discusses his W.W.II service with another man in a bar.  Alvin believes he killed an American solider while serving as sniper in France.  He's never told anyone before!!! Trite - Alvin tells a group of young bike riders that the worst part of being old is remembering what it's like to be young. Disgusting - Alvin tells a young pregnant runaway that she needs to go back to her family. Family is more important than the individual. Not only does this Kantian, proto-Nazi philosophy disgust me, Alvin had to use the old bundle of sticks analogy to illustrate it. Then there's the scene with the woman driver who can't make it to and from work without hitting a deer. (I guess that's funny, but woman driver jokes are hardly original.) The worst part of the movie is the acting of Sissy Spacek. She plays Alvin's mentally challenged daughter. She painfully draws out her stuttered lines. You think or hope that she'll choke on a word and no longer be in the movie. Not much to recommend.

Just because it doesn't have a pertinent message like Chasing Amy (my personal Smith fave) or Dogma doesn't mean it should be discounted.
