Anyone who is planning on seeing this masterpiece-what are you waiting for? The script is fantastic, the director in good form and the cast flawless. 'Cookie's' is suitable for anyone with a sense of humour and a big heart. The performances by the cast especially Glenn Close and Liv Tyler are the best in ages.  This film deserves the most Oscars, and will win the most Oscars in 2000.  I'm betting on it.

About 4 friends in a small little red-neck town, and the repercussions upon their viewing of a Rated R film, this movie blasts us in the face with the message of HOW POORLY PARENTS ARE RAISING THEIR CHILDREN.  Nonetheless, this film is the most offensive film I have ever seen, period.  Even I was offended...  Now THAT is a feat of film making skill par excellence!  Major props to the Parker\/Stone tag-team of death for morally offending me for the first time EVER in a movie.  Wow!!  Anyway, this film is finely crafted...  The writing is great, the jokes are INSANE, and there is NO HOLDS BARRED here, making this the most DARING film I can remember seeing.  Y'know what the best part is, it REALLY peeves-off all the prudes in a MAJOR WAY!!  I LOVE THAT!!  Up yours, bozos!!  South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut Rocks the boat harder than all, and will make your Parents cry (for realizing what a crappy job most parents do).  Brace yourself for Melvin?  Hell NO!  Brace yourself for CARTMAN...and that's the damndest bottom line, I ever BOTTOM LINED!!!!
