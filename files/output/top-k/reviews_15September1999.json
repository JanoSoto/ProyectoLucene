[{"date":"15 September 1999","score":"","review":"  I saw a sneak preview of _For Love of the Game_ this week, and I was happily surprised.  It immediately goes into my list of Top Ten Baseball Movies, along with (in no particular order) _Field of Dreams_, _Bull Durham_ (a Costner to Costner to Costner triple play!), _Eight Men Out_, _A League of Their Own_, _Bang the Drum Slowly_, Fear Strikes Out_, _The Bad News Bears_ and three others of your choice.  (Anyone who nominates either Babe Ruth biopic, with William Bendix or John Goodman, will be ejected immediately and banned from the game for life.)Costner plays an aging Tigers pitcher named Billy Chapel with very few strikes left in his sore arm.  It is a couple of days from the end of the season, his record is 8-11, (though with an ERA in the low 3's, which would have made him an All-Star in the real major leagues this year!), he is starting a game at Yankee Stadium that means a lot to the Yankees and nothing to Detroit, and he has just been told the team has been sold and he will be traded once the season ends.  Costner is athletic enough to play a baseball player convincingly (although they use a stand-in for some shots), and his acting range is better than he is given credit for these days.  He can be romantic, funny, self-absorbed, and angry, though his most comfortable persona is stoic with just a hint of sarcastic spine, and this role seems written for him.Perhaps surprisingly, I would say that less than a third of the film deals directly with baseball.  Baseball is the framing story (literally -- the whole film is a series of flashbacks during a single game) for what proves to be an unconventional but believable romance.  This is a great date movie the guys will love the baseball scenes, and the gals will love how our sympathies are always with Kelly Preston's Jane (the love interest), at least after the relationship has begun in earnest.Preston is fine as Jane, but the other supporting actors are better.  Jena Malone (_Contact_, _Stepmom_) is superb as Jane's daughter Heather.  John Reilly (_Boogie Nights_) has some of the best lines as Chapel's long-time friend and catcher.  And J. K. Simmons (_Oz_, _Law & Order_) does his usual fine job making a small role utterly convincing as the Tigers' skipper.The film uses special effects very well.  When Chapel focuses on his pitching, the stands blur and the obnoxious fans (this is New York, after all) are suddenly muted.  We really get the sense of what it means when athletes say they block everything out.All in all, this is a very satisfying film. Yes, the odds of a 40 year-old pitcher carrying a perfect game into the late innings (no spoilers here! you'll have to see it if you want to know if he gets that 27th out) are slim.  But the odds of any pitcher throwing a perfect game at any time are astronomical.  Baseball is the most serendipitous of sports, which is why it makes the best movies.  In any case, Chapel's performance is far more believable than the superficially similar but oh-so-ridiculous one by Steve Nebraska in _The Scout_ (what was Albert Brooks thinking?).A final note, and the explanation for my title.  Costner truly is a fine actor.  He is *not* a good writer or director.  When he just acts, we get films like this.  When he tries to do more, we get _Waterworld_.  Curse the Academy for ever convincing him otherwise by rewarding that cheap knock off of _Little Big Man_ called _Plays with Camera_.  I mean, _Dances with Wolves_.  Please, Kevin, stick to acting -- For the Love of the Movies!

Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not that movie, though I have to give it credit for trying.Kevin Costner plays somebody credited only as the Postman.  He's not actually a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western America devastated by some unspecified catastrophe.  He trades with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare.  Suddenly a pack of bandits called the Holnists, the self-declared warlords of the West, descend upon a village that Costner's visiting, and their evil leader Gen. Bethlehem (Will Patton) drafts Costner.  After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.We now finally get to the major premise the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman.  A number of the village people led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to get in on this postman act, which does not sit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the Holnists.The idea of The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds.  The Holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the Holnists can destroy any one village, but could not stand against all their victims united.  To unite, the villages must communicate with one another, and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the Holnists out of business.  So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers.  Unfortunately, Bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him, but instead your old standby cliche, the one-on-one brawl between him and Costner.  Nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard Hi, Aunt Debbie stuff played for maximum sentimental value.THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies, shot for shot, that I have ever seen.  Now, I don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next.  But here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I just knew what was going to happen next whether or not I wanted to know.  After a lion is prominently showcased eating people, a Holnist bandit seeking the escaped Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then shocked when the lion eats him.  A bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings out some Famous Last Words right before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise.

She played in Hitchcock's classic Rear window and she won an Oscar for best actress in The country girl and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, Dial M for murder.  Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time.  In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being Psycho (although I haven't seen Rear window yet).  Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player.  However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).  Mark writes crime stories.  The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it.  So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife.  But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go.  So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time.  The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark.  He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife.  What follows this is pure entertainment at its best.  As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer.  But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery.  He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be.  Another of his great performances is in Witness for the prosecution where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case.  As for Dial M for murder, well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.

His direction shows that he cares for the subject and the people and the landscape.  Everything is precise and pristine and immaculate.  I am not a huge historian when it comes to colonization in Canada, and that is a shame, perhaps I should be.  After all, my elementary school history teacher once told me that there are two things that are given to you when you are born, one is your name and the other is your nationality.  Be proud of both.  And it is subjects and films like this that he would have been proud of and so am I.  Although you can get just as much out of this if you are American, there is just a little more substance to it if you are Canadian.  After all, these were jesuits and these are the Iroquois and the Hurons and this is snowy, fridgid Quebec in the winter.  These are all very Canadian and it is a film that tries to shed some light on how our country became what it is today.  It is films like this that remind us as Canadians that we do have a history.  And as silly as that may sound, it is an important statement.  Go up to the average Canadian, any Canadian, young or old and ask them to name all the capitals of our 10 provinces and now 3 territories and I'll bet 6 times out of ten that they can't do it.

I think that he IS the best cowboy that ever played in movies and no one will ever come even close as to being as good a cowboy as he was.  Personally, I think his best movie was The searchers.  But in True grit, he simply outdid himself in his role and it's entirely understandable that he won the Oscar for best actor in 1969 for this role.  He was as brave and courageous as ever and he also delivered many laughs for the viewers.  Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) is seeking her father's murderer and when she learns his name, which is Emmett Quincy, she decides to go see an aging lawman called Reuben J. Rooster Cogburn (the Duke) and asks him to help her track down the killer.  But he only works if the prices are high enough.  So Mattie pays him a certain sum with which he is satisfied.  But then a young man named La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) decides to pay Rooster so that he may go with him and naturally, Rooster accepts.  So Mattie has to seek her father's killer with Rooster and La Boeuf.  But when Rooster learns that Emmett Quincy is working for Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall), he knows it isn't going to be easy to kill Quincy.  Now I won't say more about the movie to keep myself from spoiling any scenes of the movie.  As for the performances and the directing, well, as I already said, the Duke is great.  Glen Campbell isn't bad at all in the role of La Boeuf and Robert Duvall is as great as in any other of his movies.  The only sour touch, in my opinion, comes from Kim Darby, who seems to have concentrated too much on the annoying aspect of her character instead of all the aspects of her character.  So all in all, it's pretty good but don't start watching this movie that it's one of the Duke's classics because it isn't.  It only contains the Duke's academy award-winning performance which he totally deserved.  In other words, you should see it just to see just how good John Wayne was when he was at his best.

But when Rooster learns that Emmett Quincy is working for Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall), he knows it isn't going to be easy to kill Quincy.  Now I won't say more about the movie to keep myself from spoiling any scenes of the movie.  As for the performances and the directing, well, as I already said, the Duke is great.  Glen Campbell isn't bad at all in the role of La Boeuf and Robert Duvall is as great as in any other of his movies.  The only sour touch, in my opinion, comes from Kim Darby, who seems to have concentrated too much on the annoying aspect of her character instead of all the aspects of her character.  So all in all, it's pretty good but don't start watching this movie that it's one of the Duke's classics because it isn't.  It only contains the Duke's academy award-winning performance which he totally deserved.  In other words, you should see it just to see just how good John Wayne was when he was at his best.

I think that he IS the best cowboy that ever played in movies and no one will ever come even close as to being as good a cowboy as he was.  Personally, I think his best movie was The searchers.  But in True grit, he simply outdid himself in his role and it's entirely understandable that he won the Oscar for best actor in 1969 for this role.  He was as brave and courageous as ever and he also delivered many laughs for the viewers.  Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) is seeking her father's murderer and when she learns his name, which is Emmett Quincy, she decides to go see an aging lawman called Reuben J. Rooster Cogburn (the Duke) and asks him to help her track down the killer.  But he only works if the prices are high enough.  So Mattie pays him a certain sum with which he is satisfied.

That said, the movie is pretty good.  Alas, I've only seen it on T.V. and VHS, so I haven't seen the full power of the scope, but I've gotten a hefty dose of it, I think.  Many of the shots really are gorgeous, and some are quite powerful, too.  The first time I saw ut, for some reason I was so affected by the scene where Scarlett is driving Melanie, Prissy, and baby horugh a field right after the rain storm.  A rainbow is out and the sun is shining, but the field is bare and here and there are bloody corpses.  The devestation! I thought that first time I saw it; I really haven't thought otherwise in the 5 or so times I've seen it since.  While of course it was Selznick's picture and no one has ever argued with that, due credit must be given to the four directors (probably more) who worked on it for doing such a wonderful job in keeping the interest up through the whole four hours and doing such a great job at it, with only a few flagging-attention spots.  Then there's the acting.  Vivien Leigh is great; now I simply can't imagine anyone else as Scarlett.  Bette Davis?  Joan Crawford??  Norma Shearer???  Lucille Ball????  I just can't imagine any of them in the role when Leigh was so good.  To be able to be flirtatious, sexy, bitchy, strong-willed, and a cry-baby, all equally well!  She really brightens up the picture, and thank God for that; she's in every scene!  Clark Gable is wonderfully wry and provides a light touch, welcomely recieved, to the more sudsy, cheesy parts.  He and Leigh have marvelous chemistry, and he's very brave to be able to think he can tame her!  He plays it wonderfully cool in the last scene, while Leigh, in a very rare low spot, resorts to surprsingly annoying and cheesy histrionics, though she probably was so sick of the long hours\/months spent on this that she was just taking out her frustration the only way she knew how.  Olivia De Havilland quietly plays the part of Melanie wonderfully; without calling attention to herself, she provides a solid anchor for Scarlett and just acts the part wonderfully.  Leslie Howard is just dull as Ashley, but then maybe that was supposed to be the point, that Scarlett somehow was so convinced he was perfect that she failed to realize how wrong he was for her.  Hattie McDaniel as Mammy is funny, but not in a demeaning way.

Her performance was good enough to get an Oscar nomination, let alone the award, so that should say something!  Prissy, on the other hand, is pretty demeaning, because all she does is wail and act stupid.  No wonder Butterfly McQueen was ashamed of the role!  If I were her, I'd become a recluse and never think of leaving my house.  Yes, the view of slavery is over-simplified, but Peggy Mitchell's family's accounts of it probably were, too, as they didn't see anything wrong with it at all.Masterful performances for the most part, masterful direction, script, music, (Oh, the music!), cinemetography, scenery, and everything else is entirely masterful.

(trust me).I would never dream of telling you how it ends; but consider that this was directed by John Landis, think about the other films he's directed then see if what you expected comes out in the end.  It did for me.One final note I haven't seen An American Werewolf in Paris, but I have no desire to see any film trying to ape on the greatness achieved here.  Let well enough alone, will you, Hollywood??!Ten stars.  And I had no idea William Shakespeare was French.

Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over Leo and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects.  Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it.  While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on!  This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me.  I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful.  Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.

Working at a job he doesn't like, married to a woman (Annette Bening) he doesn't love, and parenting a daughter(Thora Birch) that has long stopped talking to him, Lester is a zombie in a world that he once had such high expectations for. Living in nameless suburbia, Lester's neighbors are a rigid military man(LONE STAR's Chris Cooper), his clinically depressed wife(DROP DEAD GORGEOUS's Allison Janney), and their 18 year-old son named Ricky(Wes Bentley). Ricky's only love in life is to videotape everything he considers beautiful. The sky, the wind, dead birds, and Lester's daughter Jane are all caught in Ricky's camcorder. When Lester falls hopelessly in lust with one of Jane's friends Angela(AMERICAN PIE's Mena Suvari), he begins a mid-life crisis chain reaction that will forever change the tranquillity of Lester's ideal neighborhood, and permanently alter Lester's life.This directing debut of Broadway's Sam Mendes(THE BLUE ROOM, the CABARET revival), AMERICAN BEAUTY cannot help but bring to mind the film RUSHMORE, the wonderful picture from last February. Both movies share an amazing similarity in tone and appearance. Both films are the product is minimal studio tampering, and most importantly, both films are the result of directors with fierce imagination and visual gumption. A English director making a film about American suburbia might be odd on paper, but Mendes captures the deeply woven world of BEAUTY with impeccable precision.It's the script by TV writer Alan Ball that I feel is BEAUTY's largest Achilles Heel. While the screenplay is wonderfully nuanced, chock full of strong characters and universal emotions, I couldn't help but to feel that the subject matter of hidden emotions lost in middle-class suburbia has already been done way too much. Ranging from Robert Redford's ORDINARY PEOPLE, to even the putrid actioner THE BIG HIT, every other movie these days seems to think it's breaking new ground by suggesting that suburban America might not be all it's cracked up to be. It's rather bland and unexciting, and AMERICAN BEAUTY's best moments come whenever that particular message is tucked safely away. The film has more fun with subplots involving Lester's mid-life crisis, his wife's infidelities, the neighbor's raging homophobia, and Lester's pining for Angela. Mendes has a great eye and Ball has a great ear, I just wish their targets were more original.With Kevin Spacey, I must admit that I had yet to fall under his charms. While a technically proficient actor, I really never enjoyed his performances as much as the fellow filmgoer. BEAUTY gives Spacey a much needed change of pace. Instead of creating a deeply pathos and dark character, Spacey takes the opportunity to showcase his sharp comedic skills. While not everything that happens to Lester is meant as comedy, Spacey takes each moment and works it for every emotion possible. We see Lester contempt, his pain, and his joy in each close-up. This is Spacey's best performance to date, I hope he doesn't lose the formula in future roles. Annette Bening also delivers a gangbusters performance as Carolyn Burnham. It's a role that is trickier than Spacey's, a character that doesn't invite much audience sympathy. Bening is a pro and works the angles nicely to give us a character that is never a monster, just a woman with her own problems. Thora Birch and Mena Suvari are underwhelming in the teenage roles, leaving only Wes Bentley alone to shine is his lead debut.  Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, and Chris Cooper are all fine in their supporting roles. The deep angst that AMERICAN BEAUTY covers is nice for a change. A film that takes some minor chances with plot selections and overall tone. BEAUTY is a film that often could be considered brilliant, only minor disappointment comes when the film cannot seem to keep a even pace. I think Mendes and Ball have created a film that will stir many emotions out of the audience. A thought provoking film told with moxie and care.

I loved his role as a ruthless killer.  I felt he did this role justice.  You have to remember that this is a MOVIE and not real life.  Sometimes I think people get to caught up in making movies real life.  The movie is about trying to catch an assasin Bruce Willis The Jackal.  They let an Irish terrorist (Richard Gere)out of prison to help catch him because he has had dealings with the jackal in the past.  Richard Gere isn't my most favorite actor but he did ok in this role.  Sidney P. as the FBI guy as always does his part justice.  I love the suspense and action.

Positing that the United States military presents a potentially greater threat to liberty than the Soviet regime might have made for interesting debate during Cold War times, but in the post-Cold War era it rings dated and hollow.  People have overinflated the braggadocio of General Curtis LeMay way too much in assessing the attitudes of America's military during this period and to me, Seven Days In May ultimately puts forth a dangerous idea that only our military stood in the way of reaching an earlier accomodation with the Soviet Union.I will note that the movie version skewers itself toward the philosophy of President Jordan Lyman (Frederic March) much more than the novel does, because the novel has an interesting wrinkle that forces one to think harder about the motives of General Scott.  In the novel, we discover that in fact the fears of General Scott and his plotters are borne out when President Lyman discovers that the Soviets do intend to cheat on his disarmament treaty.  In the end, the power of Lyman's argument to Scott is when he notes that if faced with the same crisis as president, the general would really act no differently than he (Lyman) intends to.  A much more effective, and fair, point than the perspective served up by the movie.While the character of Jiggs Casey is strengthened from the novel (he's much more wishy-washy in the book; Kirk Douglas instead portrays him as an admirer of General Scott who is torn between his admiration for the man and his respect for the rule of law), there are other things that make the film more silly today.  A right wing television commentator?  That's the strangest case of science-fiction I ever saw!  And Ava Gardner looks more haggard than usual this time out.

This movie is fantastic. The photography is incredible, the set design is as fitting as humanly possible, and Brandon Lee makes a surprisingly good undead. Here's the plot line. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend\/fiancee, Shelley (Sophia Shinas) are the ideal couple with a romance that conquers all-including death. However, the local crime gang interrupts that on halloween (eve or night, I can't remember) and rapes his fiancee. When Eric comes in in the middle of this, he tries to stop them. This gets him thrown out the window and his girlfriend killed. Young, tough, and street-wise Sarah (Rochelle Davis) always looked up to Eric and Shelley, and always imagined them as the caring parents she never had. She can see right through local cop Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) when he says they're going to be OK.However, 1 year later on Halloween  (eve or night) the darkest city I've ever seen in a movie and the local crime gang are in for a surprise. For, Eric Draven, surprise surprise, is back from the grave. Led by a mysterious crow (who the audience can obviously tell holds Eric's soul), Eric finds clothes and makeup to disguise his true identity. He then goes to find revenge on those who took the 2 most precious things to him-his wife and his life. He kills them one by one, now invincible because he is already dead.Each time he leaves some kind of mark in the shape of a crow (A blood painting, and a trail of lit gasoline, etc.) Albrecht vaguely remembers Eric from last Halloween (Eve or night) and meets Eric after his 2nd murder. He and Eric have the hilarious confrontation You move and you're dead!!! And I say I'm dead...and I move. Whenever anyone meets Eric, he mysteriously dissapears, until Sarah recognizes him from a quote of his and confronts him. After he kills the men he thinks are responsible for last Halloween (eve or night), he meets the real man behind the plan--Top Dollar (Michael Wilcott), who is the leader of the crime gang. Then things start to get interesting. I won't give away the ending. Brandon Lee puts on a great performance, and sadly, his last, as irony entered the situation and when he was supposed to be shot with a blank he was actually shot for real. This is probably the darkest movie I've ever seen that still managed to be a romance. A Must-see (4½ out of 5, 1\/2 point off for a little predictability).
