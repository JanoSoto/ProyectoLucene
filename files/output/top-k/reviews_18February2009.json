Kurz was right that the audience did not only care for the spectacle.Lucas first 2 movies where awesome. Especially in the frame of time. This third installment was inevitable. And it does not disappoint in a lot of ways.The effects where very good. The sets used brilliant. Jabba the hut and his gang where fantastic to see. I liked the addition of new rebel alliance characters too.And thankfully the spectacle was of very high quality. The fighting scenes in space and the Death Star very entertaining. The Endor fights and Ewoks a suspencefull part.And although the acting wasn't of the highest order, i did enjoy Mark Hamills portrait of Luke Skywalker. I thought Harrison Ford was great as ever. In fact without him wouldv given the movie a lot less attraction. Carrie Fisher so endearing. the lovestory between her an Solo was nice and warm. James Earl Jones voice for Vader absolutely perfect. All in all the movie was a pleasure to watch and gave plenty of emotions.The only flaw must have been the plot and the storyline. Luke, without any additional training, is suddenly a full blown jedi. Who doesn't use any of his force against the Rancor, but does so against Vader, only to lose everything again against the emperor. Strange.Weakened Vader was still strong enough to lift the Emperor and throw him in a shaft without the latter making any attempt to fight back. The same thing happened between Windu and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith; the most powerful jedi Windu powerless and defenseless when his arm suddenly gets chopped by Anakin and falls out a window. I guess he wasn't so powerful after all.Then the continuous fighting between Imperial and Rebel fighters; even though the emperor was dead and defeated, and Vader could easely have ordered to cease fire and surrender, the rebels keep fighting and eventually destroy the death star. A simple cease fire would have given the rebels a big equipped death star too. The cheering around the galaxy was also strange; even when the Death Star was defeated, why would the other Imperial troops surrender? They where still much much stronger than the small rebel army.I hope and Im looking forward to perhaps 3 following movies. Lucas is more than capable of doing so. However i hope he makes the story stick too. And stops using so many CGI effects. It gives the movie the look of animation like tom and jerry. Return of the Jedi, was imo, the best mix of puppets and CGI use.

I still think that Tarzan is the last great Disney movie, but pretty much everything else after lacks the magic that Disney once had, as far as I'm concerned.(with the exception of the surprisingly good Fantasia 2000, Bambi 2 and Emperor's New Groove) 10 years ago, this was one of my all-time favourites. I remember, every time I went swimming, I felt really inspired to be a mermaid. That's the effect this movie and the TV series had on me. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially the underwater scenes, and the storm. The script is intelligent and witty, and everyone involved did a marvellous job putting it across. The songs are fantastic, as always with Alan Menken. In fact, the only score of Alan Menken's I don't like is Home on the Range. My favourites are Part of your World(my sister is always singing it around the house) and the wonderfully energetic Under the Sea. The characters are probably the most memorable in a Disney movie, especially Ariel, a beautiful and feisty mermaid, with a dream of being a human. She has a beautiful voice also, well we have the talented Jodi Benson to thank for that. Sebastian is so funny here, a he was in the series, but as well as Flounder(another great character)he was ruined in the sequel. Kenneth Mars's Triton is an inspiring father-figure, who reminds me of my grandfather. The best character is without question, Ursula, who scarred me for life after watching her. Likewise with The Evil Manta from the series. Whilst her song is probably the least memorable song of the movie, it still works. Flotsam and Jetsam are also really creepy. Miles better than Ursula's really bland sister Morgana at any rate.To round off, I can't forget Louis the chef. He is so funny here, unlike in the sequel, where the same joke was repeated but badly underplayed. I can't believe some people hate this movie. It is one of Disney's best along with Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Sleeping Beauty. Highly recommended for all ages. 10\/10.

I was introduced to this about a month ago, I watched it, and I was actually impressed. It is not as good as the above titles, but I can name a lot worse animated films, believe me, the Secret of NIMH sequel anyone?! The film is flawed, but on the whole it is a fun sweet film for kids. The animation is very good, but is a little flat in some places. But the animation sequence in Let me be your wings is breathtaking. Speaking of the songs, they aren't bad at all. They are very pleasant, and beautifully orchestrated with lovely tunes even if some of the lyrics were hard to understand. The incidental music was lovely too. The best aspect was the story. It stayed close to the original fairytale, while adding a little bit on. All of the characters are very much the same, and none of the essence is lost, save for some slow scenes in the middle half. The characterisations are fine. Jodi Benson is a very talented singing actress, and she had the best song of the movie, Let me be your Wings, which was stunning audibly and artistically, and she does do a good job as Thumbelina. People find Thumbelina annoying and patronising, I find her cute and pretty and she means well. Cornelius was a little bland, but I warmed to him. The toads were funny, especially during that really fast Spanish song. My favourite character is Jaquimo, what a great accent, and Thumbelina's mother is a warm and loving character and provides the film's most touching moment in the reprise of Soon! Other voice actors are Gilbert Gottfried, John Hurt and Carol Channing. All in all, a pleasant animation, that is misunderstood. 7\/10.

The story of the film is very funny, touching and heartwarming, but at the same time it flirts with some serious social subjects such as poverty, escapism and mass-media manipulation.The characters start off as typical bigger-than-life stereotypes of the people the tabloids write about all the time, but as the film progresses, they strip themselves of that stage persona that make them a bit hard for an average audience to relate to. They become more ordinary, more real. Their oblivion becomes their opportunity for redemption in a world where redemption isn't really necessary.Some of the personalities that revolve around the main characters are more cartoonish than others (typical of golden era Hollywood). Take for instance Sullivan's wife-for-hire (Ursula Sessions) and her submissive accountant (or his fast-talking producers, wonderfully played by Robert Warwick and William Demarest), but who really stole my heart was Veronica Lake's character, The Girl, whose antics behind that dirty face and those over-sized hobo clothes are just about as adorable as those of Diane Keaton in Annie Hall --perhaps even more! (ok, so maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, all right)! But anyway, I wouldn't in a million years have guessed from watching this picture that Lake was such a hard gal to get along with in real life. So difficult she was, that after the filming of Sullivan's... was completed in 1941, Lloyd refused to work with her ever again. How about that? Now, what's the movie about? John L. Lloyd 'Sully' Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is an established Hollywood film director in the early 1940s. He thinks of his films as profound works of art that have high social and political significance (for all of human kind), but his two studio producers think that his latest film is simply a vehicle for communist propaganda. This makes it hard for Sullivan to convince them of backing up his latest project, Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?, a grim story about poverty and suffering --subjects that his producers do not think are Sully's biggest strengths. They try to convince him of making a lighter, more commercial picture, Sully adamantly refuses to that idea. After a while, the producers come to the conclusion that, with a little bit of sex and guns here and there, any movie could become a hit. Sullivan agrees (quite unconvinced.) The movie Sullivan wants to make is a go. The producer aren't happy. (Talk about where the hell Altman got a big chunk of his inspiration for The Player!!) Driven by his desire to make Oh, Brother... the best and most realistic movie he can make, Sullivan decides to detach himself from his privileges in order to go on a field trip away from sunny California and into the dark alleys of his own tenacity... disguised as a hobo. Hours later, after an attempt to leave Los Angeles in search of misery and all it has to teach him, Sullivan is back in Hollywood due to circumstances he can't quite comprehend. Sitting at a dinner without enough change to buy himself a decent breakfast, he meets a sultry blonde, The Girl, a disappointed aspiring actress on her way out of La La Land, who offers to buy him some ham and eggs. She sits with him. They talk. They eat.. and then... well, then you are on your way to movie heaven! After a couple of hours (in movie time), The Girl learns all about Sully's scheme to pose as a homeless guy in order to prepare himself to direct his next movie. She then decides to accompany him on his odyssey by disguising herself as another hobo --a very loyal and extremely lovable one in this case (maybe she's thinking of her career at this point--who knows?). They subsequently make several attempts to leave the state of California and scape the studio-hired safety crew that follows them around in a huge mobile home (a doctor and a lawyer included), but they are unsuccessful at it. Sullivan, no matter how much he tries to escape Hollywood, always ends up under the protective comforts of his own good fortune...that is until he decides to take one last venture on his own.After escaping his own house in order to thank all of his former homeless fellow men and women for their wonderful kindness (merely not minding him or his tom-boy companion) during his rather unsuccessful research trip, nobody hears from Sully again.Suffice to say that Sullivan, weeks later, ends up on the front page of all the newspapers in town when proof of his assassination reaches Hollywood. Everyone is outraged. The truth is that he has not been assassinated, but mugged. Unfortunately for him, he ends up unconscious in one of the wagons of a train heading far away from California... heading for real trouble (at last). When he wakes up, confused by not remembering who he is or where he's at, he attacks a security officer, which lands him a sentence of six years in a hard-labor camp.At the Labor Camp he regains his memory little by little, but he then can't convince anyone that he is a famous Hollywood Director.

I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie?

I didn't care about the comics too much, the movies didn't seem to spark my interest, and just about anything Batman-related seemed lame to me. Then The Dark Knight came along. And all I heard were scores of people say its the best movie ever, and Heath was the best Joker ever, and all that fun stuff. So, being the investigative person I am, set out to prove this theory wrong.I wasn't really pleased by The Dark Knight. I mean it was good, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't God-like. And Heath was good, just also wasn't God-Like. Then I saw this movie and all I have to say is Wow...that and this small summary following it The comic book style this movie had really made it fun. It was very fictional and old-fashioned, which brought it to life. The dialogue, costumes, sets, all of it really authentic comic style. This movie had a lot of dark comedy that was lacked in the Dark Knight, which brought it to life I think.Michael Keaton really impressed me as Batman\/Bruce Wayne. His Batman voice was authentic sounding and not forced, plus he had a lot of humor and a laid-back style as Bruce Wayne. However, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the spotlight here. All he had to do was play his crazy personality that we've all come to expect from him. Only this time with a lot more comedy. He was undoubtedly my favorite Joker. Kim Basinger was decent as Vicki Vale. She just didn't seem to shine all that much. However, I think maybe she wasn't supposed to all that much. Robert Wuhl was hilarious as Knox, Vicki's partner. I think he deserved much more screen time. Michael Gough was perfect as Alfred. It was as if Alfred was written specifically for him but we all know that isn't true. Pat Hingle was very good as Commissioner Gordon, although he didn't get a whole lot of screen time\/back story. Jack Palance was out-shined here, but filled the role of Carl Grisson very well. And lastly Tracey Walter was hilarious as Bob, Joker's personal goon.Aside from good music, set, and acting, the plot was solid. A lot of back-story at the right times, and twists that worked in the end.Best superhero movie I've seen in a while, it got me into Batman, I can tell you that much.

The characters in this film can be found up and down the North East Coast the scenery is spectacular (although I would have to be bias and say my own home town of Cullen is much more stunning than Pennan lol). Filmed at a time when the oil boom in Scotland was pretty much at its height there we were used to the sight of high flying Americans, most of them would fall in love with the North East and many are still there to this day, taken prisoner by the scenery and the people. Local Hero goes down as one of my top 5 movies of all time especially now as I am working in the middle east, watching it gives me just that little reminder of home that always brings a smile to my face. For me the standout moments of the film take place in the Lab scenes, Ricky Fulton did not do many movies but his performance as the scientist was small but excellent. RIP Ricky...... a great Scots comedian sadly missed. Burt Lancaster was also fantastic... as was Fulton MacKay (best known for his portrayal of Mr MacKay the prison warder in the legendary Porridge series starring the legendary Ronnie Barker).
