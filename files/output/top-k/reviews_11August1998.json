The  acting was great, it makes you feel like when you walk outside an asteroid  is going to fall out of the sky any moment.  It also made me think  personally about my family.  At the end you almost feel the pain for  Gracie.  I mean come on, her father has just died saving the world and  herself, the rest of the world is rejoicing while she is trying to figure  out what she will do now without her father.   This movie gets a 10 in my book.

In 1839, those  questions were more difficult to answer then they are now.  Yet, the  mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current  situations.That is, in essence, what Steven Spielberg's gripping drama Amistad is  about.  Through its various dramas, Spielberg presents a case about a group  of Africans, who, after being seized from their home, were forced onto a  ship and sent to the United States aboard La Amistad.  On their way there,  the slaves, led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of  the crew.  However, the ship was still directed towards the United States,  where the Africans were brought to trial under murder.  In the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and therefore  try to seize them away.  The United States government, led by President  Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), and Secretary of State Secretary  Forsyth (David Paymer), try to ship the Africans to Spain, where an 11 year  old Isabella II (Anna Paquin) wants them back.  The two Spaniards who own  La Amistad want the slaves for themselves.  The American ship that found  the slaves also wants them.  In the midst of this are two abolitionists  (Stellan Skaarsgard and Morgan Freeman), who want the slaves to be free.   They enlist the help of lawyer Matthew McConaughey, who tries to free them.   Through various legal proceedings, the case appears before the Supreme  Court, where it is argued by ex-President John Quincy Adams (Anthony  Hopkins).The film itself is a visual wonder.  Spielberg favorite Janusz Kaminski sets  the film in a dark, somber mood when appropriate, and a visual setting when  appropriate as well.  At times, the film is very slow, and very methodical.   Spielberg is not at his finest here, the courtroom scenes have a tendency  to lag.  But Spielberg's finest work in the film, the opening scene, a  scene of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America,  is altogether stunning.  It is this emotional force that carries the film.   McConaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the Africans, Hopkins is  sensational as the old Adams, Freeman is outstanding when used (Spielberg  vastly under uses his supreme talents), and the rest of the cast is stellar.   The movie, however, belongs to Hounsou.  His emotional intensity is  brilliant.  Spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with  focus on Hounsou, and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating.   The film is flawed, for most of the supporting characters are merely  cardboard.  But that doesn't matter.  The story is a gripping one, and one  of extreme importance.  Kudos to Spielberg for finding it, finding the  right men for the job, and letting the audience listen to the words of  Cinque.  A good job all around.  ***1\/2 out of 4, or an 8 out of 10.
