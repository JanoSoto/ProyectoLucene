But I find the films to be a lot of fun, and considering the sheer number of sequels (seven and a remake to date) for the most part each film does manage to bring something new to the series, and considering the original concept of a haunted house doesn't lend much in the way of creative flexibility, it has been fun to watch the different ways in which the subject matter is approached.Amityville 1992  It's About Time (or simply Amityville It's About Time as it is known on DVD) continues the theme of items from the original Amityville house ending up in new households, only to wreak havoc, as introduced in Amityville The Evil Escapes.

One film that perhaps won't immediately hit you is this one; 'Barry Lyndon' and this is a great shame.The one thing Barry Lyndon has going for it all the way through is the feeling of luck\/chance. The film is impossible to predict and this instantly makes it good as it grabs you and draws you into its world. It also does this with its wonderful collection of 'mise-en-scene' on display. The costumes are out of this world, the continually mole-faced characters are delightful as they are juxtaposed for their time and the settings are as consistently different and refreshing as each other.When I was watching this film, it felt like some sort of gritty crime drama set a few hundred years ago. Lyndon's climb up the aristocracy's hierarchy sneaks up on you a little bit as you realise that he's got to make something of his life given the position he's now facing. All this is kicked off following a nicely done and particularly moving love story early on. The brutish, overly confident British soldier\/captain has spoiled Lyndon's love interest and everything is set up superbly for the actual incident to happen. Once the journey starts, you can't tell which way it's going. While totally engrossing and maintaining that luck\/chance feeling throughout the first hour, 'Lyndon' sucks you in and doesn't exhale for a moment. Everything that happens is an experience and keeps you interested as to what the outcome might be.What also struck me about the film is that at times, you have no idea what the characters are even saying. From memory, the characters interact in German and some form of 'Prussian' and the gyp is there are no subtitles (!) However, this isn't a bad thing in fact it adds to the experience. It would be spoiled if some tacky looking 1970's style font popped up telling what it is everyone is saying. It gives you the feel that you're actually there with them and it's great.Unfortunately, no film is without its flaws be it length or otherwise and the film suffers from this. During 'part 2' of the film, and especially during his married life; the film falters. The character settle down and it feels like he's reached the end of his journey until something pretty unpredictable and shocking kick starts it again, but this is quite a while later. There isn't much energy in the film, the narration dries up and the settings stays the same. In fact, it's rather dull at this point.But, as I've mentioned, something kick starts it again and it's back on the road of unpredictability and anguish.Definitely one of the most under-rated films of the 1970's and shouldn't be forgotten when thinking of Kubrick's best films.

I came to the film relatively late in life- reading other IMDb entries people often talk about it as the stuff of nostalgia, something they caught as a kid or teenager, and that worried me- I didn't grow up on these films, how would I find them as an adult viewing for the first time? Truthfully it's a lot of fun. It's an intriguing little set up, where some interesting characters find themselves in a grand hotel with killer puppets on the loose. Whether it's deliberate, or the side effect of a low budget, we do get a lot of character development and some exploration of the different manifestations of psychic ability in the lead characters. Some nice moments of snappy dialogue too- special mention has to go to Irene Miracle as Dana, who has some wonderfully cutting one liners.The inevitable twists are silly and hammy, but you get the sense that this is all done with a self deprecating sense of humour. While it's far from slapstick, there is a camp sense of humour in this film- after all it IS about killer puppets! The movie is certainly worth a rent- but be in the right frame of mind for it. I wouldn't say it was a party film, it's a quiet little film that isn't afraid to take its time building up the situation and characters, so perhaps more for a quiet night in and a change of pace from modern, loud, ultra slick cinema.I have to mention the stop-motion effects used to animate the puppets. I found this to be really effective, rather than dated as other reviewers have mentioned. I find in these days of CGI, it was a real treat to watch, and did have a certain realism you find missing in computer animation today.I luckily managed to get hold of this much discussed Puppet Master 1- 7 Box Set from Full Moon- even more surprising as I live in the UK!

Kara (Helen Slater) lives in a greenhouse-style contraption in innerspace founded by Zaltar (Peter O' Toole) who sculptures creations inspired from a visit to Earth. It is only fitting that he messes things up by stealing and losing the planet's energy source omega headron (sounds like the word Armageddon to me...hmmmm). It ends up in the hands of an opportunistic amateur witch called Selena (Faye Dunnaway) as she picnics with her partner-in-crime and computer science teacher friend called Nigel (Peter Cook). She turns her back on him and, with her sidekick Bianca (Brenda Vaccaro) tries to take over the world...sort of.In the meantime, Kara changes into schoolgirl Linda Lee (her influence being a poster of general Robert Lee) and befriends a lady called Lucy Lane (Maureen Teefy). This becomes her 'Clark Kent' style disguise.First of all, the bad points. Yep, there are some plot holes and some of the dialogue is pretty poor (a lot of it coming from Bianca). Plot holes include...* The main premise for all the saving the world stuff is because an artist needed inspiration which is pretty laughable. Apparently, it is declared during the film that Zaltar is a founder of the city so, if the city has 2 energy sources, why would he resort to stealing one when all he needed to do was use his influence as a founder and ask the guardians for permission to borrow it legitimately? This simple step would mean his trip to the Phantom Zone by the guardians wouldn't be necessary...of course, if he went down this road we would have no film, lol.* We ought to ask the question 'Why is Selena so unambitious'? She has all the power in the world at her disposal, why use it just to attract a random man called Ethan who she sees cutting down a tree? With all the power in the world why use a magical coconut to knock him unconscious? I guess at least Selena upgraded from that ghost train to live on a mountain inexplicably plonked in the middle of town...* At the end when Supergirl crosses the 'fiery floor of doom' why didn't she just fly over it instead of cross it gingerly on foot? If I did read a lot of DC comics on Supergirl I would probably be more than a bit miffed that the film didn't fit in with the comic. As I didn't read them, I don't care.As with most films, the key to being critical is asking yourself 'what do I expect to get out of it?' I believe that this film was only meant to be taken as a fun fantasy tale with a linear plot of good vs evil with effects that belonged to it's time (and some of them like the gargoyle is pretty interesting). It worked for Superman, why should Supergirl dare to be any different in it's approach? There is some odd casting (notably veteran British comedian Peter Cook of all people getting his shot in US cinema as 'Nigel') but most of it seems to work regardless. Peter O' Toole fits into the role of Zaltar pretty well and Helen Slater has never been better cast as Kara\/Linda Lee\/Supergirl. Unfortunately, Faye Dunnaway is left with very little to do despite be a cause for a multitude of special effects as her acting in this seemed unmotivated and formulaic. Brenda Vaccara comes off worst as Bianca, not necessarily because of her acting as a whole but because she was given most of the really awful lines.Some of the effects are rickety (the storms in the Phantom Zone spring to mind) but if you have a nostalgic nature you will most probably be charmed by them rather than repulsed - like looking at a Betamax video for the first time in 30 years, lol.All in all, a great camp absurd fantasy film providing you view it for what it is...a camp absurd fantasy film.

First, Charles Bronson's character, Paul Kersey, would have a relative or close friend murdered by street scum. Further mayhem would befall ancillary characters so as to goad Kersey into a righteous killing frenzy. One significant variation that this formula allowed is that in each succeeding movie the weaponry Kersey will use to blow away assorted miscreants will get more and more elaborate. From the hand pistol Kersey used in the first Death Wish movie, we now get enormous elephantine hand guns that could actually kill a real elephant as well WWII Browning machine guns as well as grenade launchers by the third film. Also, the criminals Kersey is up against aren't just assorted street punks as in the first Death Wish film but now a criminal army with enough firepower to take on the Iraqi insurgents in Baghdad.What is truly striking in the last 30 minutes of the movie is that with the mayhem going on, the government didn't force the issue and send in the US Army to restore order as the Union Army did do in New York during the Draft Riots of 1863 while the Civil War was going on. Another priceless moment in the film is the ease with which Kersey is able to receive serious ordinance through the US mail. If it really was as easy as shown in the film, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations really missed an opportunity in arming themselves in the US.Like I said, the film defines improbable to extremely unlikely. It's a revenge fantasy of truly baroque extremes and frankly enjoyable on that level. In the Death Wish world, there is no moral ambiguity. There are good decent people and then there are street scum. Here, the street scum harass, maim and kill the decent and the police are oddly helpless. Even though the criminals are dressed so garishly and distinctively from the characters who are good and decent, no one seems able to obtain any evidence against them. So, the only solution is just to shoot them dead. It's nice that the criminals in these films are all unredeemable psychopaths who dress quite distinctively so even a child could kill them with a clear conscience(as a few do in one of the many disturbing scenes at the end during the big shoot-out). In sum, not total trash, not really good, fascistic in a really simple-minded way (for a more complex pro-fascistic perspective, I recommend viewing the Depression political fantasy film, Gabriel over the White House, from 1933) that doesn't go beyond offering shooting street scum like turkeys as a way to solve crime but undeniably exciting.

He's capable of making enjoyable films, but they often feel trite and uninspired. However, with Apollo 13 he comes closet to making something that achieves greatness.But it must be said that it would take an unspeakably awful filmmaker to make a poor movie about the Apollo 13 story. All you have to do is stick close to the facts, film it and not get in the way. And I guess that's what Howard does, for his directing style is pretty anonymous and his viewpoint is narrow &#150; the film doesn't really concern itself with the politics of Apollo. And while in some cases that could hurt a film, here it's the right decision, because rather than try and be a critique of the space programme it's the simple story of a bunch of guys trying to get home &#150; too much commentary would detract from the drama.Not that there isn't the odd bit of commentary here and there. There's a good scene where the astronauts are broadcasting from their craft, not knowing that the TV networks have dumped them &#150; already space exploration has become boring. And there's also the scene where the media try and set up shop on Marilyn Lovell's lawn &#150; the media are only interested in the mission once the crew are in jeopardy. And on top of this you get a few digs at NASA bureaucracy. But aside from that, the film assumes you're in awe of space exploration and that you agree with the Apollo programme.And while the flag waving nature of the film with its patriotic music, long pauses and hushed voices is its weakness, it's also its strength, because as absurd and expensive as space travel is, it still touches something deep inside. There's something moving about a bunch of guys risking their lives to push the boundaries. And although Teflon is the greatest thing that space exploration has produced, there's a sense of wonder and pride in knowing that men have managed to break the shackles of the Earth and walked on the Moon (anyone who thinks the landings were hoaxed should be shot &#150; conspiracy theorists are perhaps even more worthless than Goths).Therefore there's quite a bit of emotion when Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) realises that he wont be walking on the Moon. This is his dream and its been dashed. And there's a great scene when the craft orbits the Moon. Knowing that he won't be walking on it, he refuses to look, knowing that to gaze upon it would be torture. But despite his reluctance, his resolve eventually cracks and when he turns back round he imagines what it would have been like to walk on the surface. It's a small moment of fantasy, but it brilliantly illustrates the joy that has been denied this man.Less effective is the scene where Lovell explains the lunar landing to his son. The intention is okay &#150; to make light of the risks for the sake of family &#150; but the kid is a little too cutesy. And I also dislike the scenes with Lovell's mother. She's a dotty old woman and serves as the film's comic relief &#150; she asks Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin whether they're part of the space programme. But the film should have either made her more believable or dispensed with her entirely.Much more effective are the scenes with mission control. Ed Harris is great as always and there are some moments of real tension. Plus the scenes with mission control show what a team effort it was to bring the astronauts back home. And I even forgave the film scenes of mass whooping, because although a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans whooping usually irritates the hell out of me, I was almost joining in. I felt like punching the air when the rocket took off and I felt like raising the roof when the crew landed in the Pacific &#150; finally here's something worth whooping about.Another of the film's strengths is its attention to detail. All the technical jargon, all the confusing buttons and all the convoluted procedures have a convincing air of authenticity. And it also helps that some of the scenes were shot in zero G. It allows you to concentrate on the story (dodgy effects would have been a huge distraction). And the zero G produces a couple of wonderful moments, the first being Bill Paxton puking chunks (we've all wondered what weightless vomiting would look like) and the second occurring during the television broadcast that was ditched for baseball when Paxton throws his sunglasses at the camera &#150; it captures the fun of space.But really the film works best as the story of a bunch of guys trying to get back home (and it's apt that one of the craft was named Odyssey, as the journey has a lot in common with Homer's epic poem). And while that means that the film doesn't have a whole lot to say on an intellectual level, it works superbly on an emotional one.

Thus, 1992 heralded the return of both quirky director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton stepping into the batsuit once again. However, unlike most sequels which generally at best equal the quality of their predecessor, usually falling terribly short of the mark, Burton's Returns vastly surpasses the original in almost every possible shape and form. While an entertaining film, the first Batman was deeply flawed, a large portion of which was the film was mainly diverted towards showcasing Jack Nicholson's inspired, show stealing performance as homicidal clown prince of crime The Joker. Nicholson's performance was a triumph, but the downside being that because he was shown so often, viewers got almost no time to get to know Keaton's oddball millionaire and edgy crimefighter title character. Burton rectifies this mistake by diverting much more of the focus of his sequel towards Batman himself, while still churning up a fascinating new cauldron of villains and action setpieces. Once again, Burton's wonderfully creative Gothic design comes to play, but Returns shows perhaps his most beautiful scenery yet. The idea for the story to take place at Christmastime was novel, as Burton has several beautifully affecting shots of characters seen through slowly floating snowflakes. The single most affecting shot is the title sequence shot of the baby Penguin's carriage slowly drifting down the snowy river into the sewers, accompanied by Danny Elfman's simply wonderful score, arguably his best to date, save perhaps the Spider-Man films. Batman Returns, as well as being supremely entertaining is also a surprisingly beautiful and moodily shot movie. But Burton also improves on his prior film in other aspects - namely the action sequences have been amped up considerably, and Batman actually does some fighting, unlike the first where it looked like poor Keaton could barely move in the suit. The absence of Prince songs on the soundtrack is... liberating to say the least, namely because it makes more room for Elfman's majestic score, and... honestly, Prince and Batman do not, and should never have mixed. The script also has more memorable and well crafted lines this time round, save those given to Nicholson's Joker, even if the storyline does seem a bit uneven at times (The Penguin seems to be radically altering his master plan about every five minutes, which gets a bit disjointing). The primary cast is nothing less than spectacular, with Keaton giving a much stronger rendition of both his oddball quirky recluse Bruce Wayne, and much more stylish and classy while under the cape and cowl. It's quite a mercy he is given more screen time this time round, as we feel we finally get to know the man behind the mask a bit this time. Danny DeVito makes a terrifying, disturbing and pitiful Penguin, as well as the character and all his foils likely could have been played. Michelle Pfeiffer easily steals the show and creates an iconic femme fatale character as the mysteriously seductive Catwoman. Pfeiffer is nothing less than flat out gorgeous, and her oozing charisma and sexuality is enough to make any man me-ow. Christopher Walken also has a wonderful appearance as corrupt businessman Max Shreck, as always, getting some of the most memorable lines in the film (Bruce Wayne?! Why are you dressed up like Batman?!). Michael Gough as usual IS Alfred, and there's nothing else to be said. Altogether, Burton has rounded together a picturesque, (apart from Pfeiffer as well...) beautiful and very entertaining follow up to his first Batman adventure, with a superb rogues gallery and some much needed time to get to know the said man behind the mask. The story may be somewhat disjointed, and not terribly realistic, but it's a comic book movie - realism is seldom an element present. Any fans of the Dark Knight or Burton's eccentric creativity, Batman Returns should be considered a must view. -9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 September 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After 1989 boasted the legendary Dark Knight's triumphant explosion onto movie screens worldwide, a sequel to the smash hit seemed destined to occur.

Batman Returns, as well as being supremely entertaining is also a surprisingly beautiful and moodily shot movie. But Burton also improves on his prior film in other aspects - namely the action sequences have been amped up considerably, and Batman actually does some fighting, unlike the first where it looked like poor Keaton could barely move in the suit. The absence of Prince songs on the soundtrack is... liberating to say the least, namely because it makes more room for Elfman's majestic score, and... honestly, Prince and Batman do not, and should never have mixed. The script also has more memorable and well crafted lines this time round, save those given to Nicholson's Joker, even if the storyline does seem a bit uneven at times (The Penguin seems to be radically altering his master plan about every five minutes, which gets a bit disjointing). The primary cast is nothing less than spectacular, with Keaton giving a much stronger rendition of both his oddball quirky recluse Bruce Wayne, and much more stylish and classy while under the cape and cowl. It's quite a mercy he is given more screen time this time round, as we feel we finally get to know the man behind the mask a bit this time. Danny DeVito makes a terrifying, disturbing and pitiful Penguin, as well as the character and all his foils likely could have been played. Michelle Pfeiffer easily steals the show and creates an iconic femme fatale character as the mysteriously seductive Catwoman. Pfeiffer is nothing less than flat out gorgeous, and her oozing charisma and sexuality is enough to make any man me-ow. Christopher Walken also has a wonderful appearance as corrupt businessman Max Shreck, as always, getting some of the most memorable lines in the film (Bruce Wayne?! Why are you dressed up like Batman?!). Michael Gough as usual IS Alfred, and there's nothing else to be said. Altogether, Burton has rounded together a picturesque, (apart from Pfeiffer as well...) beautiful and very entertaining follow up to his first Batman adventure, with a superb rogues gallery and some much needed time to get to know the said man behind the mask. The story may be somewhat disjointed, and not terribly realistic, but it's a comic book movie - realism is seldom an element present. Any fans of the Dark Knight or Burton's eccentric creativity, Batman Returns should be considered a must view. -9\/10 ","genre":"Action"},{"date":"2 September 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is too good for words.

It just hit me right in the heart, in the most vulnerable, deepest part of my soul. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's the best I can do with my limited writing ability. Now understand, I was 39 years old at the time, a pipefitter\/welder by trade, certainly not someone people would think of as sensitive or artistic by nature. I've been in more than my share of fistfights, ride a Harley, and love guns, power tools, and anything that explodes. But by the end of Edward Scissorhands, especially at the Ice Dance scene, I was sobbing like a little girl. My wife had to help me out of the theatre, because my eyes were so tear-swollen I could barely see. I admit I have a weakness for characters that are outsiders, or (to borrow from Heinlein) strangers in a strange land, but what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did with this scissor-handed man was nothing short of magical. I took my 16 year old daughter to see it the next day, and I started tearing up at the beginning this time, knowing what was coming. As we left the theatre, Liz was stone-faced, and I was desperately clenched against the flood of emotion I was holding back. I didn't want to look like a fool in front of her. When we got into the sunlight, we looked at each other, and I saw that she was trying as hard as me not to break down. Which is exactly what we both proceeded to do, right there in front of the theatre. We held each other and sobbed. And I felt closer to her than I had in a long time.
