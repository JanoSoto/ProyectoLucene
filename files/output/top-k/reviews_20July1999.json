I was pleasantly surprised to laugh harder at this movie than I did at the new South Park movie.  None of the jokes had any foul language or sexual inferences, but still poked fun at society just as much if not more than South Park did.  Of course the obvious message was there for younger children to soak up, but there were many more throughout the film that only the smarter older kids and adults could point out.  Also, an added bonus are the numerous inferences to media from NWO wrestling to the high school drama Dawson's Creek with the help of lots of its stars and other stars to help carry out the jokes.  All in all, Muppets in Space is a very well thought out movie in gaining the attention of almost any age group.

He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die! A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.Perhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky.

That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about Goldfinger. How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience.

It just doesn't seem likely to happen.Much of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially Goldfinger and Dr. No, proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.But if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen Goldfinger yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond.

I had been through all the crappy Friday sequels ( 7,8,9 ) and the bad bad bad Nightmare sequels.  I know that there will probably never be a film that has the same effect that the original did but I could still hope for some effort.  So I eagerly ventured to the theater and bought my ticket, got my M&M's and pop and sat down in the almost full theater and waited.  The films starts off quite well.  It's a stormy night, a van is travelling what looks to be a desolate road to what looks to be a hellish place.  Inside we hear some good lines like  Jesus has nothing to do with this place lady,  and then we see him.  Good old Michael Myers.  The two attendants ship him out and it is then that we learn that it is October 30th of all nights.  Another good set piece.  So the film is moving along quite nicely at this point.  We have the stormy night, the folklore of Devils Night and two attendants that you know are going to die soon enough.  And then, it happens.  THE MUSIC.  Carpenter's famous haunting music blares eerily on the soundtrack, and that did it for me.  I was under the spell.  I was ready for another Halloween. Halloween 4 is a good film.  It is honest in its effort to pay homage to what made Halloween so popular.  The beginning is a great way to get back into the game ten years after the first graced our screen.  After the beginning the film succeeds very well.  It is not as good as the first or even the second but it does try.  Dwight H. Little probably studied the first and tried to emulate what made it so scary because he has some similar atmosphere in here, especially in the scene where Jamie is dreaming, and my favourite scene is when the sheriff's daughter tries talking to the deputy in the chair.  What appears mystically like a ghost right out of the depths of nothingness is truly what Halloween has been known for.  That one shot alone had me more frightened than almost any shot from any horror film in the 80's, save for Nightmare On Elm Street.  The story has Michael returning to Haddonfield to hunt down his niece.  There are some obvious plot holes, like how he got his sight back, but that is easily overlooked, after all, this is a horror movie.  So he returns and against everyones best judgement Dr. Loomis comes after him.  Loomis is massively scarred from the second one when he should have been dead from the fire, but again, that is acceptable, after all this is a horror film.  So he comes to Haddonfield again and he warns everyone that HE is on is way.  This time the sherriff actually believes him and they vow to search for the monster before he kills anyone.  We all know that is going to be futile. The reason this film works is because it has atmosphere.  Again, there is not a lot of gore in here but what it does have is some good scares.  It keeps you on your toes and if you pay attention to some of the shots and some of the symbolism, you will  predict the end.  That is only if you pay attention.But one downer and that is that it isn't the original.  As good as it is, it just can't be as good as the first or even the second.  And I think I might know what it is that prevents horror films from being as good as they were.  70's and 80's films look like they are 70's and 80's films.  They have that slight fuzz to them.  And that adds to the dimension of fear.  I think that if directors could somehow use a different filter or lens or whatever it is that they can use to make it look older, then they would have that desired effect.  Kubrick did it with Eyes Wide Shut, other film makers should take note.All in all this is a great sequel.  It is a good entry in the series and an honest effort to make it scary.  It is quite spooky in many parts, but it just lacks something.....  But still quite good and worth a look, especially on a rainy night when you are alone.  When you hear that music......
