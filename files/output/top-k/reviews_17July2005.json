Jake Gyllenhaal, before his breakthrough role in Donnie Darko, stars as Homer Hickam, a teenager who in October 1957 decides to build a rocket. This is based on a true story, written by Homer Hickam, of how four friends start to build a rocket in the small city Coalwood, West Virginia, and how they inspire the people of that town by doing the impossible. Except from the story of the building of rockets and how people are both happy and unhappy of it, it is the story of a father and son relation, how a teenager really fights for his dreams, no matter what his father thinks or wants. A beautifully storytelling movie with all glorious moments... that it is a true story makes it more believable, but at the same time also unbelievable.Highly recommended, not only for the fine story but also for fine characters, great actors and a great photography. Forget visual effects - this is a great drama movie with a great story.

Well, I may be Dutch, but I am not a particular fan of Dutch movies, as they can be incredibly predictable, and also Dutch male directors\/producers\/writers seem to think that the best thing to come out of women's lib is that they can display even more titties in a film (think of Paul Verhoeven, a great director, really, but oh so obsessed with the female body and anything randy and horny...). Very immature, these filmmakers. Dutch actors have the tendency to turn their dialogue into a competition of who can speak the fastest. The music to the films is usually boring as hell (lots of harmonica's for YEARS and nothing else), and the acting... well. But Antonia had me jumping off my chair with pleasant surprise. Went to see it with two friends in Amsterdam, years ago, in the old Alhambra theater, which has recently been demolished, and of course we, provincials, sat there between a bunch of art adoring Amsterdam folk. Every time we laughed (and try NOT to laugh while watching this film... impossible) people would look at us with angry faces did we not know this was an ART film?? Not surprising this film was NOT a hit in the Netherlands. People are so eager here to be sophisticated and Hollywood-like, that they cannot even understand a simple, heartwarming story like this one anymore. I am a writer myself, but I envy Marleen Gorrissen for having written this tale. Wish I could!! It was after the film won an Oscar that it was put back in the cinema's and people heard of the film. And this should tell you exactly what is wrong with Dutch cinema it has no identity of it's own, just like the Dutch themselves. The emptier a film, the more we love it. But when I heard the first notes of that glorious music that accompanies this film, I was sold. Also written by a woman, by the way, this music. The acting was marvelous; the story so true and real and touching; the photography, scene after scene, was flabbergasting - and, again the most beautiful music!!!!!!!To put it in a few words I ADORE this film.

Double Indemnity seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.Double Indemnity works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at Double Indemnity when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best Billy Wilder!

It's about man versus nature. It's about survival. It's about self-preservation. It's about how we deal with traumatic events. But, yeah, it's also about a man getting ass-raped by a grinning redneck with a pig fetish&#133; All too often people see nature as something beautiful, something charming and wonderful. But what they overlook is the brutality and the unforgiving selfishness that comes with survival. In such an environment no concessions are made and weakness is cruelly exploited, and so it is with the characters in Deliverance.Out of the four protagonists, Lewis is the one who is best equipped to deal with the river. He knows he's playing a game and he knows the rules. Yet he's also the cause of his friend's later misery; it's his romantic worship of nature and his arrogance that gets them into trouble, because although he respects the river and although he understands it to some degree, by challenging it he exposes his less-equipped friends to nature's cruelty. He may be testing himself, but he's testing his friends as well.The three other characters, to varying degrees, are less capable than Lewis. But in true Darwinian fashion it's the weakest character, Drew, who succumbs. He's the most moral and the most humane, which in a game of pure survival renders him the most susceptible. He's just not up to the task. But although he's killed, it's never entirely clear how he dies. His death, like much of the film, is clouded in ambiguity. Lewis is sure that Drew is killed by gunshot, but you never hear gunfire and Ed fails to find a clear bullet wound. Did he get shot? Did he faint and fall out of the canoe? Or did he die of a heart attack while under the immense stress that the characters are put under? You never know.And you're never sure if the man that Ed kills is indeed the toothless man. It certainly seems that way, as the man is indeed missing his front teeth, but you never get a clear look at him and the characters themselves aren't entirely sure. In a way it shows the hollowness of revenge, the way that it fails to satisfy and end our suffering, but it also shows our humanity. Unlike animals we're open doubt and we're open to regret, and unlike animals we have to live with our actions. It's what makes us human. Ed certainly won't forget what he did. It will always be with him, promising to rise to the surface at any moment.There's an excellent scene that illustrates Ed's pain. After surviving the river, he has to go back to something resembling a normal life and he has to eat dinner surrounded by the people who are looking after him. He breaks down. Now the reaction that follows may seem cruel &#150; everyone looks at him, and after an awkward silence, begin talking and joking &#150; but it's what he needs. It's what he needs to survive. And if anything, the scene shows that perhaps Bobby, the man who was raped by the rednecks, is better equipped at surviving than Ed. He stays strong.But I guess, in a way, you could say that the characters deserve what happens to them. At the beginning they treat the locals with a complete lack of respect. They treat them as sub-human &#150; apart from Drew who is the one person who tries to relate to them. Therefore what happens could be perceived as a final piece of revenge against the people that are destroying the wilderness and people's homes (the town is being flooded to make way for a dam). It's a last hurrah. It's the (very) common man's final blow against corporate America.In fact, watching the film back, it's interesting to note the way that the film hints that the city boys may have been hunted right from beginning. There's the lingering shot of the men in the woods when the businessmen first take to their canoes. There's the banjo player on the bridge &#150; perhaps he marks the point of no return. And there's the way that Lewis hears noises in the night when they're camping. Are they really the prey all along? Is their encounter with the mountain men more than chance? Of course, everything is pure speculation, but it's certainly open for debate.And the rape scene, of course, is brutal and shocking, but what makes it so disturbing is the interplay between the two hillbillies. It's as if they're flirting. It's as if it's some perverted love scene between the pair of them. The lingering looks they give one another and the chuckles of satisfaction certainly indicate this. They're probably doing what they'd like to do to each other only they're afraid to. After all, consensual sex between two men makes you gay. Rape, however, is an act of power and dominance. What could be more masculine than that? Of course, I'm being facetious, but the men here aren't really men. They're the animals that lurk in the darkness. They have no compassion and no humanity. Therefore, unlike the other locals they encounter, I feel they completely deserve the sub-human treatment they receive from the city boys. And I also agree with Lewis and his belief that their subsequent fight for survival is a game. That's exactly what it is, and the only thing that matters is that you play it and win. Everything else is secondary, even emotional well-being, because if you lose, even the least satisfying human emotions are denied to you.

In such an environment no concessions are made and weakness is cruelly exploited, and so it is with the characters in Deliverance.Out of the four protagonists, Lewis is the one who is best equipped to deal with the river. He knows he's playing a game and he knows the rules. Yet he's also the cause of his friend's later misery; it's his romantic worship of nature and his arrogance that gets them into trouble, because although he respects the river and although he understands it to some degree, by challenging it he exposes his less-equipped friends to nature's cruelty. He may be testing himself, but he's testing his friends as well.The three other characters, to varying degrees, are less capable than Lewis. But in true Darwinian fashion it's the weakest character, Drew, who succumbs. He's the most moral and the most humane, which in a game of pure survival renders him the most susceptible. He's just not up to the task. But although he's killed, it's never entirely clear how he dies. His death, like much of the film, is clouded in ambiguity. Lewis is sure that Drew is killed by gunshot, but you never hear gunfire and Ed fails to find a clear bullet wound. Did he get shot? Did he faint and fall out of the canoe? Or did he die of a heart attack while under the immense stress that the characters are put under? You never know.And you're never sure if the man that Ed kills is indeed the toothless man. It certainly seems that way, as the man is indeed missing his front teeth, but you never get a clear look at him and the characters themselves aren't entirely sure. In a way it shows the hollowness of revenge, the way that it fails to satisfy and end our suffering, but it also shows our humanity. Unlike animals we're open doubt and we're open to regret, and unlike animals we have to live with our actions. It's what makes us human. Ed certainly won't forget what he did. It will always be with him, promising to rise to the surface at any moment.There's an excellent scene that illustrates Ed's pain. After surviving the river, he has to go back to something resembling a normal life and he has to eat dinner surrounded by the people who are looking after him. He breaks down. Now the reaction that follows may seem cruel &#150; everyone looks at him, and after an awkward silence, begin talking and joking &#150; but it's what he needs. It's what he needs to survive. And if anything, the scene shows that perhaps Bobby, the man who was raped by the rednecks, is better equipped at surviving than Ed. He stays strong.But I guess, in a way, you could say that the characters deserve what happens to them. At the beginning they treat the locals with a complete lack of respect. They treat them as sub-human &#150; apart from Drew who is the one person who tries to relate to them. Therefore what happens could be perceived as a final piece of revenge against the people that are destroying the wilderness and people's homes (the town is being flooded to make way for a dam). It's a last hurrah. It's the (very) common man's final blow against corporate America.In fact, watching the film back, it's interesting to note the way that the film hints that the city boys may have been hunted right from beginning. There's the lingering shot of the men in the woods when the businessmen first take to their canoes. There's the banjo player on the bridge &#150; perhaps he marks the point of no return. And there's the way that Lewis hears noises in the night when they're camping. Are they really the prey all along? Is their encounter with the mountain men more than chance? Of course, everything is pure speculation, but it's certainly open for debate.And the rape scene, of course, is brutal and shocking, but what makes it so disturbing is the interplay between the two hillbillies. It's as if they're flirting. It's as if it's some perverted love scene between the pair of them. The lingering looks they give one another and the chuckles of satisfaction certainly indicate this. They're probably doing what they'd like to do to each other only they're afraid to. After all, consensual sex between two men makes you gay. Rape, however, is an act of power and dominance. What could be more masculine than that? Of course, I'm being facetious, but the men here aren't really men. They're the animals that lurk in the darkness. They have no compassion and no humanity. Therefore, unlike the other locals they encounter, I feel they completely deserve the sub-human treatment they receive from the city boys. And I also agree with Lewis and his belief that their subsequent fight for survival is a game. That's exactly what it is, and the only thing that matters is that you play it and win. Everything else is secondary, even emotional well-being, because if you lose, even the least satisfying human emotions are denied to you.

Her look is also very different, unlike the uncanny physical resemblance of Mark and Danny, but this mainly reflects differences in the stories and their settings.

Not at all, at least not here, because it works. Of course when you have a seen Running On Empty as many dozen times as I have (hmm, I think I'll go watch it again -- yup, still great), it is more than a little distracting.This sort of character emulation is not unique in Hollywood.

The best high school movies (e.g. Dazed and Confused Bring It On Foxfire) don't show more than a few moments of classes, because no one cares about or remembers most of their high school classes.

The feindishly gifted Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is planning the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Upon buying thousands of acres of useless land in California, he'll send a rocket towards the San Andreas fault, allowing the rest of California to fall into the sea. Luthor is joined by the dim-witted henchman, Otis (Ned Beatty) and the gorgeous and also dim-witted bad girl, Ms. Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine). After his plan to kill Superman w\/ kryptonite fails...Luthor watches as Superman reverses his plans and saves the day. Superman, while forbidden to interfere with the mortality of the people of Earth, turns the planet and it's time backwards to save the woman he loves, Lois (who had died in a car wreck) from death. After Lois's rescue, Luthor was locked up for a good sentence of life plus 25.While the special effects were marvelous for their time, the actors lit up the screen along with the impeccable and unforgettable music by John Williams. Christopher Reeve shines in his career defining role as the Man of Steel. While being an over grown boyscout, Reeve still projects a great charm and presence that no other actor was able to bring to the iconic role of Superman. Reeve also deserves credit for being able to play it straight when Hackman and Beatty where having a blast being insane villains in their scenes with him. Reeve was and always will be...Superman. Gene Hackman began the trend of having big stars chew the scenery as the villain in the comic book film genre. While Hackman refused to wear a bald cap or shave his head for the film, he wears noticeably silly wigs throughout the movie, making his baldness obvious. While some will criticize his wig choice as well as his comedic approach, at this time in comics, Luthor was a boring 2 dimensional mad scientist (this was long before he became the corporate villain we all know), so I believe Hackman brought a much needed wit and charm to a seemingly boring role. His humor and his brilliance as an actor make the seemingly unbearable character on the page a brilliant piece of acting. Margot Kidder allows us to see who Lois Lane is, a great and beautiful reporter, who is in love with a super hero and can't spell to save her life. The rest of the cast that surrounds Reeve, Hackman, and Kidder play out well. Finally, for the glorious 20 min and $4 million cameo from the late, great Marlon Brando. His performance in this film is so good that you wouldn't believe that Brando's name would never be attached to Superman til after his unfortunate passing. But from what was seen in the film, especially the I could embrace you in my arms, my son moment, its a shame those Salkinds cut him out of part II (looking forward to the Richard Donner Cut).

Reeve also deserves credit for being able to play it straight when Hackman and Beatty where having a blast being insane villains in their scenes with him. Reeve was and always will be...Superman. Gene Hackman began the trend of having big stars chew the scenery as the villain in the comic book film genre. While Hackman refused to wear a bald cap or shave his head for the film, he wears noticeably silly wigs throughout the movie, making his baldness obvious. While some will criticize his wig choice as well as his comedic approach, at this time in comics, Luthor was a boring 2 dimensional mad scientist (this was long before he became the corporate villain we all know), so I believe Hackman brought a much needed wit and charm to a seemingly boring role. His humor and his brilliance as an actor make the seemingly unbearable character on the page a brilliant piece of acting. Margot Kidder allows us to see who Lois Lane is, a great and beautiful reporter, who is in love with a super hero and can't spell to save her life. The rest of the cast that surrounds Reeve, Hackman, and Kidder play out well. Finally, for the glorious 20 min and $4 million cameo from the late, great Marlon Brando. His performance in this film is so good that you wouldn't believe that Brando's name would never be attached to Superman til after his unfortunate passing. But from what was seen in the film, especially the I could embrace you in my arms, my son moment, its a shame those Salkinds cut him out of part II (looking forward to the Richard Donner Cut).

Christopher Reeve...The Real life Superman9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"17 July 2005","score":"","review":" Nowadays, comic book movies are being released every two months. Most of them rushed into production, without any real time to make a smart, intelligent, and cinematic type of a comic book movie that fans or non fans would like to see. This was not the case in 1977-78. Richard Donner was given the task to create the first movie of it's kind. The one that started it all...Superman. What superhero would better start off the trend than the Man of Steel? The hero that has become an American icon and a symbol for pop culture. As director Bryan Singer of Superman Returns would say, You could go into the jungle with a cross and an S, and the two would be equally recognized. Every genre has those special movies that were made early in the game, that would be repeated or looked back on with admiration, but very few can point the finger at a film and say That is where it began. This is where comic book films were born...In Superman.The film opens with the beautiful and far more advanced planet of Krypton. On this planet, we witness the respected elder, Jor-El (Marlon Brando), passing judgment on three malevolent characters named General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran). After the elders of Krypton find these three villains guilty, Zod promises vengeance on his jailer (Jor-El), and is sent into the vacuum of space encased in the Phantom Zone, only to return in a later chapter. Jor-El is known to be neither irrational or impulsive to his peers, but his theory of the planet's destruction is quickly shunned by the others and he is forbidden to speak another word of it. As a result, Jor-El sends his child, Kal-El, to live on our planet Earth, where he would learn to live among us. After his departure...the planet of Krypton, along with his father and mother (Sussanah York) is destroyed. Enter Smallville, a quiet, southern town, where the two kindest farmers, Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford) adopt the newly landed Kal-El, and name him Clark Kent. In his teen years, following the death of his adoptive father, he returns to his routes, with the help of the crystals he arrived on our planet with. Within the confines of his Fortress of Sollitude, he learns from the spirit of his true father, Jor-El, and becomes...Superman.Upon his arrival at Metropolis, Kal-El\/Superman assumes a new identity...the bumbling and pathetic Clark Kent. He is shown as a fool, who uses words like swell and slouches. Naturally appearing as a non-aggressive wimp to his boss (Jackie Cooper) and co-workers, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure). Eventually, Clark falls in love with Lois, who in fact, loves Superman. As the world meets and greets their new hero Superman, an evil plot is brewing below the streets of Metropolis. The feindishly gifted Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is planning the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Upon buying thousands of acres of useless land in California, he'll send a rocket towards the San Andreas fault, allowing the rest of California to fall into the sea. Luthor is joined by the dim-witted henchman, Otis (Ned Beatty) and the gorgeous and also dim-witted bad girl, Ms. Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine).

A slender but interesting novel by Char;es Nordhoff and Jams Norman Hall was written for the screen as a stirring narrative and character study by Talbot Jennings, Jules Furman and Carey Wilson. Directed by skilled Frank Lloyd, the B\/W dramatic feature also included cinematography by Arthur Edeson, art direction by Cedric Gibbons and A. Arnold Gillespie, and original music by Herbert Stothart. Albert Lewin is credited as producer  but the project was overseen by Thalberg. This work of fictionalized biography has a story that is part of British naval history. Captain William Bligh of the HMS Bounty was sent to Tahiti specifically to obtain breadfruit trees by the governors of Britain's Empire. His chief officer, Fletcher Christian, gradually became repelled and then outraged at Bligh's harsh and unjust treatment of the men entrusted to his command. Finally refusing to be part of Bligh's regime of terror any longer, he led a mutiny, set Bligh and others adrift in a boat with supplies and sailed the Bounty away. Bligh returned safely to civilization, no mean feat of navigation; and Christian took the mutineers and the Tahitian women they had fallen in love with during their prolonged stay on that remote island while dealing with the breadfruit trees; and they ended by exiling themselves to remote Pitcairn Island. Another version of the film was made years later, in color in 1963; and Women of Pitcairn Island with Lynn Bari appeared in the 1950s. The screenplay is a good one, an especially surprising fact since the epic film was not often tried in the 1930s as a dramatic and not merely an adventure-level work. But this film works for most viewers; and this is true i claim partly because we discover the depths of Bligh's sadism through the eyes of Fletcher Christian. So it is that when we see him finding cause to take the extraordinary step of mutiny at last, we know why he is doing so and sympathize with his values that impel his decision. As Bligh, Charles Laughton was arch, sinister and tyrannical. Clark Gable's stoic simplicity and openness, by contrast, made one forget his accent and concentrate on his charismatic normalcy. Franchot Tone and Donald Crisp were also excellent, with such fine character actors as Herbert Mundin, Eddie Quillin, Dudley Digges, Ian Wolfe, Henry Stephenson, Spring Byington, Francis Lister and Movita in smaller parts. The action is well-paced, the incidents depicted generally believable. The physical look of the picture has a rough style and a consistent look all its own, and the appearance of the film is unusually spare and precise at the same time. Deservedly a classic from an early period in sound film-making that has lost nothing over 70 years.   ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Mutniy On the BountY' is perhaps Irving Thalberg's most-famous and best-loved film.

For a start, it crams as much detail as it can into three hours, with a brilliant cast and a sweeping John Williams score. It deals with almost all the most important aspects of American political life of the era, the vast majority of which are still as relevant as ever, especially given the current right-wing US administration. It portrays Nixon sympathetically and devotes as much screen time to his achievements as it does to his famous fall from grace. It offers a realistic portrayal of a professional politician and credits the viewer with the intelligence to judge his career for themself. In my opinion, it does have some faults though, first and foremost being Hopkins as Nixon. Whilst his performance is dedicated and rings true emotionally, I have difficulty getting past the casting of a short Welshman as an iconic tall American. Similarly, Hoskins is a bravura but bizarre choice for J. Edgar Hoover. These are counterpointed though by many smooth and assured performances from the large ensemble cast; most notably Allen, Boothe, Woods and Sorvino (who is entirely credible as the larger-than-life Henry Kissinger). The movie has some surprising takes on specific individuals, which slightly colours its objectivity. Nixon's counsel John Dean is portrayed as fairly saintly, and also happened to be a technical consultant on the picture. Gordon Liddy, the head guy on the break-in and a pivotal figure in both the cover-up and the various investigations of Nixon's use of campaign funds, has about three seconds of screen time. Some characters (such as the oil baron played by Hagman) are entirely fictitious, which is never a good idea in a biopic - stick to the facts. The crackerjack editing, whilst sometimes brilliantly mixing the cast into newsreel footage from twenty-five years earlier, occasionally lurches into pretension and dissipates the drama. Nixon's constant comparing of himself to his martyred rival John F. Kennedy is probably more an obsession of Stone's than it was of Nixon's. These are personal quibbles however and don't alter the fact that this is a tremendous production of what is fundamentally an amazing true-life story. Nixon was vilified by many people during his lifetime, perhaps justifiably, but often in ignorance of his circumstances and of the machinery of global politics. This movie is an intriguing window into his world, which at the very least shows what motivated him to do what he did. See for yourself.

According to Ms. Rosenthal's scholarship, Franco's meeting with Henri III (then King of Poland, not yet of France and not there at request of the Doge) was more important to her poetry than Venetian politics or her sex life, her trial before the inquisition was quite different, her relationship with the Veniers was far more professional and her life in general was far less dependent on men, let alone a man. Henri III was traveling through Venice when Franco entertained him at her home and may well have slept with her. However, the relationship seemed more courtly than sexual &#150; Franco even gave him gifts on his departure, two sonnets and a miniature. What Rosenthal remarks on are the sonnets she wrote in tribute to Henri in true (masculine) court style and the likelihood that Franco was trying to collaborate with other poets on a book in the future King of France's honor. Franco's poems on the event were courtier's poems and not love poems; in fact, she pulled of the rather difficult task of using the story of Jupiter and Danae as a model for her poems and undermining the eroticism her contemporaries (men) highlighted when using that myth. Franco often reclaimed overly sexualized female figures and made them into civic, public figures &#150; a pity that Herskowitz and script writer Dominy do the reverse to Franco.Franco's trial before the inquisition wasn't the maudlin thing it was in the movie, either. It wasn't even public and her accuser was a disgruntled and unpaid tutor, claiming she participated in rituals and other rites in her house. Veronica got out of it basically by admitting to allowing her servants to have these rituals and participating in them at times, but she never believed in it and it wasn't a sin or demonic if one didn't believe in it. She was hardly the only person to be pulled before the inquisition at the time &#150; Domenico Venier, her patron, was also brought before the inquisition because of a servant. Rather than having to defend her sexual behavior, she was in the position many men found themselves in. Their financial or employment practices irked a servant and the servant accused them of heresy. Unsexy as it is, Veronica's trial could be more easily compared to Martha Stewart's trial than to the sentimental theatrics in Herskowitz's film.Historically speaking, there is no reason to believe that Marco and Veronica were as close as the film shows. They were friends and fellow poets with great respect for the each other's work, certainly, and quite possibly lovers. Veronica had many lovers, though, and she did not ride off to some 'happily ever after' with Marco at all. There were other lovers she seemed to be more passionate about, including those who fathered some of her children, also left out of the film.So, as a historical drama it fails because it ignores historical fact and I think it fails even more as a feminist revision. I don't think Franco's story needs any revisionism to be feminist, and certainly not of this kind. When the heroine is more than happy to commit herself entirely to a man who has no qualms about publicly humiliating a wife who never injured him and sees nothing wrong with demanding Veronica's fidelity without offering his own, I can't consider her a feminist role model. When a film cheerfully sets up a dichotomy between the sexually adventurous but ultimately submissive mistress and the frigid, demanding wife, I can't call the film exactly a paragon of feminist values, especially when the mistress wins out. Why was there no sympathy for Guilia, who seemed quite unhappy with her lot and had no way out? Why no pretty speech about perpetual inconsequence for her, especially when she's the one is consigned to that more than any of the others. Apparently, if a woman isn't ready to be cheerfully sexually accessible to a man who can afford her, she doesn't deserve decent and respectful treatment from her husband. How this is a liberating message escapes me.The only level this film does work is as a guilty pleasure, and on that level it's fantastic. The cast is pretty, the set is pretty, the costumes are pretty, the music is pretty (if a bit sentimental and overpowering) and if you don't think about it too hard, it's a nice fairy tale. Had they not tried to base this on real people and had they deleted the ridiculous, Maxim-friendly just-do-me-feminism, it would have been a satisfying romance novel of a film. However, in trying to give this substance, they made it at best vaguely offensive.

Its also very different from all of the other Michael Myers films, which I found to be a good thing. First off, I think that the quick-cuts in the opening sequence at the very beginning are really cool. Also, the soundtrack is great although I wish some of the themes in the theatrical release could've been used a little more often. The film also contains some pretty intense suspense in a few of the scenes and some great deaths. However, the plot is pretty weak, and the ending has little to do with the rest of the story. Therefore, the story makes very little sense in the end, but the ending is still pretty good. Its totally action-packed, and full of thrills. Here's what I make of the ending in terms of the plot standpoint It seems to me that Michael Myers simply used the cult members to get to Jamie and the rest of his family. Also, I think that the cult was experimenting and attempting to control pure evil all these years. And all those test tubes, DNA profiles, and charts laying around are all a possible reason for Michael's curse. I know this seems dumb, but this is really the only explanation I can obtain. The details are very sketchy.Although the plot is weak, we do get some answers. We find out who the mysterious man-in-black is; it turns out to be one of the main characters.
