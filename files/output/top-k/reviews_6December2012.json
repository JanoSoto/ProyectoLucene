The emotions expressed by the characters were fun to watch and there were a few comedic scenes to grab your attention. What I wished the film had done differently however, was the way they made the film look almost too imaginary rather than a real life perspective. There were two important ideas expressed in the film that I thought were great the first was how the film made you reflect on life and see what really is important, and to make the most out of the time given to us. The second was that no matter what type of situation we may be in, or how far away we may feel from the rest of the world, there is always something to explore and change about ourselves. The first idea is seen when Amelie helps a blind man cross the road. While walking, she continues to explain to him everything she sees on the street; from a child laughing at a dog, to what kinds of food were being sold in the shop windows, while never telling the old man her name. This was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It proved that no matter how little the gesture you do for someone is, like simply helping someone cross the road, that little bit goes a long way. Others will appreciate the help, and you will feel better about your own self. French director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, has been known for his focus on romance and his extensive use of color and imagination, which he has truly portrayed in this film. I think his decision to cast Audrey Tautou, as the role of Amelie Poulain, was an excellent choice because she knew how to capture the audience right away. What I thought was particularly French in the movie was the music. It was not like most of the music we hear in most American films. I think the French use more of an orchestra for their soundtracks and keep it classic, rather than in America where we create music through our technology.

Die Hard serves as an alternated holiday movie. Die Hard opens up with off duty New York Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) attend a Christmas Party at Nakatomi Skyscrapper with his wife in downtown LA. Out of nowhere the plot kicks in the door as German terrorist and thieves take the people in the building hostage and start to make demands to the police. The group is led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) a brutal man whom able to have casual persona and an an intimidating one in a few seconds. Hans also had a casual attitude to killing even willing to kill his own men. Alan Rickman is able to show that Han has a curt attitude to people whom he did not know and jokey nature with those he knew. Alan Rickman is able to make him out to be somewhat of a suit. He flaunted his knowledge and boast of his education to anybody, but McClane manage to slip from his grip. The film follows his exploits as he slowly engages the German terrorists one by one barefoot to retake the tower while dealing in depth of personal pain. The broken glass on his barefoot can be seen as his Achilles's heel. McClane lacks heroic virtues and qualities like Achilles. He can be explains to be a Byronic hero or Anti-Hero by having similar traits to those who like being arrogant and cynical. He is also cunning and able to adapt. He has a dis-tasted for social institutions and norms when he was at the party. John McClane works better alone than in a crowd. Die Hard gives their hero, a cutting edge from cookie cut heroes. What Die Hard does well is keeping a small scale budget while exporting a big blockbuster result. Most of the movie takes taking place entirely within a few floors of the Nakatomi Plaza. It was one of the first of the limited-space, small cast action films. This formula of putting characters in limited area spawn great sequels in their own right, but also an entirely new sub-division of the action genre. The movie is condensed in a few scenes and areas that get so well know. It simplified in such a way that lets the characters and the action really develop and shine through. While having a few explosion-filled sequences, the movie allows the audience to care for the characters and not feel like disconnected from the story-arch or the depth of the characters portray. The movie takes light-hearted approach to the genre, incorporating many less-than-serious elements and one-liners keeps the movie fun and enjoyable no matter how many times watched through, but it comes with a cost. Sub-characters in the film seem corny, low-intelligent or bad written. The scenes with the LA police for example drag the movie down and slow it down. The film brings in Reginald Vel Johnson playing a role as a cop which doomed the actor to playing cops for the rest of his life. He continues to be type cast to this day. Reginald Vel Johnson's character has a trouble past where he accidentally shot a kid and now wouldn't be able to shot. While they did give some back-story to Reginald Vel Johnson character, most of his lines were bad and his actions in the movie are nearly useless. All the main characters in this film are fairly complex and well written compared to most of the dumb action hero movies of the 1980s. Still the police chief doesn't serve any purpose except for delaying police intervention which would have wrapped the story up faster. Matters would have been more easily solved had the chief acquired an average intelligence. Since the sub-characters took a backseat, the character of McClane and Gruber makes the movie watchable. The sarcastic nature of McClane's character against the whimsical Gruber makes this hero and villain pairing one of the finest in film history. The movie even makes a famous quote out of its hero's swearing mouth that can be still heard today. The language can be harsh and the violence too much but it's a good movie. The plot might seem rudimentary and unoriginal today, but it still one of the first movie with many of the things action movie need to be a success. It's the blueprint to any action movie today.

It is also the fact that the film is very realistic military level (as expected) in certain little things that appear in the film. Recuerdo Heartbreak Ridge for example, where, despite not having a military assistant to the action scenes, and frankly being the most important failure of the film, yet the film made \u200B\u200Bclear the difference today in day and always among the troops, NCOs and officers, which has always been, but in a sense Heartbreak Ridge was the first to play and show what is really an officer in most occasions at light Infantry, a soldier born and raised in an academy that when it reaches its destination and is in charge of a section has very little experience in this area and believes that the best solution is to control soldier to soldier to the entire section, when reality is hampering the work of Sergeant in most occasions. But this is a very long deal where we will not engage.In Men of Honor this difference is the mainstay of the film along with the human spirit of a man who has worked as hard as anyone and has been forced to move on despite all the difficulties and obstacles that life put all his life.

McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina Ed (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are more than they can handle! The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that what goes around comes around. This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another naïve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store Santa (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter.The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation.References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina Ed (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are more than they can handle! The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that what goes around comes around. This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another naïve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store Santa (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter.The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation.References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

So, like a lot of fans of 'America's Team' in Texas, and across the country, I was extremely angered and offended when I first heard that a major Hollywood movie was released that was a scathing indictment of not only the Dallas Cowboy's, but professional football as well. And, I vowed then, to never ever watch that blasphemous film that dared criticized the sacred sport of football and its most important team.I guess, I was in a rather sacrilegious mood one day when I decided to watch 'North Dallas Forty' on cable 15 years after the movies original theatrical release. And, to my surprise, I became a big fan of the movie. Watching it every chance that I could when ever it was rebroadcasted.Unfortunately, I think the window for a potential sequel which continues the story line of Nick Nolte's character (Phil Elliot). Or, at least one of the main characters of the original film. Like Mac Davis's colorful character Seth Maxell\/Don Meredith for example closed sometime in the mid-late 80's.Therefore, I'm recommending a 'North Dallas Forty' reboot that's based on ex-Cowboy player Thomas Henderson's '87 autobiographical novel Out of Control Confessions of an NFL Casualty as the main source material for a sequel to 'North Dallas Forty'.For those of you who don't know? Thomas Henderson was the extraordinarily athletic and media-darling strong side linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys from '75-'79. Who was on the cover of Time Magazine in January of '79 for an article on Super Bowl 13. But, was later released the next season from the Cowboys in November of '79 for erratic play due to drug abuse. Then wound up playing in only a few games with other NFL teams until retiring after a career ending neck injury in '81.So, in other words, he was at the pinnacle of success in the NFL just 7 months prior to North Dallas Forty's original release in August of '79, and at its lowest depths just 3 months afterwards.And, let me tell you, the stuff Thomas Henderson covers in his personal account of his experience in the NFL, makes 'North Dallas Forty' controversial indictment of the Cowboy's organization and professional football as a whole, look like a white wash by comparison.Most of the events in Thomas Henderson's book take place during the mid-late 70's, just before the over-the-top deifying worship of football players and professional athletes in general began in the 80's by means of new cable channels like ESPN and HBO for example. That served to heavily augment the local sports news and talk radio that already existed at the time, along with national magazine articles commenting on games and sports celebrities leading up to national TV broadcasts of the games of the week. Eventually growing into the constant bombardment of sports media entertainment monster that exists today.So, one can perhaps imagine that the mine field of problems and worldly temptations that players are constantly confronted with, and have to negotiate through to maintain not only an athletic career, but a normal sense of humanity has only increased exponentially as a result of their athletic accomplishments since Peter Gent's or Thomas Henderson's NFL careers in the 60's and 70's.The cinematic version of Thomas Henderson's Out of Control can also serve as an explanation for why celebrated athletes on all levels get themselves caught-up in so many controversial and tragic events ranging from the goofy, love myself behavior of Terrell Owens, to drug overdoses of young athletes in professional and collegiate sports, to murder convictions. That is if the modern mass-media actually had an interest in educating the public about the people and the sports organizations that they worship?(which, apparently they don't) So, to sum up, I think you could still have a sequel to North Dallas Forty by staying true to the overall theme of the movies scathing indictment of the NFL, its players, coaches and the owners directly involved in putting on the weekly gladiatorial show. Along with an indictment of the over-the-top mass media coverage that's responsible for over-hyping the importance to gigantic proportions the sporting events, without providing one iota of REAL insightful information concerning the actual day-to-day operations of the organizations and athletes themselves.And, if someone was to use Thomas Henderson's Out of Control as the main source material for a kind of sequel to North Dallas Forty? Then I imagine the movie beginning with an over middle aged ex-NFL star who played for a franchise in Dallas, TX as the main character. Who, after being the keynote speaker of an anti-drug and alcohol seminar is listening to a sports talk radio program, or watching a TV satellite channel debating (ad-nausem) the most recent controversial conduct by the latest and greatest batch of sports celebrities. Causing him in turn, to reflect on his own conduct during his professional career back in the day.Sort of like, The Raging Bull meets Any Given Sunday. And, I hope that you're listening Hollywood?!?

Based on a story by noir writer Cornell Woolrich, it appeals to the voyeur in all of us. Human beings are naturally nosy and inquisitive. And that is the premise on which the film is based. L.B. Jeffries, known as Jeff, (James Stewart) is a photo journalist who works for a magazine. He is wheelchair-confined in his small, seemingly cramped apartment, recovering from a leg injury sustained while on an assignment. Because he is bored, he spends a great deal of time looking at the goings-on in the block of flats opposite. As a result of what he sees, he begins to suspect that one of the residents of that block may have murdered his bed-ridden wife. He involves his fiancée, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), his carer, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and an old friend from war service, serving police detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) in his suspicions. But are those suspicions the product of an overactive imagination or is there some substance to them? Rear Window keeps the viewer on tenterhooks right up until its excellent conclusion. It is a riveting and entertaining film with superb performances from its principal actors. It is proof positive that a film does not need high-octane action sequences, expensive special effects, a cast of thousands or breathtaking scenery to keep the viewer's interest. This is a film that is claustrophobic, almost theatrical in nature (Dial M for Murder was apparently based on a stage play; and I can envisage Rear Window making a successful theatrical transfer, if it hasn't already done so). The direction by Hitchcock is, of course, excellent. Hitchcock makes his trademark cameo appearance in the film (about 30-40 minutes in), as a guest in one of the apartments opposite Jeff's. Incidentally, Stewart and Kelly each make a very minor error when delivering their lines in two separate scenes (they hesitate slightly and stumble over their words). These are barely noticeable but I am nonetheless surprised that both scenes were not re-shot or, if they were, that the unblemished versions were not inserted into the final version of the film.

To me, it's one of the movies that define the 1940s. The cinematography is dark and mesmerizing, and the whole story being told in flashback is very engaging. I can't think of another film noir at the time like it. What makes this movie so great is the characters. This is one of the best casts I've ever seen in a movie. The characters are so well written, so different, and so complex, that the emotions just leap off the screen. There are a lot of great characters, but the best performances come from Joan Crawford and Eve Arden. Eve Arden is amazing as Mildred Pierce's greedy daughter. She's such a horrible person, but that's what makes her so interesting. Joan Crawford is great as the title character, giving possibly the greatest female performance of all time. She's intelligent, she's hard working, she's loving, she makes her own decisions, and that's a breath of fresh air. She's a strong female character, but she doesn't come off like she's trying to prove something to men. That's a problem a lot writers have to this day; not being able to make a strong female character. Either they're horribly stereotyped, or they're only strong to prove a point to men. It's very rare to see a strong female lead that's just doing what she does naturally. I think the best thing about this movie is the relationships the characters all share. Like I said earlier, the characters are all very complex, and their on screen relationships feel all too real. You really get to know these characters, and you know where each of them is coming from. Some of them are kind of terrible people, but you understand why. In the end, Joan Crawford defends her horrible daughter, and you wonder why; but then you realize if you were in her position, and you had the same experiences as her, you'd do the same.

The cops find a couple of bodys down a Boston alleyway and it's not enough for the investigating detective to be some quirky caricature - we need to see FBI fed turn up in slow-mo and steal the scene in a display of over indulgent campness . Willem Defoe does indeed steal the scene and the whole film but this isn't necessarily a good thing because you have to remember that he seems to be doing a bad Gary Oldman impersonation and that there's not much of a film to steal in the first place A lot of people who disliked the film have stated that it seems like a bad Tarantino wannabe . It's true that there's a lot of bad language and much of the humour arises from the language , but it's slightly misleading to dismiss it as being a Taratino clone . PULP FICTION has a similar sort of quirky nature but the overall feel of PULP FICTION is still one of seriousness . In this film it's consciously not serious .

This line will always be ingrained in my memory when it comes to my favorite movies of all time The Usual Suspects is definitely in my top 5 and if you were playing a trivia game and someone asked you to name the movie for which this quote was made I'm almost certain if you've seen this movie you would answer the question correctly. The film begins at night after an apparent bloodbath battle aboard a burning ship in the San Pedro harbor in California. You see a man who appears to be injured and disoriented sitting on the ground having a cigarette, their is fire and explosive liquids everywhere, and of course dead men all over the place, next you see a shadowy figure make his way from the top of the ship down to face are stranger on the ground, the mystery man calls are man on the ground Keaton(Gabriel Byrne), to which he replies I can't feel my legs Keyser, the man called Keyser ask Keaton, Are you ready? Next we assume Keaton is murdered by Keyser with a pistol before the cut away from this scene. The Theme of Usual Suspects appear to revolve around honor, pride, arrogance, fear and betrayal as methods to manipulate the human mind. The use of flashbacks are apparent as the next scene has low level crook Verbal Kint(Kevin Spacey), one of only two survivors being interrogated by US Customs Agent Dave Kujan(Chazz Parminteri). Verbal tells the agent how it all started six weeks earlier, someone hijacked a truck full of guns, and five usual suspects were lined up and arrested. These suspects included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney(Kevin Pollak), the goof ball McManus(Stephen Baldwin) and the verbally challenged Fenster(Benicio Del Toro). They were put in the now famous line-up at police headquarters and told to repeat the line Hand me the Keys you Fu_king Cock Sucker. Out of this was borne a ruthless gang who decided they would do a Job in other words a robbery together. Keaton wanted no part of it, however, when they are contacted by a strange attorney named Kobayashi(Pete Postlethwaithe)and informed they must carry out an assignment given to them by ruthless and mythical crime figure Keyser Soze, or else they will be murdered. This film reminds me of another classic film in relation to theme and that would be Casablanca because each time you see this movie it opens a new layer to the plot or a new angle that was missed the first time we saw it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'd suggest that you do, it's a modern day 90's classic.

Their mission, in actuality, is Everett's selfish desire to keep his ex-wife from marrying someone else. Their adventure leads them into very troubling and dangerous scenarios. All the while, the three are pursued by a tenacious law dog (Sherriff Cooley) who catches up with the defying trio on a few occasions.Much akin to the theme of The Breakfast Club, the apparent theme of this film centers on numerous characters learning hard lessons of life and watching the changing of morality amongst the people they run into. One good example of this theme is when Big Dan Teeg (John Goodman) begins an exuberant sales pitch to Everett and convinces two of them to join him on a pick nick luncheon. While enjoying the pleasantries of the lunch setting, he attacks both of them and takes their money. Another clear example of this theme is when the trio runs into the Sirens washing their clothing in the river bed. The ignorance of the three of them leads them into a trap and causes one to be turned into the authorities. They awake stunned and perplexed as to what happened.The lighting and color techniques of the movie really add to the realism of the dust bowl era that the film is set during. This adds to the challenge portrayed by the characters during their several scenarios of conflict. A prevalent motif, or symbolic repetition, that occurs throughout the course of the film is represented by the character obstacles of Big Dan, the Sheriff, and the Ku Klux Klan leader. At each point that the characters seem to make progress on their mission, or rather Everett's mission, these symbolic obstacles are placed in their paths which sets them onto the next scene with some knowledge obtained.This film is a must see and keeps you involved in the mood and setting.

Now I understand who Catherine Deneuve really is as an actress. She's simply great as Severine\/Belle de Jour, and Buñuel is a genius.

I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov\/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal&#x85; you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine\/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Buñuel's little movies, as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like Lemon incest, as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western\/Mafia\/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western\/Mafia\/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western\/Mafia\/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western\/Mafia\/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.

It is like a puzzle that you can distinguish that all the pieces somehow fits together, but once put together, it still remains a mystery. There is more symbolism as opposed to a concrete meaning. This is a cerebral film that requires the viewer to be analytical, yet at the same time be open to many interpretations.That is the beauty of this film. This is art and while the film is really good, I'm still left pondering. I could imagine every viewer will arrive at a different interpretation and I feel David Lynch's intention while making this film was to encourage people to come up with their own explanations. This film is bound to leave one very puzzled upon their first viewing, but upon further analysis, there is a symbolic relationship that ties everything together. If you are still lost, I think the key thing to pay attention to is the cowboy. For some reason, that really helped me a lot in finding some sort of logical explanation for the events that occur in the film.While I really do not know if there is a moral presented (or a point), to me, this film represents the demons that people have in the back of their minds. It's the elephant in the room that people don't want to confront or how one becomes in denial of its existence and how there is a good way to do that, as well as a bad way, but either way it has to be confronted. That to me seems to be what this film spoke about. Coupled with a foreboding atmosphere and odd imagery, this is a disturbing piece of high quality cinema that is shrouded with an aura of mystery bound to leave an imprint on one's psyche.

And indeed IT isn't; and despite Jon Voight and Eric Stoltz also being amongst the cast in this $45,000,000 production it is a very embarrassing project to be part of. The film has been followed by three sequels to date.A National Geographic crew travel into the heart of the Amazon to shoot a documentary on the long-lost tribe reported to be somewhere along the banks of the immense river. Cannibal Holocaust it is not, I'm afraid. Director Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) and her anthropologist boyfriend (Eric Stoltz) lead the team. Not long into their voyage they rescue a stranded Paraguayan snake hunter named Paul (Jon Voight). In return, he offers to help them find the lost tribe they are looking for, claiming to have met them. But his true plans unfold when he takes over the boat and forces the crew to aid him in his manic quest to track down a record-breaking Giant Anaconda. And it descends into a typical hunters-become-the-hunted scenario henceforth.For the first half an hour at least, Anaconda is somewhat enjoyable. But after that it quickly descends into mediocrity. One must ask the question as to where exactly the $45 million went, because it was certainly not invested in to the special effects department, that's for sure. The Anaconda looks ridiculous. I've seen monsters on the ludicrous Syfy channel films from the last ten years with lower budgets than this managing to turn out better looking monsters. Albeit, just slightly. And I know it was the year 1997, but come on now people, it wasn't that long ago and there was some superb CGI around that time and even before it. Anaconda is just a very poorly made film. The acting is diabolical... horrendous (Although in saying that Voight's performance was somewhat interesting). The script resembles something written on a rainy afternoon in after-school study by two bored kids. With dialogue as ingenious as this Is it just me or does the jungle make you really, really horny? that one was courtesy of our man Owen Wilson. And Ice Cube has to get his two cents worth in there too - That's it, man, I'm getting' the hell back to LA. But Owen Wilson delivers yet again and takes the cake - You don't know sh*t about the sh*t we're in out here! Genius.As an adventure film it's oh-so-typical but I suppose it does deliver the trills required for the genre. As a horror movie, it's just too cheap and flamboyant to be anything scary or unsettling. Indeed, the snake may devour someone whole in the film but its more comical than it is disturbing.
