Showing no sign of tiredness, Paul Thomas Anderson followed those two movies with Magnolia, a devastating, poignant magnum opus (in every sense of the word it's over three hours long) that deservedly won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Festival and stands alongside Fight Club as the darkest, most daring picture of 1999.Having already shown his love for Robert Altman on Boogie Nights (the swimming pool sequence is every bit as great as the M*A*S*H director's finest work), Anderson brings it to extreme levels this time, crafting a movie of epic proportions which aims to prove there are no coincidences in life, that there has to be some kind of connection (Paul Haggis tried to do the same thing with Crash, with slightly lesser results). The film actually begins with a series of urban legends regarding coincidences, blatantly pointing out there is no way those incidents occurred by chance.Having explained his point of view in the prologue, the director moves on to telling a story that involves a dozen of people, all dysfunctional, longing for love and, most important, linked in one way or another. The center appears to be the dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), owner of a television network. Though he is in bed and constantly watched by his nurse, Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his foul-mouthed resentment for everything surrounding him manages to affect a series of individuals across L.A., reigniting old, bitter conflicts there's Claudia (Melora Walters), a drug-addicted part-time hooker who embarks on a relationship with police officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) while trying to forget the problems she has with her father, game show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall); there's Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), current champion of Gator's show What Do Kids Know?, who feels there is something missing in his life, all focused on his remarkable intelligence and how his father (Michael Bowen) exploits it for fame and money; there's Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), aka Quiz Kid, former boy wonder of the same show, now a lonely homosexual with nothing but regret for every single thing he's ever done; there's Linda (Julianne Moore), Earl's wife, devastated by the conflicting feelings she has for her husband; and there's the old man's son, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise), a misanthropic nihilist who expresses his absolute hatred for the human race (women in the particular) through his controversial TV program Seduce and Destroy.All these people are connected, be it by family ties, having the same name or doing the same thing. Most of all, though, they are unmistakably linked by an omnipresent sadness they are miserable, they want to improve their situation, but seem unable to do so. Unlike Boogie Nights, which showed people who thought they were happy and then were saddened by realizing it was all an illusion, Magnolia features characters who are flawed and unhappy right from the start, and this gloomy mood never lifts from the movie, not even after the surreal event that occurs towards the end (it's weird, it's unexpected, yet somehow it makes perfect sense within the film's structure). The protagonists' need for bonding is felt most strongly in what can be considered the best single scene of Anderson's career all the characters are listening to the radio and all of a sudden they simultaneously start singing the song that is playing in that moment (Aimee Mann's spellbinding Wise Up). It is not merely a brilliant plot device, it is also the movie's most beautiful, harrowing moment.Aside from the director's peerless storytelling skills, what lends Magnolia its true magic is the wonderful ensemble cast everyone, from the ten-year old Blackman to the late Robards (he sadly, and a bit ironically, died in 2000 of the same disease that consumes his character), is flawless, with standout work coming from Moore, Macy and Hall.

And tame the c*nt! with such raging conviction?).Some may dismiss this film for being too long. Some may say it is excessively depressing. Both things may be true from a conventional point of view, but how should one judge a film that defies conventional rules?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 July 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Considered as one of the most creative filmmakers of the modern era, American director David Lynch has developed a very peculiar and highly recognizable style through most of his work. A style where surreal images are overtly present, and linear plot lines are thrown away in order to focus mostly on the emotions created. This style has its roots in the fact that Lynch started his career as a painter, making his films an extension of that previous work, and very different to what is the classic definition of cinema. This background is probably the reason why he tends to move away from normal films (although movies like The Elephant Man and The Straight Story prove that he can make that kind of films too), and prefers to let his imagination run wild when making a movie. His first movie, Eraserhead, is also probably the best example of Lynch's style of film-making.Eraserhead is the story of Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a timid factory worker in a nightmarish industrial work that one night, during an uncomfortable dinner with the family of his girlfriend Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), receives the news that Mary had his baby. Henry agrees to marry Mary, as he truly feels that he loves her, but when Henry discovers that the baby is a mutant that cries all the time, life doesn't seem that easy anymore. Mary can not stand the screams of the child, so decides to leave Henry and return to her parent's home. Alone in his decayed apartment, Henry will have to live with the constant screaming of the deformed baby, facing his nightmares and fears about parenthood, as well as the temptations that live outside his room. And the only thing that can help him to survive is the idea that probably, in heaven everything is fine.Written by David Lynch, Eraserhead is a movie built with the logic of a dream, that is, without a linear plot and moving between a series of hallucinations and dream sequences that while apparently random, allow us to enter the twisted mind of its solitary main character. While ambiguous and cryptic, Eraserhead is an incredibly original character study about a man's fears about concepts such as fatherhood, compromise and responsibility. As written above, it follows the logic of a dream, but given it's dark nature, it would be more appropriate to say it is the vivid representation of a nightmare. Despite the apparent lack of narrative (or maybe because of it), we follow Henry closely, almost intimately, through his twisted, yet oddly very human, descent into madness as he is tormented by his demons embodied in the shape of the screaming mutant baby.In Eraserhead, David Lynch brings his nightmare come to life in a wonderfully horrific fashion thanks to his great imagination and his noticeable care for details. With an outstanding use of sound and the cinematography by Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, director David Lynch creates the perfectly haunting atmosphere of dread and decay that impregnates Henry's depressive industrial world, definitely symbolizing his bleak view of life. Many have said that Eraserhead is more a visual experience than a narrative, and I for once agree with that statement, as it is visually where we get the most clues about the film's obscure meanings, as Henry's vivid dreams and terrible hallucinations are opened windows to his troubled psyche. The pace is certainly slow, but it flows smoothly, allowing the film to express itself via the emotions of its images, like a beautiful yet frightening moving canvas.As the disturbed Henry Spencer, Jack Nance is simply amazing, as if he had been born with the sole purpose of playing this role. What I mean is not that Nance is an extremely talent performer (honestly, that is not the case), but that he managed to convey exactly what Lynch wanted to do with his character in the most natural and believable way possible, effectively making Henry Spencer a honest portrayal of a man facing his most terrible fear becoming a parent. The rest of the cast ranges from average to very good, with Charlotte Stewart being one of the latter, delivering a subtle performance as Mary X, Henry's girlfriend. In supporting roles, Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates are good, but nothing spectacular, and the same could be said about Judith Anna Roberts, who plays the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall. Finally Laurel Near is great in the now iconic role of the Lady in the radiator.While a powerful and wild exercise of imagination, Eraserhead is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, as due to the atypical way its constructed and the dark nature of its themes, it probably won't be easily accepted by those expecting a more linear, classic narrative style. However, a way to face Eraserhead's cryptic plot is to let the images do the talking and simply experience the emotions Lynch's film attempts to convey. As written above, Lynch was a painter and performance artist before becoming a filmmaker, and Eraserhead carries a lot of this background in its conception; so the watching of the movie as a visceral experience, instead of intellectual, may be helpful in its enjoyment. A very personal movie for Lynch (a lot of the film's darkness comes from his own experiences in the different stages of his life), Eraserhead is like the pure expression of the director's troubles and fears on film.Due to a constant lack of money, it took David Lynch 5 years to finish Eraserhead, but one can truly say that the wait was worthy. Thanks to Eraserhead, David Lynch would be noticed by Mel Brooks, who would help him to establish his name with The Elephant Man. But even if Lynch's career had remained in the underground, Eraserhead is without a doubt, one of the most interesting and thought provoking films ever made. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 July 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Considered as one of the most creative filmmakers of the modern era, American director David Lynch has developed a very peculiar and highly recognizable style through most of his work.

Singlehandedly defining an entire era of film-making, 'The Graduate' brought director Mike Nichols (with only his second film, after 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?') recognition as a major new talent, and launched the remarkable acting career of Dustin Hoffman. The film received seven Oscar nominations &#150; including Best Picture and three in the acting categories &#150; though it walked away with just one award, for Best Director. Often overlooked as a highly-effective comedy, 'The Graduate' features a remarkable performance from Hoffman (who, at the age of thirty years, convincingly played a 21-year-old), as well as Anne Bancroft as the bored, domineering housewife who seduces him during a vulnerable period of his life.Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman), having just graduated from college (presumably Williams College, where the author of the novel, Charles Webb, attended, and also because Ben is seen wearing a Williams College tie at the beginning of the film), is uncertain about his future. Pushed to success by his slightly overbearing parents, Ben is confused about where his life is heading, desperately fumbling for an answer whenever one of his parents' friends asks him what are you going to do next? He stares mournfully into his fish tank, perhaps likening himself to the fish dwelling within it. He is trapped in this glass cube, able to see the world outside but incapable of any meaningful interaction with it. This analogy is reinforced when, for his 21st birthday present, his parents gift him with a metal water diving suit, in which he clunks to the water's edge and sinks mournfully to the bottom of the pool. Unsure of his future, Ben is simply drifting through life Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. Here in the pool&#133; it's very comfortable just to drift here.Into Ben's neurotic, confused life comes Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), whose failing marriage to Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) has enticed her to seek sexual gratification elsewhere. Despite Ben being half her age (in actual fact, just six years separated Bancroft, 36, from Hoffman, 30), she deviously maneuvers a vulnerable Ben into a compromising position and exploitively attempts to seduce him. Their relationship continues for many weeks in complete secrecy, though the two share absolutely no connection beyond a physical attraction. When Ben is coaxed by Mr. Robinson and his own parents (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) into dating young Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), he haphazardly tries to ruin any chance of this relationship ever working, in the process falling in love with Elaine. Trapped amidst one of the most awkward triangular relationships in cinema history &#150; a boy, a girl and her mother &#150; Ben must ultimately make a choice about who he would rather be with. Instead of merely drifting along, he must decide what he wants and take control of his life.'The Graduate' appealed very much to younger audiences in its day. With its disapproving attitudes towards the older generation's complete belief in materialism (epitomised by Mr. McGuire's (Walter Brooke) one-word recipe for happiness &#150; plastics!), the film shows a wide rift between the young and old, making Ben's relationship with Mr. Robinson seem all the more shocking and scandalous. Only the younger characters in the film (Ben and Elaine) are afforded first names, likely a deliberate choice to clarify the clear distinction between the two generations. In 1967, Simon and Garfunkel were at the height of their fame, and Nichols exploited this to its full potential. By blending newly-performed tracks (Mrs. Robinson) with those already popular with audiences (The Sounds of Silence\/Scarborough Fair), he created a highly memorable soundtrack, whose songs are now universally associated with the themes and particular scenes of the film. The Sounds of Silence, considering it was written before 'The Graduate' was produced, is a perfect accompaniment to the film, effectively translating Ben's overwhelming feelings of loneliness and alienation.Considering I was expecting a straight-out drama, 'The Graduate' has its own share of hilariously comedic moments, most arising from Ben's pathetic impulsive actions when placed in a confusing situation. My favourite (supposedly improvised by Hoffman to prevent his own laughter from showing on camera) involves Ben dejectedly retreating to the back of the room to bang his head repeatedly against a wall after his pathetic attempt to grope an undressing Mrs. Robinson's chest. Revolutionary, funny, dramatic and memorable, 'The Graduate' is a deserving all-time American classic.

Often overlooked as a highly-effective comedy, 'The Graduate' features a remarkable performance from Hoffman (who, at the age of thirty years, convincingly played a 21-year-old), as well as Anne Bancroft as the bored, domineering housewife who seduces him during a vulnerable period of his life.Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman), having just graduated from college (presumably Williams College, where the author of the novel, Charles Webb, attended, and also because Ben is seen wearing a Williams College tie at the beginning of the film), is uncertain about his future. Pushed to success by his slightly overbearing parents, Ben is confused about where his life is heading, desperately fumbling for an answer whenever one of his parents' friends asks him what are you going to do next? He stares mournfully into his fish tank, perhaps likening himself to the fish dwelling within it. He is trapped in this glass cube, able to see the world outside but incapable of any meaningful interaction with it. This analogy is reinforced when, for his 21st birthday present, his parents gift him with a metal water diving suit, in which he clunks to the water's edge and sinks mournfully to the bottom of the pool. Unsure of his future, Ben is simply drifting through life Well, I would say that I'm just drifting.

Despite Ben being half her age (in actual fact, just six years separated Bancroft, 36, from Hoffman, 30), she deviously maneuvers a vulnerable Ben into a compromising position and exploitively attempts to seduce him. Their relationship continues for many weeks in complete secrecy, though the two share absolutely no connection beyond a physical attraction. When Ben is coaxed by Mr. Robinson and his own parents (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) into dating young Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), he haphazardly tries to ruin any chance of this relationship ever working, in the process falling in love with Elaine.

With its disapproving attitudes towards the older generation's complete belief in materialism (epitomised by Mr. McGuire's (Walter Brooke) one-word recipe for happiness &#150; plastics!), the film shows a wide rift between the young and old, making Ben's relationship with Mr. Robinson seem all the more shocking and scandalous. Only the younger characters in the film (Ben and Elaine) are afforded first names, likely a deliberate choice to clarify the clear distinction between the two generations. In 1967, Simon and Garfunkel were at the height of their fame, and Nichols exploited this to its full potential. By blending newly-performed tracks (Mrs. Robinson) with those already popular with audiences (The Sounds of Silence\/Scarborough Fair), he created a highly memorable soundtrack, whose songs are now universally associated with the themes and particular scenes of the film. The Sounds of Silence, considering it was written before 'The Graduate' was produced, is a perfect accompaniment to the film, effectively translating Ben's overwhelming feelings of loneliness and alienation.Considering I was expecting a straight-out drama, 'The Graduate' has its own share of hilariously comedic moments, most arising from Ben's pathetic impulsive actions when placed in a confusing situation.

As Homer grows up, he is virtually adopted as a son by Dr Wilbur Larch, the doctor in charge of the orphanage, who trains Homer to become his assistant, even though Homer has no medical qualifications. Eventually, Homer moves away to work on an apple farm and as a lobster fisherman. Homer's motives for leaving the orphanage are twofold. Firstly, he wants to see the world outside the small town where he grew up. Secondly, he has moral scruples about the fact that Dr Larch, whom he otherwise respects, is carrying out abortions which were unlawful at the time. (The story is set in the early 1940s).The film has aroused some controversy because of its position on the abortion issue. Dr Larch is a strong believer in the right of women to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Homer (himself an unwanted child, who is uncomfortable with the idea that he might have been killed before his birth in order to suit someone's convenience) initially serves as the voice of the anti-abortion school of thought, but later, while working on the farm, he reverses his position and agrees to perform an abortion on a young woman who has become pregnant through an incestuous relationship with her own father. (We are asked to believe that, although he has never been to medical school, he has become a highly skilled surgeon as a result of assisting Dr Larch).The film's title is taken from a list of rules which are hanging up in the cider house, the building where apples are made into cider and which also serves as a dormitory for the farm's migrant workers. Although some of these rules, such as the one about not smoking in bed and the one about not operating machinery while drunk, seem eminently sensible, they are resented by the workforce on the grounds that they have had no hand in making the rules. Eventually, the list is ceremoniously thrown into the fire.One of the key lines in the film is Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right. This piece of cracker-barrel wisdom is actually spoken by the man responsible for violating his own daughter, which must cast some doubt on his status as a moral philosopher. I doubt if John Irving intended his moral libertarianism to extend as far as the rules forbidding incest, but he seems to want to apply it to just about every other ethical question raised in the course of the film, not merely to the abortion debate.Both main characters carry out actions which, from a moral point of view, are highly questionable. Larch falsifies Homer's medical records (without his knowledge) to enable him to avoid military service during World War II. Later, he forges a number of documents which purport to show that Homer is a qualified surgeon, hoping to get him appointed as his successor at the orphanage. Homer is initially reluctant to go along with Larch's deceptions, but later allows himself to be appointed as the orphanage doctor after Larch's death. (He dies as a result of becoming addicted to the ether he uses in operations). He also has an affair with a friend's fiancée while that friend is away on military service. Irving (who wrote the screenplay from his own novel) and director Lasse Hallstrom, however, try to pass all these matters off as being morally justifiable, shrugging any moral issues aside with Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right, a sentiment which in the circumstances seems inadequate.Michael Caine has spent most of his film career playing Englishmen; there are occasional exceptions, such as his German sergeant in The Eagle Has Landed, but the only other film in which I recall him playing an American was Hurry Sundown from the late sixties. I will leave comment on his accent to those who are more familiar with Maine than I (I have only visited the state once, and that only briefly), but I felt that his was the best acting performance in the film. For all his faults, Larch is basically a kindly man, deeply attached to the children in his care, and Caine brought this out well. I was less impressed with Tobey Maguire as Homer. As a result of Larch's falsifications, Homer believes himself to have a heart condition and that he must avoid too much excitement. Maguire, however, seems to have interpreted this as meaning that Homer must never show any emotion at all, and his performance seems lifeless and wooden.The film has an attractive neo-classical musical score from Rachel Portman, and is photographed to show the Maine countryside in all its beauty (although, as with a number of other films set in New England, I did find myself wondering why it nearly always seems to be autumn). The film's visual beauty, however, is part of what is wrong with it. There is a serious disconnect between its visual style and its sombre themes. From what I have seen of his work, Hallstrom has always struck me as an overrated director, and The Cider House Rules reminded me of another of his films, Chocolat, in which he also uses lush, sumptuous visuals to disguise some highly questionable philosophising.

Cuáron's film holds up fairly well; it is beautifully shot, in heat-soaked colours (having been relocated to south Florida), a far remove from Lean's cold, naturalistic black and white with forced-perspective sets. The new film is also energized by some vivid acting in secondary roles, especially Anne Bancroft and Robert DeNiro.What cripples it, unfortunately, is a 90s mentality that sacrifices the most interesting parts of Dickens's narrative, for the sake of a myopic fixation on the love story between Finn (Pip) and Estella. The novel is about many things (including its astonishing array of vivid secondary characters, many of them unforgettable), but it is laid out within a trajectory of a warm- hearted young boy growing up in poverty aggravated by the self-centeredness of most of those around him, his rise to prosperity aided by a mysterious benefactor, during which he himself is corrupted, and his collapse when he discovers how mistaken he has been about many things (especially about the identity of that benefactor). In the aftermath, he discovers some genuine humanity in himself, as he is impelled to make real sacrifices to rescue his benefactor, and is himself rescued by the one truly decent character in the book.The heart of this trajectory is gone in the film. Finn is lifted up to success by a benefactor, but never confronts any demons in himself as a result of this generosity; his friend and roommate in the novel, Herbert Pocket, who shares his degradation, is left out of the film altogether. Finn never needs rescuing, and the character of Joe (one of Dickens's great creations) is much diminished; the talented Chris Cooper is given little to do, and comes across as someone to be pitied and tolerated rather than admired. Finn just goes from success to success as an artist; he never makes any sacrifices for anyone. Estella (in some ways, only a minor character in the book) is in almost every scene of the middle of the film...because those seem to be the only ones the filmmakers care about.Perhaps this film is best viewed without any reference to Dickens at all? Its love story is certainly passionate and sensual; Paltrow is beautiful (and not just in her nude modeling scene), but unfortunately Hawke is, as usual, flat and bland.

One is left at the end with the suspicion that she ultimately grabs hold of Finn the successful artist because he's successful and can support her and her daughter, now that her other lovers have left her.To be honest, the conclusion is the worst part of the novel, too. Dickens had originally written an ending where a more mature Pip meets a miserable, cynical Estella years later, and is able to observe her dispassionately, from some distance; given that she had been trained by a master (Miss Havisham) to hate and exploit men, this was probably the only conceivable ending for their story. But then he listened to advice from his friend Bulwer-Lytton, and replaced that plausible and moving ending for a Hollywood-anticipating reconciliation and fade-out (which is indeed adopted by both films).

Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, Mozart and Salieri, and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as an infectious giddy and like metal scraping glass. Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words Leck mich im Arsch and Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score &#150; mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields &#150; is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century.

This was the poster that was on a book &#150; Top 1000 movies to see before you die. I read the reviews of this movie &#150; good and bad both; especially those who hated the movie were those who had read the book. I was fortunate that I saw the moving without reading the book. This helps in enjoying it more.So this was my opportunity to see the movie. The prior knowledge that this movie is a horror movie is not a good thing to know, because one pre-conditions one mind to prepare for seeing something horror &#150; and that is the drawback of our minds.The story is based on Stephen King's novel &#150; The Shining. It is about a hotel in US that remains closed during winter snowing for six months. The author Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), wants to go to an isolated place to write a new book and remove the writer's block. He is selected as a care-taker for 6 months of this hotel, and plans to go with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd). In the beginning they are very happy and excited to be in this enormous place with nobody around. But as time passes Jack starts becoming insane due to these isolation, and the ghosts of the hotel inspire him to kill his son.The movie mostly revolves around these three characters, but there are two more big characters in the movies &#150; the sound track and camera work. The knowledge of this being a horror movie &#150; makes us view every scene with an expectation of something will happen, and that is what creates a feeling of tension. A simple shot of child driving his small tricycle in the empty corridors of the hotel is chilling to say the least. The child stopping and looking at the half open door &#150; is enormously terrifying than seeing a crude make-up ghost in drab movies like Evil Dead etc.The director &#150; Stanley Kubrick has not used night scenes, dark images, shocking editing, sudden entry, loud bangs to awake us to realize it is a horror movie. But he uses subtle consistent musical score that builds up on your nerves. The opening long shots of the journey to the mountain are breath-taking.Jack Nicholson is as his usual self. He has his own style and whims. Anyways as always he has acted well. Shelley Duvall brings life to her role as a typical housewife &#150; who is modest, next door looks, and humane to protect her husband and son; and Danny Lloyd is the best (he actually won the best supporting actor's award) in his role and portrayed the child's character brilliantly.A trivia I read was that Danny Lloyd did not know that he is working in a horror movie &#150; while shooting was on, and even after 2 years on &#150; he did not know it. He just acted in one more movie before retiring to routine life.I consider this movie very similar to Omen in creating fear &#150; without using the commercial gimmick of horror movies. Now I can venture to read the book. People say that the book is better than the movie. So I can enjoy it more!

The prior knowledge that this movie is a horror movie is not a good thing to know, because one pre-conditions one mind to prepare for seeing something horror &#150; and that is the drawback of our minds.The story is based on Stephen King's novel &#150; The Shining. It is about a hotel in US that remains closed during winter snowing for six months. The author Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), wants to go to an isolated place to write a new book and remove the writer's block. He is selected as a care-taker for 6 months of this hotel, and plans to go with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd). In the beginning they are very happy and excited to be in this enormous place with nobody around. But as time passes Jack starts becoming insane due to these isolation, and the ghosts of the hotel inspire him to kill his son.The movie mostly revolves around these three characters, but there are two more big characters in the movies &#150; the sound track and camera work. The knowledge of this being a horror movie &#150; makes us view every scene with an expectation of something will happen, and that is what creates a feeling of tension. A simple shot of child driving his small tricycle in the empty corridors of the hotel is chilling to say the least. The child stopping and looking at the half open door &#150; is enormously terrifying than seeing a crude make-up ghost in drab movies like Evil Dead etc.The director &#150; Stanley Kubrick has not used night scenes, dark images, shocking editing, sudden entry, loud bangs to awake us to realize it is a horror movie. But he uses subtle consistent musical score that builds up on your nerves. The opening long shots of the journey to the mountain are breath-taking.Jack Nicholson is as his usual self. He has his own style and whims. Anyways as always he has acted well. Shelley Duvall brings life to her role as a typical housewife &#150; who is modest, next door looks, and humane to protect her husband and son; and Danny Lloyd is the best (he actually won the best supporting actor's award) in his role and portrayed the child's character brilliantly.A trivia I read was that Danny Lloyd did not know that he is working in a horror movie &#150; while shooting was on, and even after 2 years on &#150; he did not know it. He just acted in one more movie before retiring to routine life.I consider this movie very similar to Omen in creating fear &#150; without using the commercial gimmick of horror movies. Now I can venture to read the book. People say that the book is better than the movie. So I can enjoy it more!

The plane's pilot (Kim Robillard) who is also in on the plan is supposed to send the money which is packed in suitcases across but things go wrong & the cases fall to earth somewhere in the mountains, the pilot is shot as is Qualen's jet which crash lands in the desolate, icy terrain of the Rockies. The men are desperate to get the money & agent Travers has a tracking device which will lead them to it but they need guides so they make a call to the local mountain rescue team who send Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) & Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) who Qualen intends to use to lead them to the money but Gabe knows once they have it he & Hal are as good as dead so sets about spoiling Qualen's plans...This Italian, French & American co-production was produced & directed by Renny Harlin & I think it's one of those terrific action packed unashamedly violent & excessive big budget adventure flicks from the 90's which they just don't seem to make anymore. The script by Michael France & star Sylvester Stallone is a story of an ordinary man who turns the odds on a gang of known international thieves in a far fetched but sensational way, basically there's enough needless killing, fighting, bad language, gun fights, crashes, improbable action set-pieces, plot holes, rock climbing & downright overblown silliness to keep any action junkie such as myself happy for it's two hour duration. The character's are pretty good although the scene at the start where Gabe tries & fails to rescue Sarah (Michelle Joyner) is quickly forgotten & doesn't really amount to much, the heroes are suitably heroic while the bad guys are suitably bad, what more do you want? The dialogue is alright & the story is quite exciting, it moves along like a rocket so it never bores & I just think it makes for fantastic action packed entertainment. A lot of these types of films are criticised because they are brainless, well that's true but that's why people do like them. They are pure popcorn flicks you can watch & enjoy all the wanton destruction & needless violence taking place, I'm a big fan of the 90's action flick & Cliffhanger is right up there with the best of them. There are a few silly moments like how Gabe manages to survive the avalanche that falls right on top of him, how he can swim in what would be literally freezing water without a shirt & survive with no ill effects & how the strapping on Sarah can magically un-do itself but what the hell no-one said these sorts of films had to be realistic, it's only a film right?Director Harlin does a good job & the mountain location provides a striking backdrop to the action, set in Colorado it was actually shot in Italy when apparently the American Environmental Protection Agency refused the production permission to film because of potential damage by the filmmakers! Cliffhanger also contains the most expensive aerial stunt ever filmed, at over $1 million the plane-to-plane transfer cost a lot considering how long it appears on screen. While the film does have plenty of action scenes they are mostly of the gun fight & beating people up variety, there's a plane & helicopter crash but not much else. One word of warning though, Cliffhanger in it's uncut state (sorry anyone who has a UK copy it's cut to bits) is an extremely violent film & a very bloody one as well with every bullet hit accompanied by a wound gushing blood.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Cliffhnager is quite well made & has impressive widescreen cinematography but there are a few continuity problems, for instance when Qualen's jet crash lands the final shot of it is of the nose overshooting a cliff edge by a fair margin but in the very next shot the jet is completely on the ground. The acting is OK but nothing special, apparently Christopher Walken had been cast as the lead villain before dropping out which is a shame because he's an intense actor & he'd have made for a great baddie.Cliffhanger is one of those 90's action flicks which are just so entertaining & overblown, this is one of the better ones with great action & loads of unnecessary violence. I liked it a lot & think there are far worse ways to spend a couple of hours, definitely recommended but just stay away from the rubbishy cut UK versions.

Searching for something better. A parallel place. The scene where he erupts, a ball of tension and explodes at the top of the landing is almost unbearable in its intensity. The lingering shots of the characters are ghostly and unforgettable. Gina McKee as the drab almost gray woman who asks him if he wants beans, is such a sorry damaged character yet very real. I can imagine meeting her. Leigh lifts the lid and allows us to peer into the loneliness of the human condition and it is not a comfortable place to venture. The older woman's expression when Johnny says that line to her that any woman of her age dreads, well, I challenge any actor to deliver a finer reaction.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"3 July 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Although I'm very fond of this movie, and rate it highly, I can see why it might not be to everyone's taste. The values it appears to espouse, and to imply are universal, are underpinned by other, unspoken principals that today might stick in the craw. For example, although there are no black faces in the film, Skip to my Lou and Under the Bamboo Tree both refer in an unthinking and somewhat patronising way to non-white cultures. On a different critical tack, none of women in the film show the slightest inclination to move beyond the home. You might reply to these criticisms, with justification, that they err in applying liberal stances of our own day to those of both St Louis 1903 and Hollywood 1944. But, as I say, I can see the objections.Nonetheless, I am both impressed and moved whenever I watch Meet Me In St Louis. Impressed by the beautiful camera-work, the splendidly crafted sets and costumes, and the excellent performances. Moved by the result of the underlying structure, taking us through a year from one Spring to another, through the fear of encroaching night of Autumn, into the darkness of Winter, and out the other side. And moved, too, by the honour of the characters. When June Lockhart's Lucille Ballard turns out to be the very opposite of the Smith girls' vision of an East Coast snob, they are forced to change their unworthy little plan. The ensuing scene is one of the highlights of the picture for me, as Judy Garland's Esther, put on the spot by her grandfather (wonderful Harry Davenport), pays the price for her and her sister's meanness of spirit, and is rewarded by the unexpected appearance of her true love.Yes, maybe these comfortable people in their big house can afford to be big-hearted. But that's the way symbolic drama has always worked Oedipus and Lear are kings so that their fall is all the greater. This is the key to the inevitably more modest Meet Me In St Louis, but nonetheless the film is amazingly ambitious on its own terms, and teaches its moral lessons well, particularly so in the ballroom episode I've described above, but elsewhere too for example, when Leon Ames's Alonzo witnesses his youngest daughter's extreme distress at the thought of leaving St Louis, and finds a way out of the situation in which he has dumped himself and his family, and thus demoting the economic values he has put before the happiness of his nearest and dearest.But it isn't all morals. The emotional heart of Meet Me In St Louis is the relationship between sisters Esther and Tootie, played by the headliners Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien. This finds its climax in the heart-rending Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, which I have watched through tears on many occasions.

As we've seen, it's not as if darkness doesn't inhabit the world of Meet Me In St Louis, in particular that of Tootie, who imagines she has killed someone, that someone has tried to kill her, that Katie the maid (the incomparable Marjorie Main) has killed her cat, and so on. But today the no-place-like-home\/love-conquers-all message of this wartime fantasy, no matter how brilliantly it is realised, sits as uneasily with us as, say, Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew does.The fact that I can happily discuss Meet Me In St Louis in the same breath as great works of drama demonstrates to me that whatever reservations I, or others, may have, it is still a magnificent achievement, and an undoubted masterpiece of American cinema.

Miller's Crossing is the film which indisputably established the Coens' talent as a pair of film-makers who would go down in history, following their prior success of Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. The tangled web, fuming with deceit, betrayal and vengeance has now become a fundamental trademark for the Coens' films.Gabriel Byrne performs as Tom Reagan, an adviser for the mob, who thinks before he speaks, yet is prepared to speak his mind, whatever the cost, something he learns is dangerous in the company of the men he is surrounded by. He is essentially a man who lives in a world surrounded by crime, while being a criminal himself, nonetheless he does not attempt find trouble, but rather trouble finds him due to his fraternising with countless mobsters and the dangerous use of his tongue. Due to the frequent swaying of Tom's loyalty it is inevitable that he is going to make enemies; eventually changing sides and turning-the-tables on his long-time friend and business partner Leo (played by Albert Finney). Leo is the king of the city, yet because of a disagreement and rejection of a hit proposed by fellow mob-boss Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), Tom and Leo fall out. Set around America's prohibition in the 1930s, the film charts the tale of gangsters abusing a corrupt system of injustice and moral decay.Tom Reagan is an immoral man who is striving to gain a meaning to his unethical lifestyle, attempting to balance his apprehension, guilt and moral-values. If problems such as never knowing who to trust and choosing whether to dispose of a friend are not enough, he is also subconsciously seeking to build a relationship, something which is painfully difficult under his circumstances. He is struggling to find values beneath his brutal lifestyle of criminal activity. Tom Reagan has friends as such, but most of them are with him for protection, or in some cases, the other way round. Acting is one of the countless aspects of flawlessness in Miller's Crossing, considering everyone from Gabriel Byrne, to Albert Finney, to John Turturro and Jon Polito give career-defining performances of enthusiastic supremacy.It is fact that the characters of Miller's Crossing are all intelligent people, in some way, even unexpectedly. Everyone is in search of something and hold some sort of initiative and hidden prerogative behind their decisions. Written with an almighty gusto, the characters roll off the screen from both the hard-edged, bitter script and the unsentimental, glaringly robust performances. Miller's Crossing, as with most Coen Brother films follows a dialogue-driven narrative, invigorated by dark humour, blunt, snappy one-liners and quick-fire conversations which feel humanly laboured and distant. All this helps to create the cold ambiance of the film; capturing the period through convincing set-pieces, props and costumes of the time, giving the film that extra level of accuracy.As expected with a film of this kind, Miller's Crossing has scenes brimming with grandiose violence, which is blood-thirsty and brutal in capturing the irrational foolishness of a human's lust for brutality. Shot in a method which is almost fantasy-like, the now-timeless imagery will become lodged in your mind for eternity. The cinematography is moody, smoky, edgy and cold. Miller's Crossing successfully captures the meaning behind a scene through evocative environments, which etch varied tones of emotion into the viewer. Many of the film's key themes are told through metaphorical imagery, a key image being the hat, a metaphor which is open to interpretation. The film benefits from morose lighting and shadows, emphasising elements such as the furniture and architecture of buildings. Camera angles are also a leading importance for Miller's Crossing, with moments of uncomfortable, gawky positioning, serving to accentuate the thorny, paradoxical plot. The use of zooms, slow fades, quick-cuts and stretching shots make addition to the film's stunning technical achievements. Gracefully placed editing alleviates the low-brow humour and tension, and not forgetting the beautifully poetic score, which fits the characters' distant desires.Complicated, high-strung, cold-blooded storytelling, which is unlike anything you will ever see. Miller's Crossing does stick to its film-noir and gangster movie roots, but ultimately it is an illustration of an individual's principles and the senseless violence of gangsters struggling for power. Twists and turns can be rarely executed with such perfection, Miller's Crossing offers viewers much to ponder, meaning revisiting such an underrated masterpiece is obligatory.

Arnold on the other hand, is a walking computer with explainable parts.Followed by a second sequel, Terminator 3 The Rise of the Machines (2003) which, to date, is Schwarzeneggar's final film.

Rope stands out in Hitchcock's filmography trivia as his first color movie.Any review of Rope's technical aspects will undoubtedly mention the fact that the movie was filmed in extended scenes without much editing or cutting. The length of scenes before cut was called range between 437 and 1006 in length. I think this is immediately obvious to any movie watcher who looks out for these kinds of things. Many criticize Hitchcock's decision here because the cuts are obvious and forced. For instance, to provide one cut, Hitchcock zooms into the back of a character, the cut happens, then the next cut picks up with the zoom out and continues with the next sequence. I did find several of the cuts distracting, and that is one of my pet peeves of movies is when the technical aspects get in the way and become obvious. I think the cuts between extended scenes should have been smoother so that the effect of the extended scenes would not be distracted by the cuts.However, Hitchcock is the prototypical auteur and I think this may be his stamp on the movie. The director is in charge. Hitchcock is in charge. But, I have often heard that Hitchcock thought the camera should just be another character in the room observing what is going on. What character would run into someone's back? But, I don't want to dwell on this point too much.A friend of mine spotted one scene where Brandon and Phillip were interacting and asked me, Are you watching a gay movie? Thinking back on it and reading other reviews, one can definitely watch Rope as a homo-erotic movie. The two main characters are based on Leopold and Loeb to some extent, the actors were gay in real life, the screenwriter was gay, the composer of the piano piece was gay, the part of Rupert Cadell was originally offered to a gay person and turned down by Cary Grant because of surrounding homo-eroticism, and the screenplay was heavily edited to remove sayings from the original British play which when interpreted were heavily homo-erotic. But, they managed to get it by the censors of the time with what it is now. If you look closely, though, there are enough remnants that viewing the movie with a homo-erotic slant is not out of the question -- there's still some dialog to examine and several instances of phallic imagery namely the wine bottle. So there's that.My main contention with the movie comes at the very beginning. Hitchcock decided to show the murder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is highly suspenseful even with the showing of the murder. But, I can only start watching the movie from after the showing of the murder to see just how much more suspenseful the movie would have been without showing the murder. It would then be the Macguffin of this film and what a Macguffin it would have been. The extended sequences would then work to an even greater effect by having the holding place in camera's view and the viewer would constantly be wondering, Is he in there or not? Even better, never reveal whether there was anyone in there or not! Ultimately, I enjoyed watching the movie. I really did. But I don't think the extended shots and Macguffin were used in conjunction to the extent I would have liked. So, Rope doesn't fully deliver for me.

The two major features are roughly the same, the attempted drowning that doesn't happen and the accidental one that does. However, the story and the style that go around it are almost complete opposites.Sunrise is about a lower class man tempted by a spider woman from the city, whereas A Place in the Sun has the man not tempted but actually appealed to the upper class woman. The former is, in its way, a criticism of the modern city and represents the idyllic farmer as the hero, whereas this movie twists the American Dream by almost giving it to the hero before removing everything from underneath him. Sunrise is a silent film, and A Place in the Sun does a lot of expressionist work with sound. Both Sunrise and A Place in the Sun juxtapose cheery and light framings with dark and moody chiaroscuro. However it is in the use of these juxtaposed moods that A Place in the Sun shows itself as a better movie.The problem with Sunrise is that it takes great effort to show the evil temptations of the city-scape, and then sets the city as the place where love is rekindled. In A Place in the Sun, however, the relationship between entrapment and freedom are kept to their separate realms. Shelly Winters' room is a dark and brooding place, she wears grays and heavy coats, everything about her is hunkered down and weighted. Elizabeth Taylor lives in a world of whites and light, and even though Angela is technically the more shallow character, the direction absolutely refuses to let the audience not fall in love with her. It is in that stark contrast that we relate to Montgomery Clift's brooding George Eastman, who doesn't really mean to create problems but due to his own insecurities and humility thinks that the Dream is impossible and that he must settle for what's left--until he suddenly finds himself within reach of all he's ever wanted.A Place in the Sun certainly succeeds in being an American Tragedy, and what's more, it works in a very logical way, especially with the trial scene.

Finally he snaps & gets out of his car & decides to walk home, on the way he wants to call his ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey) & check on his daughter Adele (Joey Hope Singer). However he runs out of change, he goes into the nearest shop to ask for some but the owner (Michael Paul Chan) won't give him any. William completely flips & smashes the shop up with a baseball bat but still pays for his Coke, he sets off on foot across L.A. & gets into more trouble as he fights back against the things in society which annoy him...This French American co-production was directed by Joel Schumacher & is an interesting film that almost works, as it is it's a watchable piece of moralistic exploitation but it isn't quite the classic that it could have been. The script by Ebbe Roe Smith has a fascinating premise that many of us have probably thought about doing ourselves that of an ordinary man lashing out against the petty bureaucracy & the pressures of everyday life in a spectacular way. It's starts out terrifically with Douglas just leaving his car in the middle of a traffic jam because walking would be quicker & I just love the scene in the burger restaurant where he makes a impassioned speech about the difference in the picture of a burger & the one he actually gets as it's a scene I can really relate to! However while Falling Down starts out as a dark comedic attack on consumerism & has a nice social commentary running through it the film doesn't do anything with it at all & quickly jettisons it in favour of a standard psycho on the loose & the police who are tracking him down type scenario which is nothing new & Douglas's character becomes like those he was initially targeting. By the time Douglas is using bazooka rocket launchers to blow freeway construction sites up the film has run out of steam & feels like it's forgotten it's own purpose. The ending where Douglas suddenly realises he has become the bad guy would have been good if the film had maintained it's attack on consumerism & petty law making but it doesn't so it isn't.Director Schumacher does alright, he keeps things moving along I suppose & there are some funny moments together with the more violent ones. I wouldn't call Falling Down an action flick but there are a few set-pieces here. The film starts out so well I'm not sure what happened to it but somewhere along the line it loses it's initial appeal. There's some violence, someone is stabbed in the shoulder, there's a drive by shooting, people are beaten with baseball bats & a construction site is blown up. The film also has racist overtones, Douglas comments on the Korean shop owner not being able to speak proper English as he smashes his shop up, all the gun wielding gangs are of Mexican origin, there's anti gay dialogue, one character is a Nazi who hates gays, blacks & foreigners, the homeless are portrayed as aggressive lying beggars & Douglas has a rant about the rich at the end in which he lets someone die because he's playing golf.Technically the film is very good with on location L.A. shooting, it certainly has that big budget look about it & it has high production values. The IMDb says that Falling Down was filmed between 29th April & 4th May 1992, so the IMDb are saying Falling Down was shot in a week! I think they need to find more reliable sources... The acting is OK, Douglas is alright as the anti-hero while Duvall is alright as the cop tracking him down.Falling Down could have been a classic had it been consistent throughout, as it is it's still an entertaining film with a dark humorous streak that I liked.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"3 July 2007","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Falling Down starts on a gridlocked Los Angeles freeway, the seemingly ordinary William Foster (Michael Douglas) is stuck in his car on a swelteringly hot day, the noise of car horns & people shouting begins to bother him, then there's the fly which is buzzing around his head. Finally he snaps & gets out of his car & decides to walk home, on the way he wants to call his ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey) & check on his daughter Adele (Joey Hope Singer). However he runs out of change, he goes into the nearest shop to ask for some but the owner (Michael Paul Chan) won't give him any. William completely flips & smashes the shop up with a baseball bat but still pays for his Coke, he sets off on foot across L.A. & gets into more trouble as he fights back against the things in society which annoy him...This French American co-production was directed by Joel Schumacher & is an interesting film that almost works, as it is it's a watchable piece of moralistic exploitation but it isn't quite the classic that it could have been. The script by Ebbe Roe Smith has a fascinating premise that many of us have probably thought about doing ourselves that of an ordinary man lashing out against the petty bureaucracy & the pressures of everyday life in a spectacular way. It's starts out terrifically with Douglas just leaving his car in the middle of a traffic jam because walking would be quicker & I just love the scene in the burger restaurant where he makes a impassioned speech about the difference in the picture of a burger & the one he actually gets as it's a scene I can really relate to! However while Falling Down starts out as a dark comedic attack on consumerism & has a nice social commentary running through it the film doesn't do anything with it at all & quickly jettisons it in favour of a standard psycho on the loose & the police who are tracking him down type scenario which is nothing new & Douglas's character becomes like those he was initially targeting. By the time Douglas is using bazooka rocket launchers to blow freeway construction sites up the film has run out of steam & feels like it's forgotten it's own purpose. The ending where Douglas suddenly realises he has become the bad guy would have been good if the film had maintained it's attack on consumerism & petty law making but it doesn't so it isn't.Director Schumacher does alright, he keeps things moving along I suppose & there are some funny moments together with the more violent ones. I wouldn't call Falling Down an action flick but there are a few set-pieces here. The film starts out so well I'm not sure what happened to it but somewhere along the line it loses it's initial appeal. There's some violence, someone is stabbed in the shoulder, there's a drive by shooting, people are beaten with baseball bats & a construction site is blown up. The film also has racist overtones, Douglas comments on the Korean shop owner not being able to speak proper English as he smashes his shop up, all the gun wielding gangs are of Mexican origin, there's anti gay dialogue, one character is a Nazi who hates gays, blacks & foreigners, the homeless are portrayed as aggressive lying beggars & Douglas has a rant about the rich at the end in which he lets someone die because he's playing golf.Technically the film is very good with on location L.A. shooting, it certainly has that big budget look about it & it has high production values. The IMDb says that Falling Down was filmed between 29th April & 4th May 1992, so the IMDb are saying Falling Down was shot in a week! I think they need to find more reliable sources... The acting is OK, Douglas is alright as the anti-hero while Duvall is alright as the cop tracking him down.Falling Down could have been a classic had it been consistent throughout, as it is it's still an entertaining film with a dark humorous streak that I liked.
