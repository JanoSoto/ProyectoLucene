[{"date":"28 December 2014","score":"","review":" Hitchcock made this movie three times the first was released in 1935 called The 39 Steps, the second in 1942 called Saboteur, and the third in 1959 named North by Northwest.The basic ingredients are (1) A lonely man wrongfully accused of something he didn't do. (2) His wanting to have himself in the clear. (3) His incapacity of turning his case over to justice. (4) His pursuit of the party who incriminated him. (5) His involvement in between with a blond girl that he can't trust. (6) His final encounter with his nemesis, preferably at a spectacular site.The 39 Steps is truly a masterpiece, for it is still mesmerizes you in spite of being filmed 80 years ago! Which other movie that old does that? None whatsoever, I dare you. (The next likely candidate, The Lady Vanishes was only released three years later, and was directed by the Master of Suspense as well.)Now, North by Northwest would have been this masterpiece, had it not been preceded by The 39 Steps. Noth by Northwest has some unforgettable moments as the pesticide aircraft chase, but the plot is anything but new.Saboteur differs from the other two pictures in being excessively patriotic and antifascist, somewhat of war propaganda, shot during WWII as it was. It does have some exciting moments, but having seen the other two movies in the trilogy, it just sticks out as the lesser attempt of them.

Hitchcock, just the way he liked, delivers to us a very macabre movie. The premiss is simple, two friends decide to murder someone, and hide the body in an old chest, then they invite some people (all related to the deceased) and throw a party with the chest as a centerpiece. Simple, right? No, because between all this we have complex dialogs debating if murder can be justified or not and also a lot of black humor. - Oh, it isn't someone's birthday is it? - It's, uh, really almost the opposite. James Stewart just like we are used to delivers a good performance as well as John Dall (who I didn't knew). I'm sure who likes Hitchcock will also like this movie.
