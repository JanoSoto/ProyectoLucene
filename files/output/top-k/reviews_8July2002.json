Some people may dispute his movies at times, but they can not ignore his impact on cinema. This is one of his most thoughtful and unique films, though may not be comparable to Schindler's list or A.I. or Saving Private Ryan in certain aspects (my favourite serious Spielberg's films). I'm so glad to see such a gem in the midst of a summer popcorn season. Tom Cruise can be very good, and he showed it in Magnolia (another favourite of mine by another interesting director to watch, P.T. Anderson) and Jerry McGuire. In this film, he is quite compelling and he has a commanding screen presence, even when he's around so many interesting characters (terrific supporting cast). Samantha Morton is very effective. My favourite character is played by Colin Farrell though. He is the definition of cool!!!I really liked the script, which was clever in its use of language. I'm touched at a few places in the film, especially the part when ***SPOILER*** he lost his son at the swimming pool. You've got to see ***SPOILER*** Tom chasing his rolling eyeball; it was the most hilarious scene i've seen so far this summer. This is a well-made film, like all of Spielberg's films. It is tighter than his last film, A.I. though i prefer the latter mainly because Haley (David in A.I.) is such, such a genius when it comes to acting (and because i wept watching that film). There was a slight disappointment i felt walking out of this film because of all the hype prior to the release of the film. I thought the tone of the film is uneven at places. Some scenes (i.e. the car chasing scene) had an unpolished look to them. Overall, a great film from a great director. 8\/10.

Actually, the train wreck comparison isn't really fair, train wrecks elicit the famous rubber-necking syndrome, where human nature and its fascination with abomination demand at least a cursory glance at the smoldering wreckage.  Men In Black II does nothing to make me want to watch it other than the chance to participate in a fun game of counting up how many different things Will Smith refers to as joints in the movie.  Will Smith also uses this movie as an opportunity to produce another hit single.  And by hit single I mean 70's song which he steals the music from, changes the words to, and then says ha-ha a bunch of times during.Speaking of Will Smith, he returns to play  his I'm-Will-Smith-and-I'm-in-a-movie-but-I'm-not-playing-Ali-so-I'll-just-prete nd-this-is-an-episode-of-the-Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air character that he's honed to perfection over the years.  Taking his side for part of the movie is that talking dog from the first movie who has inexplicably risen his status from scum bag informant to MIB agent material because he is selected to be Will Smith's partner for a brief, although not nearly brief enough, portion of the movie.  At this point numerous gags are made based on the fact that the dog is talking.  This of course is funny because dogs don't actually talk.  Pushing the inane envelope even further, to the point where I developed a facial tick, was when they had the talking dog sing along with the hit #1 single, Who Let the Dog's Out.  Sony was obviously trying to cash in on the booming success of Disney's Snow Dogs, and I have to say that although I have not seen Snow Dogs, I liked it better.The phrase cash in reminds me of another great feature of MIB II, the ubiquitous product placement.  If you didn't know that Burger King and Sprint were tied to this picture before you see it, you certainly will after.  Not that it interferes with the plot, since Sonnenfeld didn't seem to bother with finding one.  What little semblance of a plot there is seems mainly concerned with fiddling around with the ending of the last movie so that Tommy Lee Jones can appear again in this one.  Other than that, there's some Light of Zarra, or something, that can blow up the world somehow, or something, thereby leaving the audience with a feeling of suspense, or something.But Adam, summer movies don't need plots, you say, just so long as they keep me laughing.  Well I'm sorry my friend but every joke in this movie falls into three categories. 1.  Hey, I remember that from the trailer. 2.  Hey, I remember that from the first movie. 3.  Right, I get it, its a talking dog. The part of the movie I found funniest was the guy sitting behind me in the theater who laughed uproariously at such scenes as, Will Smith driving up to a post office, or Will Smith saying I'll be in the gym.  He also liked the talking dog.  Did I mention there's a talking dog?  At least we know Sonnenfeld is laughing, laughing all the way to the bank.  And good for him, he deserves it.The actors themselves weren't that bad, even if you'd seen most of them before.  As for the new ones, there was a slightly attractive love interest for Will Smith who I wish was hotter but didn't do anything to directly detract from the movie.  You get to see most of Lara Flynn Boyle's breasts, which are remarkably large for someone who weighs 24 pounds.  Jimmy Knoxville plays a dopey alien side-kick competently enough I suppose.  The strange thing about Knoxville's character is that he seemingly vanishes without explanation about 2\/3 of the way through the movie.  However, in all honesty, they may have explained it and I just missed it while I was distracted by lighting myself on fire. There's also a talking dog, but I think I talked about him already.All in all this movie was a double barreled misfire.  No plot, not funny, no writers, no ending, but hey at least it was only 80 minutes long, that's $.10 a minute at your typical movie venue, a rate that could be much better utilized by calling your grandma in Topeka long-distance and telling her you love her.  I honestly don't understand how anyone living outside of Kentucky or Upstate NY could possibly enjoy this movie.  Do not go see this movie, I repeat, do not go see this movie.  Take the $8 you would have spent on the ticket and play some mini-golf, buy your girlfriend an ice cream cone, make a donation to Greenpeace, something anything besides sitting in a darkened room for 80 minutes and trying to keep from scratching out your own eyes with the straw from your $4 soda.

You get to see most of Lara Flynn Boyle's breasts, which are remarkably large for someone who weighs 24 pounds.  Jimmy Knoxville plays a dopey alien side-kick competently enough I suppose.  The strange thing about Knoxville's character is that he seemingly vanishes without explanation about 2\/3 of the way through the movie.  However, in all honesty, they may have explained it and I just missed it while I was distracted by lighting myself on fire. There's also a talking dog, but I think I talked about him already.All in all this movie was a double barreled misfire.  No plot, not funny, no writers, no ending, but hey at least it was only 80 minutes long, that's $.10 a minute at your typical movie venue, a rate that could be much better utilized by calling your grandma in Topeka long-distance and telling her you love her.  I honestly don't understand how anyone living outside of Kentucky or Upstate NY could possibly enjoy this movie.  Do not go see this movie, I repeat, do not go see this movie.  Take the $8 you would have spent on the ticket and play some mini-golf, buy your girlfriend an ice cream cone, make a donation to Greenpeace, something anything besides sitting in a darkened room for 80 minutes and trying to keep from scratching out your own eyes with the straw from your $4 soda.  My recommendation is to wait for it to come out on video, and then rent something else.

He does it, and sees the violence that takes place there, and when he returns to US and tells about the evil dictator that dominates there, the new job for him is to travel there again and wipe out the incarnation of evil..This film isn't any action film as many seem to have expected - me included - but this is pretty sophisticated, but still also little slow moving (dir. cut. 15mins longer than the US version) portrait about the state of some countries in the world, and what these dictators can do to people and country. I'm mostly fascinated by the film's atmosphere and calmness as there isn't stupid gunplay or other usual flaws often found in these films. Walken acts greatly in his role of retired war veteran who takes the job only because of money offered to him. At the end, a twist in plot is coming and all the greediness and betrayal in the film gets a new face.The end is little stupid as it tries to imitate Apocalypse Now a little, by depicting Walken's face and the horror as Francis Ford Coppola did, and the gun fights at the end are also little unnecessary, especially when the film managed to be without them for so long. Still the result is satisfying, yet little too long and occasionally may make the viewer feel little tired, but this film isn't meant to be watched when tired. The US distributor cut the original version by over ten minutes, and I saw the original director's cut which includes many important bits of dialogue and things that add to the film. So I recommend the director's cut of the film as it is the directors original version.Dogs of War is pretty intelligent and interesting depiction of power and dictatorship, and also very nostalgic in its atmosphere and scenery. The gun battle at the end of the film is great looking and also gripping, but as mentioned, also little unnecessary and too traditional finale. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2002","score":"18 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":"  John Irvin directed this film, starring Christopher Walken as war veteran mercenary who gets a job by government to travel to Africa and inform the situation that is pretty hot in there.

This flick seems to imply that the opposite is true; that the standards of class structure which sustain this strife-producing social imbalance very much rest on pillars of what most people consider a bedrock moral standard We have what we have because we deserve what we have; and the corollary If you don't have it, you don't deserve it, so shut up already. The big question, and the one pushed by Ripley, regards the extent to which the careful maintenance of class privilege defines morality, NOT the other way 'round.When you look at it in this light, it seems to unlock the riddles of much violent immorality in the world. As an American, I would naturally be inclined to see blithe, never-ending warmaking as a perfect example.The image we're left with--which allows one to reasonably extrapolate future violence and eventual capture and conviction--makes me wonder how long it will be until society finally catches up with the biggest scam of all; class privilege, and the church, state, media, and common knowledge institutions that pose and lie on its behalf.It would be disingenuous not to touch upon the images of upper-classhood shown, and it certainly is a mixed bag. Marge seems almost tailor made to teach us that deference to our betters could be the wise course. But the oily Freddie and the blind, pampered Meredith quickly lead us out of that particular temptation. And Dickie walks the line. He's an apparently gracious expression of honorably-directed privilege, but one which swiftly disperses under the glare of the light of simple probity. If we could choose to be one of these high-lifers, we would probably choose to be Marge. She lends a welcome touch of balance to an otherwise powerfully negative presentation of class privilege. Let's give thanks for Marge, then get on our knees and pray for the whole obscene mess to be finally exposed for the slo-mo moral train wreck that it is.

Repo Man is also the only film which I can watch over and over again yet never find even a single moment of it to have become mundane or tedious through the repetition. But having to try to describe what makes Repo Man so good, or even what it's really about, is extremely difficult because the things Repo Man does can only be done through the medium of film - and this, of course, is part of what makes it such an outstanding accomplishment.Repo Man is basically a post-modern urban-setting western. Repo Men are cowboys, rugged individualists with a code of honor. They work hard and they play harder. The desolate landscape they ride in is not the American West, but a modern society which has been completely dumbed down by the irresistible lure of the least common denominator. Ordinary people, like Otto's parents, are just inanimate objects in that landscape. They cling to whichever leader provides a simplistic faith or belief that promises to give meaning and purpose to their existence. The Repo Men are a vanishing breed of rugged individualists in a world increasingly dedicated to instant gratification and mass consumption, or perhaps they're the pioneers of a new frontier, trying to discover how to maintain their spiritual independence in this harsh new landscape.All of this is made possible because the film achieves such a high level of excellence in all aspects of film-making. The landscape, so important a part of any western, is brilliantly depicted through the integration of sight, sound, music, and action. Attention and creativity are lavished on even the smallest details. Don't be fooled, however, by the comfort of having a code to live by. The honor and integrity of these cowboys is just a shallow illusion, and you're missing the point if you believe that salvation lies with the Repo Men or in a whacked-out homeless man developing a special rapport with aliens. There is no salvation other than just staying awake and trying to see things for what they really might be.

It combines irony, humour and criticism on a very serious matter, such as nuclear combat between the two superpowers of the 20th century in a daring yet remarkable way.

It is hard to make serious movies about 'the Bomb'. It is much harder, to make a comedy about it, and while at it a comedy that manages to defy not only the fear of the era in which it came out, but also convey several important messages to the rulers of this planet about their actions. I believe there's not much one can say about this movie. Everyone should see it and try to imagine how daring and amazing a feat this movie is in the near-fascist political climate of the 60s in the Western world, where Communist fear brought the nuclear threat into everyone's life.

I cannot think of another film to equal this one as far as interesting characters are concerned, and 99% of what makes a film work is an excellent cast!  We have this amazing family of grave robbing killers, who also kill the living at times and use them for BBQ at some gas station that one of them owns.  There is Leather Face, There is The Hitchhiker, There is the old man(the fellow who sells the human BBQ), and of course, there's Grandpa too.  All of these characters are a mystery in American culture, and we have seen them all at one point or another.  The Hitchiker works on a variety of different levels, he's the disturbed child, the sadistic killer, but he's also just a young guy looking for a good time. Leather Face is truly like a Jack The Ripper of sorts, because it is painfully difficult to figure out who and what he is all about, but, then again, perhaps he is just a meaningless beast?  The old man is able to blend in with everyday people quite easily, by wearing the mask of a southern gentlemen, although I use the term very loosely.  Grandpa is a classic character if there ever was one, because we often see in society, those who look so painfully awful that they make us physically sick, and Grandpa is a very good example of this sort of person.  The victims are quite funny, and you do actually care about them to a certain extent, which is entirely rare for even the best of horror films.  Also, a couple of the victims actually have fully developed personalities and are more than just one note characters to be laughably killed. I could carry on about this film for quite some time, because it works on every level any decent film works on.  You will laugh, you will cry, and it will truly make you think.  One last thing, the entire cast were very desperate performers and artists working in the medium of film when this feature was put together, and it really shows in the final product. Everybody involved added so much to create for a truly unique cinematic experience.  I must also add that I am very fond of the female lead, because she needs not one person to help her when horrible and troubling situations occur, she survives by will alone. And if this review seems painfully vague to you, then perhaps you should simply rent the film so that you can watch the brilliant story unfold for yourself?

I have 2 really close friends who remind me so much oh bob and steve-o... it's a good movie about 2 true punks in Salt Lake City and in the end Steve-o understands that anarchy will never work out... that everyone is a poser in their own way because of how fake they can make themselves up to be... and things always happens for a reason... there were some cast members and part of the movie I hated though... but all in all it's a great movie if your into punk.
