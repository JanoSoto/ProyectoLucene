I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade b8.5\/10.0\/bNow, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about duck and cover and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.

As I watched it without knowing that, I was reminded of MTV's Daria, especially in the way the main character, Enid, reacts to mostly everything and everyone with a mix of sarcasm and apathy. Thora Birch plays yet another teenage misfit, it's hard to tell if she's so good at it or if you're just used to seeing her in that role. There are times when the clichés and caricatures can become a bit too heavy, but overall it works.Everything in the film has a sketch-like quality, from the photography and setting to the plot itself, which is more like a series of vignettes. Sketches are also how Enid describes the reality around her, by drawing on her diary. There's a theme of fakeness running through the film and several brief comedy scenes serve to illustrate that - like when Enid and her friend are sitting in a fifties authentic diner and 80's music comes through the juke box. It's one of the signs of the uninspiring, suspended surreality they live in. Enid's friend, Rebecca, played by Scarlet Johansson, is a marginal character, she doesn't get much of a role in the film, other than to serve as contrast for Enid. She ends up adapting more easily, gets a job and a flat, and their relationship grows colder as Enid has more and more difficulty following her friend's example, or even deciding if she wants to follow that route at all. There's a scene where Rebecca, frustrated by Enid's inability to make up her mind, blurts out rather cruelly good luck living with your father for the rest of your life. That remark, along with the situation it refers to, is one of the things that lead Enid to realize she needs to take some decisions or they'll all be taken for her by others. That is what the whole film basically revolves around. There are funny bits of social satire, like the misguided controversy over Enid's art piece and the failure of her teacher to stand up for her. For Enid, even good experiences start from unpromising circumstances and her own most careless indifference. The idea of life as a matter of success vs. failure, winners vs. losers is debunked. Steve Buscemi is, as ever, absolutely brilliant as the dork Seymour. His character is also in many ways a caricature, but he gives it real depth. The unlikely affair developing between him and Enid is the most genuine part of the film. What happens to Seymour in the end is dealt with a heavier dose of comedy than perhaps would have been necessary, while Enid's future is more poetically left open-ended. For anyone expecting some sort of definite closure, this is going to be disappointing, but I don't think it is one of the flaws of the film. It just doesn't have a typical plot development so there is no contradiction in the ending being so vague. The final scene makes nice use of a tiny sub-plot that was both comical and loaded with heavier symbolism, the old man sitting on a bench waiting for a bus that never seems to come. When Enid finally catches her own bus we don't know where it leads and what she plans to do or with what money, but, as someone who really cannot stand cheesy happy endings, I thought this was a nice way of closing the film. She finally gets the courage to enact her wish about leaving in exactly the way she had talked of before. It does work as a resolution in an understated way, showing us how, after waiting for something to happen from outside, she finally decided it was up to her to start taking control of her life. All in all, an enjoyable, lighthearted and bittersweet satirical comedy, with good acting (did I mention Buscemi is fabulous?) and amusing dialogues and situations. Just don't expect too much out of it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2004","score":"","review":" Now that I know the film is based on a comic book, it figures.

Although most were made in the 70s and 80s, there's been way too many Vietnam War movies. What's worse is that almost all, if not all of them, are great movies. And what's worst of all is that almost all of them are forgettable. No one can deny the power that Platoon had, but can you really remember much about it six months after seeing it? One month? That's the trouble with war movies in general. It's been about a month since I've seen Apocalypse Now (I've been busy), and I don't remember much about it. Even while watching the movie, I thought to myself, Man, this movie is amazing, but it won't have any lasting effect. That's exactly the case.Col. Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the military to eliminate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) with extreme prejudice. Supposedly Kurtz set himself up as a god among men in Cambodia, and Willard and Co. have to go and destroy him and his compound. Along the way comes Robert Duvall and a horde of random soldiers-the token black man (Laurence Fishburn) who has an odd nickname, the fish-out-of-water (Sam Bottoms), and more.Sure, Apocalypse Now is long (two and a half hours), and at times it drags-especially when it comes to Duvall's random character. Perhaps I just don't remember it that well (see my first paragraph), but he just popped up. However, Francis Ford Coppola's movie does create a feeling of isolation and desperation.

I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered. And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music\/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity\/life and space travel.

I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered. And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music\/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity\/life and space travel.

When I first saw the film, as a child, I found the film, expectedly, quite chilling. I saw it again this afternoon, after not having seen it for about three years, and still find it quite disturbing. Now that we have IMDb, I decided to offer my thoughts. And so, I was shocked to find SO MANY comments about it...more than for any other film that I've reviewed on IMDb to date. If I add anything of unique value, great. If not, I'm happy to share my review anyway.Certainly, there are flaws, or perhaps only unique differences, in this film. Primarily, it can very easily be considered a filmed play, as the staging, the dialog, and the entrances and exits of the characters throughout the film seem to be lifted directly from the stage version. Therefore, some may find the film a bit too sterile or unnatural in many ways. However, I think it is this very sterile, staged, stark-from-a-production-standpoint quality that gives the film an even eerier and in some ways far more realistic edge than might be found were it to be produced today for film, with far more slick and sophisticated sets, dialog, camera work, etc. The realism and pronounced disturbing quality of this version stems from the simple story itself, the psychological horror of which could be in some ways obfuscated from a much more sophisticated, big-studio, modern-day production. As for the subject matter itself, I know that the number of cases, historically, involving child murderers is actually low. Therefore, some critics have argued that to take a relatively rare phenomenon, such as the child murderer, and build a motion picture around it, portraying it in the vein of plausibility, can be misleading and dangerous, giving the impression, especially to younger viewers, that child criminals are more commonplace than you may think. I wholeheartedly reject this notion. The whole purpose of acting is to portray the entire range of the human condition with as much truth as possible, no matter how rare or commonplace certain aspects of human behavior might be. Though child murderers may be few in number, it's an area worthy of as much exploration, in film, as is an ugly, unrealistic alien telling us to phone home or the sinking of the Titanic. Even though this film possesses a definite campy, staged, and perhaps even cult quality, it is chillingly effective. One reason for which this film works is due to the character of Rhoda herself, played by Patty McCormack. The smiling, blond, blue-eyed veneer of the child juxtaposed with the idea of her criminal potential (and actions) is just plain creepy. Moreover, the less you see, in terms of the actual crimes she commits, the more you conjure. And, you continually wonder who her next victim will be. Furthermore, you wonder how many people will eventually come on to her and become aware of whom she is, and how that knowledge will affect their fate.Another reason for which this film works is because of the mother, Christine, played by Nancy Kelly. As we slowly watch her become aware of what has become of her daughter, we can't help but empathize with her predicament and her decision in handling it. The first few times I saw the film, just as I felt that Patty McCormack's portrayal and dialog delivery were probably mere replicas of what she offered on stage, I felt that Nancy Kelly's performance was affected and probably lifted directly from her work on the stage (I've never seen a stage version, nor have I read the book, yet). But in the case of Ms. Kelly, watching her realize what she has ultimately given birth to and raised is very heart wrenching. Moreover, I have always wondered if the use of her right hand was a direction given to her by either of her directors (for play or film), or if it was something she came up with herself. Two instances come to mind. In the first one, the manner in which she hits the table with her right hand as she listens to what is happening outside near her shed while Rhoda plays Au Claire de la Lune on her piano is very pronounced, appears somewhat odd and is perhaps symbolic. She seemed to be pounding her hand not only in outward denial and anger at the realization she now has of what her child is capable of committing, but as a means to torture and punish herself for having given birth to her in the first place. In the second instance, Nancy Kelly used her right hand again in a very pronounced manner when she offers Rhoda her vitamins that night. Again, I couldn't help but wonder what symbolism she wanted us to draw from her gesture. It might be said that this very hand, which once comforted and fed her child all her life, has now become the tool that feeds the ultimate fate of her child toward the end of the film. (Again, not having read it, I have a fairly good idea how the book ends).As for how the ending\/epilogue in the film was handled, practically everyone on this site who has offered a review knows that the use of the casting call was basically dictated by the mandates of the Hays Code. I'll just add that I find that the chilling effect of the story carries over to this bizarre epilogue. I still find it a bit unsettling to see each of these actors take their bows, especially considering that some of the characters they portrayed would, in my estimation, appear stranger to a child than does Rhoda....particularly Leroy, when he bows to the viewing audience carrying his large pitchfork.

One of his kids, Fenton, resists and thinks his dad's gone crazy. The other, Adam, totally believes his father. A strange right-of-passage begins when the father tries to get his oldest son, Fenton, to kill one of the demons. The people described as demons are ordinary-looking people with regular jobs, families, etc. They are tied up and begging for their lives through tear-covered faces and mouth gags.The father tells Fenton that an angel told him Fenton was a demon and should be destroyed. Instead, the dad tries to convert Fenton through hard work and prayer. That boy sure can did himself a heck of a hole! Fenton tries to squeal to the cops as his father's demon-killing continues. Years later, an older Adam is shown in Matthew McConaughey, who actually recounts the tale of his childhood (opening part of film). Adam has taken his father's place as a religious murderer known as the God's Hand killer.His brother is on his list of demons to destroy.When I mentioned earlier The Sixth Sense I was trying to refer to this film's ambition in giving you a shocking\/surprising ending. I will say that it does this rather well. But the idea behind the film (while unique) is strangely morbid. That and the religious theme involved also makes it a bit...unsettling. Perhaps this is exactly what the director (Bill Paxton) was hoping to achieve. 6\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"11 December 2004","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow!

That and the fact that the last thing I saw Bill in was Broken Lizard's Club Dread, which was...well, read my review.2001 appears to have been a popular year for directors to get into a Sixth Sense surprise approach to things (this film and Identity come to mind).

In fact it's my favourite film of the entire series, personally I don't know why, maybe it's because it was the first Freddy movie I ever saw when I was little, maybe my feelings would be different if I had seen one of the other ones first. Now I understand why many NIGHTMARE fans are disgruntled with this one, it's the only one in the series that tends to bend the rules established in the first movie & carried over in the rest of the sequels after this, such as Freddy entering into the real world & being no longer confined in the dream world, but has rather possessed a young teens body. Oddly despite Freddy entering our world, he still retains all of his supernatural powers that technically he should have lost, like being invincible to being stabbed, having the supernatural strength to pop through patio decks & disappear into a wall of flames etc. another thing that fans have pointed out to over the years is the strong homosexual subtext running through the film, such as Jessie walking around with his shirt open, bearing his chest, sleeping over at Grady's house, when he could be staying with his new girlfriend Lisa, balls flying at a gay gym coach, Said gym coach being tied by the wrists & strung up in the shower stalls & having his clothes supernaturally ripped off & getting slapped in the buttocks with towels by Freddy. Numerous scenes of guys taking showers & walking around shirtless & sweating, Jessie going into a gay S&M bar, only to meet his coach who is decked out in black leather pants, a vest & no shirt, who takes Jessie back to the gym & makes him hit the shower, a NO CHICK'S ALLOWED sign on his bedroom door, the fact that Jessie keeps stating that Freddy wants to take him again & that he owns him & that something is trying to get inside his body & the fact that the lead actor cast in the role of Jessie is in fact gay in real life. In fact The film-makers have stated they never set out to make a film like this, it just sort of happened. Weather or not they did is still to this very day, hotly debated by fans of the series, some who agree with the film-makers & others who don't. FREDDY'S REVENGE is more of a haunted house\/possession flick, with many supernatural elements such as exploding parakeets, house hold appliances that catch fire, boiling pools, gym equipment attacking a gym coach. I loved the characterization & thought that the direction by JACK SHOLDER was really good. I loved CLU GULAGER's performance as Jessie's Wall Street reading dad, who tries to find a reason for all the weird going on's & his son's odd behaviour merely to him taking drugs & the late HOPE LANGE as Jessie's worried mother. Freddy is dead serious here, with ROBERT ENGLUND being really scary as Freddy & this would be the last time we would see him as a dark & dangerous entity that hid in the shadows & delivered his one liners dead serious & straight. After this the character would become more jokey with his one liners & nowhere near the scary presence he was until WES CRAVEN'S superb NEW NIGHTMARE many years later. I loved the score by CHRISTOPHER YOUNG & the acting was surprisingly really good. Plus the film has one of my favourite characters of all time (minus Freddy) Ron Grady (played by the talented ROBERT RUSTLER) I mean seriously who wouldn't want a friend like this guy? In fact, if I could have only one friend ever in my entire lifetime, I would want it to be this guy! Loved the FU MANCHU reference with the breakfast cereal, which adds a bit of dark comedy to the proceedings, as well as the odd moment where we see a picture of Tina (Freddy's first victim in the original film) hanging up on the basement wall, we also get weird special effects moments such as a human\/dog crossbreed & a mutant cat monster that swallows a rat using a long tongue. Look for Producer BOB SHAYE as a bartender. In the end, what I am finding lately is, much like other films released & loathed upon their releases such as HALLOWEEN III, Friday The 13th Part V A New Begiining\/Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday, DAY OF THE DEAD etc. the hatred amongst fans for FREDDY'S REVENGE, is starting to subside & it's actually being throughly enjoyed more these days, as well it should be, FREDDY'S REVENGE for years has been the series most criminally underrated entries, it's got great special effects, a terrifying villain that keeps himself confined to the shadows, great characters & direction & acting, moments of suspense & tension that are expertly well done & milked for maximum impact & enough weird moments & a fresher take that is not a complete re-tread of the first, & a great soundtrack & is so much better than a lot of the sequels that followed after it, which got more jokier & mediocre as they went on.

The plot, settings, actors, and ending come together for a harrowing journey, that sets out as a nice detective piece, and then moves into something far more mysterious, and eventually, shocking.

There's no way a second tornado could 'split' from the first as shown. The fluid dynamics of rotation would prevent it.· Hunt says they're 'in the flanking line.' They could not be anywhere near the flanking line if they're 'under the core' (mesocyclone, I suppose that means). · The whole 'cow' scene, while amusing, is completely unrealistic. · They survive a direct hit from an 'F3' tornado and nothing happens? Don't make me laugh.Dinner at Auntie's· I don't even know where to start with the absurd banter in this scene. The whole 'Jack Daniels' anecdote is absolutely impossible. Not even close to possible.Third tornado· You can't guarantee touchdown just from Doppler radar. You can determine the existence of a vortex, but there's no way to say whether it's on the ground or in the air. · There's a good picture of wall cloud here! One good moment. · Where the hell is the debris in this scene coming from? They're too far from the tornado and not anywhere near the RFD. · The tornado moves too fast. Not realistic. · When it hits the power lines, what the hell explodes in a ball of fire??? · Cloud motion is not particularly realistic when the tornado lifts.Fourth tornado· Once again we have an unlikely level of intensity after dark. · What are these people, living mobile home parks? Every damn tornado in the state heads straight for them! · There is a bad misconception that the visible part of the tornado, i.e. the condensation funnel, is where the wind is. The actual area of strong rotation may be many times larger and strong inflow can extend even farther than that. The visible funnel is only where the air pressure is low enough that the air is at or below dew point. In dry air, tornadoes may not necessarily have a visible funnel at all, at least until it is filled with debris and dust. · 'Downdrafts and microbursts'??? What the hell is he talking about? They took a f***ing direct hit from a funnel. There were no 'downdrafts and microbursts'&#133;The propeller idea· I'm not sure about this. It might actually be a good one. Mind you, I can't picture a scientist designing objects intended to be carried aloft by the wind that are spherical, which is the most aerodynamically efficient symmetrical shape. The logical design would be something with a high drag coefficient, not a low one (which a sphere would be), so that they would be carried more easily by the updraft. It wouldn't be necessary to make little propellers, though. Just anything that would increase drag.Fifth tornado· Sure is good of that tornado to hang around for hours until the storm chasers are ready! The longest-lived tornado on record lasted less than 75 minutes. Oh, and they casually drive by the thing on the way to their deployment point. They go from bright sunlight to within a mile of a huge wedge tornado, then back into sunlight, apparently far enough away from the tornado to prepare their instruments, then easily drive to within a few hundred feet of the thing. Yeah right.· By the way, just because the sensors spill out onto the road, how come they're no good any more? Why do they have to be inside that barrel thing? They'd still get sucked up into the funnel even if they're scattered on the road&#133; · How can they drive through the flaming wreckage of a tanker truck and not hit anything? · Quibble Explosion of Jonas's truck looked really fake. · Continuity error Part of combine harvester hits their truck on the passenger-side windshield. In the very next shot the windshield is intact. · There is no way the truck could drive through even a flimsy frame house and come out the other side undamaged. · Too many problems here to list. In almost all scenes, they're way too close to the tornado. They would be right in the inflow, and getting their asses kicked by it. · Getting caught in an F5 tornado unprotected Probability of survival very low. Probability of surviving uninjured just about zero. Wind speeds inside an F5 tornado are between 250 and 317 m.p.h. Getting hit by even a small piece of debris would be like getting shot with a gun. Even in the core of the tornado they look like they're getting buffeted by winds perhaps 40-50 m.p.h. Yeah, right. If either of them got hit by even a small rock traveling at 250+ miles per hour, they'd be dead as fried chicken. · Following the encounter, the tornado doesn't rope out, but dissipates in a matter of seconds. Pretty, unlikely. · In the final scene, it is apparent that the tornado passed within a few meters of the farmhouse, yet the house is undamaged. Possible, but very pretty unlikely.

Jeffrey Wright gives an interesting performance as the lead character. Where he is seemingly ambivalent, intriguing yet totally distant, and therefore doesn't really engage with the audience. Wright's Basquiat encapsulates the enigma of the artist, which I guess was director Julian Schnabel's intention! 'Basquait' is full of many famous actors giving extended cameos, including Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Claire Forlani, Courtney Love, Benicio Del Toro, Willem Dafoe and Parker Posey. However, it is the pop star in David Bowie as Andy Warhol who gives a great performance. Then again, he is given the best character to play, but Bowie does really well. The cinematography is good, and the story is interesting enough and gives the viewer insight into the art scene of that period, but it's hard to connect with Jean Michel Basquait. I think 'Pollock' was a much better film on an artist. Basquait still remains a mystery, even after watching the movie.
