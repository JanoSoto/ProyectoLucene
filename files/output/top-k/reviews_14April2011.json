When I saw the 3.3 rating, I was really surprised! That may be my biased self talking, but really! I was surprised since this was one of my favorite films when I was younger. But after rewatching it, I don't think this movie was THAT bad! Cut it some slack!Most people are complaining on how they killed the original movie with this remake. I think this movie was targeted for children. Those who haven't seen the original version. In my opinion, I think this film stands well on its own, with its great songs. I found myself singing along with a few of the songs ('I Whistle A Happy Tune', 'Getting to Know You' and 'Shall We Dance') which I remember from my younger days.Some of the characters may have been unnecessary like Master Little, the elephant and the monkey, but its their antics that keep the young ones entertained.

Now that my 2 year old son is into it is great. Thank God he over Barney...Anyways my kid is always talking about choo-choos and the Sodor characters. One day he wakes me up talking about Diesel 10. I never heard of him, so off to the internet I go. Find out who he is and that he is the evil unamed train at the end of the Misty Island Rescue movie (which did rock by the way) declaring that he will be extracting his revenge soon. An evil Thomas and Friends train, I love it.Then I see on youtube some great footage with a crazy old guy who was riding atop Diesel 10 with great ominous music and the big chase scene from Magic Railroad. I heard they cut the old guy because kids were too scared. I thought that this was going to be awesome, an evil train trying to kill the steam engines.So I get the movie for my kid and we watch it. Pure disappointment. What is up with Shining Time Station being thrown in, possibly the gayest show of all time. The Sodor scenes were good but every time they switched to Shining Time this lame acoustic music would come on and suck. They spent about 70% of the movie in Shining Time.The plot made no sense. Magic, gold dust, evil train, Lady the magic train, Baldwin and his cousin being stuck forever in Sodor put it in a blender and that is your plot. My wife and I didn't get it at all. Terrible writing. Also what was with Peter Fonda, he looked like his dog had just died the whole movie. Even when he was supposed to be happy and full of magic, he looked suicidal and dejected.Now onto Diesel 10. Awesome train with lots of evil potential, totally ruined by terrible goofy voice. And his diesel buddies, just dumb henchmen. I'm sorry but I want real evil. I want steam engines dead. That would've been truly awesome. Not slapstick evil. That video on youtube with the evil symphonic music that got me amped up to watch this garbage must've had the good music put on by the youtube poster because the chase scene in the movie had lighthearted music during the chase. It was terrible, like playing the Benny Hill theme Yakety Sax for the shark's theme in Jaws or Darth Vader's theme in Star Wars. It would've totally changed the movie.The upcoming Day of the Diesels looks to be good. Hopefully Diesel 10 will be really evil and kill off some steam engines.Having said all that, my 2 year old seems to love the movie. He wants to watch it over and over and gets excited when Diesel 10 is on camera. I may just rip the video to my Mac and edit out the Shining Time\/Peter Fonda drek and have a solid 4 star\/10 25 minute movie to tide us over until Day of the Diesels comes out. Would love to see Diesel 10 maim and kill Sir Topham Hatt\/Fat Director.By the way the way the UK version of the TV show, that I see on youtube is much better than the US version.

I'm not Jewish--rather an agnostic, even if Catholic by upbringing&#x97;but I feel insulted as if I was one, as judging for what you see here you'd think all Jewish men are murderous, predatory pricks who don't know what loyalty or friendship is--and that their women are nothing but shallow and opportunistic whores. I think the roots of this disaster of a flick may be traced to some penis envy syndrome in Leone who, watching how successful Coppola was with The Godfather, felt the inevitable Me Too reaction. That added to the habit of overdoing cruelty when making his Westerns flicks, which we accepted as long as that just happened in some imaginary Neverland, not in our everyday world. But he didn't see things that way. For him a Jewish neighborhood in NYC in the 30s is just as good as any frontier town where El Manco shoots dead half the pop. without raising an eyebrow.Now, the costumes and the settings are superb here and the Morricone soundtrack out of this world. Also, the acting overall is mostly appropriated--even if I'm not a De Niro fan, who I consider self-conscious in an egocentric kind of way&#x97;-but that isn't enough to save the tripe. The cinematography is uneven too many superfluous long shots and meaningless close-ups of De Niro's mug (there was some clause in his contract demanding this?)or shots that don't do anything but serve as padding--as those panning the mausoleum's ceiling after he gets inside it. As for the editing, it seems as if Leone and his Editor had found themselves with miles of film cut in countless segments, and had forgotten where they left their sequential order, and that they had finally lost patience and randomly glued everything together. I say that because the story goes backs and forward along Noodles' time line with scenes being put together without any order, coherence, as if they were just lying there and they had to go somewhere in the movie. When you add to that the many inane, superfluous sub-plots you are looking at a disaster of a movie that can make Gigli a masterpiece by comparison--I mean, what purpose serves Treat William's subplot? And the scene of Carol trying to guess the man who raped her&#x97;just for the fun of it!--or Noodles' smoking dope with the Chinese? The Godfather is such a masterpiece because it totally embraces, from the Italian POV, the immigrant experience in the U.S. in the first half of the XX Century, of which only part is the mob's birth & growth. Such community appears to our eyes as a real human group, in which a complex web of relations, rituals, conduct codes, has developed along the years for self protection--something considered necessary to fight the racism and poverty they found in their newly adopted land & which was established following the traditions of their European ancestors, in the form of tightly knitted societies ruled by semi-feudal overlords. But you won't see the Jewish equiv. here. No visible community, no scenes of families at the dining table, no wise elders; just some isolated scoundrels and murderers (And see how well these street urchins look; how well fed, groomed, dressed. That's just bad movie making). If you think I'm exaggerating, let me put this way this is the only flick I have seen where the only way men know of declaring their love to a woman is by raping her. And the worst part of it is, sometimes the woman likes it! This is also a movie featuring the basest kind of characters. You won't find here a single one youll like, as they all are equally repulsive. What says a lot about the mindset of the filmmaker is that the only 2 people for whom you may feel any sympathy are killed at the beginning--Eve--or shortly after--the little kid. So, Leone is sending us a message here this one is not about people he likes, not even about people towards which he's indifferent, but people he considers abhorrent; the bottom of the human barrel. It can't recall any other movie were people were portrayed in such an ugly fashion. Romero's Day Of The Dead maybe, but even in it people kept some ethics, principles, even if deviated ones. Not even that we got here Noodles and his friends are nothing but predators who you'll expect at any moment start shooting or stabbing each other. That was my expectation every time Noodles and Max embraced.I all, not even worth a Library checkout. If someone tries to lend it to you, punch him in the nose.

This flick's not only trash--it doesn't have any redeeming features--but it's also offensive to Jews. I'm not Jewish--rather an agnostic, even if Catholic by upbringing&#x97;but I feel insulted as if I was one, as judging for what you see here you'd think all Jewish men are murderous, predatory pricks who don't know what loyalty or friendship is--and that their women are nothing but shallow and opportunistic whores. I think the roots of this disaster of a flick may be traced to some penis envy syndrome in Leone who, watching how successful Coppola was with The Godfather, felt the inevitable Me Too reaction. That added to the habit of overdoing cruelty when making his Westerns flicks, which we accepted as long as that just happened in some imaginary Neverland, not in our everyday world. But he didn't see things that way. For him a Jewish neighborhood in NYC in the 30s is just as good as any frontier town where El Manco shoots dead half the pop. without raising an eyebrow.Now, the costumes and the settings are superb here and the Morricone soundtrack out of this world. Also, the acting overall is mostly appropriated--even if I'm not a De Niro fan, who I consider self-conscious in an egocentric kind of way&#x97;-but that isn't enough to save the tripe. The cinematography is uneven too many superfluous long shots and meaningless close-ups of De Niro's mug (there was some clause in his contract demanding this?)or shots that don't do anything but serve as padding--as those panning the mausoleum's ceiling after he gets inside it. As for the editing, it seems as if Leone and his Editor had found themselves with miles of film cut in countless segments, and had forgotten where they left their sequential order, and that they had finally lost patience and randomly glued everything together. I say that because the story goes backs and forward along Noodles' time line with scenes being put together without any order, coherence, as if they were just lying there and they had to go somewhere in the movie. When you add to that the many inane, superfluous sub-plots you are looking at a disaster of a movie that can make Gigli a masterpiece by comparison--I mean, what purpose serves Treat William's subplot? And the scene of Carol trying to guess the man who raped her&#x97;just for the fun of it!--or Noodles' smoking dope with the Chinese? The Godfather is such a masterpiece because it totally embraces, from the Italian POV, the immigrant experience in the U.S. in the first half of the XX Century, of which only part is the mob's birth & growth. Such community appears to our eyes as a real human group, in which a complex web of relations, rituals, conduct codes, has developed along the years for self protection--something considered necessary to fight the racism and poverty they found in their newly adopted land & which was established following the traditions of their European ancestors, in the form of tightly knitted societies ruled by semi-feudal overlords. But you won't see the Jewish equiv. here. No visible community, no scenes of families at the dining table, no wise elders; just some isolated scoundrels and murderers (And see how well these street urchins look; how well fed, groomed, dressed. That's just bad movie making). If you think I'm exaggerating, let me put this way this is the only flick I have seen where the only way men know of declaring their love to a woman is by raping her. And the worst part of it is, sometimes the woman likes it! This is also a movie featuring the basest kind of characters. You won't find here a single one youll like, as they all are equally repulsive. What says a lot about the mindset of the filmmaker is that the only 2 people for whom you may feel any sympathy are killed at the beginning--Eve--or shortly after--the little kid. So, Leone is sending us a message here this one is not about people he likes, not even about people towards which he's indifferent, but people he considers abhorrent; the bottom of the human barrel. It can't recall any other movie were people were portrayed in such an ugly fashion. Romero's Day Of The Dead maybe, but even in it people kept some ethics, principles, even if deviated ones. Not even that we got here Noodles and his friends are nothing but predators who you'll expect at any moment start shooting or stabbing each other. That was my expectation every time Noodles and Max embraced.I all, not even worth a Library checkout. If someone tries to lend it to you, punch him in the nose.

His assistant Anton (Arno Juerging) suggests they go to Italy, because the country's Roman Catholic faith will be sure to keep the populace clean. This assumption may not be worth much.One may wonder about the beginning -- how can Dracula see what he is doing while he grooms himself in front of the mirror? But if thoughts like this trouble you, you are taking this film too seriously. This film is neither serious nor horror.Joe Dallesandro plays the servant who has studied Marxism and the Russian revolution, and tries to interject his thoughts on class and such throughout the film. Professor Maurice Yacowar believes his words satirize the political pretensions of the European art cinema, which may be so. His beliefs translate to action in the latter part of the film. When he is is not talking, he is butt naked, making love to one sister while another watches and waits her turn. Sometimes the sisters love each other... and it is not as weird as it sounds for some reason.I am curious how this film connects to Dario Argento, if at all. The cinematographer is Luigi Kuveiller, who has worked with Argento. And both Udo Kier and Stefania Casini went on to make Suspiria together with Argento.

Simply put, do not get this for Polanski -- a cameo is all you get. Luckily, it is enjoyable on its own. The humor is great, especially with the socially awkward assistant, the sex is as raw as you would expect fro ma Warhol-approved film, and seeing Kier so young and with his desirable accent is wonderful. Mike Mayo spreads the rumor that writer Paul Morrissey may not have been the actual director, with those duties being handled by Antonio Margheriti. I make no personal claim on that issue. The Criterion DVD has audio commentary with Morrissey and Kier... perhaps this clears it up? I would not say this is a great film by any means, but fans of Udo Kier or Stefania Casini need to see it.

Any answer would fatally disappoint. So the most honest approach is to admit that some things are morally wrong and some others are obligatory, and when the two unite, then I guess, you have an idea of what hell is about &#x85; hell, as the most eloquent and representative synonym of war.The genius of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is to depict war in a cinematically powerful form, which is, let's face it, one of the most exhilarating and psychologically gripping experiences ever. To watch Apocalypse Now is to feel the essence of war, to hear its heart-breaking cry and to witness its devastating damages &#x85; the film makes you think less than feel, the film transcends any abstraction. War is a state of mind, yes, but war is made of fights, guts splattered, instant deaths, cries, shouts, explosions of napalm and insanity, genuine breakdowns and orgasmic thrills &#x85; everything is real, yet, with a depth never reached by another War film, before or after. There will never be another Apocalypse Now.The film challenges your perceptions with an incredibly haunting cinematography, taking you in a road whose end is uncertain &#x85; but uncertainty is like the uncomfortable pillow while patriotism acts as sleeping pills. In more comprehensible words, the value of life is so questionable in wartime that the very idea of winning and losing is useless. Are we humans or are we tools? Why the war? If Apocalypse Now answered these questions, the script would have lost my respect. But instead of telling us why the war exists, Coppola shows what war is. It doesn't even make it more rational, or more understandable, but the film is not about answering questions; it's about making us question ourselves.And we question ourselves. In the boots of Captain Willard, a man whose strange top secret mission will plunge him into the depth of the insanity governing a War. But Apocalypse Now is not a descent into madness; it's a thought-provoking script inviting us to a journey introspecting the very meaning of War as a conflict that tortures our minds. War starts inside us. And the first victim of a war is not the man we'll kill, it's our spirit that we destroy forever, this part of us, for which, human value had a meaning. And forever means forever &#x85; we banish ourselves from human community as soon as we participate to war. It's a duty condemning us for eternal alienation, for a purgatory, whose symbolic incarnation is the Colonel Kurtz's tribe, the objective of Willard's mission.Kurtz, created a universe where War has been pushed to its more extreme expression. He reached his breaking point and literally went insane, alienated by a desire to grave War in golden letters, to give a meaning to his military duty. And Coppola's approach is a stroke of genius, because it leaves us perplexed, torn between fascination and disgust, and our guilt to lean towards the former one. The movie doesn't try to inspire our disgust; it respects our intelligence enough not to be judgmental. On the contrary, we respect these men fallen in the trap of an inevitable insanity. They may be assassins, soldiers; they're still men as long as they tried to follow a path made of an idea of what is duty. Yes, they're morally wrong, but in wartime, the only right is to win. Fighting is obligatory. The rest is bullshit.And this is why Apocalypse Now is the movie that best defines war. Because this bullshit, whatever it is, is made of the most precious things you have in your life. And you, soon, get the feeling, that the movie invites you to discover a universe where your only choice is to die or to survive by becoming more ruthless and cold-blooded than your enemy. Kurtz knew that. Willard will know that. And we learn that. Apocalypse Now is not about war, it IS War in the most horrific and realistic view. It's real, it's made of feeling, not ideas, the only ones who express ideas in the film (I'm talking of the Redux version) are those who don't fight. Fighters don't think, they cry, they shout, they object, but ultimately, they kill or are killed, there are no alternatives, and when you kill, it's not to be killed. It's about learning to kill; it's about exploring the most efficient ways to terminate the enemy, about desensitizing ourselves to feel the power not to fear war, but to spouse it in a bloody nuptial nightmare.

If Apocalypse Now answered these questions, the script would have lost my respect. But instead of telling us why the war exists, Coppola shows what war is. It doesn't even make it more rational, or more understandable, but the film is not about answering questions; it's about making us question ourselves.And we question ourselves. In the boots of Captain Willard, a man whose strange top secret mission will plunge him into the depth of the insanity governing a War. But Apocalypse Now is not a descent into madness; it's a thought-provoking script inviting us to a journey introspecting the very meaning of War as a conflict that tortures our minds. War starts inside us. And the first victim of a war is not the man we'll kill, it's our spirit that we destroy forever, this part of us, for which, human value had a meaning. And forever means forever &#x85; we banish ourselves from human community as soon as we participate to war. It's a duty condemning us for eternal alienation, for a purgatory, whose symbolic incarnation is the Colonel Kurtz's tribe, the objective of Willard's mission.Kurtz, created a universe where War has been pushed to its more extreme expression. He reached his breaking point and literally went insane, alienated by a desire to grave War in golden letters, to give a meaning to his military duty. And Coppola's approach is a stroke of genius, because it leaves us perplexed, torn between fascination and disgust, and our guilt to lean towards the former one. The movie doesn't try to inspire our disgust; it respects our intelligence enough not to be judgmental. On the contrary, we respect these men fallen in the trap of an inevitable insanity. They may be assassins, soldiers; they're still men as long as they tried to follow a path made of an idea of what is duty. Yes, they're morally wrong, but in wartime, the only right is to win. Fighting is obligatory. The rest is bullshit.And this is why Apocalypse Now is the movie that best defines war. Because this bullshit, whatever it is, is made of the most precious things you have in your life. And you, soon, get the feeling, that the movie invites you to discover a universe where your only choice is to die or to survive by becoming more ruthless and cold-blooded than your enemy. Kurtz knew that. Willard will know that. And we learn that. Apocalypse Now is not about war, it IS War in the most horrific and realistic view. It's real, it's made of feeling, not ideas, the only ones who express ideas in the film (I'm talking of the Redux version) are those who don't fight. Fighters don't think, they cry, they shout, they object, but ultimately, they kill or are killed, there are no alternatives, and when you kill, it's not to be killed. It's about learning to kill; it's about exploring the most efficient ways to terminate the enemy, about desensitizing ourselves to feel the power not to fear war, but to spouse it in a bloody nuptial nightmare.

He directed the movie In The name of the father which was a hit all around the world.With an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis, how could this movie go wrong? The movie is based on a true-story that took place in Ireland. Daniel plays a character named Gerry Conlon, who is a small time thief from Belfast (England). Gerry is falsely implicated in the IRA bombing of a pub that kills several people while he is in London. The British police 'force' Gerry and the four of his friends to confessing their guilt about the bombing. Gerry's father decides to help his son, but ends up in prison as well. He ends up spending 15 years in prison with his father trying to prove his innocence with the help of a female British attorney. The genre is biography and drama. I really liked the movie because it had a lot of talented actors and actresses that had good chemistry.

My father knows more about western movies than I do, but it was because of my father's influence that I was drawn especially to the works of Clint Eastwood (like his Sergio Leone-directed spaghetti westerns and his 1985 self-directed western-comeback feature Pale Rider). I'd also love to throw in the late Sam Peckinpah's 1969 landmark bloodbath The Wild Bunch for good measure. Then came in Eastwood's swan song to the genre, 1992's Unforgiven. The Best Picture Oscar-winner of 1992, it stars an aged, then-62 Eastwood as William Will Munny, a retired gunslinger now trying to make ends meet as a pig farmer and widower with two young children on an isolated farm in Kansas. One day, he's approached by a young bounty hunter named The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who wants his assistance in tracking down the cowboys who mutilated a prostitute miles away in Big Whiskey, Wyoming. After some initial reluctance and deep soul-searching and contemplation, that's when Munny decides to take on the bounty with The Schofield Kid. Eastwood used his age here to great effect one of the more dishearteningly realistic and poignant scenes in this film is when Munny tries to mount his horse and because he's gotten older and been out of the game for so long, it takes him a couple tries to get back on the saddle. He contacts an old friend named Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the three make their way to Big Whiskey, where they eventually butt heads with the town's brutal sheriff, Little Bill (Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner Gene Hackman). Unforgiven is undoubtedly the greatest western I've ever seen; it would probably rank the same as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1967), it's that good. What makes this film so especially great is what it doesn't do. Unforgiven is not all about cowboys, guns, gunfights, and easy women. No. While it has those, it doesn't glamorize them. This is a dark, depressing, violent, and angry film with one of its main concerns being to turn many well-known western-genre conventions (like what I just mentioned) on their head.

George Lucas knew he was going to make the original three 'Star Wars' films. Then there are franchises like 'Robocop' that just didn't have the same magic anymore by number 3. There really are very few trilogies in Horror, but there is at least one that has had a major impact. The first 'Scream' revitalized both Slasher films and the Horror genre in general. Like 'Halloween' it was followed by a wave of imitators and a sequel a year later. That too was a hit and so the series would continue for one more chapter, a film meant to be the other bookend.Pros Excellent job by the cast, including both new comers and veterans. Ehren Krueger is no Kevin Williamson, but his script is still filled with some clever stuff. Moves at a pretty good pace. Much of the humor hits the mark. Some exciting and well staged set pieces. Suspenseful direction by Craven as always. Marco Beltrami returns to compose another good score that gets the blood pumping. Full of good twists and turns, especially the last one and it's a doozy.Cons The formula is getting a bit stale. Too many characters, some underdeveloped. Some of the humor is forced and this time there is too much of it.Final thoughts All good things must come to an end and you hope that it doesn't disappoint. 3 is definitely not as good as the first two, but is far from an embarrassment. It still has a lot of what made the others work and makes for a good cap off for the series. Of course, as we now know, this is no longer a trilogy.

That too was a hit and so the series would continue for one more chapter, a film meant to be the other bookend.Pros Excellent job by the cast, including both new comers and veterans. Ehren Krueger is no Kevin Williamson, but his script is still filled with some clever stuff. Moves at a pretty good pace. Much of the humor hits the mark. Some exciting and well staged set pieces. Suspenseful direction by Craven as always. Marco Beltrami returns to compose another good score that gets the blood pumping. Full of good twists and turns, especially the last one and it's a doozy.Cons The formula is getting a bit stale. Too many characters, some underdeveloped. Some of the humor is forced and this time there is too much of it.Final thoughts All good things must come to an end and you hope that it doesn't disappoint. 3 is definitely not as good as the first two, but is far from an embarrassment. It still has a lot of what made the others work and makes for a good cap off for the series. Of course, as we now know, this is no longer a trilogy.

The author, a veteran of World War I, recognized the merits of honorable military service, but did not glorify war or militarism. His novel was speculative fiction which is the literary equivalent of philosophical thought experimentation. It is the answer to what if questions. What if society were arranged in such a way that only military veterans had a political franchise.The film was a mockery of Heinlein's thoughtful premises and conclusions, thinking it was a rebuttal to what amounted to a straw man argument. The producers of the movie set up a false understanding of what Heinlein communicated in his literary text, then burned it down with scathing parody. If what Heinlein had written actually was jingoistic, the parody would have been spot on, but since the man never indicated that he felt military service produced (or identified) superior individuals, or that he advocated the arrangement he explored, the parody only serves to mock one of the greatest minds in speculative literature.This crime of staining the memory of one of the ten best authors in the history of science fiction, and making money from debasing a valuable original work, goes even further than this, however. The movie also issues an infantile and intellectually fraudulent insult to the real military. Unoriginally stealing dialog and plot points from legitimate war stories and actual events, this movie is a middle finger in the face of every veteran who served sincerely and in good causes. The military is often misused, but that is the fault of ignorant civilians making political decisions based on media hype and poor philosophical training. The fact remains that a volunteer military is largely made up of admirable people doing difficult jobs under bad conditions, and the movie soils the record of these people.Anyone who likes this movie as any sort of protest against militarism is deeply lacking in sound information or critical reasoning.

When Jensen dresses down Beale with his tirade for blowing the deal with Western World Funding, he reveals the real power manipulating the world economy. There is only one holistic system of systems, and that's money, big money, breaking down the barriers between nations and shifting focus onto a single global economy.
