Now, i like many critically acclaimed movies that got bunch of awards and stuff, but i also love wild movies such as Shocker. This is one of those movies that i can always watch and never get bored by it. It's hard to list everything that i like about it; Heavy metal soundtrack, serial killer with a limp, bunch of hallucinations and nightmares throughout, final fight between hero and villain in TV world... It's just one hell of a movie. There is some gore, but instead of being torture porn like Saw or Hostel movies, it has its limits with violence and juicer scenes and it doesn't hurt the movie but actually helps a lot, cause you can watch it without feeling sick by on screen carnage and still have fun with it even if you are 100% gore hound. Story? Watch the movie and try to tell its story; In first part we have slasher that goes around neighborhood killing entire families, our main hero is actually son of the villain but he doesn't knows it at first (no sht), he has dreams about murders that his daddy commits, daddy kills son's new family and girlfriend, gets caught,burned to crisp and resurrects as electrical ghost not even minute after, then in second part of the movie we have main villain entering other people's bodies and goes after hero, hero starts seeing ghosts of his dead girlfriend and other people that villain killed, villain gets bored with his new ability and returns to his old hobby of killing families but this time by going through TV sets, hero goes after him and fights him through the bunch of different channels of the TV world while Demon Bell is playing in background and in the end traps him in TV and walks away into the night. Yep, that pretty much says it all. Acting and directing; Well,pretty much O.K. But then again, if somebody's gonna take this movie seriously then they will be very critical about these two things. Horror and scary scenes; Quite a lot, and they work. Soundtrack...Best part of the movie. Songs are awesome, my favorites are Shocker that opens the movie, Love Temptation that plays after funeral of Jonathan's family, Demon Bell that plays in the craziest and funniest scene in the movie-the TV world fight, and two ending songs, Sword And Stone and Timeless Love. Awakening i also like but mostly just first part of it, i personally think that it would fit well with the scene where Jonathan is searching for necklace of his dead girlfriend through the lake. I don't know when or is it actually played in the movie though. Score; Also excellent. Both scary and sad in places when it's supposed to be. My favorite part of it is in scene where Jonathan dreams his dead girlfriend coming out of the lake and later when they kiss. Say what you want about Wes Craven, but he always could get few things right in (most of) his movies, and getting a score that would get desired reaction from audience is one thing that his movies always had. Just check out scores for Nightmare On Elm Street, Deadly Friend, Shocker and Scream. Problems with movie; Not much, except maybe the fact that MPAA have cut out some gorier parts, but it's not that noticeable when watching the movie so it doesn't bother me that much. Still, uncut version would be nice. Does this movie deserves better release and special edition? Hell yeah it does! My final opinion; Fun as hell movie, one my favorites of the era and from director, with one kick ass soundtrack that makes it even better.

For very long time now i am huge fan of it, and i don't care about all the crap i might get, i'm not gonna change my opinion.I know, this movie has lot of problems with mixed direction and forced horror scenes, but i don't think that it's as bad as some of the Craven's other work like Hills Have Eyes 2. And it's important to know that most of the problems that Deadly Friend has is not because of the director, but because of the Warner Bros studio. But getting back to the movie;Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin did a good job with script, even though it's somewhat obvious that some of it was changed and added because of studio requests. Rubin also wrote scripts for two great movies from 1990; Jacob's Ladder which i am a huge fan of, and Ghost.As for movie, i think that actors did a good job with their roles, script works for about 90% of the movie (hey,i have to be honest, right?), horror atmosphere is quite good, jump scares are sometimes predictable but they work, gore scenes were not really needed (more on that later), but even though some are laughable, i think that they are actually well done with solid makeup effects and infamous basketball kill is definitely one of the funniest kills ever and one of the best head explosions i ever saw in movie, along with the ones in Scanners, Maniac and Prowler. Nightmare scenes from movie are often called stupid, but i think that they were quite creepy to be honest, specially one where Sam dreams about killing her dad. Hey, if Wes Craven is directing a nightmare scene, then you know it's a good one.Some people would probably disagree with me, but i think that ending, at least first part of it, is quite sad. But that second part with ultra stupid and idiotic she's a robot! ending is one thing that i absolutely hate.After doing some research i found out that movie was originally very different then what was released. It was originally meant to be more of a love story then horror, but producers from Warner Bros had different ideas and Craven was told to make the movie bloodier. I think that it's damn shame. If all gore was taken out, movie would still be solid horror and with, like they originally wanted, interesting and dark love story.You can actually see that there was more to this film with the romance subplot, and few of those scenes between Paul and Sam after she's been brought back to life are very well done both by director and actors. And i'm not talking about scenes when he tries to hide her or when he runs into the murder scene, i'm talking about scenes like when Sam is looking at photos of her and Paul and when she shows him one of those photos. Movie would probably benefit more from those scenes, and original cut probably did have more of that.Instead, what we got is movie that jumps from kids horror to usual over the top 80's horror. More serious subjects that it touches, like child abuse are almost overshadowed with gore scenes that really don't feel like they fit anywhere.I can see why Craven and Rubin disowned the movie, which is too bad cause i would really like to see how different original version was before they had to changed it. I'm a sucker for movies that have been tempered with in post production from one reason or another, so maybe that's one of the reasons why i appreciate this movie for what it could have been or for what it originally was.I know that i'm probably one of the few fans that this movie has, but either way, i still love it and i would recommend it to everyone who are interested in entertaining, fun horror movie.

I'm a sucker for movies that have been tempered with in post production from one reason or another, so maybe that's one of the reasons why i appreciate this movie for what it could have been or for what it originally was.I know that i'm probably one of the few fans that this movie has, but either way, i still love it and i would recommend it to everyone who are interested in entertaining, fun horror movie.

EXORCIST 3 has some great scare scenes, like old lady walking on the celling scene, but one scene that scared the hell out of me was where nurse is walking across empty hospital hallways, when suddenly one patient appears out of nowhere and slides towards her.Acting is also on spot, not over the top and it works well with plot. Directing is surprisingly great. I can't think of any scene that was bad, and that is rare thing in some of the movies that i like to watch over and over again. Special effects, well,i understand that this part was unnecessary in original cut, but i think that effects are pretty damn good and convincing. Screenplay and entire plot are good, and definitely much better than most of the movies with similar plot.I can't figure it out what kind of moron would say that George C.Scott was bad actor in this. He was awesome! No matter if he was in some funny, sad or scary scene, he delivered great performance in every shot.Most people would say that this was just horror movie. But i think that it was also very sad movie. Entire friendship between Damien and Kindermann was nicely shown and Kindermann having to kill best friend in the end in order to save him was very sad.

Action scenes are very good, specially fight scenes. Brandon Lee is not only good fighter, but good actor as well. His roles in Rapid Fire and The Crow are his best and my personal favorites when it comes to his movies, even if there is only few of them. I wasn't fan of his acting in movies such as Showdown In Little Tokyo, but i would't call him a bad actor and still he had good sense of humor in that movie. I'm sure that he would be even better if he didn't die, which is quite sad cause he really did have potential. After watching workprints of The Crow, i could see that there were few takes of his scenes that were originally quite bad acting wise, but watching the movie again it's obvious that he was just getting started at this point of his career and that he would be better as long as he had good directors to give him some advices. As for his role in Rapid Fire,instead of being one of those unstoppable heroes that his father often portrayed in his movies, Brandon's character Jake Lo is normal human who is put into dangerous situations and has to use all of his skills to survive. By the end of the movie he really is pretty beat up and tired after all that he's been through, which is not something that you normally see happening with heroes of some average action movies. Powers Boothe and Kate Hodge were also good, but at the same time not usual cliché cop characters. Soundtrack is solid as a rock, Hardline songs really fit the film and they are used in right scenes. Score works in action scenes, specially in fight scene between Brandon and Al Leong. Script and story might be cliché, but it's nothing worth of ranting. In the end,very good action movie, and with Halloween 4 and Marked For Death one of my fave movies from director Dwight H.

So with that thought i went and found it, watched it and...wow. This is one of the best action\/sci-fi movies that i saw. Opening of the movie with random guy shooting people in bank and then getting into intense police chase while running over everything and everyone on his way blew me off my feet. I didn't expect that kind of violence and action scenes will be the first thing to start the movie. For the rest of 90 minutes it had it all; action, violence, suspense, humor, bits of drama, plot being changed from alien wanting to have fun to alien wanting to be president... After i finished watching it, i knew that this has become one my favorites. But what bugged me is how almost nobody from my friends and colleagues knew about this movie. Looking up about it on internet, i was surprised to see how originally it was almost unnoticed during its theatrical run. But what was nice to see is all the fans that it got over the years. Reading many good online reviews about this movie has only helped to make me love it even more. Although i personally don't think that every single movie that i or anybody else loves to death deserved better, The Hidden really did deserved a lot more. It's awesome, 100% fun movie that never gets boring. Come on, you have alien who likes heavy metal rock and ferrari's, you have another alien trying to stop him, and in between two of them a hardcore cop who can't figure out what the hell is going on in his city. About the actors; everyone do their job right. There isn't single one that does it half good or quite bad. I really enjoyed buddy cop chemistry that Gallagher and Beck had, and much of it is because of the actors Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Nouri. As for other known faces, it's was nice to have Ed O'Ross (Red Heat) and Clu Galager (Return Of The Living Dead) in supportive, but important roles. Script is well written and it has good,and quite often very funny dialogue. Plot is very interesting and with the way it's happening through the movie, you could say that it's realistic and another thing that helps with that is some of the reactions of characters on certain parts. Action scenes are top notch. Nothing blockbuster-spectacular, but still entertaining and quite surprising in places. Plenty of car chases and shootouts for action fans, that's for sure. Special effects; As far as blood and gore goes, just fine. But one thing that should be mentioned is great and creepy effect early in the movie where alien goes from one body into another. Not only that it looks cool, but it looks real,specially for the time when movie was made, and it's not created by CGI at all. Movies today should really have more of these practical special effects. Score - Solid. Creepy, tense, and when needed, even sad in places. Soundtrack - Awesomeness to the bone. From opening car chase\/carnage till ending credits, pure 80's. My fave songs are Weapons Of Love and Hidden by The Truth, Still In Hollywood, Haunted Head and Over Your Shoulder by Concrete Blonde, On Your Feet and Go Down Fighting by Shock Paris. You can't love this movie without mentioning On Your Feet that plays during opening pursuit. I love that song ever since i first saw The Hidden. Few times when i was playing GTA i would play this song in the background while running from cops or running over everything in my way just like alien in the movie. What more to say but great, fun and very underrated movie that thankfully has its fans, and it's good to see that it is still mentioned amongst some movie lovers here and there even today. Something that i wanted to mention; I watched The Hidden as a double feature two times. First time i watched it with Wes Craven's Shocker, and second time with Dolph Lundgren movie I Come In Peace (1992). Let's just say, that i had a blast both of the times ;) ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When i first heard of The Hidden,i thought that it's gonna be some average sci-fi action movie.

Not only that it looks cool, but it looks real,specially for the time when movie was made, and it's not created by CGI at all. Movies today should really have more of these practical special effects. Score - Solid. Creepy, tense, and when needed, even sad in places. Soundtrack - Awesomeness to the bone. From opening car chase\/carnage till ending credits, pure 80's. My fave songs are Weapons Of Love and Hidden by The Truth, Still In Hollywood, Haunted Head and Over Your Shoulder by Concrete Blonde, On Your Feet and Go Down Fighting by Shock Paris. You can't love this movie without mentioning On Your Feet that plays during opening pursuit. I love that song ever since i first saw The Hidden. Few times when i was playing GTA i would play this song in the background while running from cops or running over everything in my way just like alien in the movie. What more to say but great, fun and very underrated movie that thankfully has its fans, and it's good to see that it is still mentioned amongst some movie lovers here and there even today. Something that i wanted to mention; I watched The Hidden as a double feature two times. First time i watched it with Wes Craven's Shocker, and second time with Dolph Lundgren movie I Come In Peace (1992). Let's just say, that i had a blast both of the times ;) ","genre":"Action, Crime, Horror"},{"date":"13 October 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When i first heard of The Hidden,i thought that it's gonna be some average sci-fi action movie. So with that thought i went and found it, watched it and...wow. This is one of the best action\/sci-fi movies that i saw. Opening of the movie with random guy shooting people in bank and then getting into intense police chase while running over everything and everyone on his way blew me off my feet. I didn't expect that kind of violence and action scenes will be the first thing to start the movie. For the rest of 90 minutes it had it all; action, violence, suspense, humor, bits of drama, plot being changed from alien wanting to have fun to alien wanting to be president... After i finished watching it, i knew that this has become one my favorites. But what bugged me is how almost nobody from my friends and colleagues knew about this movie. Looking up about it on internet, i was surprised to see how originally it was almost unnoticed during its theatrical run. But what was nice to see is all the fans that it got over the years. Reading many good online reviews about this movie has only helped to make me love it even more. Although i personally don't think that every single movie that i or anybody else loves to death deserved better, The Hidden really did deserved a lot more. It's awesome, 100% fun movie that never gets boring. Come on, you have alien who likes heavy metal rock and ferrari's, you have another alien trying to stop him, and in between two of them a hardcore cop who can't figure out what the hell is going on in his city. About the actors; everyone do their job right. There isn't single one that does it half good or quite bad. I really enjoyed buddy cop chemistry that Gallagher and Beck had, and much of it is because of the actors Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Nouri. As for other known faces, it's was nice to have Ed O'Ross (Red Heat) and Clu Galager (Return Of The Living Dead) in supportive, but important roles. Script is well written and it has good,and quite often very funny dialogue. Plot is very interesting and with the way it's happening through the movie, you could say that it's realistic and another thing that helps with that is some of the reactions of characters on certain parts. Action scenes are top notch. Nothing blockbuster-spectacular, but still entertaining and quite surprising in places. Plenty of car chases and shootouts for action fans, that's for sure.

In director Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 mystery Strangers on a Train, tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) encounters such a man named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on his way back home on a train. Bruno tells him that he has figured out an idea for a perfect crime and the idea goes something like this. Two people like themselves meet on a train for the first time with no connections between them whatsoever. Both of them are aggravated with certain family members that they wish would go away. The perfect crime that Bruno has in mind is to swap each other's murders. In other words, Bruno murders Guy's ex-wife and Guy murders Bruno's father. Thinking that Bruno is kidding about the whole thing, Guy bids him farewell while unintentionally sending him a mixed message. Yes, Guy seems to overlook the fact that Bruno was deadly serious about this plan the whole time. So when Bruno manages to murder Guy's ex-wife, Guy is left in an unfortunate, puzzling situation. Does he fulfill his end of the bargain regardless of the fact that he didn't officially agree to this deal in the first place? Or does he find some sort of way to turn Bruno in even though he knows Bruno might say that Guy wanted to get rid of his wife in the first place and conjure up similar lies about their encounter? Right off the bat, the first thing I must say about Strangers on a Train is that it has a perfect premise for a plot. I love how Guy isn't sure whether or not Bruno is for real or if he's just joking about this the whole time. If you think about it, the reason this premise is so outstanding is due in large part to its dark sense of humor. There is a crucial exchange of conversation between Guy and Bruno in which Guy is completely unaware of the subtext behind what Bruno is really asking him. It's because of this conversation that Guy fails to see that Bruno wasn't really asking him to murder his father. He pretty much forced him to participate in his diabolical murder plan solely for his own benefits. So the film is well thought through in that sense. In terms of character development, although the character of Bruno was exceptionally well handled and superbly acted by Robert Walker, anything else relating to Guy for whatever reason was a bit of a bore. Despite the complicated dilemma he has to face, there wasn't anything else about Guy that stood out for me personally. He was a little too much of a blank slate character wise. Guy's love interest Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) wasn't memorable in the slightest and didn't contribute much to the advancement of the narrative. However, there is an entertaining side character named Barbara Morton (Patricia Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock's sole daughter) who has a handful of scene-stealing lines to work with. In spite of the overwhelming feeling that Strangers on a Train is only a good film as opposed to a great one, the film is well directed by Hitchcock as always. The scene involving Bruno's murder of Guy's ex-wife has a superb build-up including a shot where it appears that he is getting closer to murdering his victim, but actually isn't. Another scene that intercuts between Guy's tennis match and Bruno recovering a piece of evidence is also well directed. The climax at the merry-go-round also has a similarly brilliant buildup and of course is loaded with suspense as it should be. With an exceptional plot, scene- stealing work from Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock, and Alfred Hitchcock's trustworthy directorial hand, Strangers on a Train is worth catching a single viewing.

She is strong, caring, and can hold her own, nothing like Sam who is weak and shows no sympathy for others. Sam tries to help Jill get away from information retrieval but causes more harm than good. He is too jumpy suspicious of everyone even Jill. When Jill asks him how many terrorist has he actually seen he says its only my first day, to which she laughs at his naive answer. He causes her to wreck the car and has caused a large amount of attention to be drawn to Jill. They go into a department store that later blows up and Sam frantically looks for Jill. When he finds her he asks is she okay which is out of character for him because in this time no one cares about anyone else's safety but their own. After discovering she was not carrying a bomb he tries to protect her from the patrol men who were trying to take her away. After being released from the patrol officers he goes back to his office to use the computer to get more information on Jills where abouts. After Sam finds Jill and takes her to his moms house he can only think of one thing that could save her. He kills her. Then later returns to her side to tell her the good news, but they are no longer looking for her. They are looking for Sam and later break into his mothers house and take him away. Unfortunately Jill really dies this time because police are allowed to use deadly force on unarmed civilians if they resist arrest. Then they reveal the interrogation process which shows all the terrorist that come through. It's discovered that terrorist is a broad term for anyone who doesn't follow the rules exactly to the letter. They torture them into submission so they won't question or try to fool the government again. Sam never had a chance at saving Jill in the world where the government knows all and controls all.

I had not heard of this until recently when it was on TV. I only recorded it because it had the legend, Jack Nicholson, in it.The movie is about a cop, Jerry Black, who is about to retire. But on his last day he get's put on a case of the brutal rape and murder of a little 9 year old girl. But when a man gets arrested for it, admits it and the commits suicide it seems like an open and shut case. But Jerry believes the wrong man has been accused. After Jerry retires he is struggling to leave the case behind. He tries his best to get on with his life, but he is haunted.It is a moving story and very sad in places. I really feel sorry for Jerry. His character is so likable. He really cares for these girls and wants the killer to be found. The problem is, he is getting very suspicious of everyone. He doesn't trust anyone and is still investigating the killings.Jack Nicholson does an amazing job in this. His character was played perfectly. I really wanted him to retire happily, it was horrible to see him so haunted and unhappy. Patricia Clarkson plays Margaret. Margaret is a waitress in the local cafe that Jerry frequents. They get to know each other and have a bond. Patricia did a great job too. Other cast members were Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Tom Noonan, Robin Wright Penn, Venessa Redgrave & Mickey Rourke. Phew... what a cast! The whole casting was brilliant. Everyone was very convincing and there were some great speeches. The script was really well done.The movie was directed by Sean Penn. I didn't realise that Sean had such a good skill in directing. The images he had for this film were immense.This film really keeps you gripped. It is not a fast paced movie, it goes along quite slowly in fact. But it is not boring. You really become interested in Jerry's life and you want to know if his suspicions were right and he moves on with his life. This film had me so gripped that at one certain point, I gasped and held my breathe. My heart was beating so fast. Not many films can make me do that. It really got me attached.I loved it...

They plan to do this by using troops led by their leader Colonel Dax(Kirk Douglas). Colonel Dax does as he is ordered and he and his men attempt to storm the anthill. It goes horribly wrong and results in an unnecessary loss of men. The attack was suicide anyway. General Mireau is angry and orders his artillery to fire on Colonel Dax's troops. The order is refused so General Mireau blames the men for cowardice. Colonel Dax attempts unsuccsessfully to save his men from execution.

It is perhaps eternally iconic for watching Jack Nicholson breaking down a door with an axe, shouting maniacally Here's Johnny!!! at his family. Everything leading up to that climax, however, is a freaky experience, littered with all kinds of unnatural phenomenon, wicked imagery, and always laden with an unsettling atmosphere. The film becomes a mesmerizing nightmare, which dives into the depths of the human psyche to expose pure madness.This adaptation of Stephen King's novel downplays the supernatural a lot, thus deviating from the source material a lot and just sticking to the basics. There are ghosts haunting the Overlook Hotel, but at times, it's hard to tell if they're really real in the movie, or just reflections of Jack's mind.And that ambiguity is part of what makes this movie so great and intriguing; it remains very mysterious and open-ended, offering just enough exposition to build a basic plot, but leaving enough up in the air for all manner of interpretations. You could watch the film and accept it as just another ghost story. You could see it as a psychological thriller. Some people have even read into it and somehow dug up hidden messages of the director's involvement in faking the Apollo moon landings. No matter what you read into it, the experience lends itself to wide interpretation, universally covering terror and fear on all levels.On a micro-level, the story is generally sound, with or without the involvement of the supernatural. The film features a decent cast of characters, and a lot of their issues from the novel (primarily, alcoholism and domestic violence) carry over into the movie. Even though it's not a totally faithful adaptation, the plot is well-constructed. It explores some deep and interesting scenes concerning the horror of violence (whether domestic or in the overall human spirit), madness, and overcoming the ghosts of the past.This film is presented with very strong photography; it makes very liberal use of the Steadycam to beautifully compose the film and conjure very unique imagery. The editing is very good too. Acting in this film can be very extreme and over-the-top; Jack Nicholson's expressions and lines are often so wild that they become laughable, but the menace is still very palpable, and I think it's an awesome performance overall. Shelly Duvall tends to be very weepy, but is still decent. Everybody else does the best they can. Writing is finely-balanced and nuanced. This production uses very interesting and decent sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is very ominous, adding to the film's atmosphere.The Shining may not be the perfect Stephen King adaptation, but as an exploration of humanity's dark side, it is very effective and extremely creepy.

We have some cool scenes, a lot of amazing talk and deep dialogues, the tension is always strong and the picture is nice too.After all, this is a movie where Pacino puts all his charisma and style. Yeah, I'm giving 8 stars for this movie, but I'm suspect to talk 'cause Pacino is my favorite actor ever, and even if he makes a movie about horses being raped by dogs, I would enjoy.But seriously, it's a great movie and also so underrated. If you love Pacino, this is a mandatory stop to watch him.

This was actually first Chainsaw Massacre movie i saw. It was rented from videostore from other town. I still remember old VHS box with pic of Letherface on front sawing through some doors, and pic of Grandma in Chainsaw Heaven on the back. Once i first started to watch it, that opening narration and red letters from credits already freaked me out. Then, real terror started. For the next hour and a half i had great time watching this movie without pause and by the end of it i thought that it was best horror movie i saw at that time. One thing that i didn't know is that i watched cut version. One scene that i remember was heavily cut was opening murder of two yuppies. After Rick the Prick says Missed us... and looks at his buddy and screams, scene was cut and i didn't saw that great top-of-the-head-falling-off effect by Tom Savini. Still i absolutely loved the movie and that was years and YEARS ago. Although i discovered many other horror movies over the years, Chainsaw 2 was one of those that i always remembered. It has great characters, funny dialogue, AWESOME gore, scary moments that work, effective score combined with good soundtrack,and one thing that i specially like is the sets where most of the action is going on, plus if you just look at design of radio station and underground hideout, they are really good sets for low budget horror movie. Soundtrack - Since i have original soundtrack, might as well list songs that i like the most; White Night from Torch Song,Mind Warp from Lords Of The New Church and No One Lives Forever from Oingo Boingo. Another two songs that i want to mention are Over Your Shoulder and Haunted Head from Concrete Blonde. These two songs are also in another movie that i like, The Hidden from 1987. Another fun but unfortunately very underrated sci-fi action movie which also has cool soundtrack. One thing that i liked about this movie, other then its crazy plot, is Chop Top. I love that guy. He is horror movie legend and one of my fave horror movie characters whose one liners i kept repeating in normal life. Specially lines like LICK MY PLATE YOU DOG DK!, or DOG WILL HUNT! Even my younger cousins and friends loved that character. Other characters are, like i said, real fun and really add to the movie. Stretch is kind of heroine that i think is perfect example about how horror actress in similar roles should be like in movies. Lefty Enright is something of a hard-to-understand character that Dennis Hoper (RI.P,we miss you Dennis) plays in his usual great way, plus there isn't any other character in these movies that had chainsaw fight with Letherface and won. L.G is real sweetheart of a character and one thing that i thought was too much in the movie is the way that he dies, it's kinda too graphic death scene for such likable guy. It's really sad that actor that plays him, Lou Perryman,was killed in real life. Chainsaw family is once again played well by actors. I already mentioned my favorite member Chop Top, but Letherface is just as good and this time has more character development that's actually interesting when you think about it. If we put aside his sexual habits, of course. Cook with his ranting and constantly changing behavior is still present, Grandpa has small screen time but also has probably the best special effect makeup in the movie, Hitchhiker and Grandma characters are somewhat underdeveloped and silent throughout the movie, but their presence is still nice to have ;) This movie really deserved the kind of special edition that it get. I really enjoyed all the interviews, deleted scenes and specially funny commentary from cast that sometimes i like to turn on and listen while watching the movie. Well, on the other hand, that's kinda the purpose of commentary tracks, isn't it? I don't have any problem with this movie, cause it's great movie that is in my opinion, just as good and just as great cult classic as first movie.

It's just a silly 90's action film (set in 2013!), but a fun, silly action film.Things I loved The rock remix of the theme tune. (Even if you hate this film, you have to admit the theme tune is awesome.), Kurt is brilliant as Snake, the action sequences are great, the pacing is a lot faster than the first, it's epic, I loved the prologue and Utopia was sexy in her leather shorts and knee high boots.But the CGI is indeed horrible. Everything looks like a PlayStation game. Whereas the first movie had miniatures that still hold up to this day. The CGI in this is just laughable. The worst example is when Snake is in the submarine and it's the ocean.The surfing scene also looks fake and how is Snake able to surf properly despite having no surfing training whatsoever? And how is he able to stand up straight after getting shot in the leg?The movie's biggest flaw is that it recreates scenes from the first movie. John Carpenter can't write sequels because when he does, it's the same as the first. Halloween 2 for example.Remember that great scene in the first film where Snake had to fight the big guy in the wrestling ring? What do they make him do in this one? Make him play basketball............. Yeah.Also, he manages to get the ball into the hoop despite having no basketball training what so ever.But what about the ending? Yeah, it liked it. It's something Snake would do. Despite the fact that there could've been someone who needed an iron lung or life support machine to help them live.
