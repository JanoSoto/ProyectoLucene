It starts with a perfect pre-title sequence set in a bankers office in Bilbao, Spain with Bond getting some money or something (the movie has a complicated plot - you will need to watch the movie several times to understand it fully). Bond disposes of the bankers and then to escape makes a thrilling jump out of the window. Just this would have made a great opening but they then go back to London to give you more. And what we get is fantastic- the villain from the bankers office (cigar girl) blows up a section of the MI6 building (killing Robert King, some rich guy involved in oil). Bond then chases her in a fantastic little boat down the River Thames before ending up at the Millenium Dome. Cigar girl jumps into a hot air balloon and Bond grabs on to a rope dangling from it. Cigar girl blows herself up and the balloon leaving Bond to fall down on to the top of the MD and dislocating his collar bone. The main titles are disapointing. It has a perfect song by GARBAGE but the graphics are bad - girls covered in oil dancing in front of weird colours that look like a kailodoscope (hope I spelt that right). It's not exactly a great turn on. The rest of the movie is great except for one problem. It takes too long to get into the next action sequence. The ski chase is very disappointing for a Bond movie and by the time you get to the next one, a whole hour has nearly gone buy. Other than that the movie is brilliant. The villains are great. Although people have been complaining about Renard not being a great villain, they have been judging him wrong. He is only a henchman, like Oddjob or Jaws. Elektra King is the main villain (played brilliantly by Sophie Marcaue) and she is a great character, unusual to see a character so complex as her in a bond movie. I can't wait till the next one, hopefully they will film in Australia with Sean Connery as the villain.

As for this one...probably the worst next to Jason Goes to Hell.Here's the horrible plotlineTommy Jarvis went quite mad after the incident at Crystal Lake back when he was younger. So mad that nothing has cured him. So he's coming to stay at a special living facility in woods, with many other people with problems like his. I won't even get into talking about the rest of the cast. All of them are beyond annoying, and thank God for the high body count or I would have gone mad myself. Anyway, Tommy is plagued with many images of Jason watching him, and even snaps at others for no reason. No surprise, he hacked up Jason when he was ten, while his sister watched and screamed for him to stop. Why she wasn't crazy, I don't know. But that's probably because she was the one of the best characters of the whole series. Anyway, there's no escape from Tommy's past, and someone is out killing again. Killing everyone, literally. I mean, by the end of the movie, most of the cast is gone. Which is a good thing, because everyone in this movie you will want dead. I can't believe I hated everyone so much. Even Pam, the assistant director of the place, and final girl, is a bit irritating. This movie is so bad. Despite imfamously high death toll (21 or 22, I think) there's nothing good to say. I hated the fact that this broke the chain of time that the killings take place. Generally, the movie starts and ends on the same day. This took place over two or three days. Not very good. And the climax was horrible. Not the classic one or two survivors. Three! Yeah, three. And one of them is (don't worry, this is no spoiler, just obvious) that annoying kid Reggie. I wished he would just get what was coming to him. Especially when Pam is fighting Jason with a chainsaw, and he is in the rafters CHEERING HER ON! Who thought of that horrible idea?!I'm sure this movie could have been better. It also could have been avoided, but who am I to say. I'd say, don't see this. It's an overall irritating movie, with a slew of characters and a storyline you will despise. I would have been happy with the classic counselors killed at opening camp story, if they were just looking for an excuse for a fifth installment.

Fishburne does a good job of making Ike so charming when Tina first meets him that you can see why she falls in love with him, until he turns into a monster. Angela Bassett is just fantastic, she has Tina down perfect, though her upper body is so pumped up in some scenes she looks almost masculine. Tina Turner was (hell, still is at 60) toned and buff, but not a female bodybuilder.

Well let me tell you why I am comparing them.  The theme of the movie is pretty much the same as the one in The silence of the lambs. I also once saw on a box that it was written and I quote better than The silence of the lambs.  Unfortunately, that isn't true.  Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow can't give great performances like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave in The silence of the lambs.  However, Morgan Freeman is a terrific actor and so is Kevin Spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for Pitt's and Paltrow's performance.  The movie starts off in a house.  Someone has been murdered.  The sin this person had committed was gluttony and it seemed he was killed in this way someone held a gun against his head and forced him to eat spaghetti until he bursted open.  The detective in charge of this case is an experienced detective named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and is shortly teamed up with a young detective named David Mills (Brad Pitt).  We them have the opening credits and the camera is filming inside the murderer's house.  It is filming his hands which are working on a table and you realize how careful the psycho is.  He cut off the end of his fingers and put bandages around them simply to be sure the police do not find any finger-prints.  The next murder is committed is a person whose sin was greed, then sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and finally lust.  The seven sinners all having been murdered, Mills assumes that the murderer will not strike again and that he has only to catch him.  But that's not what John Doe (Kevin Spacey), the murderer, has in mind.  No, instead of hiding out after his seven murders, he turns himself over to the police and has a last surprise for the two detectives, a surprise that will horrify them and allow the viewer which one is able to know when to hold back and which one should be holding back.  David Fincher does a better job directing this than directing Alien³.  However, I thought there was too much unnecessary gore in the movie.  Brad Pitt does a good job with what he is given and Morgan Freeman is as excellent a in any other movie.  But Kevin Spacey walks away with the movie and gives probably the best performance as the crazy John Doe whose way to describe a murder is as scary as seeing him commit one.  It wasn't any surprise he won best villain of the year at the MTV movie awards.  I think he didn't get a nomination for best-supporting actor because he already had one in The usual suspects which he won.  The only disappointing part of the movie is truly Gwyneth Paltrow's performance who seems to be shy in front of the camera.

First of all RLR is my favorite film of 1999 (It came to the theatres here in June 1999) and I just hope everyone gives it a chance because it's a real treat. It's more like a thrill ride than a conventional movie. It's an artsy fartsy type of movie that the most analytical minds will love to pick out and decipher. It's also a fast paced action\/thriller that the most simple minded action fan will enjoy. Never have I seen a film that can appeal to so many different tastes, you have to see it to believe it !It's main problem is that it's in German. No, there's nothing wrong with it being German, it's just that the audience that I believe will enjoy it the most (North Americans) might skip out on it because it's a foreign flick. If you only knew how hard I tried to get all my friends (who all ended up loving it) to watch this film. Trust me when I say that this film is a MUST SEE for techno fans.It's got a pumping techno soundtrack in the background. The fast editing is great and not too confusing.

It has the same weird 2-dimensional animation, the same foul-mouthed characters and the same bizarre plotlines that have made the TV show so popular, but Parker and Stone have taken it to a whole new level with this movie. And surprisingly, the humour isn't just Howard Stern-esque, lowest-common denominator type stuff, despite what you may have heard. South Park is absolutely the most blistering, insightful and explosive social satire to appear on the big screen in years. And its funny too.Does this movie shock the viewer with almost unbelievable levels of profanity and vulgarity? Yes, that's the point. But is it funny? Absolutely. If you can get past the surface stuff, what's underneath is a very intelligent, and very needed, skewering of American people and politics today, especially those who represent the so-called right wing.Good satire has to be shocking to be effective and understood. Swift's A Modest Proposal in the 18th century shocked contemporary audiences by proposing that the poor be used as food for the rich. It was an effective way of pointing out the inequalities of life in Britain at the time. In the same tradition, Parker and Stone point out the absurdities of American politics through shock tactics with this film. And they also make a hilarious movie.As a Canadian, one of the victims of Stone and Parker's film, I find it extremely amusing to read all the comments posted by outraged Americans warning all of the dangers of this filthy movie. To me (and many others, it would seem, judging from the movie's popularity) it is obvious that by putting down Canadians (and everyone else) Stone and Parker are actually making fun of Americans. Most especially (though by no means exclusively, everyone gets ripped here), they are poking merciless fun at the mainstream, white, middle-class conservatives in the United States today. You know, the kind that complain about violence and swearing in movies and then go bomb Serbian civilians. One of the messages of South Park is that kids get their values from their parents, not from movies. In the wake of Littleton and the resulting knee-jerk reaction from American politicians of every variety to blame the tragedy on the media, guns, Marilyn Manson or whatever, this message is even more effective. Too many Americans blame everyone but themselves for their problems. The South Park parents' overreaction to the crisis of Terrence and Philip and their declaration of war on Canada satirizes the similar attitudes of those the movie is making fun of. And yet everyone but these people get the joke! They just see the violence and swearing in these scenes and declare that South Park should be banned! Its influencing our children! And they fail to see that they are behaving exactly like their cartoon counterparts! Here the movie is absolutely brilliant, and so accurate its almost sad.So there you have it South Park is a cutting, iconoclastic social commentary that's also extremely funny. I haven't laughed as hard watching a movie in years as I did when watching South Park. Its hilarious, and there is an important political message to it. So ignore the naysayers, go see this movie, and give it an honest chance.

And it's not so hard to know why it's the real and tragic story of Jacqueline Du Pré, that was the most famous cellist of all the times and had to stop playing because of the sclerosis, that killed her. The movie begins with Hilary and Jackie with about 7, 9 years old. This part is really fun and interesting. After 25 minutes they're already being played by Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. We have 5 more minutes and after one scene where Jackie and Hilary talked a lot in the night and slept in the same bed, the screen gets black and the word Hilary appears. You don't understand it and even forget but after 1 hour, everything gets black again and appears the word Jackie. Now, we are back to the bed, almost all the story is told again, explaining many points that were strange. Like why did Jackie sent her clothes to her mother for cleaning, how could she be so rude if she hadn't written any letter? Then, in the second part, they show that Jackie was in a Spanish hotel and when she asked about a laundry, the servant insulted her. It's so cool, because at the beginning you sometimes think that Jackie is crazy or bad but at this second part, the director, Anand Tucker, explains every single thing.  Well, if the screenplay was already very touching, it got better with the amazing classical songs used in the movie, with the great cast, the sad cinematography, remarkable scenes and some details. Yes, single details made a big difference in Hilary and Jackie. One different camera-move, one song playing in the right moment, something unexpected happening, or just one super-sad-and-touching scene. For example Jackie is alone in a big black space, there's no sceneries, only she is being illuminated.  She starts to play a song and some seconds later, she lets the arch of her cello fall. Then, in slow motion, they show the arch falling, falling, till it beat in the floor making a violent noise. With this and the horrified face of Emily Watson, Anand Tucker represented the moment that Jackie realized that something was wrong with her, and that that thing would affect her carrer. Another example one orchestra is playing a very beautiful and sad song and at end, Jackie's  husband, Daniel Barenboin, the maestro, say It's your turn.

I liked this film.  It is an excellent piece of directing from John McTiernan that captures the medieval period realistically.Contrary to most of the criticism that this film is just violence with no plot, this film has a very definite and sound plot.  It is the story of 13 courageous men who are sent to defend the homeland of a respected king from the attack of the Wendol, the creatures of the mist who are thought to be eaters of human flesh.  It is a story of duty, courage, honor and loyalty, and some very brutal battles.What the story lacked was character development and an archetypal hero.  Since that is what the masses expect in their films, I'm certain this film was a big disappointment.  That is what made Braveheart a more complete film of this genre.  We had William Wallace as our reason for watching the battles.  If this film starred Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenegger as Buliwyf (played instead by veritably unknown Vladimir Kulich), and spent a little time developing him as a leader, I'm sure everyone would have thought it was a great movie.They only real flaw in the plot was premise that an Arab that they just met, especially one who was not a warrior by profession, would be selected as the 13th warrior.  This was highly contrived.  This film was an epic saga of human conflict.  It wasn't some romantic war over a great philosophy or ideal.  It was raw survival against barbaric intruders.  It was typical of life in medieval times.  This is not something today's society can really relate to being a generation that has grown up on sitcoms and fast food and whose idea of a threat is if someone insults their cultural group.  I believe that this is the reason it did not have popular appeal.  The response would probably be the same if The Iliad were made into a film without some character development of Achilles and Hector. McTiernan did an outstanding job of capturing the look and feel of the times.  The locations were fantastic and the sets all very rough hewn.  The cave scenes were also extremely realistic.  The battle scenes were first rate.  He did a fine job of depicting the thinking of medieval men, wrought from a combination of tradition, myth, superstition, and fear of the unknown in a time when almost everything was unknown.The only real error he made was the depiction of Ahmad's (Antonio Banderas) learning of the Northmen's language.  Clearly, he was not trying to make it look like Ahmad learned the language in one night.  Unfortunately, that's the way it came across.  It would have been more effective if he used successive cutaways of him listening in different situations, on the boat, in a field, by the campfire, etc.Of special note, I saw this film on DVD and the sound was fantastic.  This was superb use of all five speakers in the Dolby 5.1 format.  The forest and battle sounds came from everywhere at once.  Characters who rode off the screen, could be tracked audibly as they rode away.  Kudos to the sound designers.Antonio Banderas did as good a job as can be expected given the way his character was written.  Since the hero wasn't the point of this film (the struggle was), and since he wasn't really even the hero (Buliwyf was), Banderas was relegated to being a supporting actor in a starring role.I rated this film an 8\/10.  A few minor flaws did not detract from the excellence of the portrayal of the epic.  Not for the faint of heart.

I liked this film.  It is an excellent piece of directing from John McTiernan that captures the medieval period realistically.Contrary to most of the criticism that this film is just violence with no plot, this film has a very definite and sound plot.  It is the story of 13 courageous men who are sent to defend the homeland of a respected king from the attack of the Wendol, the creatures of the mist who are thought to be eaters of human flesh.  It is a story of duty, courage, honor and loyalty, and some very brutal battles.What the story lacked was character development and an archetypal hero.  Since that is what the masses expect in their films, I'm certain this film was a big disappointment.  That is what made Braveheart a more complete film of this genre.  We had William Wallace as our reason for watching the battles.  If this film starred Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenegger as Buliwyf (played instead by veritably unknown Vladimir Kulich), and spent a little time developing him as a leader, I'm sure everyone would have thought it was a great movie.They only real flaw in the plot was premise that an Arab that they just met, especially one who was not a warrior by profession, would be selected as the 13th warrior.  This was highly contrived.  This film was an epic saga of human conflict.  It wasn't some romantic war over a great philosophy or ideal.  It was raw survival against barbaric intruders.  It was typical of life in medieval times.  This is not something today's society can really relate to being a generation that has grown up on sitcoms and fast food and whose idea of a threat is if someone insults their cultural group.  I believe that this is the reason it did not have popular appeal.  The response would probably be the same if The Iliad were made into a film without some character development of Achilles and Hector. McTiernan did an outstanding job of capturing the look and feel of the times.  The locations were fantastic and the sets all very rough hewn.  The cave scenes were also extremely realistic.  The battle scenes were first rate.  He did a fine job of depicting the thinking of medieval men, wrought from a combination of tradition, myth, superstition, and fear of the unknown in a time when almost everything was unknown.The only real error he made was the depiction of Ahmad's (Antonio Banderas) learning of the Northmen's language.  Clearly, he was not trying to make it look like Ahmad learned the language in one night.  Unfortunately, that's the way it came across.  It would have been more effective if he used successive cutaways of him listening in different situations, on the boat, in a field, by the campfire, etc.Of special note, I saw this film on DVD and the sound was fantastic.
