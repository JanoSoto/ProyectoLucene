The plot is told from the point of view of young television writer Benjy Stone who has been charged with keeping the guest star of a live Saturday night television show in line through rehearsals and onto the show itself. This is not easy task given that the guest is none other than the Errol-Flynn-esquire Alan Swann, the legendary lothario and drinker. The narrative charts their escapades over the week and sees them learn lessons from one another (to a point).I say to a point because the plot is not that strong when you go much below the superficial and indeed there isn't the action\/reaction that I expected from the character dynamics &#x96; or at least it is not that strong on the page. This is a bit of a weakness in the film &#x96; not that I wanted it to be serious or insightful but more that I felt it could have done with being a little sharper and more structured in regards its characters. That said, what it leaves is a rather superficial and frothy film and this is in no way a totally bad thing because it plays into this very well. The word of the day for me was whimsy with this &#x96; because it seems to have been founded on a bed of nostalgia for a particular place and time that may not even have existed. Given that nostalgia (as opposed to reality) is the foundation, it was wise to build with a whimsical comedic approach because the two things compliment each other well as the various backstage shenanigans and characters get on. It is an odd coincidence that this all occurs in 30 Rockefeller Plaza because the exaggerated antics and 100% comedic characters did very much put me in mind of 30 Rock &#x96; not as funny perhaps but the base elements were very similar.It is a comedy though and, while I was not laughing out loud very often, I did have several good laughs and otherwise found myself quite charmed by the amusing material. There are some great lines but there are also plenty of funny little characters around the edges to provide chuckles and feed into the overall comedy (for example the throwaway creation of Rookie Carroca, which is odd but yet very funny). As in 30 Rock today, the cast here are a massive part of making the comedy work and in particular carrying off the whimsy and silliness so that it remains charming and does not become stupid or grating. Linn-Baker is the narrative-device and as such he is pretty good, doing enough so that we like him and care a bit in regards his character's romantic ambitions but never pushing himself forward so that he challenges the main show in town &#x96; which is O'Toole. With his wonderful swagger and droll delivery of his lines, O'Toole nails his comedy character perfectly and is very funny doing it (his finest moment being the for ladies only exchange). OK at times the material lets him down (the more serious character moments towards the end jar a little in contrast with the rest of his performance) but otherwise he is very good. Harper is cute and works well with both men, while Bologna is a blast from the past that is simple but effective while the rest of the support cast has plenty of recognisable faces doing great little comic characters (Kazan, Hoffman, De Salvo, I could go on).My Favourite Year doesn't have the substance that the narrative (and narration) suggests that it will have and perhaps is a little unsatisfying if you are trying to take it even slightly seriously as a story but if you are even vaguely in the mood it is hard not to be charmed by it. With nostalgic whimsy as the approach the film delivers laughs that range from the slap-stick to the witty and, while you'll not be rolling on the floor it produced such consistent chuckles for me that it was hard not to enjoy it despite its apparent weaknesses in other areas.

When I was 11 I saw the first sequel o LBT The Great valley adventure,and found it far not as good as the first movie, in fact I didn't actually like it, maybe just a bit.Then I didn't see LBT anywhere until 2007, when I got unlimited internet connection and finally got a chance to know about all things I missed during my childhood, I found one of LBT songs from LBT 13 and found it very cute, because of Petrie's singing there.I was impressed by amount of these movies, I thought they should be more successful than 2-nd movie of there are so much of them and decided to download all movies. Well I just made myself watch Great valley adventure, to so to say remember LBT characters and storyline. Then LBT 3 and it was a bit better, but still drawn worse than first movie and worse overall of course.so I watched all sequels 4-6 and got used to it's stile-not amazing, but good to remember childhood.But when I watched The Stone of Cold Fire, I felt something changed, strong dialogues, Great-drawn Amazing storyline, They DON'T meet new friends and other nonsense some of LBT haters say they only met 3 villains and 2 friendly aliens, researching the main characters doing miraculous things like traveling in another place very fast(life is full with little Mysteries) and other mystic stuff, this whole movie is filled with mystery, and meanwhile it doesn't go far from the main storyline, This movie is totally different from previous 6 as a new Millennium it's quality is much better and continues improving with later sequels. I really enjoyed this movie ,and it's actually looking as the second movie of LBT deserving for Family rating, Everyone Young and old will most likely love it.2 of 3 songs in The Stone of CF are not childish, they are just great, every word is catching, maybe because adults sing them.Also a Science fiction storyline is extremely rare for childish cartoons and realistic once( reminds me show LOST where all begins realistic and them and then goes to science fiction with time traveling) and revealing aliens at the end just blew my mind! This movie has an excellent stile, especially Pterano's personality, and his voice(Michael York did great job), SOCF is also tougher than the other onces, and at the same time it brings good moralities, where can bad leadership bring to, and that some people who seem bad have heart too, they are just confused like Pterano. I'm also glad there were SciFi instead of magic, if This stone was magical it would ruin the whole LBT universe Every time I re-watch this movie I more realize how great it is, it isn't silly as any previous sequel.Also the soundtrack is amazing.Some people think it would rather better to make a series instead of movies, my question to you ARE YOU SICK?? You really think that low quality 20-min time limited episodes would do anything good?? Sooo in 2007 a lame cartoon series of LBT released, drawn with low quality, repeating songs, silly story lines, dialogues, can't say it is worse than The Great valley Adventure, but most of episodes a really not so good, they are just childish and not for the whole family to watch, just made for kids,and for Little kids.About other Sequels, I think The Stone of Cold fire made a new level for the sequels, made them not only for children(who definitely like them)but for the whole family again, almost as it was with the first movie, which is the best for all times, but if there were no sequels I'd rather live sadder, most of LBT sequels brought much happiness in my life, and NO other cartoon is even close to it's greatness.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 October 2009","score":"","review":" This better-than-average slasher offering is bolstered by fairly strong performances from a quartet of solid lead actors and a well-scouted location to stage the horror. The film is also augmented by a very cool and grisly back story that gives weight to the eventual stalk-and-slash happenings, and as a whole, the weaker elements here are out-shined by an overall spooky atmosphere and characters who make smart decisions more often than not, thus making it a lot easier for us to care what happens to them.Linda Blair is especially endearing, and considering some of the awful films she would later slum in, it's nice to see her playing a decent character here. Likewise, the presence of Peter Barton should be a treat for splatter fans, who will undoubtedly recognize him from Friday The 13th The Final Chapter. Barton is also considerably more likable than most disposable splatter film victims, and since we spend so much of the runtime with him and Blair, this certainly helps along our interest in the steady and methodical build of the film.Though the core of the story revolves around four college pledges who must spend the night in cursed Garth Manor to be accepted into their desired fraternity\/sorority sects, there is a nifty little subplot centered around a pack of their classmates rigging up the dilapidated house with special effects intended to scare them away. Hell Night runs a bit long because of this, but the body count gets a push as well, so it kind of evens out. Some of these special effects are a little far-fetched, especially a ghostly manifestation the tricksters somehow summon with a simple film projector; but it looks pretty neat, so I'm inclined to let the logistical problems slide.The house itself is a great find, perfectly suited for the story and large enough to believably allow for the hidden passageways and underground lairs the plot calls for. It's certainly a creepy locale, and it's not hard to imagine the legend of Garth Manor playing out between those rotting walls. The expansive grounds surrounding the property are also well-employed, and since the horror isn't limited to the inside of the Manor, there are plenty of opportunities for fresh frights throughout the film. Of course, we wouldn't have much of a movie if there wasn't some truth to the tale of Garth Manor, and when our pledges finally begin to encounter the deranged and deformed Garth children, the film plays out as a nice balance between a monster movie and a slasher film.

Likewise, the presence of Peter Barton should be a treat for splatter fans, who will undoubtedly recognize him from Friday The 13th The Final Chapter. Barton is also considerably more likable than most disposable splatter film victims, and since we spend so much of the runtime with him and Blair, this certainly helps along our interest in the steady and methodical build of the film.Though the core of the story revolves around four college pledges who must spend the night in cursed Garth Manor to be accepted into their desired fraternity\/sorority sects, there is a nifty little subplot centered around a pack of their classmates rigging up the dilapidated house with special effects intended to scare them away. Hell Night runs a bit long because of this, but the body count gets a push as well, so it kind of evens out. Some of these special effects are a little far-fetched, especially a ghostly manifestation the tricksters somehow summon with a simple film projector; but it looks pretty neat, so I'm inclined to let the logistical problems slide.The house itself is a great find, perfectly suited for the story and large enough to believably allow for the hidden passageways and underground lairs the plot calls for. It's certainly a creepy locale, and it's not hard to imagine the legend of Garth Manor playing out between those rotting walls. The expansive grounds surrounding the property are also well-employed, and since the horror isn't limited to the inside of the Manor, there are plenty of opportunities for fresh frights throughout the film.

It shows that you can not just put any actor under the mask to make his character threatening and scary. Also his look differs so much from the first two movies that it becomes quite distracting.

I thought this was going to be a comedy but it ended up being one of the best tear jerker's I have ever seen. It has a beautiful concept of a struggling father. Sam (Sean Penn) has a daughter called Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning) and they like to read and go to the park together and they both love IHOP. Sounds nice right? The problem with this is that Sam has learning difficulties (I think it's autism) and when his daughter reaches the age of 7 she will have a higher mental age than her dad. The government believe it's best to take Lucy away from Sam (I know!) and Sam doesn't know what's happening. He hires a lawyer called Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is very cold-hearted. Sam shows her what kindness is (I'm not going to spoil how) and she helps him.Even with his disabilities he still fights for her which is very respectful. The way the camera pan around in this film makes it look like a documentary and adds to the tension. All of the characters are really believable. Sean Penn is brilliant because he portrays a disabled well but doesn't take the Micky. Dakota Fanning is amazing even though it is only her second film and she was only 6 yet she steals the show. Michelle Pfeiffer was very good but wasn't too believable in the courtroom. Lucy's foster mother wasn't believable (I know because i'm fostered) but I enjoyed it.Overall the film is unmissable and I'd recommend anyone who doesn't like to point and laugh at other people's misfortunes. If you are going to watch this movie for cheap laughs at disabled people watch it and it will change your mind about them in a heartbeat.

Trying to be objective I'd say - it's not bad. It's not as good as what I would consider to be the classic of the slasher movies (1978's Halloween) but it has some moments of pretty good suspense and somewhat surprisingly to me I found that it wasn't a gore-fest. There's violence and blood but the murders, while they're portrayed, tend to be shown quickly and the movie moves on fairly quickly. The setting is used pretty well to create atmosphere - the movie is set in a remote camp about to be re-opened after being closed for over 20 years following the murders of two counsellors in 1958. Those murders kick off the movie. There's some decent camera-work, as the camera serves as the eyes of the killer, and at times that effect is used when the camera isn't being used as the eyes of the killer, so there's a bit of uncertainty for the viewer. It is a bit of a chuckle that this movie uses as its setting the classically bad opening of terrible novels (it was a dark and stormy night.)The performances were OK, if a little bit forced and artificial at times. Adrienne King did a good job near the end of the movie as the terrified Alice. Kevin Bacon had a role in this as Jack, but it wasn't the lead role, and aside from him no one from the movie rose to any significant stature in Hollywood and there was certainly no Jamie Lee Curtis (see Halloween) among the female leads, although there were many shots of young and cute women in various stages of undress!Strange to say, but in some ways knowing the basic outline of how the series progresses adds to the suspense at the end of the movie as to the identity of the killer, and does get you wondering how the heck this is going to lead to sequels - or at least to the sequels it led to, although Alice's last line (then he's still out there) clearly establishes that those responsible for the movie were already looking ahead to the sequels. Not having been really interested in the series before this, I will confess that, having seen the first instalment, I now have a certain curiosity to see how the second instalment is constructed. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 October 2009","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I'll concede right off that it's very hard to be objective in reviewing this movie.

The truth is I've never seen it until today, but it's spawned so many sequels and become such a part of popular culture (for better or worse) that it's stamped into your mind whether you've seen it or not. Trying to be objective I'd say - it's not bad. It's not as good as what I would consider to be the classic of the slasher movies (1978's Halloween) but it has some moments of pretty good suspense and somewhat surprisingly to me I found that it wasn't a gore-fest. There's violence and blood but the murders, while they're portrayed, tend to be shown quickly and the movie moves on fairly quickly. The setting is used pretty well to create atmosphere - the movie is set in a remote camp about to be re-opened after being closed for over 20 years following the murders of two counsellors in 1958. Those murders kick off the movie. There's some decent camera-work, as the camera serves as the eyes of the killer, and at times that effect is used when the camera isn't being used as the eyes of the killer, so there's a bit of uncertainty for the viewer. It is a bit of a chuckle that this movie uses as its setting the classically bad opening of terrible novels (it was a dark and stormy night.)The performances were OK, if a little bit forced and artificial at times.

Yes, this is a fantastic film, and most assuredly a must-see for film scholars and casual fans alike. But, as with any sequel, the sense of familiarity makes the most gripping moments of Bride Of Frankenstein slightly less spectacular than they were when we saw them the first time out, and while the film succeeds as both a logical continuation of the original and as a high-water mark in Universal's already stellar classic horror canon, Bride simply doesn't capture the near-perfection of our first visit with Frankenstein.Many also consider this film a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's source novel, but that's not quite true either. Actually, Bride Of Frankenstein's main purpose is to bring to life the substantial bits of Shelley's novel that were omitted from the original film. Putting the two movies together gives a fairly inclusive, if chronologically skewed, overview of the salient elements of Shelley's classic text. Those who have never read the book will undoubtedly find the events in Bride a marvelous augmentation of the original Frankenstein, but for those already well-acquainted with the novel, this film simply fills in the blanks.Some may find the idea of the monster speaking to be a silly twist, but it's important to note that this was a major plot point in Shelley's original tale. The way it's handled here is actually an excellent representation of the source material, and the monster's time with the blind hermit in the woods is well-lifted straight from the text. While the ability to speak strips Karloff's lumbering giant of a bit of his menace, his verbalization of his need for companionship substantially furthers the exploration of the isolation and loneliness of the monster's existence that is so key to the story.The movie's preface is a bit over the top, and although it is a rather neat idea to allow Shelley herself to tell the rest of her tale, the foppish portrayals of Lord Byron and Percy Shelley have aged less gracefully than the rest of the film. While this works as a great device to set up a sequel, the factual inaccuracy of this segue may miff those who are approaching the film from a historical standpoint.In most respects, Bride functions as a straight-forward Part II, utilizing an approach that has been used in sequels since the dawn of cinema namely, amplifying the most successful elements from the original film to substitute for the lack of surprises. In the case of Bride Of Frankenstein, this means more of Boris Karloff's legendary monster and more humor. Neither of these is a bad thing, and thanks to the strength of Una O'Connor's spirited performance, the funniest moments of Bride have held up admirably well. Ditto with Karloff's indelible creature, who remains an unforgettable and imposing screen presence. Karloff did magnificent things without saying a word in the original Frankenstein, but allowed the chance to add language to his portrayal, he's able to more ably summon the complexities and inner turmoil of the monster that are such a focal point in the text.Ernest Thesiger's Dr. Pretorius nearly steals the film on his own, even if our first glimpse of his experiments is bound to look clunky and dated to modern audiences. Though these effects aren't quite spectacular, the strength of Thesiger's performance is undeniable, and his shared obsession with Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein leads to some delightful interplay between the two.Of course, we can't fail to mention the Bride herself, Elsa Lanchester, whose stunning reveal nearly rivals the impact of Karloff's entrance in the original. Surely, the film-makers were reaching for a presence as iconic as Karloff's monster, and they definitely hit those lofty heights with Lanchester's unforgettable and all-too-brief turn as the monster's unwilling object of desire.The finale here is not only the climax of the film, but of the creature's entire quest for acceptance, and the tragedy of the monster's disturbed life is never more explicit than when he discovers that even the being built specifically to be his companion can not accept his monstrous existence. When our doomed lothario and his dismissive mate are seemingly destroyed, it is an epic, almost Shakespeare-ian last reel, and the monster's final words, we belong dead, end the saga with a violent emotional punch that perfectly punctuates the sense of primal despondency Karloff's creature has carried throughout both films.Yet, none of this quite edges Bride ahead of the classic it follows. The repetition of powerful images from the previous film, including the monster throwing a hapless soul off the roof just as he did to Frankenstein in the original, ensures that Bride simply can't shock our senses as acutely as before. Even though Dr. Frankenstein's ecstatic She's alive! is a welcome and delightful twist on the precursor's most famous moment, it doesn't have the same lunatic zeal that shone so brightly the first time through. This is most assuredly a masterfully constructed piece, but it simply doesn't match the heady standard set for it.I honestly don't know why that matters, though.

While Buscemi is narrating we see some of his flashbacks that are also good (mostly because Banderas doesn't have to act too much in them). We also love the reaction of the bartender and the people in the bar. Then there is a scene in which Banderas plays his guitar in his band. Although that is clearly not him singing or playing, this scene still is quite enjoyable. All is well until Banderas starts to act. Well let's face it He can't act. He is always pushing his hair back and making that (supposed to be sexy) look. I think that he should be a porn star. That's what I think. He can't act to well, he has long black hair. He can't speak English so well and he is, to some people kind of sexy. That is why the sex scene with Salma Hayek is so...good. The scene which I hate the most is the scene where he finds out that Bucho is actually his brother. In this scene an actor should really be able to act. An actor should express a bunch of complex emotions (and Banderas clearly can't do that). But Banderas just gets this strange look and starts walking around like an angry gorilla. This is the scene I hate the most because of Banderas. It is well written and creates a twist in the movie that we first don't know of.

The third and final installment to the series, Quatermass And The Pit (1967), however, is a masterpiece that even surpasses its predecessors in almost all aspects. Directed by Roy Ward Baker, who challenges Terence Fisher for the title of Hammer's greatest director, Quatermass and the Pit clearly hat greater production values and technical possibilities than its predecessors - there is no doubt that special effects went a long way between 1957 and 1967. The great look of this film is not the reason for me to deem it superior to its, already great, predecessors, however. This film, which was scripted by Sci-Fi legend Nigel Kneale (the inventor of the Quatermass franchise and writer of the original BBC TV-Show) simply has an incredibly fascinating story to tell - and does so brilliantly. The two predecessors were both exciting and creepy; this third part is genuinely scary and simply sublime however, as it magnificently combines a macabre premise and a variety of ingenious elements including evolution to lead to an utterly breathtaking conclusion.When trying to extend the London Underground, workers uncover the mortal remains of prehistoric simian apes. Anthropologist Dr. Matthew Roney (James Donald) is convinced that the skeletons are of an unknown race of primates, older than any primate species known to contemporary science. His research is halted when an unidentified bomb is discovered near the primates, and the military develops interest in the discovery. When Professor Allan Quatermass (Andrew Keir) steps in the body, which was at first supposed to be a WW2 bomb, turns out not to be from this world...As stated above, the two predecessors were great films, but they had their minor flaws and plot holes. This concluding entry to the Quatermass saga is far more elaborate in its storyline. The film, which is full of interesting, intelligently-drawn characters, has an increasingly tense atmosphere of doom from the beginning onward. The foreboding mood is intensely creepy, and the dark presentiment soon builds up to a truly captivating suspense level. Andrew Keir replaces Brian Donlevy as Professor Quatermass.

Anthropologist Dr. Matthew Roney (James Donald) is convinced that the skeletons are of an unknown race of primates, older than any primate species known to contemporary science. His research is halted when an unidentified bomb is discovered near the primates, and the military develops interest in the discovery.

This concluding entry to the Quatermass saga is far more elaborate in its storyline. The film, which is full of interesting, intelligently-drawn characters, has an increasingly tense atmosphere of doom from the beginning onward.

You immediately know you're in for some scares but this movie doesn't do that by making you jump or attempt to gross you out with blood and guts. This is a movie that weaves a dark, intricate web around you and, before you know it, you're unable to move and waiting for the inevitable horror that is to follow.The storyline is simple but effective. Basically, a contractor (Gordon) has agreed to clear the old asylum of asbestos within a week. Gordon and his team of four men are unique, well-developed and totally believable. All of them are sufficiently likable and each of them have weaknesses, some have dreams. Gordon's nephew, for example, is apathetic and has a fear of the dark, Mike dropped out of law school but wants to return, Phil is resentful of one of the other men for stealing his girlfriend, Gordon has just had a baby and is struggling to make ends meet. It's these details that make you empathise with the five men and what makes the end of this movie so bleak and horrifying.A special mention should be given to the music, which is essential to the atmosphere of the film sparse, unsettling and perfect for a movie that takes place inside an old asylum. I also liked the image of the wheelchair (gave me flashbacks of The Changeling) and the way the tapes of a former patient, Mary, intertwine with the plot.This is a movie that may require multiple viewings because you'll definitely have questions once it's over.

When it comes to animation, Dalmatians started a trend in Disney I don't really care for. Strapped budgets required some money-saving scheme, so in walked Xerox and with it the very scratchy-outliney style that lasted through The Rescuers. There's just something about that style that bugs me- perhaps it suggests a lack of refinement and finishing. Anywho, it is what it is, and despite my predisposition, I did love the elegance of the dogs- they always felt wonderfully sleek and fluid. Surprisingly, there are very few songs. In fact, there is only the infamous Cruella De Vil and a short blurb at the ending. I guess the extreme popularity of Cruella more than made up for the lack of other songs.When reviewing this film, I feel I must draw at least some upon comparisons to Lady and the Tramp. They were made so close together, yet appear so radically different. You can see the radical changes in Disney really start to break through around 1960 (it happens again at the end of the 80s). Once again, we are dealing with a dog's point of view, but for some reason it does not feel as entirely faithful to that point as in its predecessor. There is just a little too much focus on the human characters- the dogs begin to run into danger of stepping the boundary of cartoon-animals-that-talk land, instead of being purely animated characters (that trend only gets worse from here).What keeps this film from getting a higher score is it's not as easy to get plugged into as some stories. Being more of an adventure film than a love story, Dalmations just doesn't leave that much impact on me. It was suspenseful and well-crafted, but it never gripped me with meaningful relationships or outstanding characters or charged lines. Not to say that adventure films are inherently bad, but outside of spectacular sequences or plots, they are harder to invest in. And Dalmatians simply didn't offer me anything investable.So in the end, Dalmatians is kind of like a piece of bubble gum. I never really crave it, but it's fun to get as a novelty once in a blue moon. And after 10 minutes of unsuppressed bubbles, I spit it out and it doesn't cross my mind again.

He is a new entity in this demoralised place, where money, sex and power rule over common decency. After all the workers need to let loose and go crazy once in a while, since all the hard work they do millions of kilometres from home. Life isn't easy here in space and even O'Niel's wife decides she can no longer continue living so far away from home and leaves with their son to return to Earth (a place which their boy has only read about in books).Depressed from the turn of events O'Niel only strengthens his resolve to do what is right and keep some semblance of justice on the colony. Hence when it occurs to the sheriff that this outer space town suffers from inexplicably high suicide levels he decides to resolve the mystery and will resort to any means necessary to solve this case.Gloomy, gritty and surprisingly realistic (i.e. heads blowing up after decompression) starts off very promisingly acting out as a mystery crime story in outer space with some admirable noire qualities. All this quickly comes to pass, as the mystery is solved within the first 30 minutes of the movie and from then on we receive a hack-job script which some illogical action sequences (not much logic to them actually taking place), poor character motivations and stereotypical plot solutions. In the end you just really feel wanting for much more, as the movie never supplies what it promises.Essentially this could have been a classic sci-fi story, but the writers just got it all wrong. But the credits of the movie you really have no idea whether it has or has not ended. It never acts out to anything resembling ending and you finish the story asking yourself So what exactly did this mean for the colony and what was the point of O'Niel staying to participate in a blood-bath? The movie ages nicely and special effects are quite impressive. But with a story like this it won't ever become a classic. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 October 2009","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" Atmosperic and classy with the great screen presence of Sean Connery this movie suffers from one severe flaw an utterly uninspiring script.O'Niel (Sean Connery) is the new sheriff in a outland space mining colony renowned for its high efficiency and great production return. He is a new entity in this demoralised place, where money, sex and power rule over common decency. After all the workers need to let loose and go crazy once in a while, since all the hard work they do millions of kilometres from home. Life isn't easy here in space and even O'Niel's wife decides she can no longer continue living so far away from home and leaves with their son to return to Earth (a place which their boy has only read about in books).Depressed from the turn of events O'Niel only strengthens his resolve to do what is right and keep some semblance of justice on the colony. Hence when it occurs to the sheriff that this outer space town suffers from inexplicably high suicide levels he decides to resolve the mystery and will resort to any means necessary to solve this case.Gloomy, gritty and surprisingly realistic (i.e. heads blowing up after decompression) starts off very promisingly acting out as a mystery crime story in outer space with some admirable noire qualities. All this quickly comes to pass, as the mystery is solved within the first 30 minutes of the movie and from then on we receive a hack-job script which some illogical action sequences (not much logic to them actually taking place), poor character motivations and stereotypical plot solutions. In the end you just really feel wanting for much more, as the movie never supplies what it promises.Essentially this could have been a classic sci-fi story, but the writers just got it all wrong. But the credits of the movie you really have no idea whether it has or has not ended.

Quite faithful to the book and captures Shute's sense of stoic resignation (oh well, chin up old chap)and of course the almost manic obsession for one last hurrah....cue port drinking, fishing, Australian Grand Prix.... Would have liked to have seen more of the dissolving of order that Shute depicted towards the end and of course Kramer copped out a bit with the last scene of Moira on the headland as the sub sailed off (perhaps Ava taking suicide pills would not have been a good look in those days).My only real disappointment was the score. How many variations on waltzing matilda can you fit into two hours...the ghostly rendition of the final verse as Dwight and Moira kissed in the fishing lodge was bold and the beautiful type stuff. As an Aussie I found it cringe-worthy (even allowing for the era) and Kramer I think showed a bit of naivety in his understanding of the country by pushing the tune ad-infinitum.Also thought him heavy handed with the music in his treatment of the San Francisco, San Diego scenes and the final banner scene. Silence would have been far more effective.Still, a tremendously powerful, though-provoking and non-sensational treatment of a topic which occupied the minds of many at the time. Really did illustrate the world ending with a whimper and not a bang.
