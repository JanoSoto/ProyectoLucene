First off, this is my first time viewing the film and I have already seen Rushmore (director\/co-writers second film, this one being his first). I had not been able to find this to rent anywhere up until yesterday, and my interest to see it was at an all time high considering my adoration for Rushmore and heavy anticipation for the creative teams latest, THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS. I went into this film knowing it was a low budget, indie film, and in that respect it fully delivers. In fact it reminds me how funny and simple films could be. It begins with a successful escape from a Mental Institute where Anthony (Luke Wilson) is staying. The mastermind behind the operation is Anthony's not so bright friend Didnan (Owen Wilson, proving his comedic timing in this film). You'll see why this is funny when you watch the movie, and it sets up the main characters perfectly. Wes Anderson co-wrote the film with Owen Wilson, as well as directed. I absolutely loved Rushmore and would say that it is one of my all time top 10 favorite films...ever! Watching this film was a treat (excuse the use of that word, but it really was). I smiled and laughed at the situations, all spread out and paced perfectly (perhaps a little too slow for others tastes, all depend on how you look at the film). Bottle Rocket is as beuatifully filmed as it is funny. The cinematography really helped this simple story develop and added depth to the situations. For example, the bookstore robbery scene, in which everything looks vacant...really vacant. You'll know what I mean, and why this scene works when you watch the movie. So watch it! There's also the introduction of James Caan's character, whose presence I seemed to find distracting at first more then anything else, but there is a pay off, and his low-key performance was right on. The dialogue is hilarious, and all the characters in this film have great chemistry. It's no wonder the director used many of them again in his latest efforts. I also enjoyed the odd romance build-up for Anthony, and it showed that the director truly enjoyed the subject matter since he went on to explore it further, and with much more importance in Rushmore. All in all this film follows a simple narrative leading to simple pay offs. The pace serves the story and its characters. These are people that just want to talk and live and do...something...anything. So they rob. It's hilarious, and fun to watch. I recommend you see it if your a fan of the creative teams present work. If not you should probably give these movies another chance.  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2002","score":"","review":"   I'll dig in to this one right away...

I honestly cannot think of any other film that pulled it off so well. Unlike George Romero's zombie trilogy, Return of the Living Dead, written\/directed by Dan O'Bannon, it didn't take itself seriously. It had FUN. It never dragged, zipping you from one moment of dread to another and when it got too gory or intense, O'Bannon brought in the laughs. Not slapstick but genuine, over-the-top gags. Whether it be a hungry zombie asking to send more cops as if he was ordering pizza or the bumbling warehouse employees who, after accidentally releasing a toxic gas that re-animates corpses, find that killing zombies by destroying the brains doesn't work. When they finally exclaim WELL IT WORKED IN THE MOVIES! you know the rules have been thrown out the window.The film works on so many levels of gore and humor and the fact that it makes fun of itself and Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead come off as more self-aware than Wes Craven's Scream films of the 90's.The film took it's chances and could've p***ed off fans of Romero's original by actually referring to that movie within the first few minutes, saying it was all fictional and that what really happened was... well you get the idea. In fact, O' Bannon tried as hard as possible to make his film as different from Romero's. You see, O' Bannon's zombies could RUN after you, could think and plan ways to get at you, they could TALK to you and tell you what part they wanted to eat from you......BRAINS!The film was shot on a $4 million dollar budget and had it's problems with make-up and FX but the wonderful, brisk editing and the gloomy lighting more than covered up it's technical flaws. You'd be hard pressed to find any obvious goofs.The film's punk rock soundtrack is excellent. Dare I say goth punk? Sure it fit in with the punk characters that got stuck in the horror but the tone of the songs fit in so well with the movie.The cast was superb, all somehow finding the perfect way to play their parts. There isn't a single 'off' performance. Frank's over-the-top freaking out, Burt's calm this is what we're gonna do attitude and Freddy's realization of what's happening to his body and mind all showcase the talent that made the film work.When one of our heroes (who's been zombiefied) commits suicide by burning himself alive in the crematorium....it's not horrific but truly sad. Actor James Karen embodied 'Frank' with such an every guy quality, you couldn't help but feel for him.Thom Mathews played Freddy. A new level was added to the zombie genre. We see a young man, full of life with lots of partying left to do, slowly get snuffed out. He was exposed to the gas you see and he's slowly dying.....yet already dead. He's conscious while feeling rigor mortis setting in.....and he describes every pain to you. It's unsettling.Clu Gulager plays the warehouse owner 'Burt' (his best friend who owns the funeral home next door? Ernie. Nope, not kidding!) who seemingly dead pans throughout the entire film. While the entire film is going crazy, he is the constant throughout and you feel that if you were in the same situation, you'd want him there helping to make crucial decisions.Linnea Quigley, the B-movie scream Queen plays 'Trash'. Her infamous, FULL FRONTAL strip tease has left many of my fellow 20-something's with fond memories of their childhood.This film parodied it's sub-genre of horror YEARS before the crap that was the Scream trilogy. It also managed to be FAR scarier than Wes Craven's poor attempts which basically amounted to a Boo! a 9 year old attempts on Halloween.Dan O'Bannon, the film's writer\/director (primarily responsible for the classic Alien) created a film that, in every way, perfectly blended horror and humor. I'm not saying it's the first, I'm saying it's the first at *doing it right.*The film was released in 1985 and went head-to-head with George Romero's Day of the Dead. Return not only got better critical reviews but bested George the King at the box office and Romero is considered the best at this type of film. Wrong.Compare such boring trite with O'Bannon's work and the superior *film* shines through. O'Bannon saw the genre in a way most could not. Treat it's subject with respect yet realize, this is incredibly silly.O'Bannon's script is self-aware yet understands it's fictional world is very real. We get the humor, the film's characters aren't so lucky.The film goes the opposite of what you'd expect in such a subtle way. The hapless humans are caged in places normally associated with the dead (a funeral home, a medical supply warehouse) whereas the dead are free to roam around in the land of the living. Subtle.This is NOT a dumb film at all (as some uneducated people might mistake zombie films for.) It's an ironic, horrific, campy and witty take on a classic horror genre. A film I can watch over and over again.This classic film will FINALLY be released on DVD in America by MGM Home Video on August 27th, 2002.
