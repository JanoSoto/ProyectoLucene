So this movie is not so great, and in the wake of Jurassic Park, etc., it sometimes seems like been there, done that but it really is a fun-filled romp of a monster movie on it's own. I personally don't miss those Japanese guys in their rubber monster suits one bit. Give them credit for trying to entertain the rest of us who have matured beyond the traditional Japanese versions of this story.

Many of the comments on this movie has said that it was badly instructed, badly cast and had no plot whatsoever, well as for the plot, yes it's classical and basic but this movie is also meant as an introduction to D&D and as such should be basic in its story, what it lacks is more background on the setting ( in this case the kingdom of Izmer) as there aren't any place where you can find this in the product portfolio of Wizards. The cast haven't got any 'BIG' names like Bruce Willis or Michelle Pfieffer and this would also in my opinion had been a big mistake, instead we have some well know if not blockbuster material in the likes of Jeremy Irons as the main villain and Thora Birch as the Empress, some less prolific like Bruce Payne (Full Eclipse), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie) and Lee Arenberg (Pirates of the Caribbean) and some unknowns like Justin Whalin, Kirsten Wilson and Zoe McLellan. As far as the acting they won't win any Oscars for their performance, but most dosn't fall flat on their buttocks either except Irons and Wayans who both over acted (espessially Wayans, but when dosn't he) and Iron comes out of this even worse than he did in Die Hard 3. As for the Director is clear to see (if you have seen the Let the games begin documentary on the DVD) that he simply loves D&D and has maybe been a little blind in some places (Wayans!!)HERE BE SPOILERSI have read one comment on this site where the submitter heard cheering when one of the main characters (Snails, played by Wayans) where killed off. Now I think that the reason for the cheering isn't the fact that it's one of the main characters that are killed off but simply that Wayans is so annoying that anybody would be happy to see him out of the movie.Why do I like this movie when so many don't (I have even read in Dragon Magazine (Wizards own monthly magazine for D&D) that this movie was bad, it's almost like they're embarrassed). Well when I see a movie I look for gaming ideas for use in D&D games and while the idea in this movie is basic the setting is what attracts me and I hope that it's more fleshed out in the planned sequel. The reason that so many dosn't like this movie is, in my opinion that it's not something they can relate that much to as is the case with most other movies of this kind that have a more should we say equal review in the opinion of the masses, like Lord of the Rings which is a setting that most people are familiar with, as for the fans of the game well I think they're just grumpy that their favorite setting didn't get the part and since they can't get any info on this setting they have trouble interacting with it.On a final note while Bruce Payne does a good job of acting the role of Damodar, why did they give him Blue\/Purple libs and so bloodshot ears, he look completely foolish which is kind of sad as it's a nice character (looking forward to seeing him in the sequel (wonder how they write his resurrection into the plot)).All in all I give this movie a 6 mainly because of that annoying Wayans, the foolish look of Damodar and the overplayed Profion (Irons) ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Now I know this movie has had it's share of opinions, most of it bad even from fans of the game, I believe that most of the fans of the game had expected to see their favorite world come to life on the Silver screen but in an attempt to satisfied the masses the producers choose to create their own setting and this didn't fall well with the audience (well most of it anyway) I personally like this movie and as a fan of D&D its nice to see other settings than those published by TSR and later Wizards of the Coast even though I would have like this movie to be set in the DragonLance setting this works fine with me.

It is by far one of the best examples of acting talent across the board and evokes such levels of emotion that one is drawn deeply into the story. But, it makes a statement so one-sided and irresponsible that you cannot help but feel like you have just eaten a huge meal of empty calories by the time it is done.The basic premise behind the film is that love is all that one needs in order to raise a child. It does so by showing Sean Penn's character -- a mentally handicapped man -- trying to raise his daughter on his own and having various officials coming down on him to take his daughter away from him. It is a sad reality that is faced by some mentally handicapped parents, and one can't help but feel sorry for the situation.Personally, I have a hard time accepting a film that ignores the reality of severely mentally handicapped caregivers. While they are indeed fully capable of giving as much love as anyone else, it is an unfortunate truth that some lack the mental facilities to properly raise children. I personally knew a mentally disabled person whose mental age was beyond that demonstrated by the character of Sam, and she had a difficult time raising a cat without injuring it regularly. Though she was repeatedly told by her veterinarian what she needed to do, she simply could not keep up to the ever changing demands of raising a living creature.To put it in perspective, imagine Sean Penn replaced by Haley Joel Osment (at his age in the Sixth Sense) and having him take care of Dakota Fanning's character. In fact, that is still an over-exaggeration because Haley's mental age would still have been more than that of the character of Sam. Because we see Sean Penn physically as an adult, we don't question his abilities and we are more likely to feel sorry for him. But one has to look at the mental facilities and give it a likely comparison. We would never leave a 6 year old girl in the care of an 8 year old boy. In the same way, we can't automatically give the care of a 6 year old girl to a physically mature man with the mental facilities of a 8 year old.While there cannot be a perfect parallel between all situations, certainly there must be some semblance of logic applied instead of just presenting heart-tugging sentiment such as what this film prefers to present. I find it irresponsible of the filmmakers to simply ignore the reality of the situation in order for it to hit home emotionally alone.The film could have been equally effective had they simply acknowledged the fact that Sam really did not have the ability to take care of his daughter on his own and explored the emotional consequences of the situation he finds himself. It is tragic, but it is a fact that must be dealt with. And for the creators of this film to suggest the only gauge to deal with this situation is to ask how sorry you feel for the main character is condescending at best.Beneath the emotional surface and the performances, this film is intellectually empty.
