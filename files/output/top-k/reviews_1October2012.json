[{"date":"1 October 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Matrix is humans against the machines. The machines have almost ruined the entire human race, and a group of people must come together against all odds to battle the malicious machines to save what is left of the year 2199. This movie is not just packed with action, but allusions and symbolism as well. In the Matrix, there are various allusions to the classic story, Alice in Wonderland. In one pivotal scene, Neo is told to follow the white rabbit. He has to make the choice to either follow a girl with a white rabbit tattoo and or to stay at home, just as Alice had to make the choice to follow the rabbit. The white rabbit symbolizes Neo's curiosity to learn more about what is the Matrix. Another allusion is when Neo is forced to make the decision to either go home, or take a red pill to find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes. The red pill symbolizes the journey Neo will take to find out the truth about the Matrix, just as Alice had to make the decision to go on her journey. These references to Alice and Wonderland allow the audience to realize that Neo is embarking on a journey to a different world. The writers and directors of the film, Larry and Andy Wachowski, create symbolism in the manner in which they name locations and characters in the film. In classic mythology, Morpheus is the god of dreams. He is named this because he is a leader of a sleepy society. In the year 2199 the only place human race still thrives is in the city of Zion. This city is never seen. But by not showing it, one could say that it represents Heaven. It is the only place where people can live safely. This city is called Zion because in the Old Testament, Zion is the heavenly city for people to live in safely. The religious themes continue throughout the film with the character Trinity. Trinity represents the number three, which relates to the father, son, and the holy spirit. The Wachowski brothers are able to illustrate the differences between the virtual reality of 1999 and the present 2199 very well. When in 1999, the workers are portrayed as drones, or people who act like robots\/machines. They are blissfully unaware that their version of reality is not real and their minds are being used to power machines. It is always sunny, which represents that the virtual reality of the Matrix is far better than the present. When Neo is shown what 2199 actually looks like, he is stunned. There is no sun, only darkness. Morpheus' group must live in the dark underground tunnels referred to as sewers, while Neo learns his true potential. The darkness represents that the future is bleak and that humans have the potential to ruin their own planet. The contrast between the two time periods represents the fight between good and evil. All action films are in constant motion. Because the Matrix is an action movie, this means it was in constant motion. The Matrix is definitely action-packed; too action- packed in my opinion, being filled with battle scenes that set up good versus evil. Because the battles take place in virtual computer software, everyone has higher capabilities for fighting, running, etc. The battles seem to be the same ones over and over again, until the very end of the movie. I began to form the attitude that this film lacks creativity when it comes to the fight scenes. The special effects are very advanced in this film for being released in the nineties. The characters have the ability to scale walls and do advanced karate and Kung-Fu. The ability to switch from 1999, to a computer program, to 2199 is very impressive. Having grown up in the technological age of our society, I have learned from personal experiences that technology rules our lives. From making tea on the stove in the morning, to checking email throughout the day on both phones and computers, to using a kindle to read in the evening, one is always using technology. In the film The Matrix, an underlying message can be taken to not rely on technology, because it can be the downfall of civilization. But has society reached a point in which life cannot be sustained without technology? Before watching this film, I had previous knowledge that one can be oppressed in society. Examples of this can be seen in dictatorships worldwide. However, this film has taught me that society controls the way one feels, dresses, works, etc. To be different is to be great. Being outspoken will change the world for the better. Neo learned to be different and overcame the challenges to defeat his enemies in the end.

While watching the film, I noticed that whenever Rocky was by himself or walking away from other people, he would be venturing into the dark. I was on the edge of my seat seeing if he would get into an altercation with another person. Rocky's apartment is dark and he has a depressed face when he is in there by himself. As soon as he invites Adrian over to the apartment, the whole lighting in the apartment changes to a brighter more inviting place that was not seen when he was there alone.There are many scenes in the film, that Rocky is placed alone. He spends the majority of the time alone, isolated from many of the people that truly care about time. There are only a few scenes in which Adrian is present. Andrea is one person that Rocky is able to connect with and feels comfortable around. In the scenes where he is isolated, he has a depressed mood to him that will be able to show that unpleasant activities has gone on in his pasted and may be explained in his future activities. Some of the scenes where Rocky is surrounded by other individuals, I was able to get a sense that he still felt as if he was alone. The people he is involved with do not give enjoyment such as the mafia. I get the feeling from the film that the only reason he is involved with them is because he feels that he will never be able to make something of his life. This is thought is reinforced by his trainer saying that you could have been a great boxer but you never took the chance.I feel as the gym where Rocky works out is not just a place where he can become a better boxer. I get the feeling that Rocky goes to the gym to connect with his past and remember the times that he was a good fighter. I think that Rocky goes there with a hope that someday he will get the chance again and he will be able to take it.I think that Sylvester Stallone portrayed the part of Rocky well. I believe he was able to transform himself into a person will little education that had to fight for himself his whole life. He also was able to play being lost and trying to find himself in different activities. I was able to feel the struggle with him trying to become someone he was not such as being the person that hunted down someone when they owed money.Rocky the film is a drama; therefore it is a struggle with finding himself and staying the person that other individuals would like him to be. The producer used music and lighting to add to the suspense of the film to get the audience to feel as though something powerful was going to happen. In the end of the film, during the boxing match, the music gets really loud when the fight is getting close. When Rocky begins to yell her name at the end of the match, the sound is focused on him so everything else is at a lower noise level. With this sound change, I was able see and feel the passion he had for her and with her, he did not feel alone even though he had a large group of people surrounding him.In Rocky's apartment, he has multiple animals that he got from the pet store Adrian works at. Just how he interacts with these creatures, I was able to see that Rocky has more compassion for not only animals but for all the people he comes across. I was able to take this thought of him having compassion and apply it to other scene such as him walking the teenage girl home, and how he told her that she could become someone great. I was able to get the feeling that he was able to get a joyous feeling from helping people.

In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself.Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake society up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to escape from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become.Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of Heathers. With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, or even Ferris Bueller's Day Off. These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, Heathers is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like Weird Science, where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, Heathers leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, Heathers isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to escape from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become.Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of Heathers. With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, or even Ferris Bueller's Day Off. These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, Heathers is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like Weird Science, where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, Heathers leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, Heathers isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

This movie is classified as a true American romantic comedy, but I also think it can also be classified as a drama. I classified it as a drama because the intense problems that Alvy and other characters bring to the film. New York is not known from being the most uplifting cities in the world. It is known to be negative and gloomy, yet full of strange quirks. Alvy Singer represents the city of New York; he is negative, gloomy and has plenty of strange quirks. An example of his negative behavior is best represented in his pessimistic view on life, Life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. He goes into further detail explaining how the horrible people are those who have some kind of terminal illness and the miserable is everyone else. Another example of Alvy's negativity is his inability to grow as a person. He has been going to the same analysis for 15 years now, just to complain about how awful life is. The point of attending the analysis is to better yourself and develop a more positive outlook on life. Whereas Alvy used this time to vent his negative opinions of the world. The upside to Alvy's personality is the strange, yet fun quirks that are evident throughout the movie. Some of these are things like talking at a rapid pace, making a joke out of everything, always wanting to participate in sexually activities with his partner. His imagination starts to break away from the original story telling type of movie; this imagination created a strong interaction between the audience and Alvy. Oppose to presenting all of the information in a bland and direct fashion, Alvy brings the audience into his situations that he is dealing with. Many times throughout the movie, he has a random conversation with other people when something goes wrong in his life. He talks to these random strangers and they reply as if they know what is truly happening in his life. This is because Alvy's character feeds off of social interaction as a comedian. On top of this, his false sense of reality that is emphasized by these interactions with strangers shows his mental and emotional instability. Alvy, Rob, and Annie are all grouped in the entrainment industry. They are all entertainers; Alvy is a well-known comedian, Rob is an actor for a major T.V. series in California, and Annie is a singer for a local night bar. These three people are grouped in entertainment but yet are divided into sub-sectors. The main thing that I noticed when watching this movie is the attitudes change when Alvy is around. His negativity doesn't just smother him from enjoying life, it also affects the people he is closest too. Annie Hall is a great example of this; she started out as a bright and outgoing person, but once Alvy and Annie grew closer together, she became negative and neurotic, just like Alvy. (Induction) Just like most romantic comedy films, Annie Hall is a romantic comedy that also deals with relationships, even if they are crazy and neurotic. Characterization was something that was new to me; I understood the concept of how to analyze the characters, but I had never applied it before. After doing this project, I have learned how to analyze characters more in-depth. Earlier, I analyzed Alvy's personality is the city of New York. It allowed me to further a concept that I knew little about. Annie Hall touches on neurotic behaviors and its effect on relationships in a humorous manner. This movie represents New York and the people within the city. The romantic comedy touches on the reality of relationship and allows the viewer to see the unfolding of a relationship gone badly.

Neither of the main characters seems to have a well organized life, they come into view as lost and dependent of others. The characters will later grow to learn that all they need is love. This film illustrates the frenetic, high-speed lives of a woman and a man who can't move forward in life. The character Holly Golightly plays an interesting role as a gold-digging girl whose businesses are very questionable. The movie gives the understanding of her being a prostitute, yet the details of her sleeping with men for money is never declared. What are perfectly visible are her professional skills of manipulation. She seduces all kinds of rich men to get whatever she wants. She likes to build an image of herself as a sweet and innocent lost girl who needs a rich man to make all her wishes come true. One of the interesting points in this movie is that Holly always seems to get what she wants, mainly because of the decade this film is based on, the 1960's. This character understands happiness through money, thinking that love is just a cage and proclaiming herself as a free spirit. It looks like she needs to keep distracting herself from reality in order to fulfill her goal. The only person who she seems to care about is her younger brother, who later dies. His death allows us to see Holly's first real (and natural) reaction to what happens in her life. She builds a facade around herself changes her name, tries to belong to a place she is not used to, cuts all her relations with her past. In essence, she tries to forget who she is to become someone new. It seems like her self-esteem is high, but the truth is that she is unable to love herself; this is the reason why she does not believe in love. When she finally is able to accept who she really is, she becomes open to love. This movie presents New York City between WWII and The Great Society, where being hip and urban was reachable and attractive to the middle-class. It portrays the city as a beautiful and vibrant place where nothing but parties and other fun events happen. The film builds an impression of a magical city that only exists in our imagination. The opening scene shows exactly what to expect from Holly for most of the movie. It shows a beautiful Audrey Hepburn in a gorgeous black dress coming home after pulling an all-nighters. Her taxi stops right in front of the famous jewelry store Tiffany's, she walks towards the shop window drinking coffee and eating a croissant. Holly likes to keep her phone inside a suit case. This is part of showing how her life is upside down in so many levels and also a symbol of her not wanting to have to respond before anyone, not wanting to hear from anyone, not caring for anyone. It can also be considered as her way to state the fact that she is ready to leave at anytime. Holly's cat plays an important role during the film. The cat is a reflection of herself in many ways. She doesn't name it because she doesn't want it to belong to her, she thinks of that as caging the animal. However Cat starts to become its actual name. After realizing that she might be caging Cat, she sets it free. For a few moments it looks like Cat might be gone forever, but she hears it meowing and runs to get it back. This is a big symbol in the movie; like cat, she was lost and now is found. She picks her Cat up and kisses Paul. Also Cat and what it represents is present in the movie in many different ways. Holly wears a cat mask that she steals from a store and the book that Paul writes is called Nine Lives I have to say that to me, as soon as Holly and Paul met it was pretty obvious that they were going to fall in love. This movie, as any other romantic movie ever written, is divided in three structured, never changing elements.

And when the audience thinks that there is nothing else to do to save the relationship (nowadays every person in the world should know that is NOT the case) something marvelous happens and both characters fall in love with each other all over again. One of the aspects of this movie that have definitely surprised me the most is the infinite amount of little connections that one can make. It really impressed me how Holly's cat was a key for the movie, as stated before. After finding the importance of the cat I started wondering about any other connections that were found in this movie. The Cat lead me to wondering the meaning of the suitcase (she is ready to leave anytime), and the suitcase lead me to find the meaning of Holly's shoes. A few minutes into the movie Holly can't find her shoes, this has a deeper meaning. Holly is unable to move forward in life, unable to keep an order, to find her way.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 October 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Amélie is a film that gives us the receipt for a peculiar romance. It is filled with query humor and refreshing glimpse of isolation from reality. Amélie's physically and emotionally childhood lead her to an adulthood of loneliness and a lack of purpose. Unexpectedly she finds her life's calling. Through elaborate good deeds she finds herself a detached way to bring joy to others and herself. Finally she is force to abandon isolation and surrender to the vulnerability of love. Paris is an insightful locating for this film, it gives the viewer a foreshadowing of the happy ever after ending. However, it does not take any mystery away from the curves and bends of the plot. Paris is the city of romantic, but most of the film is shot inside of the confines of Amélie's apartment and the café she works at. Her physical and literal isolation are key elements to the tone of the film. Inside the confines of her apartments she finds Dominique Bretodeau box of treasures and sets out to help make other people happy, while unconsciously taking herself gradually out of isolation. Amélie's physically deprived childhood lead to her unusually disconnected nature, as well as her inability to function within the confines of common reality. Elements of the film demonstrate Amélie's reality compared to common reality. Common reality shows us what is plainly happening; Amélie sees Nino for the first time, the dreamlike world of the main character shows us the feeling of the scene, and the viewer can watch Amelia's heart glow and change in speed. A powerful object is the television, it is used as a window into her reality; it is a tool to show us how she is trapped, not only in physically isolation but also emotionally. Via the television she hears about the death of the princess, fantasies about how her death and hears the plea that pushes her to open her heart to Nino. One scene represents the fear Amélie has to be vulnerable, as she rides the spooky slow roller-coaster through the mass of things to find Nino, in his skeleton costume, sneaks up behind her. He lightly howls in her ear, she closers her eyes and let's go. Allowing herself to experience the thrill of the ride, the scene depicts the figurative nature of love. Mr. Dufayel seems to play a key figure in the plot, without him this movie would have continued on a frustrating path of the indecisive timid leading charter. The glass man, Mr. Dufayel, is the only person who recognizes Amélie's acquired good doer behaviors. He was also the only person to point out the crucial fact she was overlooking her own inadequacies. The glass man is a very interesting character in this film, he shares similar isolated tendencies much like Amélie's, however, his physical isolation is not made by his own choice. He's bone disorder keeps him isolated in his own home, however, he chooses to selectively distance himself from other people. Once he sees Amélie's similarities to himself he knows that it is vital to push her to pursue a more filling life than he himself has lead. Jean-Pierre Jeunet unexpected visual style added another layer to this film for me. I think it was very well shot, and the quirky characteristics of the main characters were made to live through the screen. I enjoyed the big close-ups of the main characters, this did a job of further confirming their emotions and feelings to the audience. Also I thought it was very refreshing when Amélie would break away from the narrative and talk directly to the camera. The writing was good; however, I think the numerous sub stories in the film make it a bit too long. The many other characters to enrich the plot, but I would have preferred under one hundred minutes. The films female lead centered storyline is unlike Hollywood writings, and has lead me to see I prefer this films style of writing much more than the latter. Romantic comedies all have happy endings, and Amélie is a romantic comedy that follows suit. One thing that makes it different is that is coils through the sub stories and gives us a very comprehensive view of the female lead before her love interest comes into the film. The main elements that I saw throughout this film that were being grouped together were people.

It is filled with query humor and refreshing glimpse of isolation from reality. Amélie's physically and emotionally childhood lead her to an adulthood of loneliness and a lack of purpose. Unexpectedly she finds her life's calling. Through elaborate good deeds she finds herself a detached way to bring joy to others and herself. Finally she is force to abandon isolation and surrender to the vulnerability of love. Paris is an insightful locating for this film, it gives the viewer a foreshadowing of the happy ever after ending. However, it does not take any mystery away from the curves and bends of the plot. Paris is the city of romantic, but most of the film is shot inside of the confines of Amélie's apartment and the café she works at. Her physical and literal isolation are key elements to the tone of the film. Inside the confines of her apartments she finds Dominique Bretodeau box of treasures and sets out to help make other people happy, while unconsciously taking herself gradually out of isolation. Amélie's physically deprived childhood lead to her unusually disconnected nature, as well as her inability to function within the confines of common reality. Elements of the film demonstrate Amélie's reality compared to common reality. Common reality shows us what is plainly happening; Amélie sees Nino for the first time, the dreamlike world of the main character shows us the feeling of the scene, and the viewer can watch Amelia's heart glow and change in speed. A powerful object is the television, it is used as a window into her reality; it is a tool to show us how she is trapped, not only in physically isolation but also emotionally. Via the television she hears about the death of the princess, fantasies about how her death and hears the plea that pushes her to open her heart to Nino. One scene represents the fear Amélie has to be vulnerable, as she rides the spooky slow roller-coaster through the mass of things to find Nino, in his skeleton costume, sneaks up behind her. He lightly howls in her ear, she closers her eyes and let's go. Allowing herself to experience the thrill of the ride, the scene depicts the figurative nature of love. Mr. Dufayel seems to play a key figure in the plot, without him this movie would have continued on a frustrating path of the indecisive timid leading charter. The glass man, Mr. Dufayel, is the only person who recognizes Amélie's acquired good doer behaviors. He was also the only person to point out the crucial fact she was overlooking her own inadequacies. The glass man is a very interesting character in this film, he shares similar isolated tendencies much like Amélie's, however, his physical isolation is not made by his own choice. He's bone disorder keeps him isolated in his own home, however, he chooses to selectively distance himself from other people. Once he sees Amélie's similarities to himself he knows that it is vital to push her to pursue a more filling life than he himself has lead. Jean-Pierre Jeunet unexpected visual style added another layer to this film for me. I think it was very well shot, and the quirky characteristics of the main characters were made to live through the screen. I enjoyed the big close-ups of the main characters, this did a job of further confirming their emotions and feelings to the audience. Also I thought it was very refreshing when Amélie would break away from the narrative and talk directly to the camera. The writing was good; however, I think the numerous sub stories in the film make it a bit too long. The many other characters to enrich the plot, but I would have preferred under one hundred minutes. The films female lead centered storyline is unlike Hollywood writings, and has lead me to see I prefer this films style of writing much more than the latter. Romantic comedies all have happy endings, and Amélie is a romantic comedy that follows suit. One thing that makes it different is that is coils through the sub stories and gives us a very comprehensive view of the female lead before her love interest comes into the film.

Devlin must trust Alicia as a partner and that she will do the task at hand. Then there is Alex who must also trust Alicia that she really loves him and won't go running back to Devlin. The most important item in this movie is the key. This small item represents so much more than what its purpose is intended for. It's so important because of the fact that it unlocks the secret they are looking for throughout the film. The film also has constant zooming in on the key to signify its importance. Once Alex knows Alicia has stolen the key he loses all trust in her and decides that she must die. This film has many scenes with alcohol in it and it's important to take notice of this. The characters, like Alicia, use it to escape from reality. After the trial, at the beginning, Alicia is shown at a party drinking away all her pain and trying to escape from reality. In some scenes alcohol is also meant to bring harm. The best example of this is when they find the uranium in the champagne bottles. The meaning behind this is that uranium is used to create bombs, which kill people. I learned the different camera angles showed the importance of certain scenes or how people viewed things. One example of how the camera angles showed a characters view is when Alicia wakes up after the party, Hitchcock gives you her point of view by showing everything upside down. An example of how Hitchcock uses the camera to show an items importance is when Alicia and Alex throw their party. The shot starts off on top of the stairs balcony and looks down to the crowd and starts to zoom in. As it zooms in more and more you realize its zooming in on Alicia but it keeps going till all you see is her hand behind her back and you are able to see in her hand she is holding the key that unlocks the wine cellar.Hitchcock uses light and dark colors to tell the moods of Alicia and Mrs. Sebastian. When the characters are wearing dark colors it represents the character feels trapped. When they are wearing light colors it represents they feel free. These two characters are usually wearing the opposite colors throughout the movie, since they are kind of like enemies. Lighting is also a major element used throughout this movie. Most the time Alicia and Alex are together is in darkness. Alicia is able to find safety in the darkness and represents her own world. Alex tries on many occasions to enter into it but is always rejected. The best example of this is the ending scene when Devlin gets Alicia into the car and Alex asks to come with and is denied. The best example that shows Alicia likes the darkness is when she goes to the CIA office during the day. She says the sun bothers her and wants the binds shut so it is dark in the room. Hitchcock has many scenes when the characters go from a light room to a dark room, or vise versa, and it's important to note this because the light changes how the characters interact with one another. An example of this is when Devlin and Alicia leave the wine cellar, a light room, and go outside into the darkness. Alex shows up and spots then outside right when Devlin tells Alicia to kiss him. This film zooms in twice on a cup of coffee that Alicia is drinking. The first time it is full and the second it is empty. After the second zoom in on the cup Alicia realizes she drank poison. From this point on it makes you conclude that she is going to die. Once she finishes her cup of coffee Alex and his mother appear as blurry shadow figures. Another time two shadow figures appear is at the very end. This is when Alicia and Devlin leave in the car and Alex turns to the house and his two business partners are standing in the doorway waiting for him to face his fate. I felt Ingrid Bergman, who plays Alicia Huberman, did a great job. This film depended a lot on facial expressions because of close shots on characters faces. She did a great job of getting the right expression at the right scene and made the movie much more enjoyable. The best example of this is when she realizes she drank poison and then there is a zoom in on her face. Her expression made it even more believable and showed that she knew what happened to her.

It was suppose to be an escape from the life they have been dealing with, as well as a chance to bring change for them. In the beginning of the movie they bring up Bolivia as the place to be, which leads to the conclusion that they will end up there at some point. When they finally reach their dream place it's not what they expected it to be, in reality the country is poor and run down. After all they been through Bolivia turns out to be another obstacle they must overcome. At first Bolivia acts as an escape for them and is a change. It's clear that Bolivia is an escape since it throws the posse, which is after them. The problem is that the change they get is that they are foreigners and stand out. All their plans they had are slowed down because they have to learn the native language, Spanish, in order to do business. Bolivia also brings change to Sundance's attitude once they get there. This is easy to see from the point they arrive in Bolivia till the end of the movie. He develops an on edge attitude, which he is easier to set off. Bolivia becomes the end of their dream since their adventures end here. An important item to take note of is the white straw hat that is always worn by Joe Lefors, the best lawman around. This hat represents the law which they are running from throughout the movie; they are never able to outrun the law. When in America the posse is after them then in Bolivia they are chased by officers there. Weather they are in American or Bolivia the hat is still present. This hat also brings fear to Butch and Sundance. An example of this is when they are in Bolivia they see the hat and are instantly scared and leave the restaurant they are at. There are two pivotal points in the movie. The first one is when Butch and Sundance go to Sheriff Bledsoe in order to join the war. Then the second is when Butch and Sundance get into a gunfight with the Mexican outlaws. Each of these scenes is similar in a number of ways. In both of these scenes Butch and Sundance use it as a way to go straight, or become the good guys. The first scene they try to join the war because they feel it's a way to become the good guys. Then in the second scene they feel by carrying out their contract they are now the good guys and even say they have gone straight. Another way these scenes are similar is because they try to escape the posse after them. By joining the war they feel the posse won't come after them because they will be fighting for the country. Then when they kill the outlaws they feel the posse can no longer come after them since they have changed their ways. When Butch and Sundance decide to run to Bolivia they ask Etta if she wants to join. She accepted their offer on one condition which she said she was not going to stay around and watch them die. This becomes a notable part of the movie. Later on in Bolivia Etta, for no good reason, decides that she wants to head back to America. If you put these two elements together you can tell that trouble is going to happen. After she is gone Butch and Sundance end up in a shootout and are killed, which Etta predicted since she left them. This movie was all about teamwork and how far it could get you. Throughout the whole movie Butch and Sundance worked together in order to escape many dangerous situations and see things they never thought possible. Although in the end the numbers game worked against them but they went down as a team. I learned that this movie was based on actual characters. The events that took place in the movie were loosely based on the real lives of Butch and Sundance. Some of the events that did happen in the movie actually took place but it may not have been as dramatic like the film. The ending scene was not historically correct because the bodies in that shootout were never identified. The name of their gang in the movie was not the name they went by in real life.I feel Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who played Butch and Sundance, had a really good chemistry during this film. Their chemistry really made them a great pair for this film. These two were friends in real life which makes it understandable of why they were picked for these parts together. All throughout the movie the chemistry makes the movie flow and it can easily been seen that they truly carried this film. Without that great chemistry between these two then this film would probably not of been as good.

When Butch and Sundance decide to run to Bolivia they ask Etta if she wants to join. She accepted their offer on one condition which she said she was not going to stay around and watch them die. This becomes a notable part of the movie. Later on in Bolivia Etta, for no good reason, decides that she wants to head back to America. If you put these two elements together you can tell that trouble is going to happen. After she is gone Butch and Sundance end up in a shootout and are killed, which Etta predicted since she left them. This movie was all about teamwork and how far it could get you. Throughout the whole movie Butch and Sundance worked together in order to escape many dangerous situations and see things they never thought possible. Although in the end the numbers game worked against them but they went down as a team. I learned that this movie was based on actual characters. The events that took place in the movie were loosely based on the real lives of Butch and Sundance. Some of the events that did happen in the movie actually took place but it may not have been as dramatic like the film. The ending scene was not historically correct because the bodies in that shootout were never identified. The name of their gang in the movie was not the name they went by in real life.I feel Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who played Butch and Sundance, had a really good chemistry during this film. Their chemistry really made them a great pair for this film. These two were friends in real life which makes it understandable of why they were picked for these parts together. All throughout the movie the chemistry makes the movie flow and it can easily been seen that they truly carried this film. Without that great chemistry between these two then this film would probably not of been as good.

It portrays a young, charming woman named Holly, who meets her new, handsome neighbor, Paul. This timeless tale of a flighty girl who meets a boy, girl and boy fall in love, boy and girl squabble, and ends with the inevitable girl and boy live happily ever after, is acted out marvelously by Audrey Hepburn (Holly) and George Peppard (Paul). This fairy-tale-like film is chock-full of powerful symbolism. The youthful socialite, Holly, owns a yellow-orange alley cat that is nameless. She refuses to name the cat for the reason being that she believes the playful feline does not belong to her. This unwillingness to name the cat represents her refusal to settle down. To reinforce the idea of her unwillingness to settle down, the audience learns that Holly (formally Lula Mae) once was married and had a family. She could not fully be happy living the average family life, so she dashed off to New York City, leaving her family behind. An obvious symbol in the movie given the title of the film is the jewelry store, Tiffany's. This extravagant building is the place Holly goes to break away from the pressures of her life; it is her safe haven. As Batman had his underground lair, Holly has her New York City jewelry store. Holly has to learn to let Tiffany's go, as she cannot hide there any longer. Another symbol is Holly's reoccurring use of her dark sunglasses to hide her eyes. The sunglasses represent the idea that Holly is afraid to get too close to others. The shades are a physical way in which she can block the outside world&#x97;like a mask. The idea of a mask is seen once again when Paul and Holly steal masks from a local store in the city. Both Holly and Paul live under the thumb of others. They shape their personalities around who they believe others want them to be. Holly falls under the wing of O. J. Berman, her agent, when she arrives in New York. Berman teaches her to ditch her country accent and start dressing in the latest designer clothes. Because Holly begins dating José, a South American millionaire, she reads books about South America and changes her apartment to reflect the culture of José's southern continent. This means that she bends her personality to fit in with who she believes she is supposed to be. In present day America, I feel as if almost all adolescent s or young adults do this before finding a place or identity in the world. Paul has the same temperament as Holly. In the beginning of the film, he is under the influence of his designer and older mistress. He follows her command. Both Holly and Paul gradually learn to be themselves and to let others 'opinions not affect them. Because the pivotal scenes happen in the early hours of the morning, the audience can sense the film will more than likely have a feel-good ending. Having the prominent scenes transpire in the bright-sunshiny morning allows the characters to have the rest of the day to work out the problems that troubled them in the morning. This classic romantic film does not just pull the audience in to the storyline, but hauls, shoves, and drags. The exceptional performances by Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard help construct the feeling that this film is a modern day 1960's fairy-tale in the Big City. Perhaps I am just a sucker for romance films. Before watching Breakfast at Tiffany's, I knew it is common to pretend to be someone else to fit in. Being a socialite, Holly bends her personality to have others accept her as one of their own. As the film progresses, she learns that being herself will help her find true happiness. As Fiona in the film Shrek learns that being an ogre, her true identity, will land her the man she will be happy with, Holly learns the same lesson in Breakfast at Tiffany's. I believe this film will allow the audience to come to the same conclusion; being yourself is the best way to go.

The library is an important aspect in the setting of this movie, because it provides a parallel with the dialogue. The script of this movie is heavily laden with dialogue and the spoken story of each character, similar to the books, writing, and words that fill the library shelves. Another important aspect of the library is the quiet nature of the space, putting the focus entirely on the characters and their issues. With no other noise or distractions, the central focus of the film is clear.An important character to consider that is often overlooked is the assistant principal, Richard Vernon. Throughout the film he is portrayed as a villain of sorts, out to get the group of students being punished that particular Saturday. Completely unable to relate to his students or any of their situations, he only sees what is on the surface. It is pointed out by the janitor later on in the plot that while Vernon assumes the students are the problem in his lack of understanding the new generation, he never bothered to look closer and realize it was he who had changed. This plays a major role in the overall theme of the movie, which is the inability to see past the surface of a problem or character and judge solely by a look.A pivotal scene for the five students locked away in detention is the group discussion they have about why they came to Saturday detention. Although it is obvious that it is pivotal because they are opening up, but it is also pivotal in the mood of the film as well. Before this scene, many, if not all, of the interactions between the characters were cold and isolated, making the movie seem tense. As the characters begin to open up, the feel of the movie transitions to an easier, lighthearted feel that pulls the audience in to the escapades that begin to occur. Not only has it changed the relationship between the characters, but it changes the mood of the rest of the movie.The lunches that each character eats are representative of each of their respective parents. Claire eats a fancier meal than the rest, Andy's food is loaded with carbohydrates and calories, Brian's lunch consists of a crust-less peanut butter and jelly sandwich, Allison's bologna (which she discards to replace with candy), and Bender, who has no lunch. Each meal represents the parenting style of each teenager, such as Allison's discarding of part of her sandwich signifies the way they ignore her, giving her the freedom to do whatever she wants. The writing in this movie is realistic and plausible, seeing as it is an everyday occurrence for us to judge others solely by what is on the outside. The slow reveal of the inner struggles and personal demons of each of the characters is realistic, coming slowly and in pieces, each filled with emotion. It is obvious that many of the characters do not wish to open up, which is very typical of someone dealing with their own issues. The inserted lines of dry and sarcastic humor lighten the mood when it is necessary, just as some situations require and easily remind us that they still are, in fact, teenagers. The writing is very symbolic of the things that can happen to every day high school students, although perhaps not as extreme, it serves as a guide for those moments that we all have had some sort of experience with.An aspect of grouping in this movie is shown by the colors of the characters. Red for Bender, blue for Andy, pink for Claire, green for Brian, and black for Allison. These colors play into the stereotypes that they are portraying, further signifying the outer appearance contradiction that the characters struggle with. A smaller grouping is the group of teenagers, and the adults. The stark contrast between the two age groups, both physically separated and emotionally, magnifies the generation gap and the lack of ability to understand one another.The aspect of judgment plays a large role, especially in the beginning where each character has made specific judgments against their peers. Applying that to the whole, judgment becomes the main theme that motivates them as characters, as well as how easily judgments can be changed. In watching this, I see media messages that have changed over the years. The message that this film delivers is one that can be forgotten easily, but this movie is a nostalgic reminder to never judge a book by its cover.John Hughes was the king of successful movies in the 1980's, with this movie being at the forefront of his laundry list of hit films. Seeing as how many movies were based off this movie and others like it, The Breakfast Club is a teen drama that has become the stereotypical teen drama. The storytelling techniques, such as the ability to show the progression of these characters in a single day, and revealing character complexity is something seen even recently, in shows like Community.The storytelling technique used by this movie was a unique choice, one that is not often seen. It is easy to forget that sometimes and entire story can happen in just a matter of hours in your life, not over a long span of time. This technique is adding to my ability to comprehend the realistic nature of cinematic storytelling by proving that you do not need to show weeks or month of passing time to have a story with impact.The Breakfast Club uses its title to emphasize the reason why it is so important not to judge something strictly by what you see.

This movie to me depicts everything that you hope does not happen when you get on a plane. With this movie taking place in the airport and on the plane I think the director based this movie solely so that if you were already afraid to get on a plane you now will do anything in your power to stay off of them.This movie is one of the greatest comedy\/spoof movies I have ever watched. I had never even heard of it before I had to watch it for class and now I can not stop talking about it! No, it doesn't have the sad love story or the crazy action scenes, but it keeps you laughing all the way through. The one liners and spoofs do not stop from the time the opening credits begin till the movie ends. I really give credit to the writers because I feel that this is what made other movies come to existence. Without this movie I doubt we would have ever watched movies like Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie.The main character in this film is a man by the name of Ted Striker. Mr. Striker is a man that you see cry over and over again to people, which shows he is weak, but it all had to do with the love of his life and in the end he will do anything for her! It really shows us how strong love can be. The man does have some major problems though, and like already stated they all start when he doesn't want his relationship with his love to end. He not only tries to save his love life by getting a ticket on her plane that she is the steward on, but he ends up being the only one that can fly the plane when the problem arises. This movie is pure comedy, but the directors do show us what happens if you do not give up and get over your fears. I think this is the one real life thing you can get out of this movie.Airplane really showed the craziness and diversity that hops on planes everyday. I have flown many times myself and the diversity you find on a plane is crazy. In the movie there were a mom and her sick daughter, two African-American males that jived, a couple of old ladies, and the stewards. Like I've already said this movie was hilarious and without these people we wouldn't have had all of the laughs. I also like the scene changes from the cockpit to the control room at the airport. This gave us part of the storyline, while also giving us an insight of the craziness going on in both of them we would not have seen otherwise. It really cracked me up to hear one of the men talking about it being a bad day to quit smoking cigarettes, while the other man has to take amphetamines to get through the night.This film has definitely taught me to not be so eager to jump on a plane. Yes, this film is so far fetched, but I guess you never know when your pilots will eat bad fish! I'm also not so sure there could be so many problems going on in a plane and it actually land without everyone dying! I guess when you have a man that overcomes his fear and is determined to save every ones life miracles can happen! Overall, I love this movie because these are all real life scenarios that could occur, but with a little added spice to make you laugh all the way through! OK, Maybe they are not all real life scenarios!

This movie to me depicts everything that you hope does not happen when you get on a plane. With this movie taking place in the airport and on the plane I think the director based this movie solely so that if you were already afraid to get on a plane you now will do anything in your power to stay off of them.This movie is one of the greatest comedy\/spoof movies I have ever watched. I had never even heard of it before I had to watch it for class and now I can not stop talking about it! No, it doesn't have the sad love story or the crazy action scenes, but it keeps you laughing all the way through. The one liners and spoofs do not stop from the time the opening credits begin till the movie ends. I really give credit to the writers because I feel that this is what made other movies come to existence. Without this movie I doubt we would have ever watched movies like Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie.The main character in this film is a man by the name of Ted Striker. Mr. Striker is a man that you see cry over and over again to people, which shows he is weak, but it all had to do with the love of his life and in the end he will do anything for her! It really shows us how strong love can be. The man does have some major problems though, and like already stated they all start when he doesn't want his relationship with his love to end. He not only tries to save his love life by getting a ticket on her plane that she is the steward on, but he ends up being the only one that can fly the plane when the problem arises. This movie is pure comedy, but the directors do show us what happens if you do not give up and get over your fears. I think this is the one real life thing you can get out of this movie.Airplane really showed the craziness and diversity that hops on planes everyday. I have flown many times myself and the diversity you find on a plane is crazy. In the movie there were a mom and her sick daughter, two African-American males that jived, a couple of old ladies, and the stewards. Like I've already said this movie was hilarious and without these people we wouldn't have had all of the laughs. I also like the scene changes from the cockpit to the control room at the airport. This gave us part of the storyline, while also giving us an insight of the craziness going on in both of them we would not have seen otherwise. It really cracked me up to hear one of the men talking about it being a bad day to quit smoking cigarettes, while the other man has to take amphetamines to get through the night.This film has definitely taught me to not be so eager to jump on a plane.

A long travel in space and landing on an unknown planet is quite surreal; the addition of an alien being wanted on earth is unimaginable. The author did well incorporating both a scary side with abnormal. The nature and setting of the movie was ideal in creating the fear. This crew of 7 people returning back to earth in their spaceship happens to stop on another planet. In principle, their stop was supposedly to check out what was an SOS signal however, it was planned by the organization that sent them out; as they were in search of an indestructible alien. Firstly, I believe that the limited setting managed to keep the viewers on their toes. Because they landed on an extremely dark planet with limited lighting, we were in suspense wondering what could pop out at anytime. In horror movies, the daylight means respite from any dangerous attacks however with the constant darkness, there was no hiding from danger. The characters curiosity also plays a part. Despite almost being obliged to explore the planet, they felt the need to go explore the spaceship. Plus, Dallas and Ash were okay keeping the alien on board to examine it. This keeps the suspense because they need to find out extra on an unknown planet. Thus we never knew what to expect except for something sinister. Knowing that the humans were solely in the spaceship meant that the alien could have popped out of anywhere whether they expected it or not. Meaning they had nowhere to run. To be effectively scary, the rotation of sinister sounds and silence has to be perfect. I believe the silence in this movie was at times over-exaggerated. The movie starts off with lots of silence till we find the crew who are all inside that cabin. At the same time, when the alien comes into action, things become more interesting. The sounds make us guess when the alien will strike - the different moments of silence and sounds keep you edgy. You think the alien will strike then some seconds later you don't. I think the way the crew members communicate also builds up to the death of most of the crew members. There is some negative communication amongst the members. Examples are breaking of the quarantine rules. Their lack of trust in one another leaves the viewers haggling over who to believe and who to be suspicious of. We also make up our minds about who will be first to get killed because of their active or inactive parts in the movie. I did not see Ash getting killed by the alien because he seemed relaxed and almost happy to have it on-board; at the same time, I saw Brett getting killed because he barely said a thing. The roles played defined who got killed and who survived longer. I think the background sounds were orchestras playing. Sometimes, the strings (violin) seemed to be the more obvious sounds but they mostly sound like symphonies. These somber noises are to create the scary atmosphere. In between the long silences, you hear a lot of those sounds. Even before the alien came into the fold, there were those sounds. However, around the moment Ripley defeats the alien, we get the integration of softer music. Obviously, after she rids herself of the alien, the soft music keeps going. This changes the mood from the usual scary suspense to victory. Along with the soft sounds, Ripley is dressed in all white when she kills the alien. The movie is extremely dark all the way through but around the time she will be victorious, she puts on the spacesuit. To also kill it with a sort of white blast is interesting. We see the integration of the white when she wins. The only other person who wore white was Ash but we found out that he was a bad guy. I believe the white signified hero in Ripley's case but it also pointed out that Ash was not a good guy because everyone was dressed in more tattered clothes with darker colors. This guy was out of the ordinary. I believe the movie drags on. It takes an hour of the movie to get the alien fully grown and causing terror inside the space shuttle. This results in a limit of action. In reality, there were not many moments of fright except for when the alien was going to strike. To better the situation, the characters could have encountered the alien then managed to escape. The lack of talk also adds to that so the movie is kind of boring to a certain extent. There is not really much to look forward to. However, when the alien did come into play, I easily misjudged who the main character was. I saw Ash dying because of his negativity however I thought Dallas would be the last man standing. He was quite brave and the fact that he went after the alien but there was no blood or a body after he met with the creature, I expected him to suddenly re-appear. That would be a classic situation in a suspense movie when someone we thought was dead suddenly comes back into the story and ends up being the hero. Finally, I believe that the cat, Jones was almost a symbol of death. We do not see the cat till when they start looking for the alien inside the spaceship. When Brett had to chase it down because it escaped, he was the first to get killed by the alien. Around the end, when Ripley has the cat in her arms, Parker and Lambert get killed. Finally, when they enter the shuttle after blowing up the spaceship, the cat gets placed in its little shelter. Then the alien suddenly is in the shuttle too. However, her being the sole survivor left meant that she managed to rid herself of the creature.

This is all done when he is asked by God to search for the Holy Grail during this dark time in hope it can bring happiness to all the people of Britain. In the movie the forest plays a pivotal role because most of the scenes, especially the important scenes take place in the woods. What makes this different is that when most of the trouble happens dark in the woods there it is always foggy. The fog gives the movie the suspense, not knowing where someone or something is around a person when it could be very close.When it comes to King Arthur and the writing of the film, I believe that it is good writing. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but for the role of King Arthur was played perfectly because he stood as a man of integrity, bravery and as a man for his people. He was doing the right things to acquire the Holy Grail, it just so happens they run into some shenanigans along the way. There are some things in the move than were similar and can be grouped together. There were parts in the movie that came in pairs or that can be grouped together. At the beginning King Arthur was trying to find knights to join his Round Table and they arrived at a castle. Later on there were two separate scenes with the French taunting. Also when King Arthur found his Knights of The Round Table they each so happened to get a servant to follow them around. When they all split up to look for the Holy Grail, along their ways each one of them encountered some kind of peril in a dense forest with a lot of fog, that add to the suspense with what was going on with each of them.From watching medieval movies in the past I kind of knew what to expect, but when I watched this and realized it was a comedy it changed my mind. From watching movies and from classes I knew that King Arthur is really important back in the medieval era. I knew the bravery he had and how he wanted to make Britain a great place for him and his people.

From looking at this movie from a different angle I've noticed things I have never seen before.This movie takes on a comedic tale of King Arthur and his men go on a quest for the Holy Grail. Battling mythological creatures, black knights, and bridge keepers along the way, King Arthur might bite off more than he can chew in this comedic adventure.

She begins to realize that to find who she really is she has to give up Tiffany's. The producers of Breakfast at Tiffany's use the time of day to show when the emotions of the individuals will change. In many of the morning scenes, you get a sense that something good is happening. The characters' inviting moods make it easier for me to get really involved with the exciting activity. I am able to connect more with the exciting memories in the morning because people have more of an excitement for the day because I think that the day just started and a new day is a new beginning. In the film when Holly tells Paul she is moving to Brazil to start her new life, she tells him before breakfast. In the night scenes, the cops were threatened to be called and were called. To many people, this action would be considered a bad event. The actor, Audrey Hepburn, does a wonderful job playing the part of Holly Golightly. She is able to really connect with the audience by showing how Holly is longing to be a part of a group. I am able to connect with her because while going through my life I will go through multiple groups of friends and live in different locations that will suit my personality the best. When watching the film, you feel that the actor is really living their life and I did not get a feeling that she was just trying to portray a character. Holly and Paul have the same types of personality; they are both lost trying to find themselves and they go through many groups of friends. Holly goes from living in Texas to California to New York in search for her identity. Paul is the writer who is being paid by a cougar even though he feels as if he is being pulled in the opposite direction of where he really wants to go. They both are being surrounded by many people but still have a feeling of being completely alone. You can get a sense that Holly is escaping from the current reality and moving to find herself, when she uses the stairwell outside her window. I feel when Holly goes through the window to Paul's room, she finally relaxes and begins to see who she really would like to become. When she goes back down to her room, I think she gets a frigid feeling; she does not seem to be as relaxed and she seems like she has to be in a constant rush to do the next thing. The other matching personalities are with Sally Tomato and Paul's friends. Both characters are helping support individuals in exchange for the company. Sally Tomato hires Holly to come and keep him company at Sing Sing. Paul's friend pays him whenever she comes over. Both of the individuals have a type of second life with the people they help financially. They feel as if they have a connection with these individuals and a sense of completion. Holly and Paul show the typical boy and girl love story. They have the normal arguments and laughs. They are able to understand each other's wants and needs and are even able look deep into each other to find themselves. With their first meeting, when he wants to use her telephone, you can feel the connection and the spark. When he looks at her, you feel that urge to get to know her more because she is not what he normally finds. You are able to feel the struggle between them to actually give each other the chance and lose their old identities. I just noticed a pattern that many of the parties and events in the film included smoking and drinking. Just from these few ideas in the events, I am able to assume that living in New York City would consist of parties and smoking with large groups of people. I am also able to assume that the individuals maintain more of a care free spirit.

She is able to really connect with the audience by showing how Holly is longing to be a part of a group. I am able to connect with her because while going through my life I will go through multiple groups of friends and live in different locations that will suit my personality the best. When watching the film, you feel that the actor is really living their life and I did not get a feeling that she was just trying to portray a character. Holly and Paul have the same types of personality; they are both lost trying to find themselves and they go through many groups of friends. Holly goes from living in Texas to California to New York in search for her identity. Paul is the writer who is being paid by a cougar even though he feels as if he is being pulled in the opposite direction of where he really wants to go. They both are being surrounded by many people but still have a feeling of being completely alone. You can get a sense that Holly is escaping from the current reality and moving to find herself, when she uses the stairwell outside her window. I feel when Holly goes through the window to Paul's room, she finally relaxes and begins to see who she really would like to become. When she goes back down to her room, I think she gets a frigid feeling; she does not seem to be as relaxed and she seems like she has to be in a constant rush to do the next thing. The other matching personalities are with Sally Tomato and Paul's friends. Both characters are helping support individuals in exchange for the company. Sally Tomato hires Holly to come and keep him company at Sing Sing. Paul's friend pays him whenever she comes over. Both of the individuals have a type of second life with the people they help financially. They feel as if they have a connection with these individuals and a sense of completion. Holly and Paul show the typical boy and girl love story. They have the normal arguments and laughs. They are able to understand each other's wants and needs and are even able look deep into each other to find themselves. With their first meeting, when he wants to use her telephone, you can feel the connection and the spark. When he looks at her, you feel that urge to get to know her more because she is not what he normally finds. You are able to feel the struggle between them to actually give each other the chance and lose their old identities. I just noticed a pattern that many of the parties and events in the film included smoking and drinking. Just from these few ideas in the events, I am able to assume that living in New York City would consist of parties and smoking with large groups of people. I am also able to assume that the individuals maintain more of a care free spirit.

She begins to realize that to find who she really is she has to give up Tiffany's. The producers of Breakfast at Tiffany's use the time of day to show when the emotions of the individuals will change. In many of the morning scenes, you get a sense that something good is happening. The characters' inviting moods make it easier for me to get really involved with the exciting activity. I am able to connect more with the exciting memories in the morning because people have more of an excitement for the day because I think that the day just started and a new day is a new beginning.

It's a horror movie with some imagination with the inclusion of the dead and a house with spirits. Unlike most horror movies, this movie has lots of bright colors and family togetherness. It is a horror movie without gory scenes.The definition of Poltergeist is a ghost or spirit which makes noises and in this movie, the spirits of the dead in the house were making noises. We get straight into action with a TV left on and the little girl talks with it. Although we go through an introduction after that scene, we know that the TV will play a big part throughout. It's further symbolized by the father removing the TV from the motel room. The TV is symbolic as it starts the trouble in the house. The TV keeps getting focused on &#x96; firstly the channel with no images then the men watching football. However, the interesting part is that the channel with no images is the origin of the spirits. The author uses that as if it was an area where those spirits could settle. Since the family members left the TV on, it was an invitation for those spirits to come into the house. An anthem is very symbolic but I think that it is used to symbolize danger. Grown-ups pay their respects to the anthem but here it is a call to the little girl that the TV people are coming.The two young kids notice the danger. Carol-Ann is the lead to the strange actions behind the TV then Robbie declares his fear for the tree which eventually attacks him. The children represent the force behind both the family's fight against the spirits as well as they are the start of the troubles. The little girl however is the innocent hero. Despite her lack of knowledge, everything revolves around her. She talks to the TV, always wants the closet light left on, then she gets sucked into the closet. When she gets rescued, she does not remember anything. This was taking away from the cliché of horror movies where the heroes are the older ones.There aren't powerful, sinister sounds in the movie. There's a mix of soft sinister sounds and peaceful sounds. However, there is a major use of shadows. We were shown the shadow of the door knob when they were finally about to open the door to get the girl. The shadows were a different way to create shadiness. Also, the lightning creates shadows. Normally, the storms signify an attack from someone and you will have the girl running from the danger. Instead, the characters embrace the effect of the storms and Robbie is even told to count the time between the roars of the thunder. The roars seem to hear him count and keep going a second later than the last one. Finally, to create more fear, they used the little girl screaming in the background. This is not the ideal method but it is disturbing when there is a little girl in the back screaming for her mother. This gets the viewers emotionally involved because they feel sorry for the helpless\/defenseless girl. As mentioned, the youngest seem to be the main characters and since it is unusual for children to be attacked and to be directly involved with the horror, it gets us emotionally involved in the movie and we feel sorry and worried for the kids.Despite the mother being able to communicate with her daughter at night and the storms only taking place at night, there is a lot of white in the movie. The closet light is white, the ghosts show up in white when they leave the room, they attach themselves to the white walls. The bright color is a sign of innocence. It shows the little girls' innocence in the movie as she has no idea what is happening. I believe that the family is extremely innocent and clueless about the house being built over a cemetery. However, the man who knew about the cemetery being moved is shown only twice and he is not dressed in any bright colors. The ladies who come and try to help out with rescuing Carol-Ann are not dressed in white either.The movie is very systematic and well built. Firstly there is the TV and the strange movements of the furniture in the house. Then the girl disappears. When we are all trying to figure out why these things are happening to the house we find out that it was built over a cemetery. Towards the end when we think that Carol-Ann has been rescued and nothing else could go wrong, the house ends up vanishing. Everything built from one thing to another so there were smooth transitions. The movie started off with normal talking then when the spirits settle in, they started whispering to communicate. When the daughter is about to get saved, the characters are yelling at the top of their voices to communicate between each other. In the end it gets back to normal talking. This is different because with the whispers, anything sudden could happen but when they are yelling to communicate then they are almost ready for the final showdown and ready for battle.Normally, you would expect the mother to be worried over her lost child but instead she is relaxed and it's the father suffering the most from losing his daughter. Bravery is a theme of the movie. They stick together to pull through the tough times. Towards the end, the father is not at home and they suffer one more attack, the mother grabs Robbie who grabs Carol Ann, this chain shows the family strength.

Music or the misery, which came first? and did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or am I miserable because I listened to pop music. This is a very alarming statement, many of us tend to find comfort in music which allows for a sense of self soothing.

We then go on this self loathing experience of always me mentality that leads us to learn more about this character and his obsession with making Top 5 Lists that are ongoing over the course of the film. Rob blames all of these women for ripping his heart out and stomping on it, when in high school its actually Rob who broke penny's heart. In what one can assume is chemistry class, Rob's lab partner tells him that he had sex with Penny after three days. An explosion happens as a result of the chemical reactants which conveys the anger and frustration and the mixed emotions Rob is feeling inside. After Rob's break up with Laura he decides to go on a journey to talk to his old girlfriends and find out what he did wrong to end their relationship.

He then compares his breakup with Charlie to how some people never got over 'Nam in the fact that after the break up he was scared for life and never really wanted to date again. He had a traumatic experience that sticks with him and changes his views and ideas on the world. Throughout his relationship with Charlie, Rob is very hard on himself and doesn't think he is good enough to be with a girl like her, which many of us can relate in our dating experiences.

Thankfully this thing offers up an all-star cast including some legends because without them this film would be nearly impossible to get through. Clocking in just under two-hours, the film feels twice as long and I think a lot of the blame has to go to director Mark L. Lester. His direction is all over the place and not for a second did I feel any tension in the story and I also thought the pacing was pretty bad. I will say that not all of this might be his fault because the screenplay itself has a fair number of problems.

Is it trying to be some sort of hard, negative look at the government and their powers?

The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think This Means War, Twilight, 10 Things I Hate about You) but The Philadelphia Story did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fiancée. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in Mean Girls. In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in The Philadelphia Story, alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

Spike Lee's 1989 work, Do The Right Thing, rightly follows this pattern. The movie utilizes the time frame of one complete day in order to illustrate the constant, repetitive struggle for balance that minorities experience between fighting for equality and harmonizing with society. The opening scene of Rosie Perez dancing in an alley and dressed in boxing gear to the song Fight The Power by Public Enemy indicates that the movie has a particular focus upon the oppression of people of color via authority. Local radio DJ, Mister Señor Love Daddy, announces that morning that the color of the day is black because it absorbs so much heat. This statement is indicative of the intense fire that blacks are subject to from American society, as well as revealing that blacks would be the focus of the film. In the first scene including Sal's pizzeria, Pino refers to Mookie as an azupep, translated from Italian as meaning eggplant. This word was used as a racial slur in Italy towards Sicilians because they had a darker, deeper skin complexion. Ironically, Vito himself is a dark-skinned Italian. This scene illustrates the sheer stupidity of exhibiting racism in America. Even when two people's ancestries differ from the country they reside in, it is common for one to demean and ridicule the other's heritage. There are many instances of this phenomena throughout the movie when Rosie (Latino), Da Mayar (black), and Sonny (Korean) all fire racial slurs towards one another. However, the Korean store owner, Sonny, recognizes this just in time for his store to be spared from the mob. He exclaims to the crowd, I no white! I black! You, me, same!. This line illustrates that in actuality, minorities in America share the same struggles and have more similarities than differences. In the film, characters Mookie and Vito are written similarly. They both try to avoid confrontation in general, Mookie with his outspoken girlfriend and Vito with his aggressive brother, Pino. In addition, both men avoid the pressure of only having same-race relations, Mookie by having a Latino girlfriend and Vito by having a strong friendship with Mookie. Both men also show their self-control by initially refusing to participate in a riot with such personal aspects, Vito's connection being his father's building and Mookie's connection being fellow people of color in an uprising. Though nearly every character exhibits racism at one point, they also have loving relationships outside of that aspect. Though the police officers unjustly kill Radio Raheem, they still do, in fact, make a sacrifice every day by committing to their dangerous profession. Sal passionately elaborates that he built the family pizzeria with his bare hands and hopes to give it to his sons one day. It's also implied that Sal has romantic feelings for Mookie's black sister. Even prejudice and bitter Sonny is seen running the store with his wife, who he presumably loves very much. Piecing these elements together illustrates that though the characters are racist, racism is a complex element that does not encompass and define a person's entire being. There are many elements in the film that directly clash the principles of violence and non-violence. It is first seen towards the beginning of the film, when Smiley is selling pictures of Martin Luther King Junior and Malcom X, one Civil Rights leader opposed to violence and one unopposed to violence. The principles clash again in personalities as Mookie consistently tries to keep the peace and Buggin' Out is outwardly confrontational, as his name suggests. The opposition is blatantly seen as the brass LOVE and HATE rings Radio Raheem wears on his right and left knuckles, respectively. Radio Raheem falls dead with his left hand down and his right hand being captured in the shot, illustrating Raheem's previously spoken concept that hate has the ability to die, while love is forever. Following Raheem's death, Buggin' Out proceeds to tell the police officers, I'm a black man! You can't kill us all!.

This sounds a grand plan and mostly works, it being quite clear when a new era has been started, with Fiennes narrating a cross-over sort of stitching of stories, aided by newsreel to help us place it, time-wise.Probably Hungary's most successful director, István Szabó has used English here, whereas two of his previous films that follow many of the themes explored here that I have seen and own, are in Hungarian the Oscar winning (Foreign Language) Mephisto and later Colonel Redl. These starred the Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer in brilliant and memorable performances.However, especially when comparing to the earlier Brandauer films, this structure is its slight undoing. However hard Fiennes tries - and he is forced into some quite nasty, humiliating scenes, he is never on the levels attained by Brandauer. This time-frame structure also makes the three hour run-time slacken, the film lacks the urgency and tightness of the Hungarian films and whilst in English, with some familiar faces, it lacks the authenticity, too. However, at least having all the cast speaking the same 'region-free' English dialogue means it is not jarred by a sudden American one, which would spoil it, a bit.However, the story remains an interesting one and the mood and feel never less than authentically and superbly realised, whilst handsome use of locations such as Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Budapest make for a visual feast. I've now just seen the film for the third time.If you're expecting a nice, twee and gentle period drama, leave this one well alone - Szabó has always gone for realism - often graphically. Expect torture, nudity and very strong language - it all fits in and is never gratuitous but this does mean it's not one for Sunday afternoon with grandma and the kids.I would also definitely recommend the two Hungarian Szabó's that I mention - Mephisto is easier to buy and is critically very admired. Colonel Redl I had to buy as a Korean import but that is a good transfer at a good price, if you can find an outlet. ","genre":"Drama, History, Romance"}]
