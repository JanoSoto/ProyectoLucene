Down here in Australia it is actually banned (which is ludicrous) and the majority of horror buffs haven't been able to see it (not everyone imports).What bothers me is that the rest of the world spits and curses all over this film. Why? They say it shows us what the original only lets us imagine..... so what? Didnt most of you see the original for the first time expecting to see the violence?Yes, yes, I agree that the absense of blood and gore in the original was it's main strengh. However, the formula was exorcised and executed... time to move on to the next chapter.... which is probably more disturbing when you watch it properly. I mean, the blatent use of gore and the insane humour which it's delivered with is very disturbing.The character of the 'father' is probably closer related to Ed Gein than what he was in the original... and seeing as they attribute the inspiration for TCM from Ed Gein, It would suggest to me that this second film is a success! The character of 'Chop-Top' adds to the disturbance of the film even more. His over the top sense of humour is greatly misjudged. As a viewer, his irritating and immature ranting and raving makes me feel very uneasy. While we have one character feeling violated and blood-caked on the ground, we have Chop-Top standing over them prancing around like a child, relishing every suffering moment.This is a highly original film (for it's time) and a very worthy follow up. Do not rate this movie in comparison with the original film.... both aim to shock the audience from different angles... and if viewed correctly, this one should hit you right in the jugular.I rate this film 7 corpses out of 10.

Every single aspect and element in this movie is just perfect. And I'm NOT exaggerating... If I have to rate all the different elements of cinema separately, I would rate them all 10 out of 10. Acting, directing, plot, location, dialogues, sense of humor...all brilliant and in the right proportions. Frank Capra was responsible for several milestones and masterpieces in the history of cinema but - in my opinion - Arsenic and Old Lace beats them all. Yes, I DO think it's even better than 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' !!!  Arsenic and Old Lace is just everything you could possibly wish for in a motion picture. A must see that comes with the highest possible recommendation. Explaining the plot a bit would almost be impossible to do. The story goes about so many things. Don't be alarmed, it's not at all hard to follow or something. As a viewer, you're just being overwhelmed by a series of hilarious plot twists and intelligent side-characters and their backgrounds. So much that it is almost impossible to mention it all. And besides, it's better that you start watching it without knowing too much about the story anyway. Just sit back and enjoy being pleasantly surprised. I can't imagine that there are people out there who didn't fully enjoy this movie !! It comes really close to perfection, and the intelligence and originality of it will never again find an equal. Nowadays comedies are all low-brainers ( or even no-brainers ) that handle about dumb teenagers or dick and fart jokes. Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy that is mainly story-driven and brought to an even higher level thanks the flawless acting performances.Yes...let's talk about the cast a bit !! Cary Grant plays the role of his life in my opinion. Sure, he played many other brilliant roles but his character Mortimer Brewster is just the most memorable of them all. Grant's comedy talent was never stressed better than in this film. His facial expressions are hilarious and his the amazingly funny lines sound brilliant coming out of his mouth. The girl who played his wife Elaine ( forgot her name ) is very beautiful and a great match for him. And I was very enthusiast to see Peter Lorre in this film. He's in my top 5 list of greatest actors who ever lived and anyone who saw this movie will agree with me on that. He's just perfect as Dr. Einstein. I can keep on rambling about the cast but I think you get the whole picture... FLAWLESS !!!Black comedy is one of the hardest subgenres of cinema to make a good movie out. Not many directors and scriptwriters have enough talent to take a subject like murder, death or insanity and make a masterpiece out of it. Stanley Kubrick did it with 'Dr. Strangelove' and Frank Capra did it with this one ... I think these men are the exception. Only these guys can make you laugh hysterically with subjects like this. Finally one more note  This is also a perfect movie to watch if you're a fan of classic horror movies and thrillers. First of all because of the tribute role by Peter Lorre of course but also because of the constant morbid atmosphere hanging around the movie...And, naturally, because of the character of Jonathan Brewster which clearly is a direct tribute to Boris Karloff...They even say so most of the times.What the hell are you waiting for ??

One part of me thought the movie was going to be just another piece of teen garbage and the other half actually had hope for the film. I am very happy to say that the film was actually very good. This movie is not your average teen movie of coarse it does have a few sexual references but it doesn't go overboard with the sex jokes. The most important element of the film was its meaning which is believe in yourself and don't let the people around you control you. The plot wasn't too original but I enjoyed the film very much.The film stars DJ Qualls as Dizzy Harrison, and his three friends Nora (Zooey Deschannel), Glen (Parry Shen), and Kirk (Jerod Mixon) who are just entering their senior year of high school. Dizzy and his friends have always been the geeks of the school and been the target of humiliation. So one day Dizzy gathers up enough courage to talk to one of the cheerleaders at the school. He actually succeeds in this goal but the cheerleader caused him to become aroused which in itself isn't too good. The next problem occurs when the cheerleader's boyfriend comes over and asks him what he is doing talking to his girlfriend. Dizzy is then humiliated in front of the entire school by the boyfriend punching him and then a hall monitor grabbing Dizzy's private area and pulling him into the principle's office. He is now so embarrassed and doesn't want to ever go back to school. So Dizzy freaks out in a fit of rage and goes to the mall and takes the microphone from the church quire and starts talking about how bad his life has been. This then gets him thrown into prison where he meets Luther (Eddie Griffen), who was also the loser kid in high school. Luther then explains to Dizzy how to get expelled from the school so he can go into another High school and start over with a new image. So he gets out of prison and goes back to school and tries to get himself expelled by pulling many wild stunts. He then goes back to prison where he learns the ropes of how to succeed in high school as the `cool guy'.  He changes his name to Gil, which is his middle name and starts fresh at the new high school. He embarrasses the most popular guy the first day and everyone falls in love with the New Guy! Gil gains respect from the main cheerleader at this new high school (Eliza Dushku) and starts a relationship with her. Gil feels great at first until he gets so popular and forgets about his 3 buddies who he has known since he was little. Gil finds a way to encourage the new school that his friends are just as cool as him. Gil then helps raise the school spirit by encouraging the football team to win games. Everything is going well for Gil until the football game between his new school and his old school occurs. This then causes a huge problem. The bully from the first school and the bully from the new school get together and find a way to destroy Gil's reputation.The film gives off a very good soundtrack with a mixture of many different types of music. I especially liked Dizzy's & his three friends' band who sounded awesome in my opinion. I think they should really go out and get a record deal because their music rocked. So as you can tell from the brief description of the movie, it does try to have its sexual jokes but aren't very offensive or sick like other teen movies. But most importantly to me is the end the film, which made a very good point. The movie was a very fun ride for me and I seen it many times already and enjoyed it after ever viewing.

Lumpkin Mitch & Murray, the Wall Street real-estate conglomerate, is not too happy about the production of that branch and sends down one of their top honcho's Mr. Blake, Alic Baldwin, to motivate the men to get the ball rolling and start putting dollars on the blackboard.In a pep talk that leaves the crew panic-stricken Blake tells them if they don't start to sell real-estate and get the office out of debt only one of them will be left working for the firm by the end of the month, the one who has the most sales. Blake gives the manager of the office John Williamson, Kevin Spacey,a list of valuable live leads, people who are very likely to buy, and tells him to give them out to the most productive salesman who's on top of the blackboard, in money earned, by the end of the day. with that the men who are drowning see a lifeline and will do anything that they can, right or wrong, to grab it. Explosive performances all around with everyone in the cast giving it all they've got in a great movie about salesmen on par with Death of a Salesman.

The extra expense is well worth it. The movie looks and sounds better than I have ever seen it before. The plot can be quickly summarized Holly Martins, a hack writer of westerns, comes to Vienna at the behest of his best friend, Harry Lime. He arrives just in time for Lime's funeral. After the funeral, Martins is liquored up by Major Calloway, a member of the four nation police force patrolling Vienna. According to Calloway, the late Harry Lime was involved in a black market penicillin racket. Holly decides to prove Harry's innocence, which leads him to Harry's girl, Harry's friends, and a shadowy Third Man who may or may not have been involved in Harry's death - and who, it turns out, may or may not be dead.But the plot is not what makes this movie so great - it is the plot of a very good thriller. The first thing that makes the movie so great is the way it toys with Holly. Holly enters the movie with romantic dreams about the world despite his low standing in it; ideals about honor, friendship, loyalty, love - and himself. Over the course of the movie, all of those romantic ideals will be cruelly and pitilessly ground into the dust before his eyes, culminating in a final scene that will resonate within you for years after. A friend of mine calls this movie the anti-Casablanca, and I think there's justice to that. While in Casablanca, nobility, friendship, loyalty to a cause, and love all win out in the end, here they are exposed as shams and comfort for suckers.The second thing that makes this movie so great is the visual look of the film, and how those visuals impact the story and our memory of it. Dozens of scenes and moments stay with me to this day; I can call up half the movie at will. Not just the ferris wheel scene and the crushing final scene, butDr. Winkle's (V-inkle's) hand holding a carving knife and pausing over a roast fowl when Martins's name is announced.Anna slipping and calling Holly Harry - one of several times characters get someone's name wrong - most notably, of course, completely botching Joseph Harbin's name on the tombstone.A purring cat, a pair of shoes, an improbable shaft of light, and a knowing, caught red-handed smirk - the greatest entrance in the history of movies.A monstrous shadow evolving into a balloon salesman.A wild cab ride through the streets of Vienna, with Martins asking the driver if he has orders to kill him, only to find himself delivered up to a fate worse than death. (Mr. James Joyce. Where would you place him?)A chase through the rubble of post war Vienna, being led by a boy who, God help me, looks exactly like the Sta-Puft Marshmallow man from Ghostbusters.A parrot... never mind.The whole chase through the gutter culminating in two hands reaching through a manhole screen and a last, barely perceptible nod from Orson Welles.Great dialog - mostly by Graham Greene, although Wells wrote his own, limited, dialog. Great acting, especially by Wells who is on screen for maybe five or ten minutes total, and has only a few lines and those mostly speeches, but dominates even the excellent performances by Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard, and the impossibly luscious Alida Valli.Add to that the great directing, create cinematography (beautiful black and white! The invention of color photography is a mistake from which the movies have never adequately recovered) and the great zither music, there is nothing about this movie that is not completely memorable.

Then they head to their chambermaid jobs during the day and then head back to the beach.

She has been trying to overcome the trauma of that and challenge in the big surfing contest next week.

One day Anne Marie meets a pro football player named Matt (Matthew Davis) and gives him surfing lessons but they quickly become a couple. Anne Marie doesn't know how deep his feelings are and she doesn't want to end up being just another quick fling for a jock. This film was directed by John Stockwell who has slowly developed into a pretty good filmmaker and this is a good looking film. Its technically well made and the performances by Bosworth and Rodriguez are earnest but they're just is not a shred of character development. Yes, we know Anne Marie's mother has bailed out and she also suffered from a wipe-out but all the other characters just seem to be there to  serve her. Bosworth's character talks of never wanting to go to college but later she moans of having a hard time paying her bills. What does she expect? Of course this is a fable meant for a younger (And less tasteful) audience and teenagers seem to be the target. The plot and characters are so very predictable that when the film ended there was absolutely no surprises. Pretty much what you think is going to happen does! Most of these characters are so dumb and obnoxious that it becomes impossible to be interested in them. Why were those local boys always barking orders at Anne Marie? Who are they to tell anyone what to do? It was ridiculous toward the end of the film when those same Neanderthals were rooting her on during the competition. Are we suppose to forget they're violent behavior during the film and think that they're really decent people? I didn't and you can't help but think that they're the biggest losers on the planet. In fact, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all the characters that live to surf. What a waste of time and life and too bad that none of these people are able to have any type of a life. This film is only for people(!) that love surfing. Anyone that has read one book in their life and has more than two working brain cells should be warned!

For the most part this film proves what I have always said. Story takes place in Hawaii where we see three young women who get up early and surf. Then they head to their chambermaid jobs during the day and then head back to the beach. Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) was a championship quality surfer but suffered a bad spill and was injured. She has been trying to overcome the trauma of that and challenge in the big surfing contest next week. Her roommates Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) try to encourage her and help her get back in shape. Anne Marie also takes care of her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) but she is becoming rebellious and hanging out with the wrong sort. One day Anne Marie meets a pro football player named Matt (Matthew Davis) and gives him surfing lessons but they quickly become a couple. Anne Marie doesn't know how deep his feelings are and she doesn't want to end up being just another quick fling for a jock. This film was directed by John Stockwell who has slowly developed into a pretty good filmmaker and this is a good looking film. Its technically well made and the performances by Bosworth and Rodriguez are earnest but they're just is not a shred of character development. Yes, we know Anne Marie's mother has bailed out and she also suffered from a wipe-out but all the other characters just seem to be there to  serve her. Bosworth's character talks of never wanting to go to college but later she moans of having a hard time paying her bills. What does she expect? Of course this is a fable meant for a younger (And less tasteful) audience and teenagers seem to be the target. The plot and characters are so very predictable that when the film ended there was absolutely no surprises. Pretty much what you think is going to happen does! Most of these characters are so dumb and obnoxious that it becomes impossible to be interested in them. Why were those local boys always barking orders at Anne Marie? Who are they to tell anyone what to do? It was ridiculous toward the end of the film when those same Neanderthals were rooting her on during the competition.

Suddenly he gets his big chance when the world champion seeks a new challenger, as the challenger he had has to bail out, due to an injury. Rocky goes for it, but in the end he knows he's not in the same league as the champ. The true victory is Rocky's new gains self respect and love for his girlfriend Adrian. This film has a really cool 70's vibe and for me the locations use (Philadelphia) fit the film perfect. It was filmed during winter 1976 and that's something you can actually see. The true realism and great acting performances (plus the unforgettable soundtrack) makes this a film worthwhile. A must see definitely!! My favourite scene is still the one where Rocky goes out for his first morning run. He gets up at 4 A.M. and sets out into the cold, frozen streets of morning hour Philadelphia.

Not any more. Peter Jackson and who would have thought it from the man responsible from Meet The Feebles?has done something which thwarted even the likes of John Boorman and Stanley Kubrick. Partially this is because everyone else wanted to do it all as one film. Not here. New Line,in a risky move that has now paid off,let Jackson do three films. One for each book. And the first is just superb,a superb fantasy film which has a true epic feel beyond the reach of most films today.For the most part,Jackson has followed the book,and harnessed it to what is just simply film-making brilliance. Most of the potential problems have been overcome. To name two examples,the enormous amount of backstory and exposition,and the lengthy amount of dialogue bits when characters explain what is going on. Here,the opening concisely explains where we are and brlliantly sets up everything,while we are constantly SHOWN what is happening rather than hearing people talk of it. This expands the scope of the first third of the story and makes it easier to follow for non-Tolkienites. Of course,some stuff has been cut,with some fans bemoaning the lack of Tom Bombadil,and the loss of other events of the first half of the book,but none of these losses hamper the actual film and speed the pace up. Most of the really rather unimportantchanges result in an even better film,such as the added action at the end,giving it a climax the book lacked. Another example is the elf kingdom of Lothlorien. In the book it is a beautiful paradise. Here,it is a more sinister,eerie land,which adds some tension to a potential slow part of the film. The only addition which is not too successful is the Aragorn\/Arwen love story,which has been pulled out of Tolkien's appendixes and given a bigger role in the story than it probably warrants.However,The Fellowship Of The Ring is not just a fine adaptation of a classic book,it's a stunning film in it's own right. It immerses us completely it's imaginary world. None of the sterile Star Wars or Matrix computer game-type visuallisations here,here everything has an organic look,Middle Earth genuinely looks like a world that has a history and ,for the duration of the film,convinces us. Yes,much of it is done with CGI,but it works because not only it is generally so seamless but because it is at the service of the film's plot and world. The film actually creates several different worlds convincingly and with terrific variety,from the 'Olde English Paradise'of Hobbiton to the bleak,dark kingdom of Mordor,to the beautiful,dreamlike vistas of Rivendell. Of course the action scenes,some of which have been beefed up a little from the book,are fantastic. The opening battle is just incredible,a real Wowmoment,the encounters with the Ringwraiths are real edge-of -seat stuff,and the lengthy Moria sequence,which moves from a battle to a crumbling bridge to the encounter with the deadly Balrog,is just action film-making at it's finest,effects,stuntwork,editing,music,every thing at a filmmakers disposal is combined to create one of the best bits of sustained action ever done on film. And rarely have darkness and light both been visuallised so well in a single film. The evil Ringwraiths are particularly well depicted,genuinely frightening. No toning down for a PG here,it's just lucky the film got one.Yet all this would not work so well if Tolkien and Jackson did not give us characters we care about. All the film's main characters are given full,rounded personalities and their own internal or not so internal conflicts,and little scenes which show these. All the cast is perfect,but particular kudos to Elijah Wood's wide-eyed,almost innocent but deep down very tough Frodo-there could not have been a better choice-,Viggo Mortensen's brooding Aragorn and Ian McKellen's warm Gandalf,while no one can portray evil like Christopher Lee. Howard Shore's score plays another essential part in the film,musically underlying everything shown on screen,adept at describing both darkness and light with equal skill and more inventive and appropriate than anything John Williams might have written.The Fellowship Of The Ring is a tremendous achievement,both a great film of a great book and a great film on it's own. The best fantasy film ever made? It's certainly a contender.A note about the Extended Version which was released on DVD. This longer version,which adds around 40 mins to the 3 hours running time of the theatrical version,is even better. The pace is slightly slower but the extra and extended scenes add to a much more satisfying experience. A few missing things from the boo such as the famous gift-giving sceneare most notable by their addition,but characterisations are deepened,detail is added is every major part of the film,even some of the action scenes contain more. Some subplots,such as one about the elves gradually leaving Middle Earth,which is almost invisable in the shorter cut,are clearer. This version really makes a great film even better.

If, on the other hand, you just come in expecting a holiday movie, it is actually quite good.  Not the best, but still good for the whole family. Everyone knows the story about the Grinch, unless you've been stuck under a rock for the past fourty or so years.  The original story was about the Grinch, a green, furry guy who lives on a mountain above the town of Whoville.  Every Christmas, the Whovillians throw massive Christmas parties and celebrations, much to the dislike of the Grinch, who hates Christmas. He tries to steal Christmas by taking away every decoration, present, etc. He learns the true meaning of Christmas as the end, and a few other things happen, but that's it.  It's a short story overall. Then they try to make a movie out of it.  In order to make it run at least 90 minutes, Ron Howard had to add a lot of plot and such.  The Grinch is also given the typical Howard-treatment; he hates Christmas because of a traumatic experience during a Christmas party as a kid.  This completely contradicts the original story, which has him hating Christmas because he doesn't understand the meaning and thinks it's nothing more than a bunch of noise.  Jim Carrey, however, does a pretty good job as the Grinch; there were a few faults, but we don't know much about the Grinch anyway, so it deoesn't matter as much.  Rather, all the problems fall on Ron Howard's shoulders. What seperates this from other holiday movies of its ilk, however, is that effort actually went into it.  It seemed like everyone really wanted to make a good movie, and even though it doesn't match the cartoon, it's still an enjoyable experience.  So please, don't just compare it to the cartoon; just judge it as a movie itself.

It is amazingly well done, one of the Coen's best, and the whole tone of the film - from the music to the shade of screen - is so dreamlike and creative that its hard not to like it.  It's funny, smart, sad, tense, tragic, dreamy and cool, all in one.The story focuses on the adventures of three escaped convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) on their way to find treasure in depression-era South U.S.A.  On their way they meet loads of colorful characters and even have a run-in with the Klu Klex Klan...and worse.I have to say, the most remarkable thing about this movie is Clooney's performance.  I didn't think the guy had it in him, but he manages to pull his accented and bumblingly intelligent character well.  This definitely ranks up with Ocean's Eleven and Out of Sight for movies showing that yes, George can act.The Coen's screenplay is also worth mentioning.  Ever since Miller's Crossing you'd expect a Coen movie to be filled with much smart, witty and entertaining dialogue.  You get what you expect.  'Witty' is an understatement for every word that exits every character's mouth.For those of you looking for good Coen, I recommend this...and anything else, really, 8.5\/10.

I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.A knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face, one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death, they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple, they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal, one of the finest films ever made.If Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.My highest recommendation possible.

But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her. It has a very clever story, amazing effects and three great actors Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. Who said dark comedies can't be good? Death Becomes her shows the true competitive side of women that scares most of the human race, how far we will go to be the hottest, the smartest, the kindest, etc. But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.Actress Madeline Ashton and writer Helen Sharp are longtime rivals. Helen's life falls apart when glamorous Madeline steals Helen's fiancé, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, and marries him. Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution. Obsessed with getting revenge against Madeline, she struggles in the institution with healing. Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career. Ernest, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician. When Madeline and Helen meet again at Helen's book-signing party, Helen appears miraculously rejuvenated, thin, and youthful. Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous. As part of Helen's plan, she plays both Madeline and Ernest, telling them each she has never blamed them for her ruined love life. Madeline resorts to the aid of the mysterious Lisle Von Rhoman, who claims she has discovered the secret of eternal youth.

As well as why we should care what is happening to these pretty horrible characters. But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV.

But I now think that, within the strictures of its budget, it's about as good as it can get. Sam Spade is a marvelous character in this film. He gives practically nothing away, while gathering information from others simply by letting them talk, kind of like a shrink.And it's hard to believe that they could have found a cast that fit the templates of the novel so perfectly. Sidney Greenstreet IS the fat man. Peter Lorre IS the queer. My nomination for best scene When Greenstreet attempts to peel off the black enamel from the captured bird and finds that it's nothing but lead and begins to hack away at it, as if it were alive and he were trying to kill it. Nothing is more amusing than a fat man lipid with rage.If you see this one, and I hope you do, make note of the phenomenal black and white photography. (I hope you have a good connection.) Watch, for instance, the glissade of the camera when Bogart says, You have brains. Yes, you do. In case you're worried about this being too sophisticated for enjoyment by an ordinary audience, I should mention that I showed this (in one connection or another, I forget) to a class of Marines at Camp Lejeune. They enjoyed the hell out of it, especially the scene in which Mary Astor kicks Peter Lorre in the shins.Don't miss it.

He gives practically nothing away, while gathering information from others simply by letting them talk, kind of like a shrink.And it's hard to believe that they could have found a cast that fit the templates of the novel so perfectly. Sidney Greenstreet IS the fat man. Peter Lorre IS the queer. My nomination for best scene When Greenstreet attempts to peel off the black enamel from the captured bird and finds that it's nothing but lead and begins to hack away at it, as if it were alive and he were trying to kill it. Nothing is more amusing than a fat man lipid with rage.If you see this one, and I hope you do, make note of the phenomenal black and white photography. (I hope you have a good connection.) Watch, for instance, the glissade of the camera when Bogart says, You have brains. Yes, you do. In case you're worried about this being too sophisticated for enjoyment by an ordinary audience, I should mention that I showed this (in one connection or another, I forget) to a class of Marines at Camp Lejeune. They enjoyed the hell out of it, especially the scene in which Mary Astor kicks Peter Lorre in the shins.Don't miss it.

It deserved every single award it got. It's touching, it's timeless and it's downright beautiful. I'm not a huge friend of extended versions because there's usually a perfectly good reason to take something out of the film and none whatsoever to put it back again, if pleasing hardcore fans isn't a good reason - that's totally a matter of opinion. However, Dances with wolves is certainly an exception.The nearly four hour version is the only one to be. Sure it sounds like it's too much but when you watch the movie it doesn't look a minute overlong and cutting even a second out of it would seem like a horrible crime. The original theater version was 52 minutes shorter which sound too cruel to be true. I mean really, what's there to cut? If you haven't seen Dances with wolves yet you have missed one of the greatest motion picture experiences of the 90's and you should do something about it instantly.
