Alex Proyas had already gained much appraisal for The Crow, a movie that I didn't like, so I doubted all the hype for this one when it came out (boy was I surprised). This was right up with Saving Private Ryan last year as the best movie in 1998. In fact, this movie was so good that it spawned off two 1999 summer movies that were also loosely based off of multiple universes (The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor). If you aren't a typical fan of science fiction, this movie may need to be watched more than once to get the full affect (like in 12 Monkeys). Rufus Sewell does an excellent job as the lead role, but in most cases, anybody probably could have played the role. Kiefer Sutherland is always excellent and shows no difference with his role as the mad-doctor type. Jennifer Connelly is barely noticed and is merely an attractive woman playing a transparent role. William Hurt remains the most boring actor in Hollywood, but doesn't have enough lines to bring the movie down. The real point is that it would be truly impossible to knock this movie down. The graphics are incredible and are balanced with the best background construction since Dick Tracy. The darkness is constant but brings the dark beauty that is so cool in this movie. While the story is great and is very unique, it may be very hard for many to truly understand the movie at a first setting. This may explain why many viewers complained of boredom in the theater. Dark City was just truly awesome and should be viewed by any science fiction buff or movie watcher. This movie has a chance to be a rental classic. I gave it a perfect 10 out of 10.

Freddie Prinze Jr. is her love interest and personally I think he is one of the most annoying actors out there, no exception here.The whole story is very predictable actually. Prinze is the most popular guy on their high school, just dumped by his beautiful girlfriend. Now he makes a bet with a friend he can turn any girl into a prom queen. The friend selects the girl and of course he chooses Rachael Leigh Cook. Convenient for Prinze, since she already is a beautiful girl. It does not really matter whether she wears glasses and floppy pants. Of course he really falls in love with her, of course the bet comes out, of course the girl is mad, of course the movie end on the prom, and of course it will be a happy ending.Yes, predictable it is, but also sweet, even with an actor like Prinze. Sometimes it is funny and when you are watching a romantic comedy all you really want, I guess, is the main characters get together in a nice way. That sort of happens. A teenager will probably love it, but others will not completely waste their time.

Why then, does she need to appear in an old fashioned manipulative tear jerker like Stepmom? I wish I knew.The sad thing is, Stepmom could easily have been a better movie. It takes a common problem facing many women today that Hollywood has never touched on that of being a stepmother. The problem arises when the movie wants to be about the real mother almost as much and eventually much more. Julia Roberts, one of our most overrated actresses, starts out the film trying to deal with being a stepmother to her new boyfriend's (Ed Harris) two young children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (). The movie shows her battles with 's icy ex-wife and uber-mom Jackie (Susan Sarandon).When it comes to being a mother, Jackie can do no wrong. She lives in a house that Martha Stewart would envy, has her children's schedules memorized and carries three copies of emergency phone numbers. It's actually scary. Sarandon is the perfect mom, never a hair out of place, never an untucked shirt. Roberts is a terrific photographer, although she only seems to work for 20 minutes a day. When will movies get realistic? Sure, we like to see people who are very stable, but Stepmom takes everything to the realm of fantasy. Even Ed Harris only appears when it seems necessary. His role is little more than a walk-on.Halfway through this picture perfect battle between Jackie and Julia, we learn that Jackie has cancer and the movie veers straight into tear jerker territory. A story about two women being mothers to the same family would have made a movie all its own as would a film about a mother dying who passes on her children to her ex-husband's new wife. But no, Hollywood wants us to have it both ways and what we get is two incomplete and unsatisfying halves that never quite come together. The only redeeming quality in this movie is the children who are played realistically. Without them, there wouldn't have been a story anyway. Full of annoying scenes where the characters always seem about to tear up, Stepmom is poor excuse for entertainment and a disappointment from the great Susan Sarandon.Grade C- ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Susan Sarandon is one of the finest actresses working today.

The humor is not intellectual by any stretch of the imagination (and it wasn't meant to be) but it was well written and more importantly, well delivered.The movie revolves around a group of friends that make a pact with each other that they would all lose their virginity by their prom night. What starts out as a group of guys trying every trick in the book to bed a girl turns out to be a self discovering journey that is riddled with humor that keeps you laughing right up to the closing credits. While there are those out there that may criticize this movie on its content, keep in mind that it is rated R and makes no attempt to hide that fact. Parents may be offended but the reality is that this movie does depict what many teenagers go through during the final year of high school.All the actors portrayed their roles admirably and a large part can be attributed to good writing. This movie will attract a lot of the teenage crowd (at least those that can get in) but I'm sure that adult audiences will find it just as entertaining.

Remakes of movies as vastly different as The Parent Trap and Psycho have all hit the big screen in the past year. Shakespeare and Dickens have even been updated to modern times in movies like West Side Story, 1996's Romeo + Juliet, and 1997's Great Epectations. In fact, later this year, a teenage version of Taming the Shrew is forthcoming with a name change to Ten Things I Hate About You. Maybe updating the classics for teens is way to make reading fun again? Heck, even Clueless was an updating of Jane Austen's Emma. Was it any real surprise then that Hollywood would attempt an update of the classic French novel Les Liasons Dangereuse? Previously filmed three times, Les Liasons Dangereuse is a sinister story of two manipulative French aristocrats. To update these two characters as two Manhattan prep school students might seem far fetched, but it's an premise to swallow before long.Cruel Intentions is great campy fun. It doesn't really add anything new to the tale of Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) and Catherine Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar), but does it really need to?The story speaks for itself and despite a few additions (such as Valmont attempting to blackmail a closeted football star), it remains surprisingly true to the original.True, the story is so sinister that at times it takes itself too seriously, but that's aprt of its fun. Like Valley of the Dolls and Mommie Dearest before it, Cruel Intentions is destined to become a camp classic. The story, the dialogue, and the acting are all so over the top, you can't help but resist the film.As Valmont, Ryan Phillippe is a charmingly sinister pretty boy. You can't trust anything he says, but he's totally charismatic while saying it. Phillippe has the makings of a big star. He does a complete turnaround from his usually sweet, sensitive characters (White Squall, Playing By Heart, Little Boy Blue) and dumb (54, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Homegrown). His Valmont is calculating, intelligent, intensely charming, and utterly reprehensible all at once. With that face and that wardrobe, Phillippe can't fail.Sarah Michelle Gellar as Catherine is equally good, matching Phillippe's insidiousness. She's given many of the movie's best lines. When giving advice to Cecile, the budding virgin Catherine says, Sleep with as many people as people as you can. Gellar is cruel and calculating, a refreshing change from her role on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar shines on TV but on the big screen she's never come across quite as well, until now.As good as Phillippe and Gellar are, the movie is almost stolen from them by the talented young Selma Blair. As Cecile, the gawky virgin, Blair walks the thin line between funny and realistic and does a great job. She has great likability and could be the next Sandra Bullock. Too bad Reese Witherspoon isn't nearly as good. As Annette, who is saving herself until marriage, Ms. Witherspoon comes off the same as she does in every movie annoying. Why Valmont falls in love with her is a mystery in this version.A good cast, hysterical dialogue, and a classic story make Cruel Intentions an undeniable camps classic.

When I saw the trailer for Summer Of Sam, I was so excited to see it. It looked like it was going to be a fabulous, poignant, and remarkable classic like Do The Right Thing. The trailer was a tease! The movie was a let-down! I walked into a 4 P.M. showing of Summer Of Sam on a sunday afternoon expecting another masterpiece by Spike Lee and what I got was something very very far from a masterpiece.....a travesty! A lousy movie that dragged on for 2 and 1\/2 hours that had un-necessary characters, particularly Ben Gazzara's role as a mafia godfather who makes a strong opening but has no follow-through. His character is unexplained is barely seen during the rest of the film. The lame subplots were topped off with a horrible conclusion. I understand that Spike Lee did not want to focus mainly on the Son Of Sam killings, but rather on how an entire neighborhood was torn apart and effected by the killings. He had the right idea and could have done wonders with this movie, only he blew it BIGTIME! I never look at my watch when I go into a movie, but while I was watching Summer Of Sam, I looked at my watch a total of 6 times. 4 people walked out of the theatre 45 minutes before it was over. I stayed, thinking that it would get better and build up to a strong climax, similar to the climax in Do The Right Thing. The movie did build up to a climax, but a very weak and foolish one with a lot of un-answered questions. When someone makes a movie based on a true-story, it's not good to conclude the film with un-answered questions because it's not fiction where you use your imagination. You give as many facts as possible to make the film either more entertaining or informative and Spike Lee expects us to use our imaginations for factual incidents. The film is a disappointment! I give the film 1 star out of 4 only because of the attention-grabbing beginning and a few scenes that get you built up for excitement but let you down totally. And was the trips to Studio 54, Plato's Retreat, The Diner, The Discotheque, and CBGB's really necessary??? No, because they didn't evolve into anything. They were all boring.

The movie is fairly frank about Wilde's homosexuality - the decadence of the male brothel-type place is overwhelming, and we see Wilde watching Bosie have sex with another, and being subjected to his screaming fits and recriminations. But this makes his speech about the love that dare not speak its name seem like a bit of an evasion - since we know how much it s about the pleasures of the flesh as much as about scholarly bonding between older and younger men and the other stuff that s cited. The trial itself and the mechanics of the decline seem over a bit quickly and the ending is soft, although it s hard to imagine too many people objecting. Fry is sometimes moving but is rather on one note - the film though conveys a great sense of his charm and genuine celebrity, no more than in the opening sequence where he goes down a mine and spellbinds them with a history of Cellini - throughout Wilde provokes so much enthusiasm that his downfall ultimately seems tragically avoidable.
