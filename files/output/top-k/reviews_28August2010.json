I remember seeing at least a bit of it probably shortly after it was released on video, but don't remember much about that. Within the past couple years, I've seen three films which Emmerich has made since this one, which are The Patriot, 10,000 BC, and The Day After Tomorrow. Of those three, The Day After Tomorrow was the only one I was impressed with at all, though even that one certainly has its flaws and is hated by many. By the time I finally got around to watching Independence Day, fourteen years after its release, I knew it was a popular blockbuster, but also knew that it was widely criticized and that Emmerich doesn't have the greatest reputation as a filmmaker. I thought that as popular as the movie was, there was a good chance I wouldn't like it, but obviously had no way of knowing for sure. However, after watching it, it's not too surprising that I find myself joining the naysaying crowd.In the United States of America, it is very close to Independence Day when it is discovered that mysterious giant objects are headed towards Earth! It is believed that these are meteors, but not for long, as it is soon clear that they are actually spaceships! A New York City cable worker named David Levinson discovers satellite transmissions which seem to indicate a countdown to an alien attack! He goes with his father, Julius to warn U.S. President Thomas J. Whitmore about this planned attack, and the president orders an evacuation of the cities the intruders are targeting, but it's too late. It isn't long at all before the countdown ends and major cities around the world, including three American ones (New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C), are destroyed by hovering spaceships which blast them with destructive beams! It is now up to the survivors to defeat these evil aliens and save their planet. Whitmore, who escaped with family and staff members from the capital of the United States just in time before the city was obliterated, heads to Area 51, where it is said that a seized alien spacecraft is being kept (something he had never been told before), and must work with others to prevent the end of humanity! This 1996 blockbuster suffers from the quality of the characters, plus the performances from the cast members who play them. None of them stand out as really good here, with a very unimpressive performance from Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, and a number of other bland performances. Randy Quaid is worse than most of the others, playing alcoholic Russell Casse, and so are the ones who play his kids. Scenes with these characters can sure be annoying, with lines such as, You don't want to die a virgin, do you? I've only seen the special edition, featuring nine minutes of footage not included in the original theatrical version of the movie. Apparently, the Casses are not featured as much in the original version, and that certainly doesn't sound like a bad thing to me, but unfortunately, these characters are not the film's only problem. In addition to the problems with the characters and those who play them, I also didn't find much excitement while watching this film, as much as I know so many others have. I found SOME excitement, but very little. I also didn't care much for the story, in which we barely ever see these evil aliens, nor do we ever get to know much about them. With all the problems I found with Independence Day, I found it to be tedious and usually boring, and I doubt seeing nine minutes less would have made much of a difference. There are parts that I could tell are supposed to be funny, but none of them made me laugh, so I can't say anything for the film's humour, either. Since this is a high budget modern blockbuster, it's no surprise that the visuals are great, but that's not enough to make a good movie.Shortly after watching the special edition, I thought about watching the original theatrical version before reviewing the film. (One might find it hard to believe I've never seen that version!) However, I decided not to do that. It is nine minutes shorter than the special edition, but if that's the only difference, I really don't think it's worth sacrificing another two hours or so of my life watching it. Maybe the extended version I saw features some restored scenes which the film is better off without, and that might mean that the version people saw in theatres is a BIT better, but I was unimpressed with a lot more than just nine minutes of what I saw! MAYBE it would rise to a 5\/10 for me if I saw the original, but that wouldn't be enough. Many viewers consider Independence Day an entertaining blockbuster, and I certainly don't look down on them for that, but personally, I can't imagine myself ever actually liking it. Since there were several months in between my viewing of The Day After Tomorrow and my viewing of this 1996 film from Roland Emmerich, I'm not sure how to compare them (though they do have similar flaws), but for some reason, I found more suspense in the 2004 release. If you like Independence Day for any reason, that's great, just don't expect me have the same opinion.

His movies are both impeccable and emotionally taut. They feature the very best production values and impressive acting. And they take chances carefully, which isn't actually an oxymoron. Nichols knows he's pushing boundaries, but within the established forms. Even this movie, with its insider look at Hollywood, feels ingenious in a safe way, with echoes of The Bad and the Beautiful but with everyone toned down to a perfect realism.One of the tricks of this movie, which is a little over the top in so many small ways (again, careful restraint all around), is keeping the acting believable. And foremost is Meryl Streep, lovable and sympathetic but not quite admirable or otherworldly the way older generation actresses so often get portrayed. Streep as a drug-troubled actress is a wonder, and right behind, with deliberate hamminess, is the woman playing her mother, Shirley MacLaine. Add Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss in smaller roles, a cameo by Rob Reiner, and a pretty boy role for Dennis Quaid, and you can see there is something cooking here. So why isn't this a great movie? It has the trimmings of greatness, even beyond the acting. Story by Carrie Fisher, music written by Carly Simon (and performed by the cast). Photography by German import Michael Ballhaus (who by the 1990s was also working for Coppola and Scorcese). Well, some might say it really is great. Even though it is lightweight, even airy as a farce, and even though it leaves you only slightly glad, or happy, at the end rather than transformed, you could argue that Nichols intended something with this flavor, and achieved it. Could be. But for a simple example, take his second movie, The Graduate, and notice the same tone, humor and irony laced with important topical and emotional strains. How different the effect there, and maybe for a couple of reasons. One, I think, is the subject matter here is the famously glib, plastic, unsympathetic world of overly rich, tabloid saturated Hollywood itself. Another is the inherent plot. What happens? A woman overcomes her addiction to star in another movie, and she seems to move a little forward in her relationship with her mother. Enough? Maybe not.But knowing it's not trying to change the world, you might appreciate the illusory nature of the medium, exposed for us in a whole bunch of different ways (moving props, back projection, doubles used for blocking and framing, lights and camera in action, screening rooms and overdubbing, and so on. This is the stuff behind the drama enacted by Streep and MacLaine and the rest. It's worth watching in its own right.And Nichols and Ballhaus have filmed this to glossy perfection, layering and moving and keeping the long takes going as long as possible (with an apology by Hackman, as a movie director, to Streep, the actress playing the actress, for using such long takes all the time). It's almost as if Nichols is making fun of himself, and the excesses that cause the cast and crew to go a little crazy.Brilliant and entertaining? Completely.

I've now seen only this original, and only because I wanted to see a young Janet Gaynor for the first time. Beware, however a 2012 version is now in pre-production; although, as we all know, it may never be completed &#x96; Hollywood being what it is.Of course, this story &#x96; rags to riches in the acting business - was done first by others &#x96; principally Katherine Hepburn in Morning Glory (1933) and, oddly enough, again in Stage Door (1937), and again with Katherine Hepburn ably assisted by a host of well-known Hollywood actors, including the tireless Adolphe Menjou who never seemed to mind playing a Hollywood boss, in this and many other similar movies. The difference with Star, of course, is it's maybe the first movie to dig into Hollywood screen acting and make an attempt to lay it bare.So the story is banal, as most rags to riches fantasies are. Equally, however, it's an exceptionally well-done narrative that strips the gloss off Hollywood &#x96; in a genteelly, low-key manner &#x96; to show 1937 viewers just what it took to claw your way to the top.

Hard times and war drums were on the way again the people needed to see rags to riches in action, needed to know that hardship and sacrifice were just around the corner. And, failure was not an option.Today's mainstream audience, on the other hand, would probably laugh at the perceived and implied naivety of the 1930s crowd.The acting &#x96; from Frederic March as Norman Maine (the main actor in the story &#x96; such an appropriate name!) who is already on the slippery slopes to alcoholic and acting oblivion just as he meets and falls in love with Janet Gaynor as Esther Blodgett as the aspiring Hollywood wannabee; and both ably assisted by Adolphe Menjou as Hollywood producer, Oliver Niles &#x96; raises it to the level of simplistic melodrama and without descending into bathos, fortunately.

In contrast, it also shows &#x96; with comedy or gentle satire &#x96; the daily grind of making movies and is, perhaps, the genesis of the much over-use of out-takes, bloopers and so on in some of today's productions.

Not until 1973, however, did John Schlesinger direct a screen version of the same name that has not been repeated; see that one and find out why. Not to be outdone, David Lynch, film noire auteur extraordinaire, has gone one further with Muholland Drive (2001), arguably the ultimate screen statement to date about the prostitution of screen art in the pursuit of fame and fortune, and one of the grittiest horror stories ever put to film.

He knows what this means and levels much of his desperately-needed corn crop to create a baseball diamond. Soon a long-dead baseball player with a stained past arrives to hit a few with Ray. But Ray's journey is only beginning...Fantasy is not a genre where everything is supposed to make sense; you have to allow for some room to wonder. Field Of Dreams has a killer concept that it springs on you in the first minute. That famous mystical maxim, If you build it, he will come is actually heard in the movie before anyone else says a line of dialogue. It then dials in to make an overarching statement about baseball, suggesting that a love of the game can restore the innocence of a broken nation, and a connection with a departed father.The result is a film people either love, hate, or feel totally indifferent about. I used to love this film, but feel indifferent to it now. For me, some admittedly positive sentiment is worn down by iffy dialogue, protracted big scenes, and a couple of weak central performances.Costner is so wrong for his role it defies imagination. I am the least crazy person I've ever known, he says, and it's true. He's so level-headed and quiet it's hard to accept the notion of his Kinsella character throwing over his life to a voice in the wind. He drives all the way to Boston, risking his farm, to beg reclusive author Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) to come with him to a ball game, acting the whole time more sheepish than zealous about the whole thing.Amy Madigan's performance as Ray's wife Annie suffers from a terminal case of the cutes, partly a fault of the atrocious dialogue (What if the voice calls when you're gone?) but also from her tendency to mug in every scene. The film seems to suffer from a similar problem. When Ray tells a shopful of skeptical farmers about the voice, the radio is playing Crazy. When we see him leveling the crop to build the field, the camera cuts to neighbors parked in cars three-deep watching him and rhubarbing lines like I can't believe it.The movie is never exactly bad. It moves fast and scores its emotional points, however thickly. John Lindley's camera maximizes the impact of skyscapes and corn fields. James Earl Jones carves out a crafty role for himself as Mann. We are told early on how very, very important a writer Mann is back in the 1960s (he even coined the phrase Make Love, Not War, Annie announces at one point, which I guess is supposed to show his Pulitzer-winning genius at work), yet Jones makes his strongest impression drawing smart laughs in a film that badly needs them.Writer-director Phil Alden Robinson seems to want to present baseball as a worthy substitute for conventional religious belief (twice we hear the Q&A Is this Heaven?\/No, it's Iowa.) but the film's theology seems pretty hollow at its core. Baseball is a fun sport, okay, but is hanging around playing pepper with a bunch of dead All-Stars the best an afterlife can offer? Is the Field's ultimate function that of a self-funding tourist trap drawing pocket money from nostalgic baby boomers wanting to see the players their grandparents grew up with?Field Of Dreams once moved me a good deal, but doesn't score so well anymore.

That hasn't changed all these years later and this longtime fan is quite happy with this entry. The magic was not lost and the film holds up so well. For so long it looked like this would never happen, but thank goodness George Lucas didn't let this slide by.My rating 4.5\/5 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"28 August 2010","score":"","review":" Essentially, VIRUS IS ALIENS set at sea.

It certainly has a lot of things working in its favor. It was directed by the great John Carpenter during, what is arguably, the most successful creative stretch of his career. It stars Kurt Russell, who before this film was an up coming young actor with a number of Disney films to his credit. However, after this film, he quickly graduated to leading-man status and cemented his legacy as an icon of cult cinema. And as for the film itself, it takes the rather audacious premise of having New York become a no-man's land-style prison island, and while staying true to it's B-Movie origins, the film really is a critique on the various ideologies that create and define the American experience.The film begins with a brief narration, establishing that, in the near future, the crime rate has grown to such a rapid extent, that the government decided to turn Manhattan into a giant prison. The president of the United States is on board AirForce One, heading to a three-way peace summit between The U.S., China, and the Soviet Union. The plane has been hijacked by a group of left-wing domestic terrorists, and soon crashes down into the Manhattan Island Penitentiary. Meanwhile, former war-hero turned outlaw Snake Plisskin has been apprehended as is set to be exiled to the prison island. As government officials soon learn that the president is alive and being held hostage, the chief of the United States Police Force, Bob Hauk, played by legendary Spaghetti Western icon Lee Van Cleef, decides to enact a rescue mission. He recruits Snake, promising him a full pardon for all crimes he has committed in return for safely rescuing the President. To ensure Snake's compliance with the mission, Hauk has him injected with microscopic explosive devices that will kill him in 24 hours, which is the time limit he has for rescuing the President before the three-way peace summit is over. Snake has no choice but to complete the mission or die.The world that Carpenter creates here and the characters that inhabit it are all motivated through political ideology, which has been taken to extremes on both ends of the spectrum. What we have essentially is fascism versus anarchism. The U.S. government is a police state and has gone to far right extremes in order to deal with the growing crime rate. Rehabilitation and reintegration have apparently fallen to the wayside in favor of throwing all of the nation's criminals and undesirables onto an island and letting them rot. This theme of fascism was taken into even more extremes with Escape From L.A., which explicitly portrayed the U.S. President as a fascist and totalitarian leader. While the President in Escape From New York is more of a McGuffin than a fully realized character, he is portrayed as weak and cowardly, emphasizing the precarious situation that American society is in, which is on the verge of a complete breakdown.FOR MORE, CLICK ON THE LINKhttp\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AomWRTqpzS8 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2010","score":"","review":" WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS.

Much of the story is told in flash-backs taken from his interrogation by Communist officials in the PRC prison. Much attention is paid to Reginald Johnston's book Twilight in the Forbidden City. Johnston (played in the movie by Peter O'Toole) was Pu Yi's Scottish tutor.John Lone's performance as Pu Yi was very good. Not surprising perhaps for someone who became an emperor at such a young age, Pu Yi is depicted as one who is used to comfort and used to having his way - a characteristic he seems to have retained for most of his life, although he doesn't really come across as bad or arrogant; just as someone who never learned how to care for himself or treat others as equals. I suppose it would be hard to expect a child who was treated almost like a god from the age of 3 to grow up psychologically well adjusted. He was actually overthrown not much more than a decade after coming to the throne but I appreciated learning that although he abdicated when the Nationalist revolution took place, he retained his title and it seems as though the Forbidden City remained his Empire. He continued to rule this little enclave within Beijing, much as the Pope rules a little enclave within Rome. That was very interesting.There was a lot of attention to Pu Yi's accession as Emperor of Manchukuo in 1934. He became a puppet of the Japanese, who placed him on the throne to give Manchukuo a semblance of credibility but no freedom, was captured by the Soviets at the end of the war, and finally handed over to PRC officials in 1950, his transfer to Chinese authority being where the movie begins.Near the end of the movie there's a truly fascinating scene depicting a small portion of the work of Mao's Red Guards during the so-called Cultural Revolution that was quite sobering. I was disappointed, though, with the way this ended. It chose to conclude on a sort of fantasy scene, where Pu Yi returns to the Forbidden City. I suppose it was meant as a way of saying that at his death he returned home, but I found it a weak ending rather than a heartwarming one, perhaps because while his life was interesting, I can't say that I developed any warm feelings or sympathy for Pu Yi by watching this.

Having watched the complete saga maybe four times now, I certainly know the appeal of each movie individually and their strong points. Now in a series of (mostly) great cinema, it's hard to play favorites. But it is my honest opinion that ROCKY III is the best of the Rocky saga.Compared to the first two films, our favorite southpaw emerges in this movie a new man. In fact, almost everything about this movie seems matured compared to the previous ones. Rocky himself is famous and successful, his features have hardened, and he looks more like a grown man. He and Adrian now reside comfortably in their opulent mansion with their son, and we see that Rocky has really made it this time. It seems no one can take the belt from him. Even the picture and soundtrack has become more fine-tuned than in the previous ones.The most striking of these changes is the underlying depth to ROCKY III. To be vague, a black force cuts into the happiness Rocky obtained and a heavy turn of events turns his world upside down. It is in this installment that we see Rockys inner demons full force as he confronts his feelings of fear and inadequacy, making this the darkest Rocky flick by far. Some characters never change (good ol' Paulie...) but others develop into stronger and more stimulating characters. Adrian, no longer a bystander, is the only one who can understand Rockys' strife and in helping him analyze his feelings, she becomes his partner instead of his sidekick during a very well-written scene that I feel is Adrians best moment (and a great scene altogether). Apollo is back this time as well, but not to antagonize Rock but rather to help him train; a complete 360 for Carl Weathers' part. He's apparently come to peace with some things and isn't the same egocentric prima donna he was before.Like in the first one, Rocky has to prove it to himself again. Only this time, the stakes are much higher; not only is his success or self-worth on the line, but the very composure of our most lovable character is worn down as he tumbles into the abyss of his own mental inhibitions. This time ROCKY encourages us to peer into our heads as well as our hearts. Just as we experience self doubt as we get older, Rocky does himself; WHY am I happy? What do I have that's actually MINE? Am I competent? Am I man enough? Undoubtedly the deepest of the series, ROCKY III exploits all of the strongest traits of the saga and uses them to coin interesting changes. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all top-notch, and besides seeing man-thighs flopping around a couple times I have not one complaint about this movie.

He's apparently come to peace with some things and isn't the same egocentric prima donna he was before.Like in the first one, Rocky has to prove it to himself again. Only this time, the stakes are much higher; not only is his success or self-worth on the line, but the very composure of our most lovable character is worn down as he tumbles into the abyss of his own mental inhibitions. This time ROCKY encourages us to peer into our heads as well as our hearts. Just as we experience self doubt as we get older, Rocky does himself; WHY am I happy? What do I have that's actually MINE? Am I competent? Am I man enough? Undoubtedly the deepest of the series, ROCKY III exploits all of the strongest traits of the saga and uses them to coin interesting changes. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all top-notch, and besides seeing man-thighs flopping around a couple times I have not one complaint about this movie. Guaranteed the only Rocky movie to make your hair stand on edge, this is the quintessential installment if you ask me.

These two filmmakers love the popcorn movie genre, as they have stated numerous times and proved even more times with their pictures. None of their movies, from Independence Day to Godzilla to The Day After Tomorrow to the more recent 2012 were created with the intention of being taken seriously. They are continuing the tradition of the silly disaster films from the 70s and occasionally the silly science-fiction flicks of the 50s. Their superlative film is Independence Day, the box office champ of 1996 that started a broad interest in aliens as bloodthirsty war-mongers again.The cast is populated by a wide variety of Hollywood talents perfectly matched to the stereotypes written in the screenplay. Bill Pullman is the weary-eyed, weary-voiced president of the United States; Will Smith is the smart-mouthed fighter pilot ready to kick some alien tail while shelling out punch lines, Jeff Goldblum is the nerdy but smart TV cable man who figures out before everybody else that the aliens are going to attack, his ostensibly Jewish father is played by Judd Hirsch, and Randy Quaid is the drunken, delusional crop duster pilot who claims he once had a close encounter before.The aliens in the movie are even less original, having been pulled off the shelf of the creatures from the 1950s. The only real update is that they've now been generated using modern-day special effects and not puppets, men in suits, and stop-motion animation. Their ships are also a very good visual achievement, and the sight of a 15-mile wide flying saucer hovering over L.A. looks really darn cool.You would think by the way I've been pointing out stereotypes in my review that I didn't think too terribly much of Independence Day and that it was too clichéd for me to praise or recommend. You would think wrong. This is just my style of reviews; I point out the good and the bad in every movie I see.So you want to hear what I liked about Independence Day. Three words it was fun. Three more words it's a popcorn movie. Four words now I *love* popcorn movies! This is the type of movie that if done wrong can be dreadfully boring, but if done right, as here, then is sheer entertainment. Sure, we've seen the like of a movie like this before in terms of substance. And it most certainly is a movie with style over substance. Of course E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the original The Day the Earth Stood Still are better movies because their substance is more prominent than their style. But admit it, every now and then you are in the hankering for a good, old-fashioned flick. Sometimes those kitschy black-and-white films really fill in the void for you. So therefore, I see nothing wrong with continuing this tradition using a bigger budget and modern technology.Another reason why Independence Day works is that it enthusiastically embraces its kitschy charm. Every single moment of it is played for visual spectacle or an old-fashioned charm or gag. And this stereotyping in the cast is repetitive, but it's used in a way where it is amusing, not offensive. Take Will Smith's character, for example. Even though he is just playing the same mentality of his beloved character from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (they seldom let him do anything else, after all) he brings a lot of charm and screen charisma to his performance. In the hands of a lesser actor, this role might have come across as annoying. But Smith is such a great performer that he makes it work. Randy Quaid is also in prime for as a deliberately comical drunk with a heart. And his final scene in the movie has deservedly gone on to become famous.And Roland Emmerich is very good at handling special effects sequences. There are numerous highly implausible moments, such as a fighter pilot maneuvering through a canyon while fighting off miniature UFOs, but the directing and the pacing is so tight that you don't stop to really nitpick over it, but embrace it. If there had been more dead air, you would have no choice but to stop and gripe.And unfortunately a lot of people do stop and gripe throughout the film. But even though I do enjoy this movie enormously, I can acknowledge and understand their points. This is the kind of movie you will either welcome and love for what it is or detest and scorn for what it is.

Based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's hit play The Front Page, it's an incredibly cynical but extremely funny story. Nobody is very interested in Williams the killer or the details of his crime, only in its context as relates to them.

Screwball comedies of sexual dynamics and goofy situations were big in the late thirties and early forties, with films like It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story, and stars like Grant, Katharine Hepburn and Carole Lombard made their reputations with them.

A lot of this changes come notably from the director (as heard on his commentary) and if i don't always agree with him, i like his humor.Thus, it's not really science fiction but rather a thriller in space that have roots in the submarine fights, very similar thus of his repeat in ST6.But Trek offers much than a war movie First, it is touched by beautiful poetry the nebula colors are a great idea to change from the deep space black and the score of Horner is one of his best. As he explains, it's easy just find a handful of memorable cues and mix them all along.Then, I really appreciate the art direction also when you feel the flavor of the 70s in the sets, the clothes.At last, they are still my friends to rejoice this time, they are paired with another sweet new female character Saavik that Alley portrays willfully. For the bad mouths, it was a dirty trick to depict the future romance of the never convincing Kirk's son with Spock's daughter! Spock death's was a moving moment, more painfully reinforced by the glass separation. As the grief comes, we want to hug our dearest ones (as later Kirk does with his son), but Spock is denied this human symbol.If my memory is correct, i remember that my father taped it on VHS.

Some would say the greatest of them all.For myself, this isn't enough, and I know this is me. I'm an art critic and professor of Art in my real life, and I'm never very patient with movies about artists. The reason isn't that there are inaccuracies, but that there is a subtle or not-subtle goal of aggrandizing the subject. This reaches a beautiful but, again, romanticized, peak when Pollock makes his famous break into true gestural, raw work in a large commissioned piece for Peggy Guggenheim (who is portrayed, oddly, as a shy and dull sort, which I've never pictured). Then later he makes his drip works. And then he dies, again over dramatized and made aesthetic, as tragic and ugly as it had to have been in life.If you want to really get into Pollock's head, especially if you aren't already a fan (I love Pollock's work), this is a convincing movie. At the helm as both director and playing the artist is Ed Harris. He is especially believable as a painter, which is something of an important point. This isn't like those movies about musicians where the actor is clearly not playing. Harris actually paints the darned thing, the big masterpiece, on the cusp of the drip works. I don't know if Harris was drinking, too, but he's a good drunk, and of course Pollock was a better drinker than a painter, even.It's a cheap shot to say a movie could have been shorter, but this one sure would have propelled better with less atmosphere, less filler that is meant to create his life but is interesting only as an illustration of historical facts. It wore me thin for those reasons. Again, it might be a matter of how much you can get sucked into the given drama that is Jackson Pollock's life. It was quite a life, crude, untempered, brave, and immensely connected to what matters as an artist.
