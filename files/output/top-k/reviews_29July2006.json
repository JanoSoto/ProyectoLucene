The distracted A-student from the hood is not a terribly interesting character (also a character that's been done about a thousand times in different shapes and colors). The spoiled rich girl with emotional problems is an equally worn-out cliché. It just doesn't have anything that creates interest or sympathy.Sometimes i ask myself which is worse; the movie that is so bad that i hate it, or the movie that's so bland i don't care.

The cast, plot line, and events in the film make it my favorite.I would like to start with the cast. It is the one of the best casts to have been put together in movie history. Matthew McConaughey played the unseasoned lawyer of Carl Lee, Jake Brigance. My favorite actress, Sandra Bullock, played Ellen Roark, the sort of arrogant but extremely brilliant (and hot) assistant to Brigance in the case. Samuel L. Jackson played Carl Lee Hailey, who was on trial for shooting two rednecks named Billy Ray Cobb and James Louis Willard for brutally raping his 10-year-old daughter Tonya. Rounding out the top four characters is Kevin Spacey, who played D.A. Rufus Buckley, one of the toughest lawyers in Mississippi, who was actually running for governor. These four, plus other great actors and actresses like Kiefer and Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Brenda Fricker, and Oliver Platt make A Time To Kill a great film.The plot line of A Time to Kill is a young lawyer, along with three solid assistants, defending a father that killed two men for raping his child. The plot line itself was really deep, but the way that the cast executed their roles makes this movie an uncanny piece of film.For the most part, I liked the events that took place in the movie. In fact, the only event I did not like was when Jake and Ellen were in Ellen's motel room. The two were sitting on the bed looking at each other, ready to start making out. But Jake backed down because he was married. That was disappointing because first off, his wife was out of town and she never would have found out and secondly, he wanted to do more than just make out with her. Heck, if that was me sitting with her, I would have made out with her whether my wife was gone or not. How could you resist kissing a sexy woman like Roark? I guess Jake was soft enough to resist.My favorite part was when Jake and Carl Lee were in Carl Lee's jail cell talking the night before the final hearing. I learned about how Carl Lee felt about Jake after this remark. They see you, they see a yard-worker. They see me, they see an attorney. He said that Jake was one of the bad guys. I had mixed feelings about Carl Lee's remarks. Jake did see Carl Lee as different, but he wasn't one of the bad jury guys.In conclusion, I would like to say again that A Time to Kill was my favorite movie that I had ever seen. I could watch it over and over again. Thanks, Joel Schumacher, for directing such a well thought-out movie. This movie will be a classic to me for years to come, seeing as it is now a decade old.

It made me feel uncomfortable while I watched what was happening on screen, and very few movies have ever done that to me. The movie follows a psychotic murderer as he wanders the streets of New York City, in cheap restaurants, rundown apartment complexes, and subway stations, searching for his next victims, each of them savagely murdered.The plot for this movie may not seem very scary, but the way the movie is crafted is genuinely grisly and really made me feel uncomfortable. Rather than going from the victim's point of view as they are slashed to pieces (like most horror movies tend to do), this movie rather focuses on the actual killer himself. We learn about the abuse that he suffered as a small child at the hands of his domineering mother, which is presumably the reason he's become a murderer, taking out his own personal revenge on other people. The one thing about this movie that was so interesting was how the audience got to enter the mind of the killer, so to speak. Joe Spinell gave an excellent performance as the maniac in this movie, he portrayed a tormented human very well. There are some very grisly murders throughout the movie, all of which are fairly gruesome. But the most disturbing aspect to the film was the sense of psychosis that the killer is experiencing.Maniac is surely similar to Psycho, which makes me wonder whether or not the writers of this film were basing the plot on the real life serial killer Ed Gein, who also grew up with an abusive mother and suffered psychological problems later on as an adult, which ultimately drove him to grave-robbing and murder. There are some striking similarities between the story of this film and Ed Gein's life.Overall, Maniac is one grisly, nasty movie.

(I sat on the aisle because the movie was packed with little girls who wanted to see Bill Cosby, but found out that this wasn't his movie...wow, they must have been disappointed due to the fact that Bill Cosby is in the Cosby family, and Lance Bass is in the Bass family...and last I checked, those are two different families, though I could, and probably am not, not incorrect.) But this movie was very gripping from the beginning, all the way to the end of the opening credits. I then had to go to the bathroom for the duration of the movie, but I could imagine it being the greatest movie in the history of the era of journalism meeting cavemen in a sea of rabid tigers.In terms of the acting, Lance Bass was very antidisestablishmentarianism, if that is a word. If it isn't, I would say that he was good. However, even though I am a huge fan of his, I would say that the good was not the good that you would say to a kid who cleaned up his room. But rather a good that you would say to a kid after he threw away your Mickey Mantle rookie card, in which case your good really meant bad. Thus, Lance Bass was basically a bass player for a bass farming fishery.In conclusion, this movie ranks up there with the all-time great movies, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, I Married an Axe Murderer, School Daze, and of course Lorenzo's Oil.If I had to watch this movie again, I would...and I did.

I then had to go to the bathroom for the duration of the movie, but I could imagine it being the greatest movie in the history of the era of journalism meeting cavemen in a sea of rabid tigers.In terms of the acting, Lance Bass was very antidisestablishmentarianism, if that is a word. If it isn't, I would say that he was good. However, even though I am a huge fan of his, I would say that the good was not the good that you would say to a kid who cleaned up his room. But rather a good that you would say to a kid after he threw away your Mickey Mantle rookie card, in which case your good really meant bad. Thus, Lance Bass was basically a bass player for a bass farming fishery.In conclusion, this movie ranks up there with the all-time great movies, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, I Married an Axe Murderer, School Daze, and of course Lorenzo's Oil.If I had to watch this movie again, I would...and I did.

Tommy Jarvis, who is now all grown up, goes back to Jason's grave one stormy night to make sure the maniacal murderer is really dead and that he has no chance of coming back. He opens the coffin, and stabs Jason with an iron fencepost, which is then incidentally struck by lightning, which somehow revives Jason's body. Now Jason is back, alive as ever, and he continues his rampage of teenage slaughter in the forests surrounding Camp Crystal Lake.I really enjoyed the opening of this movie. At least the writers made an attempt to revive Jason in a interesting way, rather than just have him randomly come back to life for more murders. Jason was presented as a more supernatural presence in this movie, which should've been well established way earlier, because no average human could survive all of the severe battle scars he's taken throughout the series. I mean sure, it is your run-of-the-mill Friday the 13th sequel, but this one at least tries to be something a little different, putting interesting spins on things. There were also some pretty inventive murder sequences too, which isn't uncommon in this series. The director keeps Jason lurking in the shadows throughout the film, having him pop up all over, which, while a little unbelievable, is also pretty effective and good for a couple of scares. It's still a pretty silly movie in it's essential form, but all of these movies are, really, but this one manages to have a lot of strong points and not too many weak ones.Overall, this is one of the better installments of the Friday the 13th series.

This film is absolutely amazing; David Lynch reaches the pinnacle of all of his techniques this film never succumbs to any typical sequences or things to do with thrillers. It is the most original film I have seen in years. After watching this, i thought 'I absolutely love it; what does it mean?'. I watched it again. And again. And again. I bought it. And watched it again. Then i thought 'I absolutely love it; I love what i think it means.' This is a film, like all Lynch films, that is up for almost any interpretation. It represents what you want it to. The dual characterization of the actresses boggles the mind and manipulates the senses. David Lynch is an auteur in every sense of the word. He is an original. He is a master of the ART of film. Not the business. Because, after all, film is an art. Naomi Watts gives an amazing performance mastering TWO characters, who, although (my interpretation) either one of which can be a mental creation of the other, have different natures. One is real, the other is not. Just like in this film. Everything can be real and unreal at the same time. Everything real is also unreal. This may all sound quite confusing, and it is, honestly. If you are a person who cares for straightforward(sorry if i sound pretentious), moderately bland, pure money-making films; even if you love all films, but can't stand to not understand them, then don't watch David Lynch films. But even if you are those people, watch this film, and be annoyed, sure, but respect the art that Lynch puts up there on the screen. Pure, unfiltered, visual, kinetic art. This film brings together all the visual techniques light, sound, music, movement, actors, costumes, props, locations, facial expressions, fades, effects and all were done, at least with Lynch over the shoulder of the workers, if not by him personally. He manipulates you; your mind in this film, and twists your perception of reality. What the characters know, you know. What the characters see, you see. No more. No less. It is a film in which all perception is never assured, yet you feel content as long as the characters are content. He envelopes you in every situation, and the film is like your mind all reality is input, then manipulated to suit the needs of the situation the mind sees.Lynch seems to know more about human nature than most directors, as he can show you human nature without flat out, straightforwardly, SHOWING you it. For example, the scenes at Winky's. The first scene there has no bearing on the plot. It is only a visual, complete scene with characters and everything, representation of the manifestation of fear in Naomi Watts' characters' mind about the area surrounding the Winky's. The dirty man behind winky's is not a real person. He is the manifestation of all fear, and everything that is bad. He is there, at Winky's, when Naomi Watts' character tries to get her Laura Elena Hardins' character killed. He is the one from which the conscience which kills Naomi's character springs from. He is who has the 'Blue Box' (watch it and you'll get it). He is the representation of all fearful, bad things. This movie, in addition to all things above, does what i believe a great film (and filmmaker) should be able to do Say everything that needs to be said without a word being said about it. The stuff on the screen speaks for itself. Turn off the volume. It'll still be amazing. The stuff from the speakers does too. Close your eyes; it'll be just as great.

Naomi Watts gives an amazing performance mastering TWO characters, who, although (my interpretation) either one of which can be a mental creation of the other, have different natures. One is real, the other is not. Just like in this film. Everything can be real and unreal at the same time. Everything real is also unreal. This may all sound quite confusing, and it is, honestly. If you are a person who cares for straightforward(sorry if i sound pretentious), moderately bland, pure money-making films; even if you love all films, but can't stand to not understand them, then don't watch David Lynch films. But even if you are those people, watch this film, and be annoyed, sure, but respect the art that Lynch puts up there on the screen. Pure, unfiltered, visual, kinetic art. This film brings together all the visual techniques light, sound, music, movement, actors, costumes, props, locations, facial expressions, fades, effects and all were done, at least with Lynch over the shoulder of the workers, if not by him personally. He manipulates you; your mind in this film, and twists your perception of reality. What the characters know, you know. What the characters see, you see. No more. No less. It is a film in which all perception is never assured, yet you feel content as long as the characters are content. He envelopes you in every situation, and the film is like your mind all reality is input, then manipulated to suit the needs of the situation the mind sees.Lynch seems to know more about human nature than most directors, as he can show you human nature without flat out, straightforwardly, SHOWING you it. For example, the scenes at Winky's. The first scene there has no bearing on the plot. It is only a visual, complete scene with characters and everything, representation of the manifestation of fear in Naomi Watts' characters' mind about the area surrounding the Winky's. The dirty man behind winky's is not a real person. He is the manifestation of all fear, and everything that is bad. He is there, at Winky's, when Naomi Watts' character tries to get her Laura Elena Hardins' character killed. He is the one from which the conscience which kills Naomi's character springs from. He is who has the 'Blue Box' (watch it and you'll get it). He is the representation of all fearful, bad things. This movie, in addition to all things above, does what i believe a great film (and filmmaker) should be able to do Say everything that needs to be said without a word being said about it. The stuff on the screen speaks for itself. Turn off the volume. It'll still be amazing. The stuff from the speakers does too. Close your eyes; it'll be just as great. That is what film-making is all about.

It is a great film, with still stunning special effects. I think even in the actual 21st century, with all of the computer generated, and other hight tech visual and special effects, this movie still delivers.The plot is great with the theme of technology gone berserk. The actors give good performances and the technical crew did an amazing job of making the audience believe these guys are actually in outer space.I'm not real sure how far off the book that Kubrick got, but I'm aware that he and Arthur C. Clark had many arguments about the script. Although the movie clearly can stand alone, it is helpful to see or read the sequel 2010. Though the film 2010 isn't as good as 2001, it is very good visually, and features some good performance from John Lithgow, and Roy Schieder. There is also a third book by Clark, 3001 the Final Odyssey which completes the story. I'd be surprised if that ever makes it onto the big screen though.

(In the army, no less, which is just the place *I* would go if I wanted to find to a peaceful solution with the native American people.) I do wish that the movies would just show what happened without the characters of Basil Exposition and The Preacher, so we can form our own conclusions.This movie is no exception, focusing on the Apache War, with Jason Patric playing Lt. Gatewood - speaking the very language of the Apache - pointing out to his commanding officer the errors of Indian policy. Matt Daman trots along in his wake and explains other concerns helpfully. Both look sincere and concerned, with Jason showing religious fervor and Matt looking terribly naive. Robert Duvall is excellent (as always); Wes Studi is solid as Geronimo.The scenery (if you neglect to note the transportation implications as they race from one lovely monument several hours by car to another while raiding in the space of minutes) is lovely, and the soldiers look suitably tired and scruffy.

Well, so, as one reviewer pointed out, we weren't there, but we do know some details because the people that were there kept diaries and wrote letters, and we can compare what people wrote, and they all agreed on certain things. Unfortunately, Hollywood used what was handy and ignored a few important details.So now some viewers will probably think they know something about Geronimo's life that isn't true, especially the poor junior high school kid cheating on some report by watching the movie. It's just irresponsible for movie makers to distort basic and important facts for the sake of the story.This movie was beautifully photographed, well acted, and brings visibility in an highly poignant fashion to the suffering of the Native American to those who may have missed all the other movies. If they'd ridden their horses just a little closer to the facts, they would have had a much tighter story on Geronimo.
