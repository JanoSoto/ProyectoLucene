Anyway the film is so marvelously done that even if you know you still get the chills. I was really impressed with Hart Bochner performance, mostly because he has the kind of face which usually is cast in an afternoon soap opera and though his character is mostly physical, he never plays it at a first level. I'm very moved each time I see him cry.  It could have been so easy to over do it, to be pathetic or melodramatic but instead he is touching and true. As for the part of Adrian, Colin Firth with his dark-low voice (that gives some more weirdness to the part- mostly because of the contrast with his childish face) is just brilliant.  The irony to see him play the victim as Bochner takes over Valmont's seduction is pure amazement. Everything is in the details every look, every attempt to smile, the way he walks, the way he talks and stutters.  Adrian may seem fragile but he is a survivor. Every detail in the movie adds to the actors performances the frightening neighbors (the way they invade his life is no surprise to his disliking them so much), the music, the camera shots of the living city opposed constantly to the claustrophobic dark apartment and even the apartment itself which is almost a character per se. It has its life and its secrets.  For example we never actually have a full view of the two bedrooms, we know there is a kitchen but we never see it and we only see the bathroom through a glass window.  The only space used in the apartment is the living room which gives to this thriller a feeling of a closed-room drama. I guess that if you are not bewitched by the actors the film won't do it for you.  It's not the kind of thriller only based on action plot.  The real interest of the film remains in the relation between those two different men and not in the murders themselves.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to see good and subtle acting.  It's a powerful 1h45 drama lesson!

Most uninformed people regard it as either a) a children's movie or b) a useless entry in a growing list of superhero fantasies.That Superman has the gall to take its viewer on a vivid journey through space and time into the core of imagination and science-fiction (the planet Krypton), then propel us into the Midwest for a poignant coming-of-age story, then lead us on a mission with young Clark Kent to the North Pole to physically and figuratively discover his identity, and then yank us back into a Metropolis comic-book story, only serves to underscore the underestimated brilliance of writer Mario Puzo (and a score of other writers) and director Donner.  Superman is an amazing and daring feat, much like a miracle the Man of Steel would perform himself.  It would be a severe oversight to say it's a good flick with some moments of brilliance - the whole film is a moment of brilliance.Superman has had its followers, an almost cult-like group growing over the two decades since its blockbuster release; one might say Tim Burton was a follower, which lead to his equally successful and more notorious Batman.But Superman has so much more going for it, including an indeliable, tongue-in-cheek look at the comic book hero, an underlying sense of all that is great about America, and some incredible talent (especially Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the amazing Christopher Reeve in his breakthrough dual role).Released in the late 70's, its no doubt that Donner's epic saga spoke to its haggard generation - a slew of Americans picking up the pieces from Vietnam and the fiasco of Watergate.  How fitting that audiences could turn to a fantasy film to find a new hero and leader.  For the late 70's, an American audience could watch Reeve fly over the earth and give a wink and smile to us below - a hero not without his faults, but striving to do what is noble and right in a chaotic, yet thriving world (quite the boost Americans needed after the Nixon administration).Somewhere, perhaps in the far reaches of our minds, we can find Superman soaring above the heavens, fetching cats from trees, rescuing Lois Lane from a helicopter accident, placing criminals in prisons, righting our wrongs and protecting us in the best way he can.

One may notice that in nearly every frame, there are thousands of small lights, one might even say a thousand points of light.  This is, in fact, a symbol employed by certain secret organizations to refer to their members.  On the list would be the freemasons, the Illuminati, et cetera.  It was employed by a former president of the US on a number of occasions, and this president was, in fact, a member of secret organizations.Next, when the main character enters the house where his adventure begins, where the old man has just died and the daughter makes a play for him, there is a falcon statuette in the hallway, which recures several times.  The falcon is symbolic of the Egyptian god Horus, son of Isis and Osiris.  The connection to this god is reinforced by the setting in wintertime, which is dominated astronomically by the constellation Orion, or Osiris, and the star Sirius, or Isis.  The additional use of Christmas time, the symbols of which are decendent from Roman and Egyptian festivals of light and rebirth, further enhances this connection (ie- the Christmas tree, lights, etc.).The obvious use of a Luciferian mass for the orgy is, without doubt, a reference to the secret societies.  Even the masks used are various symbols and images employed by Luciferians.  The loose and very grey morality of the characters through-out serve to enhance this reference.  Even the characters, man and wife, do not refer to physical love with any reverence.  It is simply a course and vulgar act.  And that Lucifer is the fallen star, the light of Heaven fallen to Earth, is further reflected in the use of the thousand points of light.Kubrick has even alluded to his own doubts and misgivings about himself in this area.  The way in which he allows himself to appear in reflection, not a mistake by an amateur, but purposeful, is telling.  The scenes in which the camera is visible tells us that we, too, must now suspect our own motivations.  In other words, this belief system has become so pervasive, that no one is immune to its machinations.There are many more subtle and oblate references.  For instance, the name of the restaurant in the background when the main character is being followed.  The music being played when he stops into the pub for a beer immediately after (reference the password used to enter the house).Kubrick has sent out a warning.  He is trying to wake the audience up to the hidden messages all around us.  Our eyes, he says, are wide shut.  We see, but we do not understand.

The pre-machinery days of coal mining in West Virginia are explored here through the eyes of a boy who dares to dream of a life beyond the coalfields.This movie succeeds on many levels, and most of them have been noted in reviews.  But its greatest accomplishment is the evocation of the community and lives of a people who have other wise been written out of American history.While the U.S. was booming in the post-war, places like this small town of Coalwood, West Virginia were stoking the fires of the American dream.  Required to contribute, but refused a piece of the great growth, these families are very much cognizant of their designation in society.  This film deftly shows us Homer Hickham's painful self-awareness as he tries to show colors to a people relegated to dreaming in black in white.However, this is not a film about drudgery or the downtrodden.  It is one about a town that was willing to believe in its youth, and it provides a valuable lesson for today's television-as-babysitter world.There are elements of Hickham's book which would have fit nicely within this film's framework.  The value placed on high school football over academics is but one such element, and would have helped to explain the community's mentality a little more clearly.But that is nitpicking, for this is the best of all kinds of movies  It is one which respects it subject matter, its characters, and how their lives fit in the small frame as well as the big picture.  Kudos to screenwriter Lewis Colick for appreciating Hickam's humor and the dignity of the town's citizenry.  And bravo to director Joe Johnston for instilling this talented cast with a sense of esteem.  The collaborative effort of all involved in this film make it one for the time capsule.  It reminds us who we were, how we got to where we are now, and eventually where we are going.  This film joins Charles Laughton's Night of the Hunter and John Sayle's Matewan as accurate portrayals of West Virginia and its denizens.  Without condescension or unqualified judgment, Johnston joins these directors in celebrating a people who are often dismissed as insignificant cogs, but in reality they are the engines who create a prosperity of which they are never allowed to partake.A thought to ponder as in this movie we watch Sputnik streak across the October Sky.

It is recommended that you keep a VERY open mind while watching this film, as the story gets pretty flipped-out from time to time. I found certain parts of it hard to swallow, yet bits and pieces of Matrix are truly brilliant. There are quite a few impressive fight sequences, some breathtaking and ground-breaking visual effects and a shootout scene that should be scribbled down in the record books. The message of the film is crystal clear and very ironic in these computerized times - mankind is a virus, a disease that can, should and will be cured by someone who knows better. Style AND substance, folks. The way it should be.The storyline is occasionally confusing and Keanu Reeves' acting abilities leaves a lot to be wished for, but those are minor gripes. Matrix delivers the goodies and the soundtrack is really cool. I recommend it, but not for the Schwarzenegger-crowd. This film forces you to think and participate, to probe and search for the truth alongside the characters. Not all visits to the movie theater turn out that fruitful.

They are presented as very normal teenagers who are just 'different'.Definite plus points  Fairuza Balk's acting, some great scenes, a roughly accurate perception of Wicca (OK, so still a ways off, but better than the Witches of Eastwick...!!) and a subtle moral.  For once, the Threefold Rule is presented quietly and simply, rather than having a moralistic ranting at the end of the film.Definite minus points  That poor shopkeeper character who has no good lines, the fact that the 'outsiders' are goths and wear black (come on, grow up US film makers!) and, of course, the rather weak ending for Ms. Balk.I'd recommend the film - it's deeper and less 'black and white, good and bad' than many films, but remains amusing, at times exciting and very pretty.

BTW, if anyone can explain to me what the heck dan zanes is doing in this movie or give me a copy of the song\/tell me where i can get one, it would be much appreciated; he was born in the same town as me, he's friends with my dad, ive met him and i like his music a lot!

Lili Taylor was a little too goody-goody for me, but since it was kinda required of the role, I'll let it pass.  The special effects were downright spooky.  The movie makes you jump a few times, but isn't so scary that your kids couldn't see it (also, no nudity or sexual situations, and no foul language.)  There's enough humor thrown in to counterbalance the spookiness.  All in all, not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's alot of fun and worth the price of your ticket.  I recommend it.
