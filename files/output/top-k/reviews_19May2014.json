William Castle's movies might be a bit shonky, but the gimmicks he used to publicise them are legendary. The theatres in which this movie played were equipped with glow in the dark skeletons that would trundle over the heads of the audience at the appropriate moment. How much fun would that be? However, the movies themselves don't live up to their own gimmicks, and this one, while supplying a few chills and a typically enjoyable performance from Vincent Price, is no exception.Price plays Frederick Loren, a millionaire who invites a group of strangers to a supposedly haunted house and offers them a prize of $10,000 if they manage to stay there all night. The characters are a pretty boring bunch of stock types &#x96; a sceptical psychiatrist, a screaming young woman, a heroic pilot, a spooked-out warning merchant and another woman who does virtually nothing. All of them need the money for one reason or another so they all want to see the night out &#x96; but there is something sinister afoot, and the guests find themselves assaulted by what may be a bunch of spooks.Unlike that bludgeoning bore 'The Haunting', which is probably the most famous example of the old group-of-strangers-stuck-in-a-haunted-house movie, 'House on Haunted Hill' does actually have a few creepy bits. The moaning voices at the beginning sent a shiver down my spine, and the appearance of the old woman in the cellar is an eerie moment. Castle's genre movies are usually as corny as they come, and this one has a job lot of hokey horror staples - a big spooky house, severed heads, falling chandeliers, skeletons and all the rest &#x96; so it should be good fun, but unfortunately once the set-up is out of the way the sludgy pacing and the one-note characters become boring very quickly. Rising above it all is Vincent Price, who is an invaluable presence in a movie like this. He's the perfect actor to lend credibility to less than credible movies because he can always give his characters authority no matter how dumb the movie, he always seems to believe in everything that's happening, which is why he's so great. He made plenty of duff movies, but I can't say I've ever seen him give a duff performance. So it's really Price who makes this worth watching, especially in the morbid banter between him and his wife (Carol Ohmart). Watching a Vincent Price film is never a complete waste of time, but 'House on Haunted Hill' is never really spooky or fun enough to raise it above the level of patchy dullard.

A dated, slow-paced showcase for amateur dramatics, 'The Mummy' bores from beginning to end, and even at only seventy minutes runs about an hour too long. The eerie theme music over the credits is the only mildly interesting thing the movie has to offer - because the mummy comes to life, folks, but the film never does.The 'story' starts when archaeologists dig up the mummy of Imhotep (Boris Karloff), buried alive 3,700 years earlier for falling in love with a princess. Understandably none too happy with this, Imhotep comes to life and makes a shuffle for it, turning up again ten years later to use his hypnotic powers on Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a young woman who's the reincarnation of his beloved from all those years ago. Or, to put it more accurately, he does bog all for the next hour.Some people think that this movie is a horror classic &#x96; no, seriously, they do! I have no idea why. The acting is laughable and couldn't be more stilted if the cast were literally on stilts. Only their mouths move, like in those half-assed cartoons from the Seventies. Just look at their amazement at finding out that the mummy has come to life... astonishing, the way they register no reaction whatsoever. Karloff, wasted yet again in a role with barely any dialogue, none of which is any good, is the only one who makes this worth watching.The screenplay is hopelessly melodramatic, but it's hard to see why the writers bothered when the acting's so listless. The pace isn't much better this thing moves along like a-- well, it barely moves along. It's as though the film makers were aware they had barely enough story to fill a short and padded it out with as much dead air as possible; we also have such time wasters as a redundant prologue and the subtle device of Imhotep's handy flashback pond, which shows him being buried alive, something we've already heard about and don't really need to be shown.

Directed by Carl Schultz, the movie reference to the seven seals described in the Book of Revelation, the final book of the New Testament of the Bible. Sadly, I wish I was watching Ingmar Bergman 1957's Seventh Seal, 1976's Omen or 1968's Rosemary Baby, instead of this. This movie didn't had the large budget, or the eerie presence in its script to pull off the Day of Reckoning vibe. The seven seals in this film seem weak for the most part as you as the audience see only small bits of its power; from small earthquake that only the camera can feel. To the oddly cut, the scene of one river turning red, but other rivers nearby are alright to drink. To how oddly, the seal boiled the ocean around Haiti to the point, it kills the fishes, but not human beings feet or knee deep in the tide. It's not creepy at all. Where is the scary fire and brimstone!? It's disappointing, because the movie has no mention of the opening of the first four seals which calls for the Four Horsemen, each with their own specific mission to attack the world. Where are they, in the movie? How come, they weren't mention? The movie takes too much in creative license in the Seven Seals that it no way, felt accurate or solid. The movie kinda drop the plot line half way through the film, as the letters from stop being open, and things just happen to happen. Anyways, none of those events, really matter to the main plot, only serving as background to the real meat of the story. Doing the opposite of what Demi Moore's similar character in 1996's 'If this walls could talk' does, a pregnant wife, Abby Quinn (Demi Moore) pursuits to save her unborn child from being abortion by God's plans. Yes, the seventh sign is really about the morals of abortion. The movie really felt like they, the producers were trying so hard to fit, two different type of movies into one. How in the dogma hell, did you get that, from the interpretation of the bible's Seventh Seal? I don't see seven angelic trumpeters who in turn cue the seven bowl judgments as a metaphor to abortion. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away from this movie, as it doesn't make lick of any sense. Honestly, this movie doesn't know the different between the Seventh Seal and that of the Guf. If the movie was call the 'Guf' based off, Jewish mythology. This abortion plot would make more sense, because in the film and in the myth, The Guf is the Chamber of souls, where souls of the tree of life fall into. When heaven ran out of souls, the world starts to die, as there is bodies in which has no souls to put into. The movie makes it even more confusing, as Abby is haunted by the memories of not saving for Jesus during the Crucifixion. Yes, Abby is doom to have miscarriages throughout her life, because she didn't die for Jesus. Awful jarred preachy message, there. How does, one giving one's life to Jesus, save the world, anyways? You're still going to run out of souls & people are still going to die. Somehow, it did in this movie. In the end, she doesn't really give in to Jesus, anyways, but God and Jesus is like, let's put this apocalypse on hold, because the mother was willing to trade deaths with her unborn child. If the movie is saying that, then the whole Guf running out plot doesn't make sense. Honestly, how do you run out of souls, if reincarnation can happen in this world? It would seem like abortion would be more welcome, if reincarnation tend to give souls, bodies after bodies, time after time. It's not like she give away her soul to somebody who didn't had a soul, anyways, because a soul is what makes you, you. She just put her soul in a new body. To be truthful, the whole idea of God's judgment day ending the world is dumb, in the first place since God giving human, free will is an illusion joke. Needed to say, the cheesy faux-apocalyptic is too pad out to make sense. The movie pacing is awful. Lots of oddly place drawn out boring exposition scenes like the meteorologist scene, or the young Jew that Abbey befriend chatting with a Christian priest scene. It would be cut out. Then, there is the nudity that wasn't needed to the point, because it made no sense. If she wanted to save her child, why was she going to kill herself? Without spoiling too much of it, there is a few semi-good twist and turns, here, involving both Demi Moore's Abby Quinn's character and that of Jürgen Prochnow's David Bannon. Surprising, most of the acting in this movie is pretty good, but deeply limited. The one actor that stood out is Jürgen Prochnow who can play mysterious roles, very well. His performance is brilliant. The thing that stop the acting from being great was the exposition. The delivery of those lines are just out of place. The score music by Jack Nitzsche was alright. Nothing too worth noting. It did combines some orchestral themes with the sounds of Gregorian monks like chanting. It makes certain scenes, watchable. Sadly the production suck. Depending if you're watching this on VCR or DVD, its color saturation in this transfer is muted and drab. This reflection both how dated of the film is and the seemingly independent, low budget television-oriented production, it had. Overall It plays out like a Lifetime TV lecture drama about the power of faith, than a thriller. If they kept it closer to a horror movie, than a preachy movie. It might be more entertaining.

Honestly, this movie doesn't know the different between the Seventh Seal and that of the Guf. If the movie was call the 'Guf' based off, Jewish mythology. This abortion plot would make more sense, because in the film and in the myth, The Guf is the Chamber of souls, where souls of the tree of life fall into. When heaven ran out of souls, the world starts to die, as there is bodies in which has no souls to put into. The movie makes it even more confusing, as Abby is haunted by the memories of not saving for Jesus during the Crucifixion. Yes, Abby is doom to have miscarriages throughout her life, because she didn't die for Jesus. Awful jarred preachy message, there. How does, one giving one's life to Jesus, save the world, anyways? You're still going to run out of souls & people are still going to die. Somehow, it did in this movie. In the end, she doesn't really give in to Jesus, anyways, but God and Jesus is like, let's put this apocalypse on hold, because the mother was willing to trade deaths with her unborn child. If the movie is saying that, then the whole Guf running out plot doesn't make sense. Honestly, how do you run out of souls, if reincarnation can happen in this world? It would seem like abortion would be more welcome, if reincarnation tend to give souls, bodies after bodies, time after time. It's not like she give away her soul to somebody who didn't had a soul, anyways, because a soul is what makes you, you. She just put her soul in a new body. To be truthful, the whole idea of God's judgment day ending the world is dumb, in the first place since God giving human, free will is an illusion joke. Needed to say, the cheesy faux-apocalyptic is too pad out to make sense. The movie pacing is awful. Lots of oddly place drawn out boring exposition scenes like the meteorologist scene, or the young Jew that Abbey befriend chatting with a Christian priest scene. It would be cut out. Then, there is the nudity that wasn't needed to the point, because it made no sense. If she wanted to save her child, why was she going to kill herself? Without spoiling too much of it, there is a few semi-good twist and turns, here, involving both Demi Moore's Abby Quinn's character and that of Jürgen Prochnow's David Bannon. Surprising, most of the acting in this movie is pretty good, but deeply limited. The one actor that stood out is Jürgen Prochnow who can play mysterious roles, very well. His performance is brilliant. The thing that stop the acting from being great was the exposition. The delivery of those lines are just out of place. The score music by Jack Nitzsche was alright. Nothing too worth noting. It did combines some orchestral themes with the sounds of Gregorian monks like chanting. It makes certain scenes, watchable. Sadly the production suck. Depending if you're watching this on VCR or DVD, its color saturation in this transfer is muted and drab. This reflection both how dated of the film is and the seemingly independent, low budget television-oriented production, it had. Overall It plays out like a Lifetime TV lecture drama about the power of faith, than a thriller. If they kept it closer to a horror movie, than a preachy movie. It might be more entertaining.

He sees the world from the television that was put in his room at the palatial mansion where he works. His daily meals are prepared by the house cook and life is very controlled. The gardener's life makes perfect sense. That is until his employer, the owner of the mansion.... the old man, dies. That is when all the other staff members leave the home and Chance is left without a place to go. After attorneys come to discover him living in the empty home, he understands he must leave his garden.The mansion was his only home, his only family and with the old man gone, Chance is left to fend for himself in a world he has never seen before, except on TV. Totally perplexed by his circumstance, he packs up his things and sets off into the world to find another garden to tend.His adventure into the world outside the walls of the mansion send him into Washington politics when he is accidentally hit buy a limousine owned by Benjamin Rand, a political big wig who's wife (Shirley McClaine) allows Chance to be taken into their home after the accident. Chance is then given a room and is introduced to the guests and dignitaries who frequent the home. He only want is to be given a new room and a garden to tend. But everything he says is misunderstood to have great, deep meaning and no one thinks he is a gardener.During a political dinner at the mansion, Chance meets the US president and is quoted in his speech to the world. The simple observations of this very simple man have such profound misinterpretations that Chance is elevated to the highest esteem of the first family and beyond.While all this money, power and prestige surrounds him, Chance's simple talk of caring for his garden is misunderstood as metaphors of lofty offices and powerful interests. Chance is interviewed on television where he professes his philosophy about gardens, the people hearing what he says, take him as a great profit. He is famously endorsed and elevated as an icon.This movie is a hoot and will have you laughing on the floor. It holds up to the test of time, I saw it again last night and it was just as powerful and pertinent as it was in 1979 when it was first released. Peter Sellers was never more hilarious and some of the scenes are pop classics. Chance is really just a simple gardener that became a TV junky who likes to watch. The precursor to Forest Gump.

Indeed, the final third of the story rips off The Exorcist so much it's a wonder the film-makers didn't face legal action. But for what it is - a very loose version of the original serial murders that took place at 112 Ocean Avenue in November 1974 - it isn't bad.Where the original film was laughable in the extreme, this one at least has some narrative interest. Unfortunately the film is overloaded with supernatural goings on to the point of silliness. That's not to say it doesn't have effective moments, such as when Sonny puts the shotgun to his father's head during a family argument (possibly based on a real happening regarding the DeFeos). The movie also features a decent performance from James Olson in the same sort of role Rod Steiger ridiculously over-egged in the original. Mostly he's quiet dignity in the face of all the horrors, and he does it very well.Tommy Lee Wallace turns in an okay script, though the incest sub plot might jar with some viewers; and there are some nice camera tricks from director Damiano Damiani and pretty convincing make up effects. The film also has a fine music score.After the murders (which surprisingly come about 50 minutes in) it goes a little downhill - a descent into sub-Exorcist territory. But overall this ain't too bad. It might have been much better if the movie was a factual account of the actual DeFeo murders, but this probably wasn't permissible for legal reasons.
