This film is getting some of the worst reviews of the year. This film was phenomenal.  However, the film should have been titled, I Still Know What You Did That Summer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this more than the awesome Halloween H20.  Granted, it really didn't scare me very much, but it was pounded over the head with suspense all the way through. Everyone's downing the performances, I thought they were great.  Jennifer Love Hewitt was very convincing in her role as the traumatized victim.  She never overacted, which is typical for a horror film.  Her character has really developed and grown since the original.  She is much stronger and it was a joy to watch her make that transition.  I find her an amazing actress. She has a wonderful presence in Party Of Five as she does here.  I have seen so many horrible actresses lately for instance, Maria Pitillo (Godzilla) and Denise Richards (Starship Troopers). Brandy was fine also. She got the most negative criticism for her performance.  I felt she brought what she needed to the role.  Basically, it was Brandy being Brandy, and she really didn't need anything else.  Considerably, I am no dummy.  Right now, I'm an acting student at University Of Illinois, so I know bad acting when I see it.  There was none in this picture.  Plus, it's a horror film.  Don't expect Saving Private Ryan.  That's not what it's made for.  It's just a horror film, a superior at that.  This film blew the original right out of the water.  Compared to this, I Know What You Did Last Summer was crap. For once, Kevin Williamson was outdone, dramatically.  Also, so what that the film left it open for a sequel.  I knew before then and I still loved it.  This is the best horror film to come out since Scream.  However, I have concluded one thing.  This film wasn't really about the killer.  It was about Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts.  I haven't seen so much cleavage in a film in a long time.  I'm not complaining.  Jennifer's the most beautiful young woman in Hollywood, no joke.  She combines beauty and brains in this motion picture and I would see it again in a heartbeat.

However, to like the movie as much as my friend and I did, you have to have a proper appreciation of classic B Movies. While Vampires might not be a B Movie in the technical definition of the word, it most definitely has a B Movie feel to it. Let me put it this way If you loved Army of Darkness, you'll likely enjoy Vampires. They're very similar, in fact. The main characters are both loudmouthed macho jerks who spout incredibly cool lines. Just as Ash never needs to reload his shotgun, James Wood's character never needs to reload his crossbow, which in this case is even more laughable, yet wholly irrelevant to enjoying the film. There is a rather unpleasant misogynistic side to the movie, which is my main criticism of the movie. It goes without saying that this is a guy film to be seen with one's male buddies, as opposed to, say, most Mel Gibson action flicks which many women enjoy along with men (Braveheart, Conspiracy Theory). Of course, if the woman in question likes being treated as just one of the guys, and appreciates B Movies like Army of Darkness, by all means, see it. The main selling points of the movie are hardcore action, gratuitous nudity, witty macho dialogue (much better than Schwarzenegger's crapulent tripe, but you should have guessed that by the fact that the movie stars the grizzled James Woods), some decent gore, and a few interesting concepts such as the church's involvement, relics, and the always interesting vampire concept, which always varies from movie to movie. I shall now compare Vampires to Blade and  From Dusk Till Dawn, two other relatively recent modern-era vampire flicks, both of which I enjoyed. Blade and Vampires, while similar in concept, have very different settings. Blade is an urban tale, filled with martial-arts-type fighting, a black main character, realistic gore, and the concept of vampires having an organized underworld society, and it should be noted that the main hero was conceived as a comic book character, and thus killing is treated as a serious business. Vampires is a modern western, with mindless shooting, punching, and general butt-kicking, with gore to a similar degree as Blade, yet far less visual realism (i.e. poor gore effects); the main character is an obnoxious jerk and killing is more amusing and entertaining than meaningful. Blade, I thought, was a cool movie, but I liked Vampires even better as it was a lot funnier and filled with tough-guy, wisecracking, butt-kicking western-style characters. However, I thought both are eclipsed by From Dusk Till Dawn. To start, compare Vampire's hooker party with the now-legendary Titty Twister Club.  From Dusk Till Dawn had much better effects. From Dusk Till Dawn slaughtered its characters slowly, instead of wasting them all at the beginning. Of course, From Dusk Till Dawn had a boring, meandering beginning that attempted to be a plot with quasi-serious character treatments. Considering the real point of that movie was the vampires, they should have made the beginning move a lot faster, since once they get to the Titty Twister Club, most of the beginning becomes completely irrelevant. However, if From Dusk Till Dawn started right at the Titty Twister scene, there would be no question that it was better than Vampires, which concentrates it's action scenes at the beginning and end, and makes you sit through a middle that is full of funny and entertaining lines but little action. Salma Hayek gave a much more masterful performance than any of bthe women in Vampires. Woods was much better than Clooney, but there's no comparing Danny Dullness Baldwin with Quentin Tarantino in terms of sidekicks. The actual depiction of the vampires themselves is similar in character (bloody thirsty monsters, unlike the more refined and intelligent ones in Blade) yet different in style (the Master Vampire of Vampires was a pretty spooky human predator, where as the vampires of FDTDawn were more demonic in appearance).

However, to like the movie as much as my friend and I did, you have to have a proper appreciation of classic B Movies. While Vampires might not be a B Movie in the technical definition of the word, it most definitely has a B Movie feel to it. Let me put it this way If you loved Army of Darkness, you'll likely enjoy Vampires. They're very similar, in fact. The main characters are both loudmouthed macho jerks who spout incredibly cool lines. Just as Ash never needs to reload his shotgun, James Wood's character never needs to reload his crossbow, which in this case is even more laughable, yet wholly irrelevant to enjoying the film. There is a rather unpleasant misogynistic side to the movie, which is my main criticism of the movie. It goes without saying that this is a guy film to be seen with one's male buddies, as opposed to, say, most Mel Gibson action flicks which many women enjoy along with men (Braveheart, Conspiracy Theory). Of course, if the woman in question likes being treated as just one of the guys, and appreciates B Movies like Army of Darkness, by all means, see it. The main selling points of the movie are hardcore action, gratuitous nudity, witty macho dialogue (much better than Schwarzenegger's crapulent tripe, but you should have guessed that by the fact that the movie stars the grizzled James Woods), some decent gore, and a few interesting concepts such as the church's involvement, relics, and the always interesting vampire concept, which always varies from movie to movie. I shall now compare Vampires to Blade and  From Dusk Till Dawn, two other relatively recent modern-era vampire flicks, both of which I enjoyed. Blade and Vampires, while similar in concept, have very different settings. Blade is an urban tale, filled with martial-arts-type fighting, a black main character, realistic gore, and the concept of vampires having an organized underworld society, and it should be noted that the main hero was conceived as a comic book character, and thus killing is treated as a serious business. Vampires is a modern western, with mindless shooting, punching, and general butt-kicking, with gore to a similar degree as Blade, yet far less visual realism (i.e. poor gore effects); the main character is an obnoxious jerk and killing is more amusing and entertaining than meaningful. Blade, I thought, was a cool movie, but I liked Vampires even better as it was a lot funnier and filled with tough-guy, wisecracking, butt-kicking western-style characters. However, I thought both are eclipsed by From Dusk Till Dawn. To start, compare Vampire's hooker party with the now-legendary Titty Twister Club.  From Dusk Till Dawn had much better effects. From Dusk Till Dawn slaughtered its characters slowly, instead of wasting them all at the beginning. Of course, From Dusk Till Dawn had a boring, meandering beginning that attempted to be a plot with quasi-serious character treatments. Considering the real point of that movie was the vampires, they should have made the beginning move a lot faster, since once they get to the Titty Twister Club, most of the beginning becomes completely irrelevant. However, if From Dusk Till Dawn started right at the Titty Twister scene, there would be no question that it was better than Vampires, which concentrates it's action scenes at the beginning and end, and makes you sit through a middle that is full of funny and entertaining lines but little action. Salma Hayek gave a much more masterful performance than any of bthe women in Vampires. Woods was much better than Clooney, but there's no comparing Danny Dullness Baldwin with Quentin Tarantino in terms of sidekicks. The actual depiction of the vampires themselves is similar in character (bloody thirsty monsters, unlike the more refined and intelligent ones in Blade) yet different in style (the Master Vampire of Vampires was a pretty spooky human predator, where as the vampires of FDTDawn were more demonic in appearance).

But where Altman's film was somber and made you leave the theater wanting to kill yourself, Solondz' film makes you laugh. Its dark humor and cynicism recalls Stanley Kubrick's films. But where Kubrick's films are cold and judgmental, and his characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, Solondz makes his characters likable and sympathetic despite their destructiveness.This film features at least 5 Oscar worthy performances. If the movie had concentrated on any one of these characters, it would have been spellbinding.  The performance above all performances is by Dylan Baker as the pedophile psychologist. I don't know if I've never seen a character quite like him in any movie. (He is a monster, but he is somehow redeemed by the fact that he clearly loves his family.) Also creating characters that will live in my memory forever are Jane Adams as the loser Jordan sister (so funny and heartbreaking -- where'd she come from?), Philip Seymour Hoffman as the geek who makes obscene phone calls in his spare time for his only gratification, Cynthia Stevenson as the self-deluding housewife who professes to have a storybook life and marriage while her husband is out diddling young boys, and Louise Lasser as the grandmother dealing with a marital split in advanced age.When I was watching the film I had the horrifying but probably accurate thought that this movie is probably more representative of real life than almost any other movie I have ever seen.Acting, direction, cinematography all work together as one scene after another in this film is played out to gut-wrenching, nervous-laughter-inducing perfection.It's hard to imagine Todd Solondz, young as he is and with only 3 movies under his belt, will ever top this directorial effort.

That said, I must also say that Vampire$ by John Steakley is perhaps my favorite fiction novel.  It influenced a lot of modern vampire and vampire-hunter lore, as well as this writer's storytelling style.I never go to a movie based on a book expecting to see the book.  Jurassic Park was a lot of fun, regardless of Crichton's own self-surgery, and I loved Starship Troopers for the Nazi propaganda satire it was.  But, come ON!  There are soooo many good elements in Vampire$ it seems a shame to neglect them!No Felix??  He's the catalyst of the story!  No Jack Crow becoming a Vampire at the end?  Hoping for a sequel, Mr. Carpenter?  Fat chance.  Carl Joplin and Annabelle were also sorely missed.I will say that the characters of Father Adam and Valek were faithfully plucked from the book (although Valek was severely neglected in terms of development).  Okay, transplanting Davette into the hooker Katrina made a certain amount of movie sense, but all Cheryl Lee did was writhe around and roll her eyes like some psychotic crack whore, which she is eminently qualified to do (and not that I'm complaining -- her performance was... um, riveting).Combining the characters of Cherry Cat and Montoya into Daniel Baldwin's best Reservoir Dogs impersonation was bearable, and James Woods honestly comes as close to being Jack Crow as I could expect, with the two following problems 1) Jack Crow would never need to steal a car (that was just stupid), and 2) the neat thing about Jack Crow is that he's tough as nails on the outside, but is slowly withering away on the inside, watching all his friends die and crying in the Pope's lap.  No development for the movie Crow, aside from the revelation that he killed his vampiric father and he likes to hurt people (did like the wood references, though).The basic theme of the book is that there's this bunch of ex-football players and commandos and such who drive around in a semi, ridding decent God-fearing communities of their vampire problem and getting paid HUGE sums of money to do it, and knowing that eventually, they're all going to die. The basic theme of the movie is that there's this handful of tough guys slaying vampires in the southwest.It's a western.It's a bad western.As a vampire flick, it's kinda fun.  Near Dark was much better.As any kind of tribute or slight nod to John Steakley's well-crafted characters, it is a travesty.And it's number 8 out of the top 10 box office offerings for last week.  All hail the almighty dollar!Haven't heard of any film adaptations of Armor yet, but I hope he doesn't let Carpenter near it.
