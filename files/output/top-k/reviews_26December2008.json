Let us start with the three top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband, the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But, from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film, and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love. The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated, without the character (in his physical being and internal composition) of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose melodrama.Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather one dimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. His attraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashback scenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak of higher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No. That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it's not a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only look at contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales in contrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, not Rick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that she would have stayed with Rick, no matter. But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that it simply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There is nothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically or performance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the other highly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001 A Space Odyssey, Casablanca comes up short, way short. On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing (and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if, objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting. Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the most decisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrong for several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies toward films or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has been claimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems. Ah, the flicker of illusion!

The setting for this film as being after WWI, and entering into the great depression separates the story from being exclusively about money, or an individual character. Although, this movie is titled, The Legend of Bagger Vance, this film is not about Bagger Vance. Sure, Bagger Vance had a big role in transforming Matt Damon's character. This film is about fear, and personal doubt, and the ability to overcome our own obstacles.Using Golf as the subject is terrific, being that it is a sport which, is ultimately about competing against yourself.

What a waste of 93 minutes. The viewing was in the afternoon, around 200, and I could barely keep my eyes open while watching this snore-fest.This movie is not funny. Many of my fellow students were laughing at Allen just because he is such a loser and over-analyzes everything. Well whoop-dee-doo. There is no explosiveness to this alone...it's like telling the story of a joke but forgetting the punchline. But this style of comedy is praised because it's supposedly sophisticated. Yeah, right. There was only one sophisticated joke that made me laugh. This joke was about meta-physics, and I actually let out a brief chuckle. There were 30 people screening the movie with me, and it went over every one of their heads. Yes, I was the only one who understood the joke enough to laugh. I'm considered to be a pretty sophisticated guy, and it's a sad testament to a film if it does not even appeal to its target audience. That's because anyone who is intelligent enough to know what these Woody Allen sex and obscurity jokes actually mean has enough sense not to laugh at the trash. This just reinforces the fact that it's overrated.Another reason why I say confidently that not only Annie Hall is overrated, but Woody Allen in general is that he received multiple Oscar nominations. What a joke. You're telling me that Woody Allen is the best director, best screenwriter, and one of the best actors in a leading role? For this garbage? Well, I guess it's safe to say that Woody Allen single handedly beat the entire film industry with this movie then. When Orson Welles received similar praise from the Academy for Citizen Kane, it was 1941, and he beat the odds by making a decent flick back when movies had an excuse to suck...and there was almost no quality competition.This film should be praised for its realism, seeing as it is just as funny as your average Joe Schmoe's non-eventful life...which isn't worth viewing in the first place.

It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, nothing personal, here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new chapter in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor\/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)?

The man is often falsely accused as in The Wrong Man or The 39 Steps. Or accidentally enters into a world of horrors that they can't escape as in The Birds or Psycho. And sometimes the lead accidentally becomes part of a large conspiracy in which they are forced to participate as in North by Northwest and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Hithchcock is fond of the reluctant hero or heroine, people who fall into impossibly difficult situations that they did not choose for themselves. In this way his movies, even those that would not be labeled horror films, are like nightmares. The protagonist wants to scream out this can't be happening, but barely has time to think as the rogue crop duster bears down on him trying to slice him in half. We tend to identify with the Hitchcock hero who is often ordinary--though still very much movie stars--whether they be Cary Grant living at home with his mother or hardworking family man Henry Fonda.The Lady Vanishes is the other type of Hitchcock film--the type where two would-be lovers throw themselves into intrigue partly out of boredom and partly as a means to romance one another. As in Rear Window where a crippled photographer played by James Stewart and a pining Grace Kelly become voyeurs and then detectives, Lady features bride-in-waiting Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) on a journey to meet her fiancée where she begins to tussle and then solve a mystery with arrogant joker and folk musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave).While on a train journey through the fictional European country of Mandrika, Iris notices that Miss Froy, the kindly old lady who was sharing a compartment with her, doesn't seem to be on the train anymore. Partly out of a need to forestall the doldrums of an unwanted marriage and partly because of the needs of the script, Iris throws herself wholeheartedly into finding the missing Miss Froy. Gilbert, seeing an opening, joins her in a quest. The plot thickens when other passengers claim to have never seen the little old English woman. We are then asked to contemplate whether Iris--who did suffer a blow to the head earlier in the film--might be imagining Miss Froy or whether some sinister conspiracy is actually at work. (A similar question is at the heart of the ludicrous, not very funny, but highly watchable Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan).Vanishes while ostensibly a mystery is just as much a comedy. Like Nick and Nora in The Thin Man series, Iris and Gilbert trade bon mots and blows with bad guys while trying to figure out the mystery. The mystery is a device upon which to hang a comedy of manners. Joining Iris and Gilbert in their comic quest are two stoic British gentlemen who are more concerned with returning to England in time to catch a cricket match than with the increasingly bizarre plot going on around them. Their continued stoical perturbation in the face of mystery and violence is a running joke throughout the film. This joke reaches a glorious comic crescendo when the bullets begin to fly in the film's climax.And what a climax it is as the train's British passengers are faced with a showdown at high tea. The nation of Mandrika confronts the English on the train and they, though repeatedly denying Iris's claims and need to take action, find their backs against the wall. Among them is a pacifist who as the action heightens becomes cowardice embodied. It is in this climax that the film becomes unexpectedly political. The Lady Vanishes released in 1938 between the two world wars, is a comment on the coming conflict and the necessity of war. British who are not willing to enter the fray are naive or foolish.As they are in other Hithcock films, the women of Vanishes are smart, brave, and resourceful. They frequently lead the charge in the film while the men try to keep up. Hitchcock reportedly had testy relationships with his female co-stars, but he frequently provided them with meaty roles. Most movies, even contemporary ones, are likely to relegate female stars to weak supporting roles where they anxiously stand by while male costars do the fighting. But The Lady Vanishes turns on the actions of several strong female characters.Vanishes is above all a comedy and this intentionally or not takes the edge off the suspense. We are pretty sure all will work out in the end because the barb trading leads need to end up together. It could be argued that the film goes off the rails in the final third when the absurd plot drives the film toward a violent, tone shifting climax, but I found it in keeping with the delightful absurdity on display throughout the film.In fact each of the film's three acts have there own unique tone. In the first, the cast is stranded by snow in a small rail-side hotel and each is introduced in short, comic vignettes. In the second, the mystery is afoot. By the third act, the mystery is largely solved, but a violent conflict erupts. The film under the steady hand of Hitchcock successfully fits these disparate pieces together. While not Hitchcock's best, it still is a fun, unique film that will keep you entertained.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"26 December 2008","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Alfred Hitchcock is fond of telling the story of one man fighting against staggering odds. The man is often falsely accused as in The Wrong Man or The 39 Steps. Or accidentally enters into a world of horrors that they can't escape as in The Birds or Psycho. And sometimes the lead accidentally becomes part of a large conspiracy in which they are forced to participate as in North by Northwest and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Hithchcock is fond of the reluctant hero or heroine, people who fall into impossibly difficult situations that they did not choose for themselves. In this way his movies, even those that would not be labeled horror films, are like nightmares. The protagonist wants to scream out this can't be happening, but barely has time to think as the rogue crop duster bears down on him trying to slice him in half. We tend to identify with the Hitchcock hero who is often ordinary--though still very much movie stars--whether they be Cary Grant living at home with his mother or hardworking family man Henry Fonda.The Lady Vanishes is the other type of Hitchcock film--the type where two would-be lovers throw themselves into intrigue partly out of boredom and partly as a means to romance one another. As in Rear Window where a crippled photographer played by James Stewart and a pining Grace Kelly become voyeurs and then detectives, Lady features bride-in-waiting Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) on a journey to meet her fiancée where she begins to tussle and then solve a mystery with arrogant joker and folk musician Gilbert (Michael Redgrave).While on a train journey through the fictional European country of Mandrika, Iris notices that Miss Froy, the kindly old lady who was sharing a compartment with her, doesn't seem to be on the train anymore. Partly out of a need to forestall the doldrums of an unwanted marriage and partly because of the needs of the script, Iris throws herself wholeheartedly into finding the missing Miss Froy. Gilbert, seeing an opening, joins her in a quest. The plot thickens when other passengers claim to have never seen the little old English woman. We are then asked to contemplate whether Iris--who did suffer a blow to the head earlier in the film--might be imagining Miss Froy or whether some sinister conspiracy is actually at work. (A similar question is at the heart of the ludicrous, not very funny, but highly watchable Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan).Vanishes while ostensibly a mystery is just as much a comedy. Like Nick and Nora in The Thin Man series, Iris and Gilbert trade bon mots and blows with bad guys while trying to figure out the mystery. The mystery is a device upon which to hang a comedy of manners. Joining Iris and Gilbert in their comic quest are two stoic British gentlemen who are more concerned with returning to England in time to catch a cricket match than with the increasingly bizarre plot going on around them. Their continued stoical perturbation in the face of mystery and violence is a running joke throughout the film. This joke reaches a glorious comic crescendo when the bullets begin to fly in the film's climax.And what a climax it is as the train's British passengers are faced with a showdown at high tea. The nation of Mandrika confronts the English on the train and they, though repeatedly denying Iris's claims and need to take action, find their backs against the wall. Among them is a pacifist who as the action heightens becomes cowardice embodied. It is in this climax that the film becomes unexpectedly political. The Lady Vanishes released in 1938 between the two world wars, is a comment on the coming conflict and the necessity of war. British who are not willing to enter the fray are naive or foolish.As they are in other Hithcock films, the women of Vanishes are smart, brave, and resourceful.

It encapsulates the stage show, while making the necessary changes to make it a workable movie.Based on the life of Argentina's glamour couple Eva and Juan Perron, this film follows Eva's life from her childhood through to her death. It depicts her almost obsessive climb from lower class poverty to the darling of Argentina as she does anything in her power to climb through the social classes.Madonna gives what is possibly the best performance of her acting career. She appears to really get into the character and seems to relate to Eva in a way she doesn't in most of her other films. There are a number of similarities between Eva and Madonna that are quite fun to pick out. She is basically in her element in this film, as it is basically a 2 hour long video clip - and her talents certainly lie in singing, dancing and music videos as opposed to straight drama.Antonio Banderas is great in the apathetic role of Che, a character who narrates the film. He is dripping with the necessary distaste, sarcasm and distrust the part requires. He has a great singing voice that, surprisingly, goes very well with Madonna's.The visuals in this movie are a treat, with amazing attention to detail, vivid colours and an array of amazing costumes.My only criticism is that it starts to drag a bit toward the end, but it ends on an impressive note.This is a film I could watch repeatedly and enjoy on different levels each time. However, I can totally understand why some people don't like it. If you don't like musicals DO NOT watch this!!! There are only about 10 lines of dialogue in the whole film, the rest is sung!

Three men go gold prospecting and one of them goes nuts. But Raymond Chandler's plots, of which this is one, defy facile description, let alone analysis.I understand that William Faulkner is given lead credit for the writing but I can't imagine he had very much to do with it. Faulkner wasn't sober all that often -- Old corn-drinking mellifluous, Hemingway called him -- and description, not dialog, was Faulkner's forte anyway.Anyhow I'm not going to bother much with the plot. Half-way through, Humphrey Bogart, as Chandler's private detective, Philip Marlowe, appears to have satisfactorily wrapped up the case assigned to him by General Sternwood. The misbehaviors, legal and otherwise, seem to have been explained to the General and Bogart has been paid off. But Bogart decides to poke around further, on his own, largely because he's fallen in love with Sternwood's daughter, Lauren Bacall, and she with him. If someone can provide a logical link between Bogart's love for Bacall and Bogart's decision to kibbitz in events of no consequence to either of the two, I'd be grateful.Here's what Bogart tells Bacall in his office. You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out and I'm trying to find out why you're trying to find out. Amen.And -- let me ramble for a moment -- what in the name of all creatures is Geiger the crooked book dealer up to? Blackmail, somehow involving photographs of Sternwood's naughtier daughter, Carmen, the one who tries to sit in Bogart's lap while he's standing up. In Chandler's novel at least Marlowe manages to get hold of one of Geiger's books. It was filth, says Marlowe -- meaning pornography. Okay. That at least tells us what kind of illegal enterprise Geiger was involved in. Simply OWNING a copy of Lady Chatterly's Lover could wind you up in jail, never mind SELLING it. The blackmailing business is a poor substitute because it raises additional questions the movie doesn't answer. Who was being blackmailed for what? There are too many other discrepancies between the novel and the film to bother with. And Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner are no more than popular pegs for the real author -- Howard Hawks -- to hang the story on. Bogart is nearly perfect as Philip Marlowe, just as he was nearly perfect as Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade in the earlier The Maltese Falcon. Bogart and Hawks had made one previous film together but this was their last. Hawks didn't like Bogart's horning in on his supernally beautiful new find, Lauren Bacall, and sneaking off for mid-afternoon, umm, assignations.What one remembers from The Big Sleep is not the story but the characters and the exchanges between them. The Maltese Falcon at least had the search for the black bird to hold it together. This movie has nothing of the sort. Instead, we remember Bogart imitating an androgynous book collector, a scene that was improvised on the spot, as many of Hawks' memorable moments were. The movie has a kind of slapdash quality to it that keeps it from becoming more than an entertainment. Yet -- entertaining it is. It's filled with little quirky gestures, mannerisms, and apothegms.

And the little girl that portrayed the daughter did an amazing job - she was so adorable and I loved her whole my dad has been abducted by aliens thing she had going with Nicholas Cage.I think this movie has touches of Its a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol woven through it. So while it is not completely original in concept, it gives a nice modern twist to classic stores that we all can relate to.

I think it is rare that Hollywood actually endorses a solid middle class family lifestyle as being something to aspire to (as opposed to sordid affairs, and looking out for #1 type films). I like that the family portrayed is barely middle class - as opposed to living in some luxurious McMansion like a lot of films show. I think they did an accurate job of showing the chaos, love and sacrifice that a lot of us have experienced in raising our families. And that ultimately, we would choose to do it all over again if given the choice.I was surprised this got a PG13 rating with the shower scene though.

After his obnoxious uncle loses money from gambling, he begs his mother for money but she denies him of any of it. In return, he literally takes the roof off their home. In order for them to afford a new home, the family meets with a man name Ahmed, who promises to give them a new home and fix the little girl's leg. Perhan agrees to travel with Ahmed to Italy until his sister's leg and fixed and his new home is finished being built. Perhan keeps money from Ahmed little by little throughout the years. Years go by and Perhan finds out his girlfriend Azra and now pregnant but he is convinced that the baby's father is his uncle. When Azra dies after giving birth, Perhan decides to accept the baby as his son. Perhan does not see his son after that night. Eventually, Perhan finds out Ahmed uses his little sister as a beggar and after four years, they are reunited, meeting his son, Perhan Jr., for the first time.At some point Perhan is found by his grandmother at a bar drunk and dancing with multiple women. She tells him that he was once so innocent and was a grandma's boy, but now now the same anymore. He had grown up quickly while staying with Ahmed. Kusturica put magical realism into this film, showing the magical elements that included Perhan's telekinetic powers in a realistic setting. His work on this film showed brilliance with the story plot. To turn away from the film for just a minute, you may lose sight of the story quickly. Davor Dujmovic, who played the main character Perhan is impressive and very authentic. Somehow I felt that he put some of his life experiences into his role. The theme of betrayal and loss in the movie may have reflected his real life. Towards the end of the film, Perhan wasted no time taking revenge against Ahmed by using his telekinetic powers but knew he would have to sacrifice his own life in return. The music that was playing when Perhan was shot and the scene where his funeral was taking place, stuck with me for hours after the film was over. The outcome of his actions resulted in tragedy as well as his death nearly 10 years after the film was released, leaving many to question his drug habit and life outside of the big screen.
