Preston, who I usually like because of her uber-hotness, plays one of the most annoying female characters of all time.

It is the girl, it is the boy, it is the crazy one, it is the geek, it is the popular one, it is the party. I know all those things that most of the time come along in the package of a teen movie. But this film is really one good piece. I can't say great, but I can't also say bad.Here, unlike many teen comedies, we get to meet the characters. To know details and things about them, because they aren't comic creatures. They aren't one dimensional, you know? It always happen that some characters just got to be there, and don't have much development, but some others do. And it's not easy to create much development for one night only, because there is only a party.This guy, Preston. He is totally mad for this girl, so that he thinks they are meant to be. And maybe they really are. And this girl, is so trapped in her world (no matter what that world is), that she's not looking anywhere else. And if she looks, it might be too late. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry are more than alright for this characters. She (Hewitt)is gorgeous, and she doesn't need a lot of effort to play Amanda's part. It's just the part of a gorgeous girl. He (Embry) is impressive. In his eyes you can see that he has been left aside, most of the time. Embry gives some kind of depth to his characters, even if he doesn't have to. I liked him in White Squall and I understand him here.The rational character is Denise. She doesn't want anything to happen but she hasn't even tried. Ambrose gives simply the best performance of the movie. And Seth Green made me laugh. His character, Kenny, wants anything to happen, but he has looked to much, and needs to stop a little bit. As for William, well, he is that neutral character, he needs some new things in his routine. His life has been the same for too long. Many things could happen in this party.All the rest of the cast is in and out, going and leaving, talking, remembering.

It's always good to make sure you're up to speed. I actually appreciate it when sequels do that, to some extent, especially when there is such a long line of films that came previously. In this case, however, we get this montage of what we had seen before and then a whole movie of things that we had already seen before. There is literally not a scrap of originality in this entire movie, which is not a good thing in a series based almost solely on creative ways to kill people.Tina, the main character, gets mad at the beginning of the film because her dad hits her mother during a fight, so she gets into a boat and all sorts of weird things start happening. The lake starts to boil, for one thing, but more importantly, the dock that her father is standing on collapses into the lake, killing him. This is, of course, totally unique and invented for this movie, and doesn't remind me of Carrie or Firestarter at all.The movie is similar to its massively superior predecessor, Part VI, in that it starts off with characters returning to the scene of previous trauma, in this case Tina returns to the lake where her father died because, as her accompanying therapist claims, there is nothing left that they can do for her at the hospital. It just so happens that her father died at exactly the same spot as where Jason was drowned at the end of Part VI. At any rate, an undisclosed amount of time has passed, and ultimately Tina's riled emotions cause the water around Jason's body to start boiling, his eyes snap open, and the chain just falls off of him. It definitely rusted through pretty fast, given that it was in fresh water.But no matter, the movie wastes no time in piling on the horror clichés. The interesting characters from the last movie are replaced with more idiot kids who literally do absolutely nothing in this movie but have sex and get killed. YAWN. One genius opens a can of beer upside down over his face, then acts surprised when he starts choking. I couldn't wait to see this jerk get killed, but the characters are such cookie-cutter clichés that by the time he was killed I had lost track of who was who.And no points for guessing that the doctor is not really there to help Tina. It becomes quite obvious very soon in the film that he's not really going to help her much if he keeps insisting to her face that she's insane.But listen to this setup &#150; a guy is making out with his girlfriend in the woods (people always found ways to end up in the woods alone at night in this movie). She says she's cold and will he go get some firewood. Why don't we just get in a sleeping bag, he says. Ultimately, he agrees to go get wood, gives a bad Terminator line and then, get this, he walks out into the woods WITH A MACHETE, leaving his girlfriend alone. She promptly crawls inside the tent, closes the flap, gets into the sleeping bag, and waits to get killed. Is this the best they could offer?The sad thing is that the entire movie is filled with enormously clichéd horror movie setups exactly like this one. Later in the film, some blonde girl tells some geek to come skinny dipping with her in the middle of the night, to which he reluctantly agrees. Needless to say he not only doesn't make it into the water, he doesn't even manage to get undressed. Is there going to be a scrap of originality in this entire movie?I can tell you right now, the answer is no. I just saved you an hour and a half. The most original thing that this movie does is that, after the Screeching Cat scare (I'm willing to believe that the production team made it a point to put that dinosaur egg into the movie), they threw in some thunder and lightning, just in case the cat wasn't enough.In the movie's third act, Jason pulls the power out as he goes to enter the building where the remainder of the kids are.

Whether Robin ever actually existed or not is questionable, but with characters like Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck and Little John, everyone deep down wants there to be an element of truth. Told by Hollywood on countless different occasions and staring many different actors (Sean Connery and Kevin Costner to name two), the finest interpretation of the story is the original film staring Hollywood Rogue Errol Flynn. Made a year before the outbreak of World War II, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a swashbuckling epic in it's own right with classic lines, romance and enough sword play to last a lifetime.King Richard I of England, known more popularly as Richard the Lionheart, has gone to fight the holy war. Whilst away, Richard's younger brother, the treacherous Prince John (Claude Rains) plots to overthrow him. Only one man stands to protect the King's throne and his name is Robin Hood (Flynn).As a Hollywood star, Errol Flynn was legendary for being a bit of a ladies man.

First of all, I am a 21 year old girl from a suburb of large city. All of my friends in junior high all talked about this movie like it was great. I was expecting it to be great as well. When I was 14 all I wanted to do was rent this movie, but I was never allowed. Fortunately, it was a good choice not to rent the movie at 14. My life was nothing like the kids that were portrayed in the movie. I've never even encountered anyone who has lived a life similar to the kids in the movie. Yes, I am naive and have lived a sheltered life. It probably would not of had that big of an effect of my life because I wasn't having sex, drinking or doing drugs anyways.Furthermore, I don't think the kids\/parents who this movie was calling out to would really think twice about the actions they were doing. It cannot be a wakeup call for America, if the intended audience just doesn't care. Do you think if the kids in the movie saw a film similar to this would they change their actions? No, they will continue to think they were invisible to HIV, STDS and PREGNANCY.I will give the movie credit for not glamorizing sex, drugs and alcohol. Unlike other movies, the kids in the movie don't look cool when they are engaging in these acts because they aren't attractive. The more they engage in these actions the worse they look, which is true to life. When I first saw some of the actors I didn't realize why they weren't the typical beautiful people you encounter in films. Instead, they look like normal people. Which makes it even scarier to watch.After watching Telly and Casper talk after he just devirginized a 12 year old almost made me vomit. I was tempted to turn off the movie, but decided to continue watching to see if it got better. It really did not.My major problem with the film was how the females in the film were portrayed as desperate, sluts, or victims. All of them. Even Telly's mother seemed to be on the end of desperate. Why wasn't there a female character to stand up to these boys or say no? When Jennie is looking for Telly in the park, the one girl said she didn't agree with the boys almost killing that kid - yet she did nothing about it. Perhaps they would have beat her up too? But she had a choice she didn't have to stay and watch. It was just disgusting to see these female characters get walked all over in the film. As a young female viewer, I was appalled most at this. In addition, the scene in which the females are talking about their sex lives is really disturbing and not realistic. My friends and I do talk about sex, but not like that. Also, why is female oral sex never mentioned in this film? If it is going to be realistic it should be mentioned too- especially by the girls doing the talking in this scene, but it is forgotten I guess because it is a male dominated film.Overall, I was disgusted with the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone who does not want to see a 12\/13 year old having sex with a teenage boy who has HIV.

The protagonists Neal (Steve Martin) and Del (John Candy) do some incredibly stupid things, and have some very bad things happen to them, while the various crooks have all the fun. For me this just is not the kind of comedy that I enjoy. The dull spots far outweighed the bright spots. Also, I never have enjoyed John Candy, to me he is always an irritant, no matter what his role is.All the rest of my comments contain MAJOR SPOILERS, please read no further if you have not yet seen the movie.It starts 2 days before Thanksgiving, in a very tedious meeting with a client, Neal is trying to make is 6PM flight to O'Hare and get home by 9PM. After buying a cab ride for $75 from a greedy attorney, then losing it anyway to Del, they both get to the airport and both on the same delayed flight, which lands in Wichita because of snowed-in Chicago. That's when the escapade really begins. To try and get to Chicago on time they have to first take a train, and when it becomes disabled, are put on a bus to St Louis, then have to rent a car to Chicago, thus the name of the movie. Nothing works out right, Del is a smoking, annoying blabbermouth who tells anecdotes without a point, and is a constant irritant to Neal. Then, a thief sneaks into their room at night and steals all their cash.In general, I don't enjoy watching movies where the main characters have to endure lots of misery, especially if it is a comedy. Where there is misery, it must be inflicted on what we might consider the bad guys. P,T & A is what I consider a dumb comedy. The various bad guys have the fun (punch in the face, kick in the nuts, steal money, greedy lawyer, dishonest cab driver, snotty stewardess) while the good guys do incredibly stupid things and have all kinds of bad things happen to them. I thought the first 5 minutes, setting up the anticipation of a possibly difficult trip home, and the last 5 minutes, with the family on TG morning, were the best. Filmed in the winter, the main of the movie is too dark, and dirty, both figuratively and literally, for my enjoyment. The scene where Neal gets back to the car rental counter, and berates the lady at the counter, with every other word being the F-word, was the low point of the movie for me, and whatever hopes I had for it to be really entertaining was lost there.But I did like some things! The scene where they woke up cuddling was totally funny. Del, where's your other hand? Del, Between two pillows. Neal, Those aren't pillows. Or, the scene of them driving down the highway in a burned-out car reminded me of the two guys in Dumb and Dumber riding down the highway on that tiny scooter, on their way to Aspen. Or Del's comment, We'd have more luck playing pickup sticks with our butt-cheeks, than we will getting a flight out of here before daybreak. Or the guy who gave them a ride to the train station, about his little wife, She's tougher than she looks. Her first baby came out sideways, she didn't scream or nothing. And, it does have a pleasing ending, when Neal finds out that Del's wife died 8 years ago and he really has no home, so comes home with Neal for Thanksgiving.I realize that Roger Ebert has it among his list of great movies, but it just isn't the type of comedy I enjoy. While I enjoyed many of the jokes, overall the best rating I can give it on a 10-point system is 4. Just too much misery for me to enjoy it as a comedy.

Where there is misery, it must be inflicted on what we might consider the bad guys. P,T & A is what I consider a dumb comedy. The various bad guys have the fun (punch in the face, kick in the nuts, steal money, greedy lawyer, dishonest cab driver, snotty stewardess) while the good guys do incredibly stupid things and have all kinds of bad things happen to them. I thought the first 5 minutes, setting up the anticipation of a possibly difficult trip home, and the last 5 minutes, with the family on TG morning, were the best. Filmed in the winter, the main of the movie is too dark, and dirty, both figuratively and literally, for my enjoyment. The scene where Neal gets back to the car rental counter, and berates the lady at the counter, with every other word being the F-word, was the low point of the movie for me, and whatever hopes I had for it to be really entertaining was lost there.But I did like some things! The scene where they woke up cuddling was totally funny. Del, where's your other hand? Del, Between two pillows. Neal, Those aren't pillows. Or, the scene of them driving down the highway in a burned-out car reminded me of the two guys in Dumb and Dumber riding down the highway on that tiny scooter, on their way to Aspen. Or Del's comment, We'd have more luck playing pickup sticks with our butt-cheeks, than we will getting a flight out of here before daybreak. Or the guy who gave them a ride to the train station, about his little wife, She's tougher than she looks. Her first baby came out sideways, she didn't scream or nothing. And, it does have a pleasing ending, when Neal finds out that Del's wife died 8 years ago and he really has no home, so comes home with Neal for Thanksgiving.I realize that Roger Ebert has it among his list of great movies, but it just isn't the type of comedy I enjoy.

The protagonists Neal (Steve Martin) and Del (John Candy) do some incredibly stupid things, and have some very bad things happen to them, while the various crooks have all the fun. For me this just is not the kind of comedy that I enjoy. The dull spots far outweighed the bright spots. Also, I never have enjoyed John Candy, to me he is always an irritant, no matter what his role is.All the rest of my comments contain MAJOR SPOILERS, please read no further if you have not yet seen the movie.It starts 2 days before Thanksgiving, in a very tedious meeting with a client, Neal is trying to make is 6PM flight to O'Hare and get home by 9PM. After buying a cab ride for $75 from a greedy attorney, then losing it anyway to Del, they both get to the airport and both on the same delayed flight, which lands in Wichita because of snowed-in Chicago. That's when the escapade really begins. To try and get to Chicago on time they have to first take a train, and when it becomes disabled, are put on a bus to St Louis, then have to rent a car to Chicago, thus the name of the movie.

Frequency tells the story of John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), a down-on-his-luck cop in Queens (circa 1999) whose life apparently spiraled southward after his fireman father (Dennis Quaid) died on the job thirty years earlier. The movie doesn't explore John's unfortunate circumstances much; he's shown arguing with his girlfriend once, plus he drinks some, and Caviezel makes a few sardonic comments and looks bitter. But this lack of development can be forgiven for two reasons one, Caviezel possesses such a genuine sincerity that it's hard not to like his character, despite the fact that we don't really know him; and two, John discovers the ham radio early on into the film, setting up the most intriguing part of the premise. What ham radio? Why, the very radio which belonged to Frank, John's father! John starts to fool around with the radio one day. He picks somebody up, much to his surprise ... and lo and behold, the person he's chatting with about baseball and Queens is his father Frank -- all the way back in 1969!! These scenes -- with Caviezel, Quaid, and the radio -- are definitely the highlights of Frequency. The scene in which the father and son's identities are revealed to one another is engaging; particularly charming and poignant is the scene where a present-day John talks to his 1969 family (including his younger self). Thanks to the radio, John is even able to warn Frank about that fire and prevent his father's death!Regrettably, after this history-altering incident, the film became more than a little ... confusing, to say the least. Frank appeared to still be alive, but I was unclear as to whether he was living in the 60's or the 90s's. While John's warnings that cigarettes will become the true cause of his dad's death send a positive message about health, this doesn't really go anywhere. Even more puzzling is the big serial-killer subplot revolving around John's nurse mother. I knew the killer was stalking nurses, and I knew that as Frank tried to stop him, he became a suspect himself -- but my clarity ended there. Again, WHEN was the killer killing?! Was John's mother alive or not?! In fairness, I watched Frequency on an airplane... so some of my confusions could very well have resulted from the interfering loudness of the plane's engine, or the interruptions of dinnertime. I have to say, though, that I think writer Toby Emmerich simply tried to squeeze too much into his script. The serial killer plot was unnecessary. The relationship between Frank and John made for an interesting enough film. My other gripes are minor and mostly have to do with a bit too many close-ups of eyes and such. Overall, Frequency DOES have a lot going for it!Supporting performances by André Braugher (who somehow manages to look exactly the same age in 1969 and 1999); Elizabeth Mitchell; and Noah Emmerich are on the mark. I liked how the movie hinted at the importance of familial relationships. I'm not really a baseball fan, but I didn't mind the baseball elements in this movie... which were sort of quaint. Plus, I've always had a weird fascination with things like ham radios.Finally, as I mentioned earlier, Jim Caviezel shows he's one to watch for in this earlier starring role. His own father had a brush with death some time before this movie, and it's evident in his performance that the subject matter is close to his heart. You can see the sincerity in his eyes! And that makes it hard to criticize Frequency, although once the serial killer plot starts up the movie becomes simply too confusing to really get involved with.All in all, Frequency is a movie that starts out great and slips into being merely good.

I wasn't bored at any time of this movie when I first on opening day at the movie theater and I have seen it dozens of times since then and it is just as entertaining.This one is my favorite out of the series, yes I said it, Halloween Resurrection is my favorite. I liked it even more then the 1st one. It has great characters and a great plot and they finally killed off Laurie who was a pretty boring character.This one is way better then 2,4,5, and 6. Those ones were just violent and stupid with characters I despise like the guy obsessed with his car in 5, and the guy who hosts the radio station in 6, plus all the Strodes in 6. And this one unlike H2O, not only shows the people die, but has a bigger body count of 10 people. I liked H20 a lot anyway. It had great characters and didn't get boring just like Resurrection. H20 is my 2nd favorite out of the series. So basically this one is way better then 2,4,5 and 6 despite what people say.This one also has a lot of familiar faces. Thomas Ian Nicholas from American Pie and Rookie of the Year (who sadly doesn't last long against the wrath of Michael Myers) Sean Patrick Thomas from the Barbershop movies, Rapper Busta Rhymes, Model Tyra Banks, Ryan Merriman from the Disney movies.Bianca Kajlick had a role in Bring It On, Billy Kay plays the baby in Three Men And A Baby, Dan Joffre is in every bad movie I can think of My Bosses Daghter, A Guy Thing etc., and the security guard who gets his head cut off also gets his head cut off in Freddy Vs. Jason. I will say the movie has its downfalls their is some bad acting, mostly foam Busta Rhymes and Bianca Kajlick. But this is they're 1st time as leads, they have never done leading roles. Plus their are several goofs but its still a pretty good movie.I want the 9th to be like this one and H2O, not like 2,4,5 and 6. Those were B movies that tried to rip off the Friday the 13th's deaths, and they did a pathetic job. I would probably like to see more sequels after 9, and the series has introduced enough surviving characters to do so.Rated R for Violence, Languedge, Brief Nudity, and Drug Use.

And this one unlike H2O, not only shows the people die, but has a bigger body count of 10 people. I liked H20 a lot anyway. It had great characters and didn't get boring just like Resurrection. H20 is my 2nd favorite out of the series. So basically this one is way better then 2,4,5 and 6 despite what people say.This one also has a lot of familiar faces. Thomas Ian Nicholas from American Pie and Rookie of the Year (who sadly doesn't last long against the wrath of Michael Myers) Sean Patrick Thomas from the Barbershop movies, Rapper Busta Rhymes, Model Tyra Banks, Ryan Merriman from the Disney movies.Bianca Kajlick had a role in Bring It On, Billy Kay plays the baby in Three Men And A Baby, Dan Joffre is in every bad movie I can think of My Bosses Daghter, A Guy Thing etc., and the security guard who gets his head cut off also gets his head cut off in Freddy Vs. Jason. I will say the movie has its downfalls their is some bad acting, mostly foam Busta Rhymes and Bianca Kajlick. But this is they're 1st time as leads, they have never done leading roles. Plus their are several goofs but its still a pretty good movie.I want the 9th to be like this one and H2O, not like 2,4,5 and 6. Those were B movies that tried to rip off the Friday the 13th's deaths, and they did a pathetic job. I would probably like to see more sequels after 9, and the series has introduced enough surviving characters to do so.Rated R for Violence, Languedge, Brief Nudity, and Drug Use.

As a movie, it was very realistic and funny at the same time. Nicholson is hilarious and a lot of scenes are even funnier because people can relate (i.e. while reconstructing their new house, they run into a few problems with the contractor). In real life, women get involved all the time with men who cheat and still go back to them. It never made sense to me, but it still happens and I'm glad Meryl Streep leaves Jack Nicholson. Not only is it great in literary design (which it should be as Nora Ephron had two screenwriters for parents), but the visual design is incredible. For example, during their wedding, pay special attention to the proximic pattern (where the player is in relation to other things and where the camera is in relation to other things). Specifically, even in the beginning of the scene, Mike Nichols uses interesting images. It starts focused on an old woman who's fallen asleep, but even though she's the center and focus of the frame, what really catches the eye is the couple behind her because they're moving around a lot. Then, alas, they are the couple in the next shot approaching Streep in the bedroom to tell her they are Nicholson's oldest friends. They start out far away as they don't know her very well, but walk toward her as they try to get closer to her (which, I thought was good use of physical representation). Then, Nichols continues to use physical closeness for the rest of the scene to show her relation to each one. Streep's held in the arms of her father because they're close, her therapist is sits close to her on the bed but not as close as her father, and Nicholson holds her tightly as he would seem to be the closest. But that's enough analysis for one day. But I do recommend seeing this film--I had never heard of it before but it's actually very good. And one more thing, Yakov Smirnoff is always fun\/funny to see.

The original intent is easily discerned in the sometimes choppy flow of the story. At 4 hours the movie is long and the script is rendered anemic at times. Still, it is a decent effort to put real American history on the screen. The first segment concerns Buford's brave stand on the first day of the battle. Sam Elliot is good as the Union cavalry commander who risked his unit to buy a few hours for the Army of the Potomac to come up and occupy the high ground outside of Gettysburg. It was a gamble that paid off. The second part of the film centers on J.L. Chamberlain's 20th Maine throwing back the Confederates who were trying to turn the Union flank at Little Round Top on the second day. This action received much acclaim more than 125 years after the fact when it was featured in Ken Burn's Civil War (1990). In that series it was described as a feat that saved the Union army........ and maybe even the Union itself.. Jeff Daniels bears a striking resemblance to Chamberlain and does a fine job with the role. Unfortunately, the script gives him some lame lines at times. (Here they come again boys!). He is especially badly used by keeping his character around after the moment of glory to just duck Confederate shells in the back of the Union center during Pickett's Charge on the third day. Chamberlain's brother is dizzily played by C. Thomas Howell. His is the only character in the film that really got on my nerves---I kept hoping that he would collapse from heat stroke or get hit in the head and knocked unconscious by a spent minnie ball. The scene where Howells' character talks to the rebel prisoners, at the end of the first day of the battle, is supposedly based on a famous Civil War painting. But John Huston must have had the exact same idea when he made The Red Badge of Courage  (1951) --- The scene in Gettysburg almost exactly matches the one in Red Badge of Courage even down to some of the dialogue. Only John Huston had the good fortune of having his lines uttered by Arthur Hunnicutt and not C. Thomas Howell.Another part of the picture follows the course of all three days of the battle as seen from the perspective of the Confederate commanders. Tom Berenger is very charismatic as Longstreet. However, like Daniels, he has got to spout some rather insipid lines at times. And he has to stand there like a dummy while his junior officers engage in a flip discussion on the pros and cons of Darwinism. Berenger's southern accent is overdone at times and on a couple occasions it seems to disappear altogether. Still - all in all - a creditable performance. Longstreet spends a great deal of the movie trying to convince General Lee (Martin Sheen) to disengage the rebel army and find a strong defensive position somewhere between the Union army and Washington. It's ironic then that he is left to plan and execute (against his own strong judgment) the futile Confederate assault on the Union center on the last day of the battle.I see in the trivia section of IMDb that Sheen was only the 4th or 5th choice to play Robert E. Lee. Sheen does not match Lee's physical type. Lee being relatively tall and angular while Sheen is a smaller man. I think Sheen would make a wonderful General Grant - he bears a remarkable likeness to the Union General. However--taking all of that into account -it is a tribute to Sheen's acting ability that he does succeed to a large degree in this role. He shows Lee's fighting spirit, his dignity and humility. The scene where Lee rides among his cheering troops just before Pickett's charge is the most moving of the film---and apparently completely unplanned. More is revealed in the faces of the re-enactors in this scene- about the caliber of the men of the Army of Northern Virginia -than could be discovered in any other ten Civil War movies.The conventional view is that Pickett's Charge was a horrendous blunder by Lee -- his only major mis-step of the war. I tend to hold with those who dissent from this view. Lee certainly knew that the final assault was a long shot. However, he also knew that it was imperative that a decisive defeat be inflicted on the Union Army somewhere north of Washington. He was determined to seize the day and the hour to attack the Union Army wherever he could and not let the campaign be deflected by stalemate or the uncertainty of further maneuvering. The battle of Gettysburg had a now or never quality for Lee. He rolled the dice and lost.Stephen Lang is unmatched in theatrical flair as Pickett. If you want to see real life courage though- you had better watch Richard Jordan's performance as Armistead. A dying man in real life playing a man fated to die in the movie. The friendship motif that is played out between Jordan's Armistead and Brian Mallon's Union General Hancock doesn't work. The emotional connection is not made---but it is not from a lack of emotional sincerity or intensity on Jordan's part. While this movie only succeeds modestly where it does succeed - it can at least be said that- where it fails--it doesn't miss by much. I have a real appreciation for the effort that I can see was made here to put American history on the screen. The commitment is made visible by the acting performances, in the use of re-enactors -- in the camera work on location at the Gettysburg battlefield--in the beautiful musical score. This is a movie worth owning. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2005","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Gettysburg was first conceived as a miniseries.

It's ironic then that he is left to plan and execute (against his own strong judgment) the futile Confederate assault on the Union center on the last day of the battle.I see in the trivia section of IMDb that Sheen was only the 4th or 5th choice to play Robert E. Lee. Sheen does not match Lee's physical type. Lee being relatively tall and angular while Sheen is a smaller man. I think Sheen would make a wonderful General Grant - he bears a remarkable likeness to the Union General. However--taking all of that into account -it is a tribute to Sheen's acting ability that he does succeed to a large degree in this role. He shows Lee's fighting spirit, his dignity and humility. The scene where Lee rides among his cheering troops just before Pickett's charge is the most moving of the film---and apparently completely unplanned. More is revealed in the faces of the re-enactors in this scene- about the caliber of the men of the Army of Northern Virginia -than could be discovered in any other ten Civil War movies.The conventional view is that Pickett's Charge was a horrendous blunder by Lee -- his only major mis-step of the war. I tend to hold with those who dissent from this view. Lee certainly knew that the final assault was a long shot. However, he also knew that it was imperative that a decisive defeat be inflicted on the Union Army somewhere north of Washington. He was determined to seize the day and the hour to attack the Union Army wherever he could and not let the campaign be deflected by stalemate or the uncertainty of further maneuvering. The battle of Gettysburg had a now or never quality for Lee. He rolled the dice and lost.Stephen Lang is unmatched in theatrical flair as Pickett. If you want to see real life courage though- you had better watch Richard Jordan's performance as Armistead. A dying man in real life playing a man fated to die in the movie. The friendship motif that is played out between Jordan's Armistead and Brian Mallon's Union General Hancock doesn't work. The emotional connection is not made---but it is not from a lack of emotional sincerity or intensity on Jordan's part. While this movie only succeeds modestly where it does succeed - it can at least be said that- where it fails--it doesn't miss by much. I have a real appreciation for the effort that I can see was made here to put American history on the screen. The commitment is made visible by the acting performances, in the use of re-enactors -- in the camera work on location at the Gettysburg battlefield--in the beautiful musical score. This is a movie worth owning.

The original intent is easily discerned in the sometimes choppy flow of the story. At 4 hours the movie is long and the script is rendered anemic at times. Still, it is a decent effort to put real American history on the screen. The first segment concerns Buford's brave stand on the first day of the battle. Sam Elliot is good as the Union cavalry commander who risked his unit to buy a few hours for the Army of the Potomac to come up and occupy the high ground outside of Gettysburg. It was a gamble that paid off. The second part of the film centers on J.L. Chamberlain's 20th Maine throwing back the Confederates who were trying to turn the Union flank at Little Round Top on the second day. This action received much acclaim more than 125 years after the fact when it was featured in Ken Burn's Civil War (1990). In that series it was described as a feat that saved the Union army........ and maybe even the Union itself.. Jeff Daniels bears a striking resemblance to Chamberlain and does a fine job with the role. Unfortunately, the script gives him some lame lines at times. (Here they come again boys!). He is especially badly used by keeping his character around after the moment of glory to just duck Confederate shells in the back of the Union center during Pickett's Charge on the third day. Chamberlain's brother is dizzily played by C. Thomas Howell. His is the only character in the film that really got on my nerves---I kept hoping that he would collapse from heat stroke or get hit in the head and knocked unconscious by a spent minnie ball. The scene where Howells' character talks to the rebel prisoners, at the end of the first day of the battle, is supposedly based on a famous Civil War painting. But John Huston must have had the exact same idea when he made The Red Badge of Courage  (1951) --- The scene in Gettysburg almost exactly matches the one in Red Badge of Courage even down to some of the dialogue. Only John Huston had the good fortune of having his lines uttered by Arthur Hunnicutt and not C. Thomas Howell.Another part of the picture follows the course of all three days of the battle as seen from the perspective of the Confederate commanders. Tom Berenger is very charismatic as Longstreet. However, like Daniels, he has got to spout some rather insipid lines at times. And he has to stand there like a dummy while his junior officers engage in a flip discussion on the pros and cons of Darwinism. Berenger's southern accent is overdone at times and on a couple occasions it seems to disappear altogether. Still - all in all - a creditable performance.

Anthony Perkin's and Janet Leigh's performances seem truly genuine and real all the way through. The shower scene is undoubtedly the most memorable horror moment in film history. There's something about that scene that makes it hard to watch even to this day. Notice when 'Mother' opens the shower curtain how you can just barely make out the eyes that stare so coldly at Leigh before the knife comes down on her. And the brief moment where we see 'Mother' leave the bathroom. The entire scene is just masterful. It never gets old, never will. It will remain the definitive piece of film-making and will remain the granddaddy of all horror pictures.On another note, Psycho II and III are actually worth watching, despite what some people may say. They aren't the masterpiece that the original is of course but the filmmakers wisely don't try to duplicate it. They are very different stories from the original. They are a (especially Part II) quite intelligent continuation of the character Norman Bates. If you are interested in seeing what happens to Norman in the years to come, they are indispensable.As for the remake... I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. As a movie, it stinks because it's already been done, and it just proved that the original can't be beat. Then again, I've heard it should be just looked at as a tribute. But what raunchy way to pay tribute to the greatest horror film of all time.So, in closing, let me say that if you haven't seen Hitchcock's masterpiece, go now and buy it. That's right, don't rent it, buy it. It's a certainty that you will love this film.
