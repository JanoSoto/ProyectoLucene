All I knew beforehand was that it had Pacino in the leading role and Cazale supporting. I also knew about the hostage situation being the main plot. Everything else was new to me and Al Pacino being one of my favorite actors I was more than thrilled when I noticed that Dog Day Afternoon would be on TV tonight. And it wasn't a disappointment. Right from the start, when the third robber with Pacino and Cazale gave up, I knew that this is going to be interesting. For me that was a totally new way to start a bank robbery. And it got interesting, I can say that. The dominant feeling during the film was that the two robbers were completely out of their element and in the wrong place. The whole time I had a feeling that Cazale's character Sal would do something hazardous and blow the whole thing. Pacino's Sonny was also a big question mark. What would a nice guy like him do in a situation like that? And I couldn't get a straight answer to that question. Although he had big problems with money and family he didn't seem that desperate. Well, they say that the quiet ones are the most dangerous and unpredictable ones in reality. This quiet and odd pair got my sympathy right from the start and had it all the way till the end. Sonny was the one who exceeded himself time after time (or so it seemed) and Sal was only trying to hang on and do what Sonny tells him to. It was a surprise that they got as far as they did. Also the other people in the movie were a bit different than in most of these kind of crime movies. There were no panicing and screaming hostages or cops with a too heavy trigger finger. The usual and annoying cliches were left out. The cops and the crooks had an unusual understanding between each other, for example in the negotiation situations. I've never seen the cops saving the villain from a raging civilian when the villain has come out to negotiate. Maybe I haven't seen enough these kind of movies or then it's just one of the particularities of this one, I don't know. Anyways, the great suspense and atmosphere lasts all the way till the end of the film when the final solution takes place. Also the solution feels really realistic (well, it is based on a true story) and it also seems to be the only right one to end the story. As a whole, Dog Day Afternoon is a great and entertaining film with all its unconventional characters and situations. Pacino also makes a convincing performance while other performances stay in the background much because of Pacino's great work.

There are many flaws in the film plus one possible plot hole. Many will argue that Alien Resurrection is worse, but I found many more aspects of that better than Alien 3. The first problem with this movie is the story is basically a rehash of the first Alien. The only difference is that Alien was much more effective. The story is in no way thrilling at all. Also, the tagline for the film On Earth everyone can hear you scream. What the hell? This movie doesn't take place anywhere near earth. Another problem is the characters which are really poor. I know I did complain about some of Alien's characters, but they were ten times more interesting and likable compared to some of these characters. There are basically too many characters, its obvious there just here to get killed. One of the only characters to have a personality is Charles S. Dutton's characters, but when he talks he sounds more like a reverend. We do not need religious people in an Alien film. It doesnt fit at all.The film does contain good visual effects, one of its strengths. The film also has a dark atmosphere thats suitable. It also has some style by director David Fincher, I liked his point of view shots of the Alien. I also liked the ending, it was the perfect way to end a disappointing film. Unfortunately, these are just about the only strengths Alien 3 has.The action scenes werent that suspenseful. The scene where The Alien pins Ripley against the wall was the only part I felt that was suspenseful. The other scenes I just didnt feel anything.

Luckily the praise comes as easily as the film is good -- and boy, is it good.If you haven't seen Lethal Weapon (1987), get off your computer, drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy it. If you have seen it, then drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy the sequel, Lethal Weapon 2. It's a real ball-breaker, a bruiser, the type of film where the heroes get beat up mercilessly but when they get mad, boy are they mad, and they tear apart everything in their path that is standing in their way. There's a particular shoot-out scene aboard a docked ship where Riggs (Mel Gibson) goes on a rampage and really kicks butt with a vengeance.But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.The film opens with a high-speed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are in hot pursuit, tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brand-new car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel, up a bridge, and so on and so forth.When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck. Soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats, one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity, so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.Riggs finds himself a new girl (Patsy Kensit), while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy, ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie, but their friendship is a sort of love-to-hate, explained in Lethal Weapon 4 (1997).What a hard action movie\/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched Lethal Weapon, and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of Lethal Weapon, while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first Lethal Weapon movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In Lethal Weapon 2, the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as Another 48 Hrs.)But Lethal Weapon 2 is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here.Lethal Weapon 2 is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichés, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it.

Luckily the praise comes as easily as the film is good -- and boy, is it good.If you haven't seen Lethal Weapon (1987), get off your computer, drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy it. If you have seen it, then drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy the sequel, Lethal Weapon 2. It's a real ball-breaker, a bruiser, the type of film where the heroes get beat up mercilessly but when they get mad, boy are they mad, and they tear apart everything in their path that is standing in their way. There's a particular shoot-out scene aboard a docked ship where Riggs (Mel Gibson) goes on a rampage and really kicks butt with a vengeance.But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.The film opens with a high-speed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are in hot pursuit, tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brand-new car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel, up a bridge, and so on and so forth.When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck. Soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats, one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity, so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.Riggs finds himself a new girl (Patsy Kensit), while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy, ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie, but their friendship is a sort of love-to-hate, explained in Lethal Weapon 4 (1997).What a hard action movie\/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched Lethal Weapon, and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of Lethal Weapon, while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first Lethal Weapon movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In Lethal Weapon 2, the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as Another 48 Hrs.)But Lethal Weapon 2 is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here.Lethal Weapon 2 is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichés, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it.

If you know every line, every cut, every camera angle, every note of the score, and every costume, does it still get your attention?  If you're channel surfing at 3AM and you see the movie in question, no matter how far along it is, will you stop and watch it anyway? When the answer is yes--and for me, it is yes to very few films--then it's great.  Tootsie is GREAT.  The writing is sharp, the performances are uniformly excellent, and the subject matter remains timely, even now, twenty years later.  The casting people outdid themselves with Tootsie, as every role, even those where the actor has only a line or two, is so well done. Sydney Pollack--what a find!  His performance as the totally hassled agent is superb, and honed, no doubt, by a professional lifetime of dealing with real agents.  Bill Murray (why was he uncredited, anyway?) is, as usual, a joy.  (His reaction when he interrupts Dustin Hoffman and his much-too-ardent admirer--You slut--is hysterical even after 100 viewings.) Jessica Lange and her cute little overbite have never been used more effectively.  Charles Durning's portrayal of Les strikes a perfect note of old-fashioned sanity in this movie's crazy world.  And Teri Garr is priceless!  When she screams in frustration over having been stood up AGAIN by Hoffman she is the icon for every woman who's ever been forgotten, thrown over, dissed, or dropped.  I could go on and on--Dabney Coleman, George Gaynes, Doris Belack--they are all fantastic.Somehow the Oscar voters got carried away by Gandhi and voted it the Best Original Screenplay award.  Of the other nominees I think either Tootsie or ET deserved it far more--they were, after all, ORIGINAL stories!  The only Oscar for Tootsie was to Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress, but I think she was given it as a consolation prize for losing Best Actress to Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice; really Teri Garr, who was also nominated, was more deserving.  Hoffman lost, too, but perhaps deservedly so, given the competition.  Again, however, I'd quibble with the winner (Ben Kingsley for Gandhi).

You'll never regret whiling away a couple of hours with this wonderful ensemble.  And it will get you thinking about gender roles, something we as a society are still struggling with today.  I've often thought of Hoffman's moment of truth, when he explains to Lange near the end, I was a better man with you, when I was a woman, than I ever was with any woman when I was a man.

Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it.

Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones.

Other reviewers have referenced web sites and publications that contain the detail and I have sourced material that has satisfied my curiosity.It is not a documentary, in spite of the fact that director, Apted, is an eminent documentary maker. It is a human drama set amongst the surreal environment of the code-breaking complex of Bletchley Park. I can't comment on how faithful Stoppard's screenplay is to Harris' book, not having read it. And it is specious for anyone to make comparisons in any case.Does the film downplay the Polish contribution to the Ultra activities? I don't think so. They captured an early 3-rotor Enigma machine and copied it and successfully cracked the codes then in use. What the English operatives captured was the later 3-rotor machine with the front patch panel, which was a quantum leap ahead of the pre-war machines. Turing and his associates then created the 'bombes' - reproduced in exquisite detail for the movie with assistance of the curator of the Bletchley Park Museum.

This man, of course, is Batman, and it isn't to long before he meets his arch-nemesis, the Joker.As a bit of a sucker for superhero films, I am usually easily pleased with films from this genre.  Batman, however, is easily one of the more impressive films based on a comic book hero that has ever been made, and probably, that will ever be made in the years to come.  Although I have never been a large reader of the Batman comics, this film seemed to capture the essence of the character that featured in the few books that I did read, and added a lot more.Firstly, credit must go to Tim Burton, whose vision of Gotham City is incredible, which seems to combine elements of realism with a darkness that complements the city's Dark Knight perfectly, unlike the Gotham City of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, which looked just plain ridiculous.The stars of this film, namely the actors who play Batman and the Joker, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are almost perfect in their depictions of these classic characters, especially Nicholson, who truly was the star of the show.  Keaton was also good as Batman and alto-ego Bruce Wayne, although his performance was somewhat shadowed by Nicholson's performance, that was complemented even more with virtually every good line given to the Joker. Not that this was a bad thing though, as Nicholson delivered them all perfectly.Kim Basinger as Bruce Wayne\/Batman's love interest was also a good choice, although her performance was not a great one compared to the two leading men.  Supporting characters of Commissioner Gordon, Alfred, Harvey Dent, and Carl Grissom were also well performed by Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance, respectfully.The storyline of this film is not extremely great. It doesn't need to be. Centred on Gotham City being threatened by the Joker and the people of Gotham City not sure on whether or not Batman is good or evil, it features several confrontations between Batman and the Joker, from the first creation of the Joker when Batman fails to save Jack Napier from falling into a vat of chemicals, to the final battle atop Gotham City Cathedral.  The grand master plan of the Joker's also doesn't seem like anything any sane, or even insane criminal would try to do (launching gas into Gotham's streets to kill thousands of people with no money demand or anything similar), but hey, this is based on a comic book, and if anything, makes the Clown Prince of Crime just that little bit more evil.Danny Elfman's score for the film is the final gem in the crown of this film, which must have come close to being nominated for an Oscar.  I remember humming the main theme for Batman for days after first seeing it. It complements the characters and situations perfectly and the main theme should have a place as one of the most distinctive movie themes of all time, along with themes such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones.With all said and done, Batman is a classic film, not like The Godfather, or Citizen Kane, but a classic in the sense that it is great entertainment with a great cast, that can provide enjoyment for people of most ages, provided that they have a sense of imagination and are willing to let themselves be taken on a great ride of a film.  8 out of 10.  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2003","score":"","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!In a city overridden with crime, a man who lost his parents to a mindless street crime, is carrying out a life long vendetta against criminals. This man, of course, is Batman, and it isn't to long before he meets his arch-nemesis, the Joker.As a bit of a sucker for superhero films, I am usually easily pleased with films from this genre.  Batman, however, is easily one of the more impressive films based on a comic book hero that has ever been made, and probably, that will ever be made in the years to come.  Although I have never been a large reader of the Batman comics, this film seemed to capture the essence of the character that featured in the few books that I did read, and added a lot more.Firstly, credit must go to Tim Burton, whose vision of Gotham City is incredible, which seems to combine elements of realism with a darkness that complements the city's Dark Knight perfectly, unlike the Gotham City of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, which looked just plain ridiculous.The stars of this film, namely the actors who play Batman and the Joker, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are almost perfect in their depictions of these classic characters, especially Nicholson, who truly was the star of the show.  Keaton was also good as Batman and alto-ego Bruce Wayne, although his performance was somewhat shadowed by Nicholson's performance, that was complemented even more with virtually every good line given to the Joker. Not that this was a bad thing though, as Nicholson delivered them all perfectly.Kim Basinger as Bruce Wayne\/Batman's love interest was also a good choice, although her performance was not a great one compared to the two leading men.  Supporting characters of Commissioner Gordon, Alfred, Harvey Dent, and Carl Grissom were also well performed by Pat Hingle, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance, respectfully.The storyline of this film is not extremely great. It doesn't need to be. Centred on Gotham City being threatened by the Joker and the people of Gotham City not sure on whether or not Batman is good or evil, it features several confrontations between Batman and the Joker, from the first creation of the Joker when Batman fails to save Jack Napier from falling into a vat of chemicals, to the final battle atop Gotham City Cathedral.

The strange slightly surreal and offbeat tone of the film was quite reminiscent of Tarantino's work. I loved this film, and thought the little laughs hidden in the film made me like it. I watched this with a couple of friends, they too liked it, but we each noticed and laughed at different things.I also loved the constant twists and turns and changes to the dynamic of the story. It starts out as Freddy paying back a debt but changes into an affair on the road, then finding some stashed money, hiding from the cops, then hiding a murder and so on. Oddly despite all of these twists and turns I never got lost but was glued to my screen figuring out who's with who and who's looking out for who.The fights between the two brothers, Sam (Vince D'Onofrio) and Jjax(Keanu Reeves) are some of the funniest things i have ever seen on screen. Reeves put in a good performance as a bumbling crook and D'Onofrio carries himself well as his childish brother. The ever angelic Diaz puts in a good show too. Lindo and Akroyd raised a few smiles too.Don't pay any attention to the bad reviews here. They were just people looking for a ho-hum romantic comedy when instead they got a witty dark comedy.(My kind of film) 3.75\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2003","score":"19 out of 23 people found the following review useful","review":"  Watching this movie on running trait in all the characters stood out, their quirkiness.
