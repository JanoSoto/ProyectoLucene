The story is that of a teen who is dying to go to the prom with the school beauty. Unfortunately, a plan to get her attention backfires and he dies. But, he rises as the walking dead in order to keep the date. But, even though no one seems to mind much that the dead kid pretty much resumed his normal life, he is quickly decaying. And, it requires that he eats living things in order to slow the process until a doctor (played fantastically by character actor, Austin Pendleton) can figure out how to chemically reverse the process. Of course, his cannibalism does not blow over well with the towns folk, who soon begin to ostracize the boy (and violently, at that).It is a witty little black comedy that does sometimes strive too hard to impose its humor on the audience (though, maintaining some witty subtle humor at the same time). The generic supporting characters such as the oblivious father (played by Edward Hermann), the exceedingly prim mother, and, of course, the doctor (Austin Pendleton) are great. Its seems like a more scaled down, cheaper version of something that Tim Burton could put together (and sort of did, with Frankenweenie). Also, look for Cloris Leachman, Paul Dooley, and a then-unknown Matthew Fox and Phyllip Seymour Hoffman in supporting roles.If you enjoy this movie, check out 'My Best Friend is a Vampire,' 'The Applegates,' 'I Was a Teenage Zombie,' 'Terror Vision,' or the disturbing black comedy 'Parents.'

Machismo or not, I bet I would have seen some misty male eyes in the theatre had I bothered to look. I Am Sam is a rare movie that's touching, funny, and heartwarming.Sean Penn is Sam Dawson, a mentally challenged single father. The reason I say is and not plays is that Penn does such a brilliant job in this role, it is as though he actually becomes Sam, in much the same way that Tom Hanks became Forrest Gump. I don't like Sean Penn personally. I find his politics obnoxious, and his soapbox ways of preaching them nearly intolerable. But there's no doubt the man can act. For the entire length of the movie, he never slipped from his character for a second. He was so convincing and believable, I half expected him to sound like Sam when he interviewed on Oprah Winfrey.Despite its ingenuity, Penn's performance is not the only standout one in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer is inspired in her role as a driven, frazzled, neurotic ultra-successful lawyer with a suffering home life. Several of the supporting roles are played by actors with mental disabilities, which only adds to the richness of the cast. And Dakota Fanning is captivating as Lucy, the seven-year-old who knows her daddy is different but loves him anyway and wants to fight not to be separated from him.The main problem with this movie is that it requires a significant amount of suspension of disbelief. Are we really to believe that a man with Sam's mental capacity was able to raise and take care of his daughter singlehandedly for seven years, without major catastrophe? His job would hardly be able to cover his rent, let alone child care expenses, and he lacked many basic skills necessary to raise any child, let alone such a well-adjusted one as the girl in the movie.And it does raise some questions about who to root for. Sam is the good guy and presumably, the audience is on his side. But is it really in the best interest of the child for him to win custody? I mean, in real life, she might have been placed in an indifferent or even abusive foster care situation, but this movie comes up with Laura Dern as a picture-perfect mom-substitute. Wouldn't Lucy be better off with her? Even Sam concedes this at the end, so why don't we?

In this way, the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as Return to Paradise, but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship.Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is a bit glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues.There were some plot holes here, and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic.

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.The movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.Those are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday).

Ash sets out on his journey but soon forgets the words & takes the book anyways & voilà! the dead awakens & led by Ash's evil other half, they launch a crusade against the castle, where Ash must use his 20th century smarts to come up with a plan that will destroy the evil & get him back to his own time, unless of course the evil side dominates & Ash & his companions wind up dead or worse a deadite...ARMY OF DARKNESS is a highly enjoyable entry & a perfect way to cap off a really fun trilogy, love it or hate it, this was really the movie that made Both BRUCE CAMPBELL & his character ASH the real stars they are today. The film has some great (if slightly outdated) visual effects & the undead marching skeleton scenes & the human battle with them are very well done & executed. The acting is great & Sam Raimi still manages to keep the directorial touches that helped elevate his EVIL DEAD series above most horror franchises & delivers some pretty good shots. The film's comedy that began in EVIL DEAD 2 & brought over to an even greater degree in this one, is well handled when it's supposed to be funny & the film is suspenseful when it needs to be. The set design & score really stand out & are very well done. All that out of the way however, now it's time for the bad. The film doesn't feel or have the look of an EVIL DEAD film, now as rumour has it (& again I'm just stating what I heard) is that Universal, who put up the money, said they didn't want an EVIL DEAD movie & as a result, the film actually foreshadows what would become of 1999's MUMMY remake with BRENDAN FRASER, i.e. it's an action\/fantasy film with some horror around the edges & that's precisely the problem, while fans of the first two (such as myself) may love the film, it can never be truly looked at as an EVIL DEAD film, slap another title on it & put in another actor to replace BRUCE CAMPBELL get rid of any reference to the first two films & you would still could have fooled in audience into believing it's not an EVIL DEAD movie! There's not one single scare or gloomy atmosphere in the entire film, no over the top bloody kills (not counting the opening blood ocean that shoots from a pit after a deadite has eaten a prisoner) & guts or monster slime & even the possession of humans is played down. Also worth noting is that in the previous entries it didn't take much shooting with a shot gun to take down a deadite, here ASH often has to fire several rounds into a demon before it goes down & where was the unseen evil force that caused the mayhem in the first two movies? It's seen only once here, very briefly, but never again after that. Also not only is the book of the dead yet again changed in look (it looks bigger, sturdier, has a different looking cover that resembles the demonic unseen entity & not as grotesque) but the film-makers seemingly & disappointingly try to re-write history, at the beginning of the film , Ash states that he & his girlfriend went up to the cabin by themselves, where she was possessed & then it went after Ash in the woods & got into his hand out there, so he chops it off with a chainsaw in the living room. Also when Ash arrives back in time, he's calm, cool & co llected as he approaches the king & his men who mistaken him as one of his enemy kings men, however that's the disappointing part, EVIL DEAD 2 briefly (but poorly & confusingly) recapped the first film where five kids went up to the mountain cabin, not just Ash & his girlfriend, Also in EVIL DEAD 2, Ash's hand was bitten by his girlfriend & then turned against him where he then had to saw it off in the kitchen, not the living room, therefore it goes to show that although Raimi & company are great at making movies, they sure stink when it comes to continuity & worse there's no blood in the scene where Ash lops off his hand & just goes further to show how much input the studio had in calling the shots on this film. Also at the end of EVIL DEAD 2, when Ash first arrived he was about to be slain by the Knights as a sacrifice to the deadites & attacked a flying deadite that chased the Knights away, but when he realized what had happened & where he was, he hated being there & couldn't believe his misfortune, he started to cry in frustration, in fear & agony, also the fact that Ash became possessed with a deadite in Part 2 that kept taking him over at times, is also seemingly forgotten about here & why is it that some people can turn into a deadite & then back to human again but others can't? None of these questions are ever answered. Still the film has a fun pace & if you can actually look past what the idiot executives at Universal Pictures demanded, you should enjoy this film, it's fun, action packed & pretty funny with some pretty inventive visuals & animation.**** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2005","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In this third & final chapter to director SAM RAIMI'S fun, scary, funny & gross out horror series, ASH, gets sucked back in time, to medieval times actually, where he must retrieve the book of the dead in order to make it back to his own time, but must be careful to say the three magical words given to him by a wizard.

It is loosely based on The Odyssey, but since I've never actually read The Odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallels.Parodies of everyone from Robert Johnson to the Carter Family show up at some point. There are hillbilly rednecks, a political election, a blind prophet, religious fanatics, some hooded KKK members, and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killing.Somehow in this hodgepodge, a plot (and I use the term loosely) gets strung together. However, this movie isn't about the plot, nor is it about the acting, even despite George Clooney's golden globe award. Each time his accent slipped I questioned how well he deserved that one. But none of that was the point. The bottom line is, this movie is very, very funny.Of course, being able to pick out some of the references helps. I admit that I probably missed most of them, since many were very obscure, but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyone.Just don't go into the movie expecting something typical, because O Brother, Where Art Thou? is anything but.

It has everything (cheating incestuous sex, chopping off digits, a dumb hick mechanic, a blind native American who wants Dr. Pepper all the time, etc etc etc) that a well-rounded movie needs, plus it was completely done in a comic fashion. It is closest to Stone's other film Natural Born Killers by way of stylish camera shots and the addition of comedy into a dramatic setting.Sean Penn brilliantly plays the lead character, whose car blows a radiator hose out in the middle of the Arizona desert, and the closest town is that of Superior, AZ, a dirt-road town with barely 1,000 people living there, if that. Penn goes through hell from the beginning when random characters in the city want something from him and in return, it drives him to try his best to get the hell out of Superior. Everything during his days in Superior is centered around money and the fact that he has hardly any. So he gets schemed into murders, and he gets whatever little he has taken away from him (his train ticket gets ripped up by the local hoodlum, TNT, again brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix, and he has several full bottles of beverages broken for different reasons). Therefore, he's constantly running in circles to get out of this town.There is an all-star cast (back then, and now) of actors Jennifer Lopez (a better singer than actress), Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Billy Bob Thornton (the best among the bunch as the hick mechanic), Sean Penn, Claire Danes, Liv Tyler (only for a second in the train station), and Jon Voight...all packed into a nice DVD. The music had that comic, light-hearted side to it (with the country sound of a jew's-harp played over violin or whatever, etc) which helped you to see the irony that is driving him to madness in this town. Again the camera shots were awesome, and they had that Oliver Stone quality of the 90's where he would switch frames with the villain of the movie with an animal skull and switch the point-of-view to see what the actors are seeing, and so on.I didn't like the ending so much. I kind of wanted things to resolve themselves, but instead, things just keep on falling into the bad-luck-category of his life. I also hated Jennifer Lopez's delivery of lines (just like in any other movie with her...The Cell, etc) because they feel so fake and put on that you know the director was just looking for T&A for the film. Also she doesn't play a native American very well. She has a thick accent straying too much towards Latino that you don't pick up on any cultural change until you get the story.Overall, though, (bad point aside) it is a brilliant movie that is easy to watch if you like the other Stone films. I had to give it a 9\/10 for great performances, great music, awesome story, and everything in between. Go out and buy it if your a fan of any of the actors listed above, or if you are trying to find a great weekend film with friends.

I explained to him that WWS to place in 1965, about a year or two before the huge appearance of the anti-war movement, and certainly predating the hippie movement, so these elements weren't meant to appear.A lot of it is fictionalized, but then again, so were many aspects of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan (some of the only worthwhile modern war movies in about the last twenty years). We Were Soldiers tells the rather un-hip story of the early Vietnam years, so, I must state again, that this is why you don't hear any tunes from the Rolling Stones, The Doors, or Zeppelin. That's 1968 onward... I guess... and WWS does a commendable job.The uniforms are right on target with the 1965-66 timeframe. The choppers used featured equipment and weapons that wouldn't appear until a year or two later, but that's OK. The combat scenes capture the essence of the fighting, and thankfully no retarded cuts or zooms were used. However, we don't see a single M14 rifle (the precursor to the M-16, which is seen all over the place in WWS), as most of the troops would have been using them as the M16 wasn't fully deployed to units at that time. But the best thing I can say is that the characters of 2LT Geoghan (or whoever), SGM Plumley, and SGT Savage look incredibly like their real-life counterparts, as far as i could tell in the photo section of the novel. That kind of accuracy is commendable. The true-to-life events, such as the airstrike, are well done.I do have some gripes though... having served in the Army (1996-2001), there are some shortcomings that I am able to spot. There is not enough development given to make enough of the supporting characters memorable. This worked in Black Hawk Down, but not here. Plenty of faces appear beyond the top and second-billed characters, but something was missing. I would have liked to see more of Too Tall (the other pilot), Godbolt (the black dude), Jimmy Nakawama (got burned bad) and CPT Nadal (we have an American Platoon... OUT THERE!). They're mentioned plenty of times, and they function to give what I call their partner character some depth, but they themselves either appear, disappear, or don't have enough lines. Also, the sound is not terribly well-mixed as some of the dialogue is muffled, and the editing is about average. Some key scenes take place in near darkness, so knowing who's who as well as the emotional impact is missed.One thing that really irks me is.... the lack... no, the absence of the portrayal of black soldiers. PFC Godbolt is Geoghan's partner character, but he doesn't get a single line. He looks like a nice guy, throws a grenade, gets shot, dies. Obviously, black soldiers made up quite a bit of the Army in 1965 (and even now.... almost pointless to say) but there's no representation of them (I Don't MEAN THEM IN A BAD WAY, OK??) except for Godbolt's wife back home. The Asian soldier, Jiimmy Naki-something, appears, for like a split second in the beginning, then runs into Joe Galloway (I cant remember the guys name) during the attack. The he gets wounded. He's about the only minority who gets a line. Both he and Godbolt were real people...hmmmm.... The voice-over narration is used very spottily, and this coulda been polished up. Finally, there is a mention of losing a boatload of draftees is a bad week the draft wasn't in effect until 1969.Nevertheless, WWS is a solid war movie that tells the lesser-known era of the Vietnam involvement.

A friend of mine commented, Well, it's strange, the soundtrack to the movie is tribal in nature, and there's no memorable Sixties' tunes, like in other Nam movies. I explained to him that WWS to place in 1965, about a year or two before the huge appearance of the anti-war movement, and certainly predating the hippie movement, so these elements weren't meant to appear.A lot of it is fictionalized, but then again, so were many aspects of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan (some of the only worthwhile modern war movies in about the last twenty years). We Were Soldiers tells the rather un-hip story of the early Vietnam years, so, I must state again, that this is why you don't hear any tunes from the Rolling Stones, The Doors, or Zeppelin. That's 1968 onward... I guess... and WWS does a commendable job.The uniforms are right on target with the 1965-66 timeframe. The choppers used featured equipment and weapons that wouldn't appear until a year or two later, but that's OK. The combat scenes capture the essence of the fighting, and thankfully no retarded cuts or zooms were used. However, we don't see a single M14 rifle (the precursor to the M-16, which is seen all over the place in WWS), as most of the troops would have been using them as the M16 wasn't fully deployed to units at that time. But the best thing I can say is that the characters of 2LT Geoghan (or whoever), SGM Plumley, and SGT Savage look incredibly like their real-life counterparts, as far as i could tell in the photo section of the novel. That kind of accuracy is commendable. The true-to-life events, such as the airstrike, are well done.I do have some gripes though... having served in the Army (1996-2001), there are some shortcomings that I am able to spot. There is not enough development given to make enough of the supporting characters memorable. This worked in Black Hawk Down, but not here. Plenty of faces appear beyond the top and second-billed characters, but something was missing. I would have liked to see more of Too Tall (the other pilot), Godbolt (the black dude), Jimmy Nakawama (got burned bad) and CPT Nadal (we have an American Platoon... OUT THERE!). They're mentioned plenty of times, and they function to give what I call their partner character some depth, but they themselves either appear, disappear, or don't have enough lines. Also, the sound is not terribly well-mixed as some of the dialogue is muffled, and the editing is about average. Some key scenes take place in near darkness, so knowing who's who as well as the emotional impact is missed.One thing that really irks me is.... the lack... no, the absence of the portrayal of black soldiers. PFC Godbolt is Geoghan's partner character, but he doesn't get a single line. He looks like a nice guy, throws a grenade, gets shot, dies. Obviously, black soldiers made up quite a bit of the Army in 1965 (and even now.... almost pointless to say) but there's no representation of them (I Don't MEAN THEM IN A BAD WAY, OK??) except for Godbolt's wife back home. The Asian soldier, Jiimmy Naki-something, appears, for like a split second in the beginning, then runs into Joe Galloway (I cant remember the guys name) during the attack. The he gets wounded. He's about the only minority who gets a line. Both he and Godbolt were real people...hmmmm.... The voice-over narration is used very spottily, and this coulda been polished up. Finally, there is a mention of losing a boatload of draftees is a bad week the draft wasn't in effect until 1969.Nevertheless, WWS is a solid war movie that tells the lesser-known era of the Vietnam involvement. Yeah, everyone knows about the hippies, the peace signs on the soldier's helmets, the out of reg uniforms, the negative attitude, but these are staples of Nam movies that take place later in the war. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie made that deals with the later years of the war (say, 1972). Plus Madeline Stowe does a good job in as supporting role. Plus she looks real cute when she does that flinch\/double take when the cab guy arrives at her door.On par with BHD or SPR? No. But it is on the level of Platoon, Glory, and Hamburger Hill. 7 of 10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"5 February 2005","score":"17 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" I had gone to see A.I. with very high expectations, hoping to be not only entertained, but also intellectually stimulated. Unfortunately, neither happened.The movie started off with a very promising opening scene. The world set up in the movie is one where mecha - humanlike intelligent machines - are common, but often hated by humans. A team of scientists is interested in knowing whether a machine could be developed to love, like a real child, and whether people could love him back. Some of the initial issues brought up include what consists of humanity, whether machines can have feelings, whether they can love, and what responsibilities - if any - humans have towards machines. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would play out.Instead of a philosophical movie, however, A.I. gradually evolved into a long, run-on fairy tale loosely based on Pinocchio. David, the robot-child created to love, wants nothing more than to become a real boy so as to win the affection of his mother. He sets off on a typical fairy-tale quest, with the goal of finding the Blue Fairy who can grant his wish. Along the way he makes a couple of friends to serve as sidekicks, and encounters obstacles and dangers. This is an all-too-common plot that really did not need three hours to unfold.One of the problems with this movie is that it unsuccessfully fused two divergent visions - one of the late Stanley Kubrick, whose brainchild the movie initially was - and the other of Steven Spielberg, who finished the project after Kubrick's death. The lavish, grandiose scenes are clearly Kubrick, with a bit of the Burton-esquire dark side, thrown in for good measure (I could almost swear Tim Burton had a hand in this movie, if I didn't know better). Especially the scenes of the flesh fairs and the machines searching for old parts are plenty dark and twisted.And then? Just as we expect the plot to heat up and eventually come to a climax - nothing. The break between Kubrick's and Spielberg's visions in this movie is clearly apparent. Spielberg attempts to turn this into another E.T. (what is it with those acronym titles, anyway?) but fails miserably. One scene leads into another, and another, and another. Each scene of the last hour or so of the movie could easily have been the last. It really should have ended long before it did. Because when it finally ended, the audience was left with . . . well, I'm not sure. There's no moral, no message, no underlying meaning, and seemingly no rhyme or reason for ending the movie the way it ended. The last hour just chugs along aimlessly until it breaks off awkwardly, without really saying anything.Not that everything was bad. There was some very good acting in this movie, and a cute talking teddy bear. However, these small things fail to redeem this mess.Again, it's another case of a real shame. Had A.I. dared to ask the big questions, it could have been one of the most intelligent and thought-provoking movies in a long time. But it didn't, so it wasn't. If you're looking for something interesting, pick up a copy of Ray Kurzweil's book The Age of Spiritual Machines. A.I. doesn't even come close.
