[{"date":"3 April 2003","score":"","review":"  Slightly better sequel finds Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage once again in danger of a psycho fisherman. Julie returns from the previous flicks to take a vacation in the Bahamas with her new college buddies. It rains a lot. Jack Black dies. Brandy almost dies. Freddy Prinze Jr. gets beat up (Bonus!). There's really nothing in this movie that hasn't been covered in the first, but visually, this movie is superior. I've always had a thing for rainy movies, so this was a treat (plenty of wasted wet T-shirt opportunities however). It's a little gorier than the last one, but still isn't scary. Maybe I've seen too many horror films, but this is by the numbers. If you want to see Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in tight tanktops some more, rent this movie. It's bad, but it fills a sort of void, the void created by boredom and lack of motivation. An easy viewing I guess.P.S. I like the way the killer wrote the message on the wall. Just watch.

It can be seen as pure feminine escapism, as a kind a romantic comedy borrowing elements of `Wuthering Heights', its supernatural overtones, its setting and romance-driven mismatching of partners, which are present in all Gothic novels from the Bronte sisters to the Harlequin dime-store novels with a shirtless Pirate Fabio on the cover. I am not discounting this element and I might add that making a love story between a living woman and a dead seaman has to the ultimate erotic paroxysm of this kind of impossible, star-crossed mismatch. Talk about impediments to this marriage! But, on another level, Captain Gregg is not only an impossible ideal of truthfulness, fidelity, masculinity, nobility and courage that Mrs. Muir sees lacking in every man she has come across, he is also the mentor of her economic and psychological liberation from the oppressive forces that drove Victorian women to bad marriages or unsuitable living arrangements with strangers or family members they despised. On that level, Captain Gregg is a product of her imagination, but one that is also conveniently a product of her own will for identity and independence. Like the song says, she would rather be blue thinking of her unattainable ideal than be hap-happy with any less perfect man of flesh and blood; she would also much prefer to be left to her own devices than to depend on anybody else for survival. Having said this, the Gothic aspects of the story, the extreme polish of the script and dialogues, the magnificent acting, the intelligent direction, the lighting and photography, and, most of all, Bernard Herrmann's music score all combine to make of this story a true `spoken-word opera'. Nothing compares in the way of transcendentally powerful arias with Captain Gregg's goodbye to the sleeping Lucia. On the DVD, I played this scene in French and found it just as alarmingly beautiful. I played it in Spanish and was amazed by its passion and overtones of Luis Bunuel's own `Wuthering Heights' (despite the fact that for some reason, the Spanish versions of Fox films did not have access to a separate music-and-effects track and had to improvise their own music as background to any scene overlaid with dialogue). But most of all, it is the English-language version with (on this DVD) the slightly expanded fake stereo version of Herrmann's score that takes the prize for sheer bravado and operatic grandeur. I watched this over and over again, wondering why in the world there never were Oscar nominations for `Best performance by a sleeping beauty' and `Best performance by a departing Shakespearean ghost', two staples of the operatic repertoire.
