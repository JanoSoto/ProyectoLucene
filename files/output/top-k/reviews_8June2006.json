Yes, Alien is a straight-up sci-fi horror flick, and Aliens is a typical sci-fi action run-n-gun extravaganza based on the creatures found in the original, but there's something about Aliens that seems to put all of the necessary scares and thrills made famous from the first one, then added much more tension and excitement than the first film can ever hope to achieve. Instead of facing one alien, Ellen Ripley (the main protagonist from the first Alien, played wonderfully by Sigourney Weaver in one of her best roles) and a group of outer-space mercenaries faces off against an army of them! It made even more tension-filled thanks to James Cameron's excellent direction. This is what an action movie should be, so all directors taking on a high explosive action movie should take notes from James Cameron's Aliens. OK, but many would be asking Why would some action movie ranks with the likes of classic movies, such as The Godfather, Schindler's List, and even Saving Private Ryan to name a few. Well, I have an explanation about that. In theory, Aliens is a typical what I would call run-n-gun action movie affair such as any typical Michael Bay movie, and since it deals with creatures attacking humans, it would be logical that it can be compared with rather superfluous creature features such as Deep Blue Sea, Jeepers Creepers, and Congo. But that was what separate Aliens from the rest, in that unlike the others, this one has a story that is well connected to the characters' motives and that it is actually worth paying attention to. For example, Ellen Ripley isn't just some one-woman army that is typical of any heroic action movies, she actually have the motives and realistic tendencies to really give herself a strong presence throughout the entire film. Sigourney Weaver pulled out a surprise by being nominated for Best Actress of 1986 at the Oscars for a role that really shouldn't. After watching it, you would be surprise by how strong of a performance she really delivered. Unlike the first Alien, in which she practically runs away from the creature, in this film you'll see how she must conquer her fears of the creatures in order to save an innocent little girl (played by Carrie Henn) from an alien infested space colony. To put it bluntly, this movies proves why the character of Ellen Ripley is among the greatest movie heroine in cinema history, and Sigourney Weaver will forever be immortalized as the character. The alien creatures themselves are some of the most terrifying, and thanks to the wonderful puppetry, the creatures gives an organic feel that makes them come alive, and gives the film much more tension-filled moments based on the design of the creatures. One little thing of particular notice is the astounding film and sound editing. Since the aliens wouldn't deliver a promising threat to the mercenaries based on presence alone, the film editing gives it a sense of real danger and thrill that would, in my opinion, ruin the movie in the hand of a less talented film editor. In other word, the film would be half as successful if it weren't for the smart editing techniques. And the sounds emitted by the aliens and the surrounding environment gives the abandoned setting a more menacing and terrifying place to visit, which are excellent additions to keep the tension up. The music, while not extraordinarily memorable as say Star Wars, brings the tension package together with grace, since the music adds so much to the terror and dismay in the movie, a great way to bring out the heart-stopping moments throughout the film (and there are tons, with most of them being the most memorable in cinema history in my opinion). And, although I've stated it before, it wouldn't be as great as it is without James Cameron. James Cameron had made a masterpiece with Aliens, in which he took the basic monster run-n-gun thriller and took it not just to the next level, but also with great balance. There's no overabundance of mindless shooting (although there are plenty to consider the movie a run-n-gun affair) and, believe it or not, the characters do not play second-fiddle to the action itself. Although some of the mercenaries wouldn't require deep characterizations, Ellen Ripley and her exploit in the abandoned outer-space human colony makes the already tension-filled atmosphere the more tension-filled. James Cameron demonstrated the perfect action movie in my opinion, and thanks to the atmosphere set by Ridley Scott's Alien, this one bring a whole lot more to the table, making the Ellen Ripley battle with the aliens a whole lot more satisfying than the original. Out of the four Alien films (not counting Alien vs. Predator), this one is definitely the best. Not just the best in the series, but one of the best in cinema as a whole, in my opinion. There just isn't any other movie that delivers this much thrill, terror, and pure excitement as Aliens, and it took only James Cameron to make another run-n-gun masterpiece to match up to it (that would be Terminator 2 Judgment Day). Overall, for those who would like to know what movie would deliver in thrills with no bad story bogging it down and a hero (or heroine) that is not dumbed down by the plot, Aliens is the answer. The definitive action movie that stills holds up today, and to a degree, one of the best movies ever. A 10\/10 would seem only reasonable for an action movie with no noticeable flaw, and it is James Cameron's most superb work in years.

The only commercial that I ever saw that had Lucas in it was the clip where he and Maggie are sitting underneath Ravinia listening to the concert.The other reason that it didn't do quite as well was that it was different from the teen comedies of the day, which you could more or less split into two groups--John Hughes movies and naked horny teen movies. Lucas was far too intelligent to be a naked horny teen movie, but not quite funny enough to be in the same league as a John Hughes movie. I always thought that the movie veered unnecessarily into melodrama after Lucas got sacked, and you found out that his dad was an alcoholic--especially considering that the plot point was never used again and didn't seem to change things.So many good actors came out of this movie (Winona Ryder, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Charlie Sheen--even Corey Haim), and it works on so many different levels. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a warm, relatively inoffensive coming-of-age movie.

But when the remake was announced, I became interested, and even more so as the mythical 6\/6\/06 day was arriving. So in special celebration (not the right word, I know) of that day, I purchased up the original and watched it. While I was not terribly disappointed, I was not entirely impressed either.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador in Italy, whose wife Katherine (Lee Remick) has given birth to a stillborn baby, on June 6 at 6 A.M.. For the sake of his wife, Robert goes to an orphanage and adopts a new born child, who he brings to his wife, without ever telling her of the tragic death. They name him Damien, and soon after, the Thorns are moved to Britain. As Damien's fifth birthday comes though, a bizarre death occurs at his party, and even stranger things begin to happen soon afterwards, leading Robert to start believing that his son may be the Anti-Christ.While the film is not particularly scary, it is fairly tense. As the film goes along and the death toll rises, you cannot help but start believing what is going on is much more real than it may seem. Just the idea of the devil being born again in the body of a child is terrifying enough. And as a result, Richard Donner's production performs well, even thirty years later. David Seltzer's screenplay is well versed and well written. Even though you can predict what's coming, the writing is still very well done and well communicated. Jerry Goldsmith's score holds up well, if a little more dramatic than it should be.Peck is great as Robert, always questioning, and never truly knowing the truth. When emotional moments come however, his acting is not as reciprocal as it should be. But this is a great actor here, and he handles the material well, and never really messes it up. Remick is not bad, but falls to the wayside about halfway through, in order for Robert's investigation to really take hold of the film.

While I was not terribly disappointed, I was not entirely impressed either.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador in Italy, whose wife Katherine (Lee Remick) has given birth to a stillborn baby, on June 6 at 6 A.M.. For the sake of his wife, Robert goes to an orphanage and adopts a new born child, who he brings to his wife, without ever telling her of the tragic death. They name him Damien, and soon after, the Thorns are moved to Britain. As Damien's fifth birthday comes though, a bizarre death occurs at his party, and even stranger things begin to happen soon afterwards, leading Robert to start believing that his son may be the Anti-Christ.While the film is not particularly scary, it is fairly tense. As the film goes along and the death toll rises, you cannot help but start believing what is going on is much more real than it may seem. Just the idea of the devil being born again in the body of a child is terrifying enough. And as a result, Richard Donner's production performs well, even thirty years later. David Seltzer's screenplay is well versed and well written. Even though you can predict what's coming, the writing is still very well done and well communicated. Jerry Goldsmith's score holds up well, if a little more dramatic than it should be.Peck is great as Robert, always questioning, and never truly knowing the truth. When emotional moments come however, his acting is not as reciprocal as it should be. But this is a great actor here, and he handles the material well, and never really messes it up.

His job is relatively easy until a large Great White Shark begins using the beach for a buffet on the 4th of July weekend. Brody joins forces with an oceanographer and a crazed sea captain with a vendetta against sharks to kill the creature once and for all. With its great acting, superb direction and intelligent dialogue, Jaws is truly one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.Peter Benchley's chilling novel was an instant best seller, so it was only a matter of time before someone attempted to make it a movie. Thank God it was Steven Spielberg. At the time this film was made, Spielberg was still relatively unknown except for a few TV projects including the cat and mouse thriller Duel. Steven Spielberg brought his genius directing style and mixed it with the words of Benchley's great novel to make the first ever summer blockbuster. What I like most about this film is that it's not really a horror, and it's not really an action. There's actually a story to it. The intelligent dialogue makes the movie interesting to watch because of its blend of humour, fear, and desperation. Of course, there are two other main things that add to the effect of this movie. The first is the chilling score by John Williams. You don't even have to see the movie to know where it's from. The second is the fact that you don't really see the shark until the end. The tension just keeps building.Obviously, a lot of the success has to be credited to the great actors involved in this movie. Roy Scheider is great as Martin Brody who is determined to kill the shark yet has a great fear of the water. Robert Shaw is beyond perfect as Quint, the Ahab-like captain who will stop at nothing to destroy the shark, even if it means his death and the death of those around him. Richard Dreyfuss is always good to me, but especially so here. His constant bickering with Quint makes for some awesome comic relief.Overall, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films out there. It takes itself seriously yet it's still a popcorn flick. I recommend this movie to everyone.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 June 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Jaws tells the story of New York cop Martin Brody, who has moved to a small summer tourist island to become the chief of police.

This was not the case for me though. Although I have nothing against the people who enjoyed this film, I cannot deny how terrible I thought it was. Let me explain Firstly the characters. I have to ask, what characters? Honestly, there seems to be absolutely no character depth at all. It's just guys walking around making jokes. Take Groucho Marx for example, all he seems to do is make insulting jokes towards people. The main problem for me is that the jokes are not funny at all. And I can admit there were lines which I thought could have been remotely funny had they only been done by a funny character. Groucho's character just seems blank to me. Then there's also Harpo Marx, who simply goes around cutting things and annoying people. He doesn't even talk. I don't see how he can even be classified as a character personally.To be blunt, I found this movie boring. In just 20 minutes into the film, I felt so sleepy I had to go to bed. I wasn't tired before the movie nor should I have been. I didn't tire myself out that day at all, and it wasn't even late, but watching this film made me so bored I wanted to go to bed.

The central story about the aristocrats finding interest in an American millionaire (Mitchum) and an old flame of Grant's (Simmons) had potential. But the problem was that the screenplay is too talky and too cerebral, but not (paradoxically) as complete as it should be.There are pages and pages of the dialog which are (frankly) long winded. Cary Grant is not amusing when explaining his behavior to people, even Deborah Kerr. Whatever emotional chemistry worked for them so wonderfully in AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER is cut down considerably here.The additions of Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons does not really help. Mitchum's growing interest in Kerr, and her growing response to his seeing her in London is okay, but Simmons' relationship regarding Grant is not developed. We know they had an affair before he married her friend Kerr, and she has remained a friend of both, and she is funny regarding her open interest in sex, but why Grant's rejection of her is never really gone into. Also, at the tale end, there is the suggestion that Simmons and Mitchum might find each other a worthy lover. But nothing in the film really builds up to that final look between them! There are good moments - Grant and Mitchum going fishing, and muttering under their breaths about each other, and the business about the fur coat gift that Mitchum buys Kerr, and she tries to hide (and Simmons ends up wearing as her own). But the good moments are fragments. The duel scene towards the end is analyzed to death. It says a lot that the use of Noel Coward's song THE STATELY HOMES OF ENGLAND on the soundtrack at the start and end of the film is one of the highlights. One wishes Coward wrote the screenplay here - it might have been brighter or more consistent.Because the cast really tries I have given it a 7, but it is not as good a film as it should have been.

The central story about the aristocrats finding interest in an American millionaire (Mitchum) and an old flame of Grant's (Simmons) had potential. But the problem was that the screenplay is too talky and too cerebral, but not (paradoxically) as complete as it should be.There are pages and pages of the dialog which are (frankly) long winded. Cary Grant is not amusing when explaining his behavior to people, even Deborah Kerr.

No great meaning, but it would become the standard for the title sequences of Bonds to come. 6 points.Theme Song Apparently several theme songs were written for this film and for some reason this was deemed the best. Makes you wonder what the others sounded like. The music is okay, I suppose, but the words are just plain nonsensical, revealing nothing about the movie itself. It's not even clear if the song is about Bond or about the film's villain He knows the meaning of success \/ His needs are more so he gives less. Huh? Tom Jones belts the song out with gusto, but there's nothing to really work with. 2 points Bond, James Bond Could it be that Connery is getting bored with the character already? After the opening teaser, he sort of walks through the rest of the film. It's a not a bad performance, but you get the feeling that he knows that the material is mediocre and is busy thinking about his next non-Bond project. 6 points.Bond Babes Claudine Auger is pretty as Domino, the villain's mistress. There's not much more to say. 5 points.Bond Villain As Emilio Largo (a.k.a., Number 2 at SPECTRE), Adolfo Celi wears an eye patch, which is about the full extent of his characterization. Celi can't be totally blamed for this, since the film allows him few opportunities to create a character, or for that matter, to even have any dialogue. As a key player in a plot to set off nuclear devices, you would think the writers could think of something of interest for him to say or do. No such luck. 3 points.Bond Baddies As assassin and seductress Fiona Volpe, Luciana Paluzzi could have stolen the film. She is certainly attractive enough and cold-blooded enough. But, again, the screenplay doesn't give her a lot of leeway for creating a colorful character or for flaunting her evil in an entertaining fashion. Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, her counterpart in the 1983 remake NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN would do so much more with the part. Even so, she gets a respectable 7 points.Plot After the one-two-three success of the previous Bond films, it is surprising just how routine number four seems. Blofeld and company steal a couple of nuclear bombs and hold the world for ransom. Perhaps this is the first spy film to concoct that particular gimmicky plot, but that doesn't make it any less cliché and just plain silly. 2 points.Production values Much of the story takes place underwater, where a hijacked NATO fighter plane is submerged. Thus, so much of the action is in slow motion and performed by stunt people wearing diving masks. Boring! Despite a countdown to a possible nuclear holocaust, the film lacks any sense of urgency and drama. 4 points.Bonus Points THUNDERBALL is so undistinguished, it is tempting to subtract points just out of spite.
