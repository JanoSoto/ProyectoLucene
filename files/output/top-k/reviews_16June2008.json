My second complaint is that Broderick's character gets the majority of the screen time, therefore overshadowing Witherspoon and Klein's characters.....In fact you may at times forget you are watching a movie based on a high school election, as it seems to be a portrayal of the life and times of teacher Jim Mcallister (Matthew Broderick). Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) really suffered from this, and had minimal screen time.This film was supposed to be a comedy, but yet i rarely found myself even cracking a smile....It just wasn't very funny at all.Other flaws and plot holes are as follows....1) The chemistry between the lead characters was almost non existent. Broderick, Witherspoon, and Kleins characters were barely on screen together, which made it hard to get a feel for the movie.2) Brodericks hate towards Witherspoon was just unconvincing. She had not done enough in the film to warrant being disliked by him so much, that he would risk his job to fix the results of the election. Once again, they were rarely on screen together, and there was no chemistry between them.3) Chris Kleins character Paul was just not convincing enough as being 'Mr Popular'. He was too slow and dumbed down to gain much respect from anyone, and the character was under used and poorly written. The potential for this character could have been great.4) The scene where Tracy lost the election to Paul could have been so much better. Tracy barely showed any reaction to losing at the time, when what you were really expecting was for her to go completely nuts in front of the whole school. We were denied the pleasure of seeing this, and instead 'treated' to seeing her crying her eyes out at home.5) The ending was just ridiculous. Dragged out and boring. By this time the film really had lost its direction, and the ending just seemed like it didn't know what to do with itself, or which way to go.The film was OK in parts, but it just wasn't very good. And I am actually 'amazed' that there are so many positive reviews for this movie. Im actually baffled.....Did we watch the same movie? Anyway the film is worth a look if you're a fan of the American high school teen thing, but i watched this with two other people who thought exactly the same as me.4\/10 stars, and thats being quite generous too!

It's all part of the fun. It was offering something new to the series. As much as I love the other movies, most of them were all pretty similar in terms of plot, with characters that were hard to distinguish from one another, to me anyway. Sure the movies were all different in a couple of ways, but they still had a fair few similarities. Bunch of teens in a secluded area getting picked off one by one. Sure Jason Lives sort of has that, but it's a much smaller part of the movie. A New Beginning tried something new, but it didn't really pay off for them. The thing about the other movies were they were essentially about the killer taking out the people for most the movie. The minor exception to that rule was The Final Chapter, which contained some awareness to the situation, but even that came under that profile for the most part. Jason Lives seems to focus more on the fight against Jason. There are characters who know what he is doing from the start.Another thing I like about the movie is the fact that the kills seem a lot cooler to me. Normally you would just see characters see Jason, have a scared look on their face and get killed. Or a character killed so fast they probably wouldn't even realise that they are being killed. It's not a major problem but it wasn't really what I wanted to see every time. Now scenes in the range of someone firing rounds of shotgun shells into Jason is more like it.

And in this film, it does, as the radioactivity from a worldwide nuclear holocaust finally reaches Australia and the last humans face extinction. This sombre classic, with its spectacular performances from some of the leading stars of Hollywood, and its magnificent script and direction by Stanley Kramer, is based on a best-selling novel of the time by Nevil Shute. This film shook up the entire world when it was released. Apart from being the first occasion when any Americans had ever heard 'Waltzing Matilda' (somewhat overdone on the soundtrack), or indeed had even realized that Australia existed, this film was about that subject which now faces us again the end of civilization and of the human species. We now know that this will not come about by nuclear war, but by all the other causes too plentiful to enumerate (perhaps with the odd terrorist atomic bomb thrown in). The most shocking aspect of this film is the total calm and resignation of all of the characters in the film, their dignity, their self-control, their lack of hysteria. All that has gone. Today the same film would have to show people rampaging in the streets, knifing each other, getting dead drunk, vomiting everywhere, having sex in doorways, all the things they are already doing every day anyway, but somewhat more frenzied because they realize it's their last chance. No single film shows more clearly the total decline in society in the past half a century than does this one. If we needed a lesson in the hurtling speed with which hedonism, decadence, and collapse of values have overwhelmed us like a tsunami, this film provides it. In the entire film the sole character who even goes into denial and protests (but only to her husband) is the young wife with a baby, played by first-timer Donna Anderson (who strangely looks just like my friend Jenny Anderson, also once an actress doppelganger?). The performance by Gregory Peck is a marvel of restraint and controlled emotion, Ava Gardner is intensely and passionately heart-breaking, Fred Astaire in a straight dramatic role proves what a brilliant actor he is, and above all, Anthony Perkins acts circles round all the others, which takes a lot of doing, considering how amazing they all are. His every twitch and gesture is inspired. Stanley Kramer's script and direction are miraculous. The visit to California by submarine and some of the scenes there are so spine-chilling that words are insufficient. This is one of those films of which one can unreservedly say that it is 'a great movie'. If only we could dismiss it as fantasy fiction, but alas, this looks like really happening to us before long, only in a different way. Really, all schoolchildren should be made to watch this film, and it would perhaps sober them up. Above all, what we have lost is dignity. There is so much of it in this film, there is so little left today. It seems to me, if it is not too obvious a thing to say, that the end of humanity is something worth two hours and 14 minutes of our time at least. Or can we stop binge-drinking long enough for that? Some reflection after watching this astonishing film will bring illumination to the thoughtful. People with their noses stuck in video games need not apply. But just think, when we all go down, all the horrible disgusting people will be wiped out too! It's almost worth it, isn't it, just to see the human vermin exterminated. It might be a great way to start again with the lower mammals. Maybe a hundred million years from now, a more successful 'human' species will evolve, and let's hope they get it right. This film is really a kind of testament to our failed species, but our degree of failure in 1959 was nothing to what it is now.

Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell. Orson Welles's 'spell' seems to grow with each viewing of this film, as if each time one sees it, more phosphorescent light is emitted by that eerie face so suddenly illuminated in the doorway. And oh, the haunting atmosphere of that deserted postwar city at night! The alleys! And the subterranean river with its sewer drains, of which Carol included so many extra brooding shots, to such great effect. How many 78 rpm records of Anton Karas's theme song were sold? It must have been more than a million. This film has never ceased to live in our imaginations, nor should it.

Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell.

It's easy to see the film now and recognise with the added aid of history what it was trying to say. It's also easy now to point out more recent films that have been influenced by it. But I feel Three Days of the Condor is one of those films that most people should see for this reason alone; for the reason that you don't need a cut a second approach to get across the feeling of urgency and it is possible to write a film that doesn't have its protagonists always rely on technology.The 'Condor' of the title refers to Robert Redford's character and how earlier examples of the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time can still seem afresh. Joseph Turner (Redford) leaves his post at a CIA run building which scans and analyses most written texts in the world for secret, encrypted clues. Here is the film setting up its predominant theme of suspicion. At a time when the East and the West were at loggerheads, the CIA must recruit people to read and scan seemingly random books in order to uncover clues and conspiracies, most of which will not even be present. It's this sort of paranoid, 'reading too much into something' atmosphere and situation the film carries the entire time. This is aided by the films constant air of ambiguity shown toward who Turner's character can trust and who he cannot. But the film establishes this hero as a problem solver, albeit a solver for problems and equations that perhaps don't exist before placing him in this situation where a massive problem has erupted and he must deal with it &#150; we as an audience feel he is up to the task.Then there are the little things you notice thanks to viewing it in the 21st Century. Back in the day when narratives and screenplays actually needed brains and couldn't rely on technology and modernity, films like this were made. When Turner discovers the initial incident in his office building, he cannot use a cell phone so runs to the nearest phone booth. He has to actually get a grip of the situation, leave the establishment without giving anything away and then calmly find a public phone. Likewise later on, when he catches up Kathy Hale (Dunaway) he must wait for the news to start at a certain time. At this point, she doesn't trust him and he has to use his brain to devise a way to keep her from escaping while he can rest and wait for the news. In today's post-modern environment, a 24 Hour News Channel would've cured the problem in a second and we would've been robbed of a scene that not only furthers the forced intimacy of Turner and Hale but one that also enhances Turner's intellectual qualities as he thinks up a solution to his problem of resting\/waiting.These sorts of things are a far cry to the junk we have produced today when technology and gadgets do it for the characters. Take Michael Mann's 2006 stinker 'Miami Vice' and look at how cell phones and laptops do most of the work as the two lead stars strut about with blank expressions on their faces. Then there are the times when you realise this film has been done more recently but with lesser success. The CIA chase idea; the not knowing who's your enemy and who's your friend and more noticeably the character of Hale in this film who's character later resurfaces in The Bourne Identity under the guise of Franka Potente's German character Marie. But Three Days of the Condor retains a certain mysterious atmosphere, it cuts back on itself but when it does so, it never feels like a gimmick and nor do you feel cheated out of an action set piece or a character's death. The primary strand the film has going is its USA vs. USA ideas, especially brave during The Cold War. As a hero, Turner is a blonde haired, upstanding guy who doesn't seem as if he'd hurt anyone and he battles a massive organisation on his own. Then there is the secondary strand running parallel with this involving Dunaway's character and her relationship with Turner which covers all the areas you'd expect it to but it never becomes the primary focus. There is dialogue, there are scene involving just the two of them and they do make love on one occasion but it never overtakes the espionage they are here, this is what happens, this is how they feel and then 'bang', we move on.Furthermore, I think the film's other theme as opposed to hunting and looking for things that elude certain individuals is that of watching and point of view. Hale comments that Turner has the sort of eyes which 'don't look away'. They are 'kind' eyes and this scenes while furthering the feeling between the two once again highlights the film's primary ideas about point of view and the constant looking, searching and finding of someone or something. The scene seems unnecessary bar to further the relationship but as I said, the film never gets distracted with the romance and thus even the scenes that seem most obvious in doing so are actually linked with strand one. With a brooding atmosphere, good performances from talent you'll recognise and a series of themes, Three Days of the Condor is a winner.

Edward Norton gives one of the great performances of all time as Derek Vinyard, a former skinhead trying to make amends and save his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from the same path. The narrative is non-linear, alternating between the present and flashbacks to various points in the past. The flashbacks are presented in black and white, representing both the static and unchanging nature of the past and the simplistic former world-view of Derek.Norton is not only great in his performance, but frightening as well. He is articulate, intelligent and sometimes for a moment, he almost seems to make sense. Unlike, say, Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York, his character cannot be dismissed as a relic of history; there are people like this around today. His rhetoric embodies everything that is both dangerous and alluring about the Right, whether in the form of the Nazis of the past or the Neo-Conservatives of the present. It feeds upon the vulnerability of the ignorant, upon fear and disillusionment and the need to feel victimized. From what he says, you would think that white Americans were at the mercy of some kind of hegemony of minorities, rather than the other way around (listen to the drunk college students in 'Borat' for a disturbing real-life example of this). We are losing our right to pursue our destiny, Derek preaches before leading his gang to commit acts of terrorism and thievery. Where anyone who is not a WASP fits into this destiny is not made clear, but the words are hypnotic like Danny's Iron Cross swinging in front of his computer screen. These people hide behind false patriotism, using it as a tool for justifying the ugliest acts imaginable. The presence of the American flag is pervasive throughout the film (early on we see Danny picking his teeth with a miniature American flag, a brilliant metaphor for the above).Eventually, Derek kills two blacks (perhaps the most sickening sound effect in movie history was that guy's teeth on the curb; if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) and is sent to prison for three years. There, he meets and eventually befriends a black man who is there longer for a much lesser crime and he starts to see through his own rhetoric. He is changed both by his realization of the complex nature of the world and of the flaws in his manner of going about things. His former teacher (Avery Brooks) advises him, You have to ask the right questions, and asks Has anything you've done made your life better? Salvation will come not through rhetoric and being vindictive, but only through working to change things for the better because as Danny later says, Life's too short to be (expletive)ed off all the time. After Derek gets out of prison, he severs his ties with the old chicken-hawk Cameron Alexander, who had previously been his mentor and who was now courting his brother. Danny is outraged when Derek snubs his former followers and after catching up to him, noisily beats him against a metal garage-like door while Derek calmly repeats to him, Take it easy. That is perhaps the main message that we take away from American History X (and one also brought into focus in Paul Haggis' Crash). People are too quick to anger and too slow to accept responsibility for themselves. In this film, as in life, the easiest answers are seldom the right ones, everything is more complicated than it seems, and there are unfortunate consequences to actions that not even the best of intentions can allay. But 'Taking it easy' is an important step in the right direction.To conclude, this is another (perhaps unfortunately) timeless piece of film-making. The US is heading into what will likely be the ugliest election in its history.

I remember that I did not enjoy it, but also clearly remember that I was in a tired state, which the seemed to happen to me after the school's Christmas assembly for some strange reason. Therefore, that says nothing about the quality of Monsters, Inc. I've seen it thrice since then, and while it has never been one of my favourites from Pixar, and may have more appeal to kids than adults, I certainly can't go as far as saying it's STRICTLY for kids.Monstropolis is a city where only monsters live. This city relies on a company called Monsters, Inc. for its power. This company's employees enter human children's rooms through the closets and scare them to make them scream, as their screams are what generate the power for Monstropolis! Two monsters who work for Monsters, Inc. are James P. Sulley Sullivan (a big, furry, blue creature), and Mike Wazowski (a green Cyclops monster with no torso), who are best friends. Currently, Sulley is in the #1 position for causing the most screams, but Randall, his chameleon-like rival, is determined to top him! One night, Sulley sees that a toddler girl has come in through one of the doors! Residents of Monstropolis are convinced that human children are poisonous, so Sulley and Mike are scared when they first see her, but she seems harmless, and Sulley grows to like her, giving her the name, Boo. Still, they must try to get her back home before any other monster finds her! There definitely is humour in this movie, but a lot of it is perhaps more amusing for the kids. I personally found a lot of it at least mildly amusing, but overall, I didn't find the movie as funny as I had hoped. We have plenty of the standard slapstick here, but it sometimes seems too simple and childish, and not as funny as I usually find that type of humour. Mike Wazowski is a comic character, with his bitterness and sarcasm, which helps. Claiming he and Sulley are rehearsing a scene for an upcoming company play when their co-workers catch them talking about Boo is a highlight. Overall, I think Mike's New Car, an animated short featuring Mike and Sulley, is slightly funnier than their full-length movie, but for the most part, I guess the humour in Monsters, Inc. is good enough. Maybe funnier for kids, but adults could definitely get their share of laughs as well.Other than humour, this Pixar effort tells a very imaginative story. It may not be the most well written one to ever come from the computer animation company, but still one that obviously took talent and imagination to write. The adventure that the two main characters find themselves on eventually gets quite exciting. As usual with Pixar, the animation is no disappointment, you can basically expect the same kind of great animation and colours here. So, this is not one of Pixar's best, but it is still another job well done from the company. I'm sure Monsters, Inc. has a lot for kids, which is good, since these animated family films are supposed to entertain them, but also has entertainment value for adults as well, even if it's not equal entertainment value for both audiences like it sometimes is.

The plan is to rob five different casinos within the matter of minutes on New Year's Eve. I've been wanting to catch this film for quite sometime and it actually turned out to be just as I expected. I really can't call this a good movie because the story is so incredibly stupid that it's very hard to take anything in it serious but I think that's probably the key to having a good time watching it. The whole plan to rob the casinos is so incredibly dumb that if you did decide to take the film serious then you wouldn't enjoy a thing about it but if you're willing to turn your brain off then you might end up being entertained. There's no suspense to speak of and there's not too much comedy so what does the film have going for it? The cool cast, which is constantly trying to act cool in front of the camera. Not only do we get Sinatra but we've also got Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, Cesar Romero, Richard Conte, Henry Silva, Angie Dickinson, Ilka Chase, Buddy Lester and cameo spots by Shirley MacLaine, Red Skelton and George Raft. The wonderful cast really makes this film worth watching and that's really the only thing the movie has going for it. I wouldn't say the direction was overly good but that is mainly due to the screenplay that really doesn't allow anything great to happen. The first hour is a long introduction to all the characters but we really don't learn too much. When the heist finally takes place it's very well handled and fun and I only wish more time could have been spent on it. In the end, this is a nostalgic film that works its magic due to the cast having fun. If you don't take it too serious then you should enjoy it too.

After embarrassing his sister (Josephine Hull) one time too many, she goes to put Stewart away but the doctors have a hard time getting him (and Harvey).

I think the most important thing he brings to the role is the fact that he can make the viewer overlook that we can't see Harvey and Stewart really pushes his charm and sweetness to the point where we just go along with him and accept it as a fact that a big rabbit is standing next to him. Oscar winner Hull is hilarious from start to finish as is the supporting cast, which includes Cecil Kellaway, Charles Drake and Peggy Dow.

If memory serves me fine,it's been a while since last time I felt compelled to do the same thing- can't wait to gush,about the feelings that keep flooding my mind, and heart. This time,it's only after I watched the movie legend of 1900. A truly remarkable, profoundly touching piece of cinema. Well directed,the scenes beautiful and emotion-laden, characters fully fleshed out and convincingly depicted. A job more than well done. Kudos to the crew and cast. But I think the thing that really reaches and touches the innermost recess of my tender heart, is not just the movie,the art form ,the vehicle that serves to showcase, but rather what's been told, what's been showcased, what's been revealed. In other words,It's the story that does it. I didn't know much about the screenplay and the writer thing,nor that I cared. I just noticed at the beginning of the movie,when the billing came up one by one,the movie is based on a novel ,by a foreign writer.I mean he is a Non-American writer.Perhaps a Spaniard or French.So the immigrant perspective and sentiments pervasive in this story(and movie,thanks to the wonderful director,who is also a Non-American director,by the way) are very much real,and make for a truly cinematic as well as literary success, in terms of how many hearts it touches and moves. For there's always something alien in this story, in the main character 1900,the seafaring pianist who refused to ever set foot on dry land,not even when the ship he was born and spent all his life on,Virginian,was about to be blown up to pieces.Not that only immigrants would be easily associated with such aberrations,it's just that it would feel more right if it occurs with a foreigner, an immigrant who is destined to be at odds with a whole new culture that is seething beyond the board, beyond the beckoning Statue of Liberty.I just fear such a brilliant, such a heart-breaking ,such a once-in-a-lifetime story would not be safe with a seasoned, sophisticated and native American screenwriter and director. There's always something they just can't get, that subtle vibe, that unique angle.Unless they are foreigners, they are immigrants, they see things differently,literally and figuratively. So it's a real good thing, for audience, and for the cinema history as well perhaps, that a foreign squad was assembled to get the story told in cinematic terms. Even The lead role,1900, was played by a foreign actor, Tim Roth, a Briton. I keep missing the point.I don't know why.I have no idea why I keep avoiding coming to the point. The point of what's in the story that grabbed my heart and squeezes my tear gland so damn hard.There's no beating around the bush now I guess.It's just me,I must confess. It's the way 1900 lived his life, viewed his life, chose to end his life that really struck a chord with me.Because I can feel 1900, because in a way I'm him, I'm like living in a ship of life, just like him. I sympathise with him,with what he has gone through;I'm saddened by what he's missed,what he's been denied- life's luxury,great love, a skyrocketing fame,given his stunning piano-playing skills;I truly relate to what he said at the end of the movie to Max, his only bosom friend on board(and assumedly,on land too),the trumpet player, the words he whispered in his characteristically mellow voice,with an air of confidence and ease fit for a Shakespeare play monologue, with a light in the eyes that could still an enraged lion, the words that really tugged at my tender heartstrings. I could only paraphrase.I may not be able to quote verbatim,but the gist is, life beyond the board is like a piano with infinite keys with it. A piano you can make no music on. A talented,nay,gifted player like him could only play(and alas,played so fantastically) on a piano with 88 keys. Once on land,he would find himself stranded, in the endless possibilities, infinite choices, and limitless temptations. He'd felt lost and he'd never be himself. He'd rather blow up with the ship. And he wished there'd be pianos in heaven. All of a sudden,I just got it,why I'm so moved by this movie.

If memory serves me fine,it's been a while since last time I felt compelled to do the same thing- can't wait to gush,about the feelings that keep flooding my mind, and heart. This time,it's only after I watched the movie legend of 1900. A truly remarkable, profoundly touching piece of cinema. Well directed,the scenes beautiful and emotion-laden, characters fully fleshed out and convincingly depicted. A job more than well done. Kudos to the crew and cast. But I think the thing that really reaches and touches the innermost recess of my tender heart, is not just the movie,the art form ,the vehicle that serves to showcase, but rather what's been told, what's been showcased, what's been revealed. In other words,It's the story that does it. I didn't know much about the screenplay and the writer thing,nor that I cared. I just noticed at the beginning of the movie,when the billing came up one by one,the movie is based on a novel ,by a foreign writer.I mean he is a Non-American writer.Perhaps a Spaniard or French.So the immigrant perspective and sentiments pervasive in this story(and movie,thanks to the wonderful director,who is also a Non-American director,by the way) are very much real,and make for a truly cinematic as well as literary success, in terms of how many hearts it touches and moves. For there's always something alien in this story, in the main character 1900,the seafaring pianist who refused to ever set foot on dry land,not even when the ship he was born and spent all his life on,Virginian,was about to be blown up to pieces.Not that only immigrants would be easily associated with such aberrations,it's just that it would feel more right if it occurs with a foreigner, an immigrant who is destined to be at odds with a whole new culture that is seething beyond the board, beyond the beckoning Statue of Liberty.I just fear such a brilliant, such a heart-breaking ,such a once-in-a-lifetime story would not be safe with a seasoned, sophisticated and native American screenwriter and director. There's always something they just can't get, that subtle vibe, that unique angle.Unless they are foreigners, they are immigrants, they see things differently,literally and figuratively. So it's a real good thing, for audience, and for the cinema history as well perhaps, that a foreign squad was assembled to get the story told in cinematic terms. Even The lead role,1900, was played by a foreign actor, Tim Roth, a Briton. I keep missing the point.I don't know why.I have no idea why I keep avoiding coming to the point. The point of what's in the story that grabbed my heart and squeezes my tear gland so damn hard.There's no beating around the bush now I guess.It's just me,I must confess. It's the way 1900 lived his life, viewed his life, chose to end his life that really struck a chord with me.Because I can feel 1900, because in a way I'm him, I'm like living in a ship of life, just like him.

Night Shyamalan, it became the best film he's made to this point.Following the old if it ain't broke, don't fix it rule, Shyamalan teams up with Bruce Willis again, and for the second consecutive time Willis plays a more subdued role compared to his signature films (no yippee-ki-yay moments here). His character is a security guard named David Dunn. He's an ordinary man who used to play football in high school but had to quit because of an injury. One day, he is on a train that accidentally derails, resulting in the death of all passengers but him. On top of being the only survivor, he doesn't have a single scratch on his body.

Elijah is convinced David is some kind of superhero, and sets out to prove it by asking a series of questions, the most important of which is How many days of your life have you been sick?.Unbreakable does the impossible of turning a potentially geeky subject into a serious movie - with a limited budget.

Yes, we would expect her to be maybe 10-20 years younger than her 50 years, and some have suggested she was thus miscast. However, her relatively advanced age makes her crush on Peck's 70 year old character, Ambrose Bierce, more believable. Peck's characterization of Bierce is somewhat at odds with what I have read of this man. We get the impression that, like Harriet, he has decided to forsake his bookish life, as a sick old man, for a final hands-on adventure, as an aid to the rebels in the Mexican revolution. However, the real Bierce fought in the Civil War and later crossed the continent on another assignment. He was not a one-dimensional bookish writer, by experience.Fonda simultaneously develops a crush on both Bierce and General Arroyo(Jimmy Smits). They are both seen as romantic rebels, though of very different sorts and for different personal reasons. Harriet reminds Bierce of his daughter, whom he hasn't seen for many years, while Bierce reminds Harriet of her father, who abandoned his domineering wife for a new love, and who fought in the Spanish American war to help free Cuba. But after partially destroying the Miranda mansion where he was conceived, Arroyo delays taking his troops to join Villa's, as ordered. Arroyo's bedding of Harriet on the very bed where he was conceived symbolically reverses the power relationship in which his European father raped his native American mother. He finds the original Spanish land grant papers giving the land of this hacienda to the peasants. Since Spain no longer governed Mexico, these papers were not necessarily valid, as Pierce points out, but Arroyo refuses to heed. Arroyo's shooting of his favorite horse and of Bierce reinforces his determination to stay at the hacienda of his birth instead of joining Villa.There are several references accusing Arroyo of having become the new Miranda, and thus betraying the revolution. I don't understand why Arroyo had one of his soldiers shot for doing what he himself was doing. He must have known he would receive the same sentence if he did not soon join Villa's forces. Perhaps this symbolized the near universal tendency of revolutionary leaders to gradually become tyrants as bad or worse than those they topple. So it had been with Porfirio Diaz, the once revolutionary general the revolutionists now fought against. So it would be with various successors to Diaz during these turbulent times.This is an entertaining film, for the most part. There are enough action scenes to complement the philosophizing and other tamer scenes. You will have to pay close attention or see it several times to dig out all the symbolism. I can see why this film was important to Jane Fonda. It is, in a sense, autobiographical, symbolizing her mid-life transformation from an apolitical sex kitten into an anti-establishment political spokeswoman for the powerless of the world.

He was not a one-dimensional bookish writer, by experience.Fonda simultaneously develops a crush on both Bierce and General Arroyo(Jimmy Smits). They are both seen as romantic rebels, though of very different sorts and for different personal reasons. Harriet reminds Bierce of his daughter, whom he hasn't seen for many years, while Bierce reminds Harriet of her father, who abandoned his domineering wife for a new love, and who fought in the Spanish American war to help free Cuba. But after partially destroying the Miranda mansion where he was conceived, Arroyo delays taking his troops to join Villa's, as ordered. Arroyo's bedding of Harriet on the very bed where he was conceived symbolically reverses the power relationship in which his European father raped his native American mother. He finds the original Spanish land grant papers giving the land of this hacienda to the peasants. Since Spain no longer governed Mexico, these papers were not necessarily valid, as Pierce points out, but Arroyo refuses to heed. Arroyo's shooting of his favorite horse and of Bierce reinforces his determination to stay at the hacienda of his birth instead of joining Villa.There are several references accusing Arroyo of having become the new Miranda, and thus betraying the revolution. I don't understand why Arroyo had one of his soldiers shot for doing what he himself was doing. He must have known he would receive the same sentence if he did not soon join Villa's forces. Perhaps this symbolized the near universal tendency of revolutionary leaders to gradually become tyrants as bad or worse than those they topple. So it had been with Porfirio Diaz, the once revolutionary general the revolutionists now fought against. So it would be with various successors to Diaz during these turbulent times.This is an entertaining film, for the most part.

Yes, we would expect her to be maybe 10-20 years younger than her 50 years, and some have suggested she was thus miscast. However, her relatively advanced age makes her crush on Peck's 70 year old character, Ambrose Bierce, more believable. Peck's characterization of Bierce is somewhat at odds with what I have read of this man.

The animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such as the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story, but with this I am not overly bothered.

The only law left is upheld by the Main Force Patrol, a hard as nails highway patrol who used supped up cars. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is an officer in the Main Force Patrol, after a high speed chase a known criminal & biker gang member called Night Rider (Vincent Gil) dies in an accident. The leader of Night Rider's gang Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) swears vengeance against the Main Force Patrol, after Max's friend Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) is burnt alive he quits the force but trouble soon catches up with him as his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) & young baby son are run down by Toecutter's gang. Driven over the edge Max sets out for revenge...This Australian production was co-written & directed by George Miller & having seen it several times over the years I have to say I think Mad Max is a vastly overrated action thriller that I have never really liked to any great degree. Many people consider it's sequel Mad Max 2 (1981) to be the better film & I echo that statement, in fact I would say Mad Max 2 is significantly better than this in every possible way. The script by Miller & James McCausland is supposedly set sometime in the future but apart from a run down police station there is nothing to indicate this at all, in fact I would say just looking at it Mad Max feels like it's set in the past & isn't the least bit futuristic at all. It certainly doesn't have anything approaching the bleak post apocalyptic feel of Mad Max 2. The actual story really isn't that good, Max as a character doesn't feature that much for the first half as the film has little focus & then by a string of tenuous coincidences his wife & baby are killed & he sets out for revenge as the film turns into a second rate Death Wish (1974) rip-off. This revenge part of the film doesn't feel that great, Max runs some bikes off the road & in that sense it's rather impersonal. The only time it becomes interesting is when he gives a biker the choice of either cutting his own foot off with a hacksaw or burning to death as the car he is handcuffed too explodes. The action is very sporadic, the opening car chase sequence is brilliant but then there's nothing else in the film that comes anywhere near close to emulating it which feels rather anti climatic.Director Miller does alright here, the opening car chase sequence is brilliant with some truly spectacular crashes. I also liked the little artistic touches during it as well, like when Goose gets a call about the chase a couple of tow truck drivers leave just as quickly in anticipation of a pile up & some work or how Miller just show's glimpses of Max inter-cut with the chase ahead of him. Miller likes to keep his camera really low on the ground, he likes to show the tyres of the various vehicles as they speed along to try & get a real sense of how fast they are going which for the most part is very effective. There's some violence here, there's a severed hand, a dead dog, people are brutally murdered & burned alive & there's a bit of blood. Unfortunately despite a thrilling opening sequence the film fails to build on it & it does drag at times unlike Mad Max 2 which is just fantastic throughout. According to the 'Trivia Section' on the IMDb main page for Mad Max because of a lack of money about 20% of the scripted action scenes were never filmed, I don't know whether that's true but it would certainly explain the uneven pace I suppose.With a supposed budget of about $350,000 director Miller & the crew worked miracles on basically nothing although the lack of any big action scenes after the opening is understandable if not desirable. Filmed in Victoria in Australia & was initially re-dubbed for it's US release because of the thick Australian accents. The acting is alright, Mel Gibson certainly looks very young & fresh faced here in one of his very first roles.Mad Max is a film with a reputation that totally baffles me, I just can't see that much here to enjoy. I think it's an uneven & rather dull film only livened up by a terrific opening car chase & a few sporadic impressive stunts for the rest of it's duration.

But before getting to it, a quick overview. Harrison Ford plays President James Marshall, en route back to the U.S. from Russia with his wife and daughter and various government officials. The crux of the movie, that Air Force One could be hijacked, calls for an almost complete suspension of disbelief that few other movies require. The scenario as played out is about as plausible as possible, which is, the head of the president's Secret Service detail is a traitor. If you can get past that without summoning all your critical faculties and walking out of the room, 'Air Force One' is a hell of a lot of fun and a real roller-coaster ride. And there are moments, too, that are painful to watch, such as when a young press secretary is murdered by terrorists. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, knows how to hold on to the audience's collective neck by the jugular, keeping the suspense high and the tension tight. For the most part, it's very convincing, particularly the scenes on board the plane (though the special effects are variable). The parts in the situation room at the White House are, oddly enough, not quite as believable. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell are the VP and Secretary of Defense, respectively; they and the various generals don't really do much except sweat the crisis out. There are a number of neat little touches throughout; the hostages sending a fax from Air Force One, the dumping of fuel and then the subsequent re-fueling 'scam.' All very clever. But then there is The Scene. When the group of terrorists led by Gary Oldman's character get the go-ahead signal from the corrupt Secret Service agent, what follows is several minutes of superbly-orchestrated mayhem as passengers are shot, the cockpit crew locks themselves in to land the plane, and the rest of the Secret Service detail tries desperately to save the president. It's all frantically and furiously convincing, right down to the last two agents getting the president downstairs and into the ubiquitous 'escape pod' (you know, that's the one-man capsule the White House is forever denying exists), protecting him with their lives until the pod can be ejected and sent parachuting to earth. Movies just don't get any more exciting than this. There is so much going on at once, one doesn't dare blink for fear of missing something. 'Air Force One' would be worth seeing for this scene alone; the good news is the rest of the movie is very entertaining as well.

It's all frantically and furiously convincing, right down to the last two agents getting the president downstairs and into the ubiquitous 'escape pod' (you know, that's the one-man capsule the White House is forever denying exists), protecting him with their lives until the pod can be ejected and sent parachuting to earth. Movies just don't get any more exciting than this. There is so much going on at once, one doesn't dare blink for fear of missing something. 'Air Force One' would be worth seeing for this scene alone; the good news is the rest of the movie is very entertaining as well. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"16 June 2008","score":"","review":" 'Air Force One' is a movie with one terrific scene, one of the all-time great action scenes I think in film history, and it's so good, it tends to overshadow the rest of the film, which isn't bad either. But before getting to it, a quick overview. Harrison Ford plays President James Marshall, en route back to the U.S. from Russia with his wife and daughter and various government officials. The crux of the movie, that Air Force One could be hijacked, calls for an almost complete suspension of disbelief that few other movies require. The scenario as played out is about as plausible as possible, which is, the head of the president's Secret Service detail is a traitor. If you can get past that without summoning all your critical faculties and walking out of the room, 'Air Force One' is a hell of a lot of fun and a real roller-coaster ride. And there are moments, too, that are painful to watch, such as when a young press secretary is murdered by terrorists. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, knows how to hold on to the audience's collective neck by the jugular, keeping the suspense high and the tension tight. For the most part, it's very convincing, particularly the scenes on board the plane (though the special effects are variable). The parts in the situation room at the White House are, oddly enough, not quite as believable. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell are the VP and Secretary of Defense, respectively; they and the various generals don't really do much except sweat the crisis out. There are a number of neat little touches throughout; the hostages sending a fax from Air Force One, the dumping of fuel and then the subsequent re-fueling 'scam.' All very clever.
