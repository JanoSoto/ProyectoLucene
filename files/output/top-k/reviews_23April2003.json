With all the Screams and I Know What Your Breasts Did Last Summers, making Freddy's Revenge in these enlightened days would be just about impossible.But culture, and particularly youth culture, in the 1980s was considerably different, certainly far less conservative and anti-creative. In those days, The Cure were a big thing, and even the most basic of pop sludge was far more creative than what we have today. Not to mention that it was far easier to make dodgy films and get them released theatrically.A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2 picks up five years after the original, although it was a rush-job filmed less than a year after said original was out of the theatre. The film company, at that time the independent startup known as New Line, saw a quick and easy meal ticket that only required them to convince Robert Englund to submerge himself in what looks like three tons of multi-coloured latex. So the idea of a decent script, decent actors, or decent photography, went right out the window.Which is kind of sad, really, when you consider that this is the only Freddy film in which an original premise is used. You might want to skip the rest of this paragraph if you have yet to see it. In it, a young man (whose behaviour is consistent with repressed homosexuality, in one of those hilarious plot coincidences) has just moved into the house from which Nancy originally dealt with Freddy. With the help of the sort of girlfriend any other male (and even some females) of this age would want to climb atop of at every opportunity, our hero attempts to fight off Freddy (and his own gayness), which in turn creates some very interesting plot devices. The moment when our heroine is holding up a carving knife at Freddy, who gives her a graphic and terrifying demonstration of the fact that she'll kill her (confused) lover if she kills Freddy, could have been one of the most horrific moments in the entire series. I am not quite convinced that it isn't, given that the only other episode in the series that was vaugely adult after this point was Part 3.Unfortunately, the actors hired for these roles cannot act their way out of a wet paper bag. The only cast member with acting skills that even compare to Robert Englund's would be Marshall Bell.

Suffice to say that De Palma has only made a handful of Hitchcock homages in his long career, and has proved himself capable of making many other kinds of movies, from the zany rock musical 'The Phantom Of The Paradise' to the outrageous crime saga 'Scarface'. But there's no denying 'Obsession' is one of De Palma's blatantly Hitchcock influenced films. I don't like it as much as his 'Sisters', his first, and for me his best attempt in this style, but I still think it's a fascinating movie, and well directed. 'Obsession' is obviously inspired by 'Vertigo'. De Palma makes no secret about it and even hired Bernard Herrmann to contribute an extremely 'Vertigo'-like score. (Herrmann incidentally not only preferred his own work here, but thought 'Obsession' was the better movie! Something I don't agree with). Now 'Vertigo' is Hitchcock's best in my opinion, a complex, multi-layered masterpiece that it would be impossible to better. If you are comparing the two movies then 'Obsession' cannot compete, but if you take it for what it is, I think it's a very good film. De Palma only really takes one basic concept from Hitchcock's film anyway and goes in a different direction with it, though stylistically there are plenty of other Hitchcockian shots and sequences throughout. Cliff Robertson ('Charly'), a most underrated actor, is excellent, some would argue better than the material. Genevieve Bujold ('Dead Ringers') is also very good in a difficult role which she pulls off convincingly. I was less impressed by John Lithgow (who De Palma would later showcase in the silly 'Raising Cain') who was a bit cliched, but still enjoyable. The script for 'Obsession' written by Paul Schrader from an idea conceived by him and De Palma. Schrader of course wrote 'Taxi Driver', and many people may not know that De Palma was at one point slated to direct that movie. Of De Palma's three major tributes to Hitchcock I would rate them in order 1. 'Sisters'. 2. 'Dressed To Kill'. 3. 'Obsession'. All three are excellent thrillers and worth watching, though only demonstrate one aspect of Brian De Palma's undoubted talent.

New Zealand and computer graphics have combined to create a visual extravaganza wholly true to the original's aesthetic.  But the replacement of words by images in itself is merely a prerequisite for a successful film. And the words are largely, sadly, replaced little of the text survives, and even in the beginning, when Galadriel gives us an introduction to then history of the ring, Tolkein's own various accounts have been discarded (arguably necessarily) in place of a softer, more matter-of-fact overview. None the less, the main details of the story survive. Scriptwriter Frances Walsh has simplified in places but has not shied away from the essential complexity and richness of the tale.  Of course one has quibbles we lose the subtlety of Saruman (a shame, when Christopher Lee is the perfect casting); all the hobbits, Bilbo excepted, seem about half a generation too young; the re-invention of Arwen as a warrior princess is dull, obvious and anachronistic; Hugo Weaving's Elrond is slightly camp and his council lacks due solemnity; and however often Viggo Mortenson flashes his cheekbones, Aragorn was surely never such a pretty boy. But compared with what seems right, what seems wrong is surely trivial by contrast. And yet the film still fails to really capture the magic of the book.The problem is that a lot of the strength of the book is what happens when nothing is happening.  A few examples suffice to illustrate the point.  Headed towards Weathertop, Aragorn tells the hobbits fragments of ancient legends; by the time the party arrives, their destination is established as a place of wonder and history.  But in the film, we leap there straight from Bree Aragorn points out the ruined fortress as if he had never mentioned it previously, in the manner of a tour guide pointing out the sights.  The subsequent flight to the ford is notable in the book as a time when the heroes are waiting, day after day, for inevitable attack, which when at last it happens has a much more powerful impact than the simple chase scene rendered here; while the attempted passage of the mountains, grimly familiar in prose to anyone who has battled the elements at altitude, is reduced to a single dramatic scene, that makes the point (that the pass will not be crossed) but wholly fails to suggest that the characters might die here (and slowly), defeated by nothing more magical than weather and cold. In consequence the film becomes a mere sequence of dramatic challenges fight the orcs, flee the balrog, meet Galadriel, etc., etc., etc.  The sense of time, and of the characters' changing perceptions of their mission as it passes, is lost.  Instead, the battle scenes, which in part one are merely skirmishes, are played up.  In spite of its great length, this film lacks patience. Everything is amazing; and so in a sense nothing is.

Animation's crowning achievement? Well, I'm sorry to bust 99% of the world's bubble, but this is an EXCEPTIONALLY overrated film that in the past I would have thought good, but now think of as easily the worst animated masterpiece ever made by Disney.It's plot is so weak, it can be summarized in at most one paragraph. Every moment is stretched as far as it can go, and more time is filled with irrevelant material, such as songs (which are some of the weakest ever created by Disney, but I'll get to that later) than with actual story. People claim this gives it an epic quality. The only way that this could possibly be true is through epic boredom.The characters are shallow and unmemorable. Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa, and the Hyenas are comic relief that are sorely missing comicality (If you want a truly great example of Disney's comical relief, look at the Genie and Iago from Aladdin, or Kronk and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove). Simba is an unadmirable hero who I couldn't care less about, and his love with Nala is anything but inexistent. Scar is one of the weakest of the modern Disney villains, and does not make you hate him like Gaston or impress you with his evil so much that you like him like Jafar. The only characters I can pass off as even half-decent are Rafiki and Mufasa.The music I will give merit to as being okay and somewhat enjoyable, but still, it isn't within a hundred miles of the attractive Arabian dances of Aladdin or the Broadway style melody of Beauty and the Beast or the fun Tropical tunes of The Little Mermaid. Only the Circle of Life (even I have to admit that the opening number is magnificent) is as good as any of the songs in the aforementioned films, and just barely. The rest are simply radio-friendly pop tunes.However, one thing I will stop at no ends to give this film credit for is its animation. I will say right now that no other Disney film has backgrounds so richly detailed or characters so well designed. Indeed, the art quality is definitely the most astounding ever created Disney. But art quality alone cannot save this movie from all its other weaknesses, and besides, art quality is probably the least important of the four major aspects of an animated film (the other three being story, characters, and, in the case of Disney, music). This movie does not deserve to be praised as if it is the best Disney can muster. The people who think this is true have probably never seen any truly great Disney films, or just can't realize one. Aladdin, for example, is in my opinion the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made (And I am a film buff, to those of you questioning my merits). Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10, and many others would probably crack my top 100. The Lion King, however, is depressingly mediocre, and deserves at most a 5.

Connery is great, as is Ursula Andress, and the plot is good (I've read the book, and the bit with the squid should have been put in the film) Dr. No gets a rating of 8\/10 from me.

Emotions and feelings are the basics of the themes that almost all Hitchcock films center around.  Theme is defined by Webster's dictionary as a subject or topic on which a person writes or speaks, it is something for a certain proposition or discussion.  Hitchcock uses his themes as the basis for what he wants to be discussed.  There are often many subtle ideas that are thrown into each movie for the purpose of elaborating on the main theme.  In Hitchcock's film Vertigo, the main theme is obsession with the past, and how things used to be.  Each character in the story has a strong obsession to a portion of history, or how things `used to be.' Determination to get back what one once possessed, love for something that is no longer there, the identity crisis that follows sick nostalgia, and reality versus artificiality problems that erupt due to all the previous statements are all other issues relating to obsession that come up during Vertigo. As the film opens up in Midge Wood's (Barbara Bel Geddes) apartment, it is initially clear the lost past and the urge to recreate it are (and are going to be) very affluent in the movie.  John `Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) cannot wait to be cured from his fear of heights so he can go back to his detective work, and Midge's only love has been and will ever be Scottie. The next scene is in Gavin Elster's (Tom Helmore) office (a friend from college, the past), he brings up that he wishes San Francisco had never changed, and mentions how his wife is haunted by a dead person and stares at the `Portals of the Past' across the San Francisco Bay.  Nostalgia is seen in the bookstore with old pictures and maps of San Francisco with the historian and of course with the Carlotta story in itself.  The film has three distinct movements, as in another Hitchcock film North by Northwest, which shows the evolutions of the hero; in Vertigo the movements show the evolution of Scottie's obsession with the past.  The first section is just Scottie following Madeline Elster (Kim Novak) - Scottie trying to recreate his detective work.  The second part starts as he is falls in love with Madeline (someone `dead') - the following then becomes a romantic obsession and he wants her to change back to being `not crazy.'  The third movement is as Scottie meets Judy Barton (Kim Novak) - as the attempt to change her into Madeline starts. Obsession is defined as an unhealthy or irrational compulsion. Compulsives allude to repetition, and the spiral in the Vertigo symbolizes repetition. The spiral is first seen during the credits, then with Madeline's hair, and finally with the spiral staircase in the church.  A spiral never ends, just as Scottie does not want to forget about the past, especially not Madeline. Scottie's obsession with the past comes in full force in the last section of the film when he tries to change Judy into Madeline.  At the store buying her clothes, and finally in the hotel room as she walks out of the bathroom he literally see his eyes shining (by the lighting) with desire and passion when Judy finally looks exactly like Madeline.  Hitchcock shows how this is only an illusion with the green light coming from the Empire Hotel sign outside the window.  Judy is absorbed by the green because Scottie is disconnected from the reality of the present and lost in the artificiality of the past.  Green lighting is used throughout Vertigo to illuminate the feeling of dream-like feelings.  During the scene while Scottie and `Madeline' are wandering through the woods, they stopped to discuss the Sequoia Semperviva trees, the trees that are evergreen and ever living. This is a subtle hint at Hitchcock's suggestion that bringing back the past in its entirety and its reality is impossible.

A movie that was a very big part of there childhood. For me that movie would be `Batman.' It was a childhood favorite which I continue to cherish to this day. What is great about the character of Batman is that he is a real person, a person who's life was affected from a very young age and through his determination managed to get vengeance on all those who try to affect others the same way they affected his. The film starts as a teaser, we see a couple with a young child walking through the decaying city of Gotham. Much like that dreadful day in Bruce Wayne's life. The family walk into an alleyway where they manage to get mugged. Thu emerges the Batman.Mugger Don't kill me, man - don't kill me! Batman I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.Mugger What are you?! Batman  I'm Batman. Director Tim Burton manages to create a city which is decaying in time and is as corrupt as it can get. It is a city in the need of help. Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne\/Batman and easily does the greatest performance of any actor to wear the famed costume. He manages to balance both characters giving Bruce Wayne a lost child quality in the need of comfort and Batman the vengeful deep spoken hero with the most intimating eyes to appear on screen. Jack Nicholson is equally as good in the role of Jack Napier\/The Joker. The history of the character is not explained that well in this movie but we can establish that he is a tormented soul since after being framed by his gangster boss Carl Grissom he seems to be driven to the edge. Director Tim Burton and screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren develop a great story that is exciting, funny, and dramatic. They also develop the character of Batman terrifically as a man who wants to get vengeance but not be a killer\/murderer like his prey. But once he discovers that the assassin of his parents is still alive he like the Joker is driven to the edge and becomes much of a murderer as the enemy itself.Inspired by Frank Millers `The Dark Knight Returns' and `Batman Year One' we get the opportunity to see the publics point of view of both Batman and the Joker. The movie is almost flawless. What is missing is better development for the character of Commissioner Gordon and his relationship with Batman. However, his development is not missed at times. The film won an Academy Award for Anton Furst's amazing art direction but I truly think it should have taken home more.

A movie that was a very big part of there childhood. For me that movie would be `Batman.' It was a childhood favorite which I continue to cherish to this day. What is great about the character of Batman is that he is a real person, a person who's life was affected from a very young age and through his determination managed to get vengeance on all those who try to affect others the same way they affected his. The film starts as a teaser, we see a couple with a young child walking through the decaying city of Gotham. Much like that dreadful day in Bruce Wayne's life. The family walk into an alleyway where they manage to get mugged. Thu emerges the Batman.Mugger Don't kill me, man - don't kill me! Batman I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.Mugger What are you?! Batman  I'm Batman. Director Tim Burton manages to create a city which is decaying in time and is as corrupt as it can get. It is a city in the need of help. Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne\/Batman and easily does the greatest performance of any actor to wear the famed costume. He manages to balance both characters giving Bruce Wayne a lost child quality in the need of comfort and Batman the vengeful deep spoken hero with the most intimating eyes to appear on screen. Jack Nicholson is equally as good in the role of Jack Napier\/The Joker.

Everything here is on an epic scale - the location, the cinematography, the all-star casting (which is quite fun - Hey, there's that guy from The Apartment! - and not all that distracting). He may have gone too far with his liberal peppering of flashbacks, but they are for the most part well-judged, particularly the infamous Hamlet&Ophelia ones.The flashbacks of the couple making love has come under fire from various corners, criticising Branagh's audacity, the Nobody will ever understand the nunnery scene! type of argument. But the point is, he's offering an interpretation, a concrete fact. Golden rule for directing Shakespeare you can never have subtlety or innuendo. It's confusing enough for the audience to deal with the language besides having to handle subtext. Consider Zeferelli's Hamlet could you really imagine Mel and Helena in love? No. You could imagine him stalking her, but that's about it. No, Ken has the right idea. The plot literally has to be spelled out to make it an enjoyable experience, so while the Yorick flashbacks might be annoying to the Shakespeare connoiseur, they fill in the blanks for the masses.Now. Performances. Derek Jacobi and Richard Briers were highlights for me, particularly Briers' not-at-all-idiotic, manipulative Polonius. Branagh's dynamic, smart, human Hamlet is the best I've seen (but then, I've only seen four). His direction (MIRRORS! SINGLE SHOT TAKES!) is the real triumph here, however.The one annoyance is the ending. If you thought Hamlet's dispatching of Claudius in the play was overkill, wait til you see this, where Hamlet drops a chandalier on him for good measure. Also, when Hamlet dies, Patrick Doyle's score keeps whining over it, so we never get to appreciate that, y'know, he's dead. A moment of silence would have been nice.All criticisms aside - and there's always going to be plenty in a production this big - I'd advise you just to enjoy it. Enjoy the costumes, the fencing, the nunnery scene, the after-the-play scene, the mirrors, the flashbacks, the whole thing. Because when you boil it down it's a really good, fun thriller.
