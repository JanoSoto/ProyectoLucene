This was the right film at the right time and despite fine work all round, especially Jack Nicolson who became a star on the back of his short performance as boozed-out back roads lawyer, it is clearly a B movie. A smart one - but that doesn't change the fact.For those that never saw the hippie movement first hand or those that didn't see the American dream of freedom die (or at least change) this might not quite hit the mark.

What kind of person needs to live in a world of controlled self-poisoning other than people that don't like reality?The Terry Southern script was probably written on the back of cigarette packet and actor\/director Hopper was merely reflecting what he knew and felt at the time. A lot of intensity, but too little intelligence. Dope does that to you - making you think you are profound when you are just waffling. As a director he is (today) a proved mediocrity, although not without low budget merit.I actually like the American hinterlands.

Few films have had the guts to do what HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER did, which is account the serial killer (Michael Rooker) who has a taste for women, stalking and murdering them, particularly hookers as they are easy prey. For him the thrill is not in the hunt, but in the kill, as he relishes in the deaths of basically anyone. When his flat mate expresses an interest in Henry's sadistic hobby, Henry eagerly shows him the ways of a serial killer. He teaches Otis (Tom Towles) how to kill, cover yourself and kill again, and Otis too learns of the adrenaline rush of snapping someones neck with your bare hands. While doing all of this, Henry also seduces Otis' battered and bruised sister Becky (Tracy Arnold), fresh out of an abusive marriage. Becky finds solace in our protagonist, without a clue of his extra curricular activities.The basic story is of Henry and Otis killing people, sometimes to get what they want, usually just for fun. McNaughton is very talented, he creates an eerie and disturbing atmosphere with the slow lingering shots of Henry's victims rather than showing their murders. Ken Hale, Steven A. Jones and Robert McNaughton's creepy score was very effective, although misplaced at times which made the scenes seem cheesy. But when used at the right times the score was fantastic. The overall atmosphere of the film was very terrifying, every character had a black cloud over their head, their demise was right around the corner. There was a scene where henry was watching a woman pack her groceries, and when she pulled out of the car park her followed her. Doesn't sound that creepy, but the mix of Rooker's expression, Macnaughton's direction and the terrifying musical score made that scene go down as one of the most terrifying in film history.The acting was very very good. Michael Rooker was perfect as the dull killer, if you look closer you see the subtle hints of what he does, but unless you see him do it you'd never guess what Henry did with his free time. Tom Towles was also very good as the 'apprentice killer', and sometimes I was more scared of him than I was of Henry. Tracy Arnold didn't live up to Rooker and Towle's standard, but she did do well.The home invasion scene was well done, but didn't live up to the hype. The ending was great, very unexpected but definitely not out of character for Henry. I did think some of this film was creepy, but I'd heard a lot about it's infamy and it didn't live up to its standard like most 'disturbing' films I hear about, such as LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.

It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the Thing is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are things? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a thing. A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the thing would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.

And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the Thing is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are things? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a thing. A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the thing would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.

Stuck with nothing much to do, they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want.

There's no gore apart from a dream sequence when George puts an axe into Cathy's head.Technically the film is fine but rather flat & uninteresting, it's well made but nothing stands out as being spectacular.

The tank blows, causing the booth to go up and then tumble down, but the two men survive all that. Then, getting out of the Palace Hotel Ballroom in a water logged tunnel, the lady uses a semi-automatic weapon but the two men's verbal pleadings saved them from murder.

It is there that a newly transplanted writer, Stingo, meets the two of them. Knowing few others, Stingo is transfixed by the couple, as Sophie is beautiful and loving and Nathan a witty and brilliant man. They befriend the young writer and take him all over town and welcome him for dinner on many an occasion. All too soon, however, Stingo learns that the twosome has dark secrets. Sophie, although a former Catholic, was in a concentration camp in Poland during World War II and is still suffering from the situation. Nathan has disturbing episodes of violence, most often directed at Sophie, and seems to change his demeanor on a dime. Although Stingo tries to help, he fails. Is there something even more disturbing at the heart of the situation? This is a powerhouse movie, devastating and heartbreaking to the extreme. Streep gives a towering performance, well deserving of her Academy Award. Her Polish-American accent is flawless but, even more so, her agony as a concentration camp survivor, is palpable at all times, even when she is smiling. Kline is just as impressive in a virtually thankless role, for Nathan is a tortured soul who takes out his demons on others. The rest of the cast is also great, with Peter MacNichol giving a loving performance as the caring neighbor and friend of the unlucky couple. The sets, costumes, direction, script, and production are in the stratosphere. If you have never seen this film, do seek it out. Although you must be prepared to have your heart broken in a million pieces, at any view, it still is a vastly rewarding look at the human condition, its response to evil, and the ways we can try to overcome it.

She also has the most delicious and engaging smile.I was very much enjoying Crush up until that tragedy came out of left field, so angering me that I yelled at the screen. I actually felt betrayed after becoming so swept up in all the joy and romantic eroticism beforehand. There could have been all sorts of adversity for the couple to face without the great, plot-shifting finality as written. This is the only reason I can't count the film as a true favorite.Still, there's that one pivotal, magical scene, in which Andie's character first meets her former student as a strapping adult. When he asks her, barely suggestively, if he could get her anything, Andie provides the most wonderful and telling expression her eyes soften and her jaw slowly drops with breathy desire -- long-suppressed desire -- and without a word she speaks volumes about her deep well of longing and the smoldering lust that is overcoming her in the moment...she is a vital, beautiful woman, and her needs can no longer be ignored. Jump cut to the teacher well-mounted behind some bushes and you have the cinematic equivalent of orgasmic abandon, all done quite politely. I still become, uh...quite moved by the memory of it.

The score, adding so much emotion especially to the scene where the father watches the ship be destroyed. I felt so much power from the score there although not enough from William Hurt's performance here. The cinematography generated a lot of the film's excitement especially on the planet they crash land on.Although the flaws of the film come from within some of the acting as the director also isn't directing the actors to show enough power in most scenes but the director does show his talent in some places of the film, bringing out the epic scale and excitement. Also the writing isn't top notch as the sub-plots aren't handled well, bringing out the feeling that it is just another blockbuster. When it comes to writing, we've already seen sub-plots like this.But this does stand out over many action-blockbusters, keeping it's fun and the non-stop action in place which is a problem for many action films. I definitely agree that this is underrated and should get about a 6\/10 rating. I haven't seen any episodes of the TV series but for the people that have, i believe that they have compared them 2, having the film be rated lower...e.g, the new star wars films may be rated higher if the older ones didn't exist because there isn't anything better to compare them with.
