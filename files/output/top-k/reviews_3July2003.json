It was the kind of theater where the occasional stray cat would run across the bottom of the screen on a Saturday night followed by one or two of his pals. It was the kind of theater where your shoe might stick to the carpet from all the spilled soda. It was the kind of theater where the occasional shootout had been known to happen, thankfully never while I visited. It was the last movie I got to see there because after it's run, they replaced it with Cooley High and Them, the last two movies that would ever be shown there. The theater was torn down to make way for a McDonalds, which is still there to this day. I guess the reason I'm telling you, dear IMDB user, about the theater is because it was a symbol of the old days for me. I was ten years old when I saw the Terminator, nineteen years ago. Thinking about that fact while watching T3 two days ago made me feel a little sad, especially when it dawned on me that I had watched that movie and it's two sequels with one my oldest and closest friends. Sad to say, I think the state of movies these days has dwindled. I remember going to the movies in those years not only to see great special effects and unflinching violence (cut me some slack, I was a kid then; what kid didn't love movie violence?) but with the sincere hopes that I would be hypnotized by a great story. These days, it's rare that you actually get that. You might get some astounding special effects wrapped around a thin shell of a story and that's if you're lucky. The Terminator was one of those movies that blew me away when I first saw it and it did so with an intensity that still rivals most action movies I have seen ever since.I'm not going to go into plot details because honestly, if you're reading this, I think you know what to expect already. For those out of the loop, just know that this is the movie that made Schwarzenegger and that's no exaggeration. The definition of ruthless in the dictionary should have a picture of him from the movie right next to it. I remember watching this movie and the feeling I got, when he went into the police station and mowed down everyone and their mothers who even dared to stand up and get in his way is still a feeling I get when I watch that scene, almost twenty years later. Not that I enjoy seeing the cops bite it in fantasy or reality but the thrill of watching an unstoppable killing machine destroy everything in it's path with such frightening single-mindedness in achieving it's goals.... it's really something else. This is one of those movies that I have never gotten tired of. It's a B-movie but a B-movie with heart. There's a reason that it was voted one of the ten best movies of the '80s and it's because it's infinitely rewatchable. All of the characters are memorable in this. The only gripe that I have with the flick is that the special effects haven't held up all that well and to be truthful, they were never really that good to begin with, even back in '84. It doesn't detract much though because this movie grabs you from it's opening shot and never lets you go. This movie isn't about how cool the effects are or how much action it has. It's a movie with a great story that doesn't get overwhelmed by anything else. I love this movie and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading this and go get the damn DVD. If you think the movie sucks I will gladly refund the $15 or so dollars. Just be prepared to give me a convincing explanation as to why you hated it.I hope that people reading this understand the sentimentality behind my review. There was a time when I used to enjoy looking forward to seeing movies on the big screen. I still enjoy the occasional movie in the theaters these days and it's funny how the really good ones are made on a smaller scale. I just feel like these days, it's all about how much of a budget gets approved and how much of it goes towards the film's big action set piece. That's fine and all but how about giving me a good story to go with it? Maybe one day, the flicks will recapture the imagination they once had without resorting to the ageing tactics employed today.

His films focus on white, middle-class teens of varying stereotypes.  Here, he throws everything into the blender.What surprised me about The Breakfast Club was the level of silence.  I'm serious, there is almost an equivalent level of quiet as in 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Whereas Kubrick used that silence for a purpose, Hughes must have run out of time in production.  Of course, when music is used in Breakfast Club, it's not Blue Danube Waltz.  The library is too large to create any mood, but, with a movie like this, don't expect an ALIEN level of quality in production design.  The editor must have been on vacation because the movie could have been 15 minutes shorter and made stronger because of it.  John Hughes' director of photography doesn't catch many memorable images, although Emilio Esteves' monologue is delivered with an obvious pan around reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs.  He will never be a notable character actor, whereas everyone else seems to have a grip on their ideas--except when they're overacting.  Question the social issues and problems that are smeared around like bloodstains all you want, I haven't the time for it.Dialogue is the movie's only asset.  Some of the conversations are rather...how should I say...enlightened for a bunch of teenage miscreants.  Much of it is Hughes' standard recycled propaganda that he continued repeating, but he's not Kevin Smith.

The adults are the typical Hughes incompetents who 'don't understand' and the kids admit that they hate their parents.  What else is new?  Still, The Breakfast Club is worth watching for the minority that it appeals to as long as they aren't decayed from the wave of 'Modern Teenage Comedies'.

As John sat in the stands of his son's baseball game, he thought that it was going to be a typical game day.  As Michael walked to the plate, the crowd cheered for him.  He struggles with the first few pitches, but finally gets a hit.  Michael takes off with good speed rounding first base. As he heads toward second, something terrible happens.  He collapses and falls to the ground.  John, Michael's father, quickly rushes him to the hospital.  After intense examination, John is told that his son has a rare type of heart failure and will not survive without a transplant.  John Q is a film about how a desperate father must take the law into his own hands to save his son's life.John, played by Denzel Washington, is informed that his insurance will not cover an operation of that magnitude.  John and his wife Denise must pay for this operation out of their own pocket.  The operation could cost up to $250,000.  John does everything that seems possible to raise the money. He goes to the church, sells his belongings, and even starts working two jobs. John and Denise go to the hospital with what little money they have raised and beg the doctors to do the transplant.  However, the HMO people still refuse to let the doctors perform the transplant.  While all of this is going on, Michael is closer and closer to death.  When it seems that Michael has only a few hours left, John makes a command decision.  John screams, `I am not going to bury my son,' as he takes the ER hostage.  He refuses to release anyone and will even start to kill hostages until the doctors agree to do Michael's transplant.Nick Cassavetes, the director, sends out a very strong message through this film.  He shows how people must do the wrong thing in order to have the right outcome.  Cassavetes shows how people must take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left.  Cassavetes wanted his audience to see that institutions do not always put the patient's best interest at hand.  Therefore, people like John have to take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left.The film had a number of things that I enjoyed about it and a few things that I did not.  I liked how it depicted the inside of the hospital.  The hospital always seemed very dark and dreary, which set the right mood and added more drama to the scene.  I liked the costumes that they picked for John Q and his family.  The costume designer did an excellent job displaying that they were just normal people.  However, I did not like the music.  I thought the music was a little dramatic and added too much drama to parts of the film that did not need it. John Q is an excellent film which touches many people on an emotional level.  The film is a perfect example of modern day problems and what people must do to overcome their problems.

After intense examination, John is told that his son has a rare type of heart failure and will not survive without a transplant.  John Q is a film about how a desperate father must take the law into his own hands to save his son's life.John, played by Denzel Washington, is informed that his insurance will not cover an operation of that magnitude.  John and his wife Denise must pay for this operation out of their own pocket.  The operation could cost up to $250,000.  John does everything that seems possible to raise the money. He goes to the church, sells his belongings, and even starts working two jobs. John and Denise go to the hospital with what little money they have raised and beg the doctors to do the transplant.  However, the HMO people still refuse to let the doctors perform the transplant.  While all of this is going on, Michael is closer and closer to death.  When it seems that Michael has only a few hours left, John makes a command decision.  John screams, `I am not going to bury my son,' as he takes the ER hostage.  He refuses to release anyone and will even start to kill hostages until the doctors agree to do Michael's transplant.Nick Cassavetes, the director, sends out a very strong message through this film.  He shows how people must do the wrong thing in order to have the right outcome.  Cassavetes shows how people must take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left.  Cassavetes wanted his audience to see that institutions do not always put the patient's best interest at hand.  Therefore, people like John have to take the law into their own hands when it seems like there is no other option left.The film had a number of things that I enjoyed about it and a few things that I did not.  I liked how it depicted the inside of the hospital.  The hospital always seemed very dark and dreary, which set the right mood and added more drama to the scene.  I liked the costumes that they picked for John Q and his family.  The costume designer did an excellent job displaying that they were just normal people.  However, I did not like the music.  I thought the music was a little dramatic and added too much drama to parts of the film that did not need it. John Q is an excellent film which touches many people on an emotional level.  The film is a perfect example of modern day problems and what people must do to overcome their problems.  John Q is a film that is easy for most people to relate to and leaves the viewer asking themselves if they would do the same thing John Quincy did.  I know I would.

It had a great begining, and i always love Val Kilmer's performances (I still think he was the best batman)  But there were still a lot of Kilmerisms, so i wouldn't say that i was blown away by his performance, but it was certaintly solid. As for the movie, i kept going back and forth on whether or not i liked it. The reenactment of the kennedy Assasination with the pigeons was far and away my favorite moment of the film.  I haven't been quite as bug eyed as that in a long time.  As for the whole Working for the CIA thing.  That was pretty weak.  And it had no purpose in the film.  It did not advance the plot in any way, other than to explain to the audience, in about 5 minutes, after most of the movie had already progressed, what is actually happening. I think that this could have been accomplished much more gracefully, I would have figured out what happened, if i had just watched the last scene when he was telling the guy that he killed his wife.

Everything from the obvious business corruption and defective merchandise (I'm sure it's only a glitch.) to architecture and even music.Paul Verhoeven hit his highest mark as a director with this movie.  It is not empty-headed like Starship Troopers and doesn't have a dependency on violence like Total Recall.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but Total Recall has one violent act every seven minutes, minimum.  Whereas in Total Recall, the carnage is merely titillation for action fans, RoboCop has a hidden moral to its message.  The pacing is terrific, even though the DoP must have been loafing during production.RoboCop also infuses the original Frankenstein story in an amazing way.

After buying and viewing the DVD, I was disappointed and felt I wasted my time and money.  I loved Re-Animator, From Beyond, and The Return of the Living Dead (1985), so the idea of seeing Peter Jackson's over-the-top zombie film seemed appealing.  Dead Alive was 1\/10th of what I pictured.  How could they make a zombie movie and only show 3 or 4 skulls?  Since the people were so freshly killed and zombified, I didn't get to see the classic, skeletal, long-dead, maggot-covered zombies I imagined.  The zombie baby simply looked cheap, puffy, and fake.  If it looked more like a normal (yet ghostly white) newborn but had baby fangs, super strength, or evil eyes, it might have become a classic character in cinematic history.  Using slow motion in the battle scenes might have contributed to a more intense, nightmarish effect, not to mention giving visual pleasure to the audience.  The choice to film nearly everything at normal speed with handheld, wide-angle cameras weakened the film.  Having a lawnmower attack without the full power of a lawnmower engine's sound (varying as it struggled to chop up the zombies) was an odd choice as well.  The mower's undersized blade made no sense either.Tragically, the effects overwhelmed the story.  Since the story lacked internal logic to begin with (zombies able to punch through doors and instantly decapitate others could only choke Lionel), all I was left with was a couple dozen good moments of humor.

Now, after watching it again, I can't help but feel that something was missing with the movie.  It is this missing link that really prevents this film from being a great movie.Don't get me wrong, I really like The Untouchables.  The acting is good, with what little script that David Mamet, who is usually a much much better screenwriter has to give them.  Connery, though sounding like a total cliche line after line of dialogue really stands out, in my opinion, one of his best roles ever.  Garcia is also good with what unfortunately turned out to be little more than a standing extra, and of course, Deniro is simply awesome as the Charasmatic and often brutal, Al Capone.  However, Costner, as usual, simply lacks every hint of emotion in his role as Elliot Ness.  His 'tough guy' scenes with Capone are more laughable than serious, and his tender acting makes Ness appear to be more of a wuss than the passive-aggressive vigilante who out smarted Capone.  What really is missing is hard to place...it's not one big problem, it's a series of small problems that add up.  As mentioned, the weak script and Costner's bad acting are both serious detriments to this film's success.  But, there is something else that I can never and could ever put my finger on...it's an extra edge or an extra passion that was missing that really prevented this film to be a true epic.  Also, after reviewing it after ten years, there are so many parts in the action scenes that involve either completely idiotic acts by the characters, or incredibly inconsistent scenes (for instance, in the raid on the liquor convoy, a platoon of mounties on horseback are charging a group of tommy gun clad mobsters who are hosing their guns at them at close range, yet not a single one is hit.  Also, the final scene where Costner looks at the matchbook, finds out his friend's killer is really the same Capone henchman whom he just disarmed AND then rearmed, makes the killer very aware to the fact and is then responsible for the guy going gun crazy in the whole court.  Also, I find it very hard to believe that NOONE heard the gunshots that echoed throughout the courtroom building.  And finally, though cool, the scene with the baby carriage has it's fair share of problems).  Plus, the pacing of the movie was a little too fast...I felt that there were scenes missing that should have been there...scenes that could have been spent with more characterization, and most importantly, the building passion of the team to bring down Capone.  There are far too little scenes that convey this passionate desire that we are supposed to be feeling with the characters.But when you add all of this up, surprisingly, it matters little.  With so many flaws, it still turns out to be a good movie with a great score by Ennio Morricone (who has provided scores for dozens of famous movies) and great direction by De Palma, though the pacing seems really choppy at times, and doesn't always flow well.  This film, next to Scarface, is probably De Palma's best effort overall.  It is entertaining and features some cool characters that unfortunately have very limited dialogue.  Overall, not a bad film, but there are much better gangster films out there.  Watch it for Connery, he truly shines.  7.5\/10 stars.

Today he is perhaps best known for authorship of The Ballard of Reading Jail, which was written during one of the times when he was in prison following a direct confrontation with the government of the time. When he wrote Salome it was banned for a time by the English stage censorship and, even though it can be a most rewarding performance to watch, stage productions of it are still relatively infrequent. Consequently many people today are more familiar with the bowdlerised opera which was based on the play and was composed by Richard Strauss. The opera has been filmed by at least two major directors, but for the cinematographic enthusiast there is also this very noteworthy film, directed by Ken Russell, which is much more closely based on Wilde's play. In my opinion this film is dramatically far superior to the rather pathetic opera, and is very worth while seeking out by anyone interested. Basically it exploits the psychological tensions which may have existed in King Herod's court, and which could have accounted for the demand by Salome for the head of John the Baptist on a platter; the story that is so baldly reported in the Bible.\tThe scenario of this film is set in a brothel where Oscar Wilde is treated to an illegal birthday performance of his play, acted by friends who include some of the employees of the host establishment.  This choice of venue has upset many critics but it is totally irrelevant to the play - it is helpful for a modern viewer to remember that, at the time in which this film is set, Oscar Wilde and his literary friends would meet regularly to present impromptu performances of works they had written, basically as a quality control procedure for the final product they eventually published; and this film simply exploits the practice. It is essentially a film of a play, with the story associated with the presentation of the play added to maintain cinematographic interest. \tKen Russell is a controversial director but although the film is not without faults, the overall quality is outstanding, the cast is superb, and there are particularly memorable performances by Glenda Jackson as Queen Herodias and by Imogen Millais-Scott (who shows the capability of looking any age between thirteen and thirty) as Princess Salome. Both the play and the film effectively capture the decadence, which was characteristic of the royal courts of petty despots at this point in history, better than any other works I have seen. It should be a must for anyone who has the opportunity to see it.

I was somewhat skeptical the first time I saw it because I adored the book and I knew there were some changes, but I found the essence of Fannie Flagg's fabulous novel in tact.  This is a story that burrows into your heart and mind and stays there.  It is absolutely magical storytelling with a stellar cast and beautifully written characters that never fade from memory.A time and place in America, filled with the best and the worst of our life and history, is impeccably captured.  The flashbacks take us to the time of an Alabama whistle stop town that was a bustling hub when the railroad was the center of all movement.  This was the era of hobos and simple pleasures.  The scenes from the past become more powerful by the juxtaposition to modern times, where the story begins and returns at intervals.Kathy Bates plays Evelyn Couch, an unhappy middle-aged housewife who stumbles on Ninny Threadgoode (the superb Jessica Tandy) one day by accident at the nursing home where she is visiting one of her husband's relatives.  The two have an instant chemistry and a deep friendship begins.  Ninny proceeds to tell Evelyn the story of Idgie and Ruth, two young women who shared an amazing friendship and love 50 years earlier. This movie has to be experienced, as mere descriptions might sound like another southern-flavored movie about women or a weepy nostalgic tale.  It is much more than that, and more than the most glowing review can ever convey.  If you are reading this and haven't seen it, please make a point to.  The actors are nothing short of magical.  All four actresses (Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) are at the top of their craft.I will borrow a line from Ninny Threadgoode to describe how I always feel after seeing this film.  I may be sitting here in this nursing home but in my mind I'm over at the Whistle Stop Cafe having a plate of Fried Green Tomatoes.I may be sitting here finishing this comment but in my mind I'm at the Whistle Stop Cafe.
