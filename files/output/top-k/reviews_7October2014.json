While I love the brutality, there isn't much tension. It's brutal without actually being intense. That's the major deficit. The story isn't twisty enough. James Woods does a fine macho character. This is good vampire hunt movie but it doesn't anything more than that.

James Cameron did an amazing job at synchronizing a horrific event in history with the everlasting love between Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Titanic is a movie that keeps you on your toes whether it's between the two love interests or between the tragic events that is happening to the ship, and the people while the boat plunges into the water. To me Titanic is a five out of five movie because of the amazing actors\/actresses, the story line, the message it relays at the end, and all the different characters that made this movie so diverse. While watching Titanic you have no choice but to fall in love with the characters which made me want to watch the movie even more. The actors\/actresses were amazing when portraying the characters they were supposed to be. The way they fell into character so easily was elegant. The director made the characters so diverse, which made it more interesting to see how different classes of people were treated back in 1979. The people that were chosen to portray the characters actually looked as if they were born for that particular role. You could feel the sincere emotions the actors were giving off while in character which made the audience open up to the movie. The movie was so interesting that the audience could watch the movie over and over again and it will never get tiresome. A contributing factor to success of Titanic was how the movie told the background of some of the characters. They were able to tell the story behind most of the cast members like the husband, mother, newlywed couple, and the young unfortunate families. Some of the characters in the movie might have not been intended to be significant, but ended up being very important to the impact the movie had on the audience's emotions. For example while the boat is sinking there is a mother who is tucking her kids away into their beds. She felt like that was the only choice she had, because she knows that with their social status they would have no chance of survival. All she wanted to do was comfort her kids and make sure they were at ease right before they all perish. Just that scene alone played an important role in the audience reaction and emotions. The movie also relayed a very unique personal message that was very meaningful. The Director showed that love can conquer anything, and can last forever even throughout death. In the beginning of Titanic we noticed that the very first time Jack saw Rose he instantly fell in love. Through the entire movie the audience see how their connection grows into this deep love that neither one of them have ever experienced. Rose was engaged to one of the wealthiest men on the boat, and she gave it all away because of the connection her and jack shared. Even when the ship was sinking Jack and Rose was so passionately in love they literally did anything for each other. For example, Rose went into the bottom of the boat, which was filled with water, to rescue jack, who was handcuff to a pipe and left to drown. Also, Rose jumped off one of the only life boats in order to stay with jack cause she knew that she couldn't go on without him, or how Jack let rose lay on floating wood in order for her to stay out the freezing water and stay alive. All of those contributing factors made the movie great. I fell in love with Titanic and will recommend the movie to anyone. After watching this movie it became a part of history and any and every one would love watching it. When watching the movie you fall in love with the message that the movie gives you. The characters that are being portrayed make you fall in love with the movie as well. This movie makes you want to watch over and over and anyone would love it.

Not only that the film does make you laugh at times and seeing the tender side to Thunder Jack at the end is really sweet!
