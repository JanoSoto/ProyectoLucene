DONNIE BRASCO isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly an intense, highly entertaining and at times thought-provoking film that manages to have many strong points. There's no question that the strongest is the relationship between the two men and this is perfectly brought to life thanks to the terrific performances by the two leads. By this point in his career Pacino could play a gangster in his sleep but the character of Lefty is certainly something very different than what we've seen from him in the past. The most noticeable thing is that this guy is pretty much a sad loser. There's really nothing special about him and I really loved the low quality that Pacino brings to him. There's just a certain sadness that floats around this guy and Pacino simply nails the role. Depp is just as impressive as the undercover agent who quickly finds himself becoming like the men he's spying on. The relationship and chemistry between the two actors is simply wonderful and certainly carries the picture. There's also strong support from the likes of Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche. What I enjoyed most outside the performances was the fact that the movie also has a good sense of humor. There are some very intense moments scattered throughout the picture and especially the constant fear of one of the two leads getting killed but there are also some clever bits of comedy thrown in. The late 70's and early 80's setting is also perfectly captured by director Mike Newell who also manages to keep the film moving at a very good pace. With so many gangster movies out there it's sometimes hard to find one that gives us a new and fresh look at the subject. DONNIE BRASCO does that and it's certainly one worth watching.

He plays a retarded man released from prison after serving twenty-five years for killing his mother and her lover with a sling blade. He felt morally justified because he saw their act of love as evil, only later realizing that it was wrong to kill them.We follow his release, first accepted with kindness by a local repair shop where he reveals himself to be skilled at fixing motors, then received into the family of a boy he's befriended, played wonderfully by LUCAS BLACK. Unfortunately, the family life is ruined by a violently dysfunctional man called Doyle (DWIGHT YOAKAM) who is a crude bully and redneck full of bitter hatred and resenting the intrusion of Thornton and the boy and possessive in his relationship with the mother.The biggest weakness in the screenplay is figuring out why the mother would ever be attracted by such a bigoted bully. Yoakam plays him in a ruthless manner that shows no compassion for the character and he's so evil that you have to wonder about the mother's mental faculties in letting him even near the family. It's also hard to believe that she would let the retired man use her garage for shelter on such short acquaintance with her son. But hey, this is a movie, this is the script, and that's it.All of the acting is uniformly excellent, particularly BILLY BOB THORNTON, who was nominated and would have deserved the Oscar for his penetrating study of a retarded man without a single false note.Tension builds because the viewer is aware that some sort of confrontation has to happen between Karl (Thornton) and Doyle. It's a matter of waiting to see what develops and that's what keeps the viewer hooked onto the story and wondering how it will conclude.It's a fully realized slice of life, Southern style with hillbilly overtones, always centered on the main thrust of the story without ever losing its touch, rich in atmospheric detail. J.T. WALSH as a fellow inmate is impressive, as is JOHN RITTER (whom I didn't even recognize at first) as a sympathetic gay man, amazingly real in a serious role.

I grew up watching this film and to me it hasn't aged a bit. No horror film even comes close. It has a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith which gives the film a lot of energy. Its beautifully photographed and the visual effects by Industrial Light and Magic are spectacular, but not overdone.I think that was Spielberg's intention, not to make it over the top and to make it as realistic as possible. Spielberg also used a lot of his own childhood fears and put them into the film. The acting is ace from Craig T.Nelson, Jobeth Williams and the late Heather O'Rourke which whom does not have much screen time but is the centre focus of the movie. She was just an angel.With all of the elements of visual effects, sound, acting, directing (Tobe Hooper) and writers (Steven Spielberg) this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Don't expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days, Poltergeist is not about that. Its the emotion of losing a loved one, a family coming together to fight to bring that loved one back and the hell they have to go through to succeed.This film, even though considered by many to be a classic does not receive the credibility it truly deserves. Poltergeist is a marvelous piece of work. The film received 3 Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound effects editing and original score. These awards which were all won by Spielberg's E.T.

The film isn't your typical cat-and-mouse thriller because this here actually has a brain that has its characters constantly thinking and reaction to what's going on.The film works perfectly as a thriller because even though you know who the killer is it doesn't take away from the entertainment. The screenplay gives the detective and the killer so much development that you really get to know both of them, get to know their flaws and you really get inside their minds. This is a thriller without the mystery of finding out who the killer is and Nolan perfectly handles this and manages to build up suspense through the character's developments.Of course, when you've got such great performances it really helps. Pacino turns in one of his greatest performances in years as the detective who finds himself under an incredibly suspenseful situation while at the same time not fully functioning due to his new insomnia. I really thought Pacino was fabulous and especially as the film wears on and his character becomes more delusional. Williams is so calm, cool and collection that you can't help but find yourself liking him yet you have to remind yourself that he's a killer. The coldness that Williams brings shows what a terrific dramatic actor he was. Hilary Swank plays a supporting part and she too is quite good.INSOMNIA, on a technical level, is quite excellent with a wonderful score and some dazzling cinematography.

However, I really, really disliked this film. In my opinion it sucks, and I can overlook many things if I enjoy the killers, but even that was lacking.THE GOOD It created Leatherface, inspired the remake and helped launch the 2006 prequel, thats the best thing this movie has ever done in my opinion. The idea of a hulking, skin wearing, mute, brutish killer was genius and pretty original for the day.THE BAD The film is way too slow moving. It focuses on unnecessary things far too much. In one instance Pam stumbles into a bone filled room that seems to stink from her reaction, but still she waits for a stupid amount of time just so the camera can pan around unnecessarily at the bones. Also, this film keeps character development (what there was of it) in the first half mainly on the most annoying character of the film, Franklin. Franklin was so annoying that if he wasn't in a wheelchair there would be nothing sad about seeing him bite the dust. In fact, I can see his death as a relief for some viewers. And even the other characters are lame. Jerry and Sally were laughing while talking about Sally's grandmother dying, Kirk found it amusing to pick up some nasty tooth and hand it to his girlfriend, and Sally wouldn't stop screaming! The sound quality is horrible, it took me like 10 views to figure out that Leatherface was laughing during the scene before he hooked Pam. The hitchhiker silently howls by the side of the road, and the dialogue on occasion seem like mumbles.Even though the basic idea of Leatherface was genius, it was seriously detracted from by the retard persona they chose to use. Why should I be afraid of someone who doesn't know why things happen and is even afraid of me? Squealing like a pig, acting stupid, he really didn't seem to know why things even happened. The new Leatherface acts more like real killers. In fact, he acted a lot like a mute BTK. In my opinion the remake\/prequel Leatherface is superior in intelligence, looks, and demeanor. Speaking of looks, the house didn't look as good as the remake house in my opinion, neither did the setting. Last, I hate the soundtrack! Well, what there was of one.So whats the best part of this movie? It introduced Leatherface and inspired the remake and prequel. Other than that its the worst kind of a pointless film, one that made a lot of money.

This movie came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing. If i had never discovered the ravier side of things this movie may not have made sense to me. That night when i watched it for the 1st time, with some mates, i was completely blown away. I had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time. Almost everything i could relate to in some way. There was never 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another. My mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them. We had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in HT. We where coming down while we watched and when the movie came down i remember actually coming down a bit further. it was actually quite depressing in our room during those low points. Thats what's so good about Human Traffic. it really taps the whole situation.its a unique movie in the way its not plot driven, but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important. it always seemed to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to the lostness in the same way. work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. for them its their holiday. But the reality is you cant truly escape. Another situation they all have to face.Me and my mates where no different from these guys. We all had our own stuff going on.

What works so well is that we're given a terrific cast with Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen leading the way as the wise vet and the wild rookie. The two of them work perfectly well together and certainly help keep the film going at a fast pace. The supporting cast gives us wonderful work by Corbin Bernsen, Margaret Whitton, James Gammon, Wesley Snipes, Charles Cyphers, Dennis Haysbert, Chelcie Ross and Rene Russo. We also have the priceless Bob Uecker who turns in one of the memorable roles in sports film history. The film is perfectly directed by David Ward who perfectly plays up the various comedy routines but he also manages to packs some wonderful tension during the final ballgame as the Indians go up against the Yankees.

The whole movie is great, but there is something about that barn scene that just does it for me.

Films like Billy Madison, Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore &#150; very straightforward, run-of-the-mill comedy films. The Wedding Singer has a lot more to it than that, and is a surprisingly enjoyable and witty romantic comedy. The trick is very simple &#150; it's a film about people. No fancy plot devices, no special effects, no action thrown in to spice things up &#150; just real and funny characters caught up in a situation that anyone can identify with.In the 1980s, wedding singer Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) makes friends with a pleasant waitress named Julia (Drew Barrymore) at a wedding party. The pair of them get on incredibly well but neither notices the chemistry between them as both are already engaged to their respective lovers. In Robbie's case, the attractive but incompatible Linda (Angela Featherstone); in Julia's case the successful and materialistic Glenn (Matthew Glave). When Robbie is jilted at the altar by Linda, he sinks into depression but is helped through the tough times by Julia. During this time he realises that he actually has feelings for her, a fact that Julia herself also awakens to. Julia begins to have serious doubts about whether she truly wants to spend the rest of her life with Glenn&#133; but her family and friends convince her that she is merely suffering from a few pre-wedding jitters. However, when Robbie finds out that Glenn is a love rat who sleeps around with other women he realises that the time is right to declare his love to Julia. But circumstances conspire to jeopardise his plan, and Robbie has to chase Julia to Las Vegas before she unwittingly marries the wrong guy&#133;What makes the film better than a standard romantic comedy is the clever '80s background, with clothing, fashion, hair-styles, music tastes and phrases all perfectly captured from the era. In one great scene, Robbie instructs Linda to stop wearing his Van Halen T-shirt please get out of my Van Halen T-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up! Little subtle gags like this run throughout the film and make it a pleasure to come back for repeat viewings. The dialogue is generally very good, with lots of quick witted sarcasm and one-liners. But the film remembers also to set aside time for the emotional and romantic elements, so that it doesn't just become a soulless gag-fest. Sandler proves for perhaps the first time in his career that he is a likable and subtle actor, capable of creating a character with personality rather than sticking to type. Similarly, Barrymore gives her sweetest performance in years &#150; the chemistry between them is unexpectedly warm and genuine. Indeed, the entire cast create memorable and amusing characters, right down to a hilarious cameo from Billy Idol. There's really not much wrong with The Wedding Singer &#150; it's a little conventional and the outcome is wholly predictable, but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise well-made, engaging and genuinely funny comedy flick.

But in 1977, the world was not full of Allen films filled with Allen humor and Allenisms. Thank goodness for that, because the film is truly one where his character can't be the sole focus. This is a film about Annie, as the title suggests, which really makes this movie great and still shine among the Allen repertoire.The film stars Woody Allen as his usual neurotic, pessimistic self, in the form of comedian Alvy Singer and follows the story of his life with a focus on his relationships with women and his family. The chronology of the film is off-whack with the beginning being his childhood, followed by a time where he and Annie (Diane Keaton) are not getting along followed by the story of how they met with several tangents of Alvy's past wives, etc. thrown in the mix. Allen tests your patience with his character most of the time, but Keaton as Annie is absolutely intriguing. You are drawn to her inexplicably just as Alvy is. She's a complete mess of a character, but she is so convincing and so interesting. The two of them, along with the film, are so off-beat, but that's what makes it good. The characters walking through memories like A Christmas Carol and talking to the camera and the scene when they're in line at the theater and the guy behind Alvy completely irritates him are very fun and don't detract from the story.Perhaps the best part of the film is that it's not so serious. It's kind of ironic that Alvy is the biggest pessimist in the world, when his film sort of treats life in a casual and humorous way that's very much how things are sometimes. Annie Hall shows that film doesn't have to be about an intense subject that is more interesting than anyone's normal life. Normal life with strange, weird, but normal people can make for just as good of a film. A story about a relationship between two people doesn't have to be filled with sweeping moments of love and emotion. Would all this be nearly as effective if Allen and Keaton weren't really strong, believable characters? No, probably not, but that shows that there is more to good film than a unique plot that falls into a category beyond the average person's experience.~Steven CVisit my site http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"29 February 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" If Annie Hall had been a later Woody Allen film, you'd be ready to slap him by the end of the film's opening monologue.

This is an incredibly important little film because it's always nice, as a historical document, to have those surrounding the event be on hand to tell their stories. I was rather shocked that the young girl's family memebers, including parents, were here for interviews and it just became more and more heartbreaking as the film went on. I'm not sure if depressing is the right word or not but the events in this film really can't be looked at in any other way. In the film we're told this event changed how white America looked at racism and I wish Lee would have gotten some of those racist in Birmingham to tell what they thought at the time and their feelings after they learned who was killed in the attacks. We do get George wallace making a fool out of himself but I somewhat had a problem with this. It's a joke seeing him try to say he was a friend to black people and he comes off looking very stupid, which I guess he should but the man seemed near death and I'm not really sure putting him on camera was the right thing to do. This is the only part where I think Lee went overboards in the story. The story was strong enough that we didn't need that little break, with slow motion and sound effects, to show what type of person Wallace was. The other thing I have to question is the fact that Lee showed the mutilated and burned bodies of the four children. I think knowing that they died is bad enough but seeing their bodies is something that certainly won't leave my mind. Either way, Lee has created a remarkable little film.
