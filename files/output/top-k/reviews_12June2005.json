[{"date":"12 June 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Following Sleepless in Seattle, this is not a very good movie. Those who are great fans of the first are not likely to find any magic in You've Got Mail. That said I like this movie better than that other romantic comedy with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. It is certainly a step up from Joe Versus the Volcano (which I also enjoyed, but is no great classic).I am the first to admit that Sleepless in Seattle is a better movie than You've Got Mail. The script is better, and as much as I like both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, they are just not at their best in this film, and the chemistry between them is much more convincing in the first movie. Nevertheless, I liked this movie partly because it illustrates the disappearance of the mom and pop type business, yet still puts a human face on the big chain stores that have replaced it, and more importantly, I was more moved by this one.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan go well together, and have come out with some good movies. Nora Ephron is a good director, and this is a decent movie in that regard, especially considering the script is just mediocre.This film is worth seeing as a romantic comedy, but don't try to compare too much to Sleepless in Seattle or Meg Ryan's movie with Billy Crystal, When Harry Met Sally, or you may be disappointed.

The other one is Lost Highway. Because of this, but not only because of this, the following review will contain a lot of comparing between the two. As someone brought up(on the message boards or in a review... I can't remember exactly), this seems like Lynch wasn't satisfied with Lost Highway, so he made this to improve on it. Of course, it could that all his films are like this... I don't know. This seemed to have a more cohesive plot and it made more sense than the aforementioned film. In spite of this, I still didn't fully understand until I read a very good interpretation on the message boards. The idea of this seemed more vague and harder to figure out than Lost Highway. It seemed easier to follow, though... but maybe this is because this was the second time I saw a typical Lynch film(not to mention how similar in basic idea this was to Lost Highway). I found myself sympathizing more with the characters in this film, as well as finding their actions plausible and credible. The movie made much more sense to me right after watching than Lost Highway. In conclusion, this very well may be a revisit\/remake of Lost Highway. The plot is very interesting, and vague as it may be, it can be pieced together if you pay close attention and watch it more than once. The pacing is very good, you're rarely bored. The acting is perfect. I didn't find any performance to be anything but stellar. I didn't see Lynch playing around with lighting in this film as much as he did in Lost Highway, but maybe it was just more subtle this time around. I recommend this to fans of Lynch, surreal films and film as an art form. Excellent film, but won't be to everyone's liking. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the second movie by David Lynch I've seen(not counting The Elephant Man, his only non-surreal movie).
