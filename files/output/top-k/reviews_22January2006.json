You know exactly what you are going to get before you order, and in some way, the dishes are all alike in spite of some fundamental differences. In a Lynch film, you know you are going to get a lot of surreal imagery, stories that would make sense if you could take the pieces and rearrange the order, or soundscapes that promote a creeping sense of unease. Sometimes all of the above. But then, Lynch must also have quite a lot of talent as a director, given that he is able to coax decent and genuinely good performances out of two women who used to appear in Please Go Away. Critics of the film have attacked it for being an excuse to show minimally-simulated lesbian sex scenes or making no sense, and I cannot deny that they have some cred in a sense. Without reading an explanation or theory of the plot in advance, Mulholland Dr. tends to make little sense. However, unlike Eraserhead, it does not allow for thousands of theories that may not coincide with what Lynch had in mind.Many scenes in the film are referenced later, or even in advance, and some are repeated from a different perspective. What makes Mulholland Dr. watchable is the theory that it is the story of a young woman's emotional breakdown as her career stumbles into a quick decline. Originally made as a pilot for a TV series, it appears to be a series of reflections on experiences in the director's life. The illusion and perceived glitz of Hollywood is contrasted with its hidden squalor and dirty politics. If one simply sees it in this way, then the film is otherwise just a string of bizarre coincidental images. Lynch has given a series of clues in order to unlock the hidden meaning of the film, but I honestly believe he neither knows nor cares about any hidden message himself. Not that he is deliberately confusing the audience to hide a lack of skill. Rather, he is simply feeding his own legend in order to promote the story. Exactly what the point of scenes such as the Ryan Entertainment meeting is, he would rather we just make up for ourselves. You have to respect a director who is willing to do that.As I mentioned, the film contains performances from two women who appeared in Please Go Away, the television series that has come to symbolise everything I loathe about Australia, its culture, and its people. Naomi Watts is the more prominent of the two, and there is no way one would guess from watching her in this film that she was somehow involved in that utter talent vortex. In a strange way, it is her wide-eyed, innocent portrayal of a woman new to this strange land called Los Angeles that keeps the viewer focused. The real star of the show, however, is Laura Elena Harring, who has no connection whatsoever to the aforementioned soap opera, and it shows. Starting the film as a mousy, frightened woman with no memory of who or what she is, at least half the shocks and revelations of the plot come from her. Justin Theroux provides the rest of the film's heart as the director who simply wants to retain artistic control, but slowly transforms through the film when he is harshly reminded of who has the real power in Hollywood. It has been suggested that this is an autobiographical character based on Lynch's reflections on the production of Dune, which would not surprise me.By far the most puzzling and interesting sequence of the film is the play in the club Silencio. It is worth sitting through this sequence a few times in order to catch everything that Geno Silva says during his monologue. I do not speak Spanish fluently enough to understand how the statements made in the language during the song affect the plot, but it would not surprise me to learn that much of the entire plot is revealed in this sequence. Another memorable scene occurs when a mob heavy comes to the Kesher house, in search of the esteemed director. A lot of people who wanted to punch Billy Ray Cyrus in the face for Achy Breaky Heart will live vicariously through this scene. Many who suffered through the introduction of Lorraine Kesher will also find this scene quite satisfying. I cannot reveal the most satisfying scene in the film, however, as it is basically the end of the film and just left me dumbfounded when I first saw it, as I suspect Lynch intended. Then again, Lynch and dumbfounded often belong in the same sentence where reaction is concerned.Out of ten, I gave Mulholland Dr. an eight. It suffers somewhat from its TV pilot origins, and a few plot threads seem to be left quite loose, but it remains by far Lynch's most accessible and satisfying work, at least from what I have seen. Even if you despise other Lynch films, as Roger Ebert seems to do, you might just find Mulholland Dr. strangely rewarding, as Roger Ebert also seems to do. In fact, Ebert says it best with a quote from his review the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it. Amen, Roger.

Amongst the group are Big Daddy's wife, Ida, their eldest son, Gooper (Jack Carlson), Gooper's wife Mae (Madeline Sherwood) and their five children and the Pollitt's youngest and favourite son Brick (Paul Newman) and Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).The movie opens with Brick, in a drunken stupor, attempting to recapture his lost glory days on the athletics track. Unfortunately, the only glory he gains is a broken ankle. Brick is a former star footballer who has become a miserable alcoholic. He spends his days in a deep depression, hobbling around on his crutch, grieving for the death of his best friend, Skipper, and yearning for the love of his father that he has never had. Brick is so wrapped up in feelings of disgust and sadness; he can't even bear to make love to his wife Maggie (whom he accuses of seducing and sleeping with Skipper). He lies on the couch swilling whiskey, nursing his broken ankle and wounded pride and rejecting Maggie's seductive advances as well as refusing to care about the family quarrelling downstairs.The story really heats up towards the middle of the film. As a thunderstorm erupts outside, the gloves come off. Determined to find out the cause of Brick's alcoholism, Big Daddy battles Maggie and Brick behind closed doors. Several revelations finally come to the surface. Brick's hatred of himself over losing his best friend and 'crutch', finally bring him out of his emotionless state as he starts to talk about the events leading up to Skipper's death. His deep blue eyes slowly well with tears and his grief-ravaged face crack through his father's harshness towards him. Big Daddy realises that his son's 'very close and almost obsessive' friendship with Skipper replaced the love that had been denied by his father for so long. During the heated arguing, Brick lets it slip that to Big Daddy that he has been lied to about his illness. Stunned with the revelation that he has terminal cancer and he has been lied to, Big Daddy wanders off to be alone.Brick searches for Big Daddy to apologise, and finds him in the basement, where they both have a deep and meaningful talk about their relationship. Father and son then realise how much they need each other. Brick doesn't care about wealth. All he wants is a father, not a boss. Both men are physically crippled &#150; Brick with his broken ankle and Big Daddy with cancer. However, they become emotional crutches for each other, which in turn ease the physical pain. With a new found respect, understanding and love for each other, father and son help each other up the stairs to face the storm brewing in the living room between the remainder of the family. This particular scene is the strongest and most emotional in the entire movie.The family gather for a 'final confrontation' in the living room. It is uncovered that Gooper and Mae have drawn up papers to try and take Big Daddy's plantation from under him due to his terminal illness. With these revelations out in the open, Maggie cunningly takes the opportunity to give her 'birthday present' to Big Daddy. She announces that she is in fact pregnant with Brick's child. Of course Big Daddy knows that it is a lie. But he also knows now that Brick's demons have finally been laid to rest, and that his youngest son is ready to take on the responsibility of a family as well as the Pollitt property. He admires Brick for his simple want of love not money. Big Daddy then organises to have his lawyer leave his wealth to Brick.Paul Newman captures the intense depression of Brick really well. For the first half of the movie, he is emotionless, uncaring and wrapped up in his own world of pity and sadness. Elizabeth Taylor was perfect as the desperate and beautiful Maggie the Cat. She was courageous and powerful. Her performance perfectly bounced off Newman as he expressionlessly thwarted her advances. Both Newman and Taylor are so stunningly beautiful in this movie, that they take your breath away.Burl Ives was magnificent. What I loved most about Ives' performance, was Big Daddy's ability to be the domineering patriarch, but at the same time in his scenes with Brick, he allows himself to show that he understands his son's emotional pain, and in his facial expressions, you can see that he does hurt for the torment that Brick is going through. They are very subtle expressions of tenderness, but at the same time, they do make an impact on the viewer. Big Daddy's heart does truly break for his son, and it is clear that Brick is the favourite. Madeline Sherwood was impeccably cast as Gooper's annoying, greedy wife, Mae. Her whining, yelling and constant sneering at Brick and Maggie's infertile marriage is enough to make you wish Maggie actually did slap her into oblivion. The underrated Jack Carson is Gooper. Judith Anderson plays Big Mamma &#150; the desperate, lonely and under-appreciated wife.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof takes us back to when the performances of actors were simply enough to draw audience. The story only revolve around family domestics, but it keeps the viewer interested and thoughtful until the final scene because of the pain, torment and greed of its characters. It was a pleasure to see such wonderful and talented performers at the top of their craft, and it is a terrific salute to the way dramatic film should be made.

But he also knows now that Brick's demons have finally been laid to rest, and that his youngest son is ready to take on the responsibility of a family as well as the Pollitt property. He admires Brick for his simple want of love not money. Big Daddy then organises to have his lawyer leave his wealth to Brick.Paul Newman captures the intense depression of Brick really well. For the first half of the movie, he is emotionless, uncaring and wrapped up in his own world of pity and sadness. Elizabeth Taylor was perfect as the desperate and beautiful Maggie the Cat. She was courageous and powerful. Her performance perfectly bounced off Newman as he expressionlessly thwarted her advances. Both Newman and Taylor are so stunningly beautiful in this movie, that they take your breath away.Burl Ives was magnificent. What I loved most about Ives' performance, was Big Daddy's ability to be the domineering patriarch, but at the same time in his scenes with Brick, he allows himself to show that he understands his son's emotional pain, and in his facial expressions, you can see that he does hurt for the torment that Brick is going through. They are very subtle expressions of tenderness, but at the same time, they do make an impact on the viewer. Big Daddy's heart does truly break for his son, and it is clear that Brick is the favourite. Madeline Sherwood was impeccably cast as Gooper's annoying, greedy wife, Mae. Her whining, yelling and constant sneering at Brick and Maggie's infertile marriage is enough to make you wish Maggie actually did slap her into oblivion. The underrated Jack Carson is Gooper. Judith Anderson plays Big Mamma &#150; the desperate, lonely and under-appreciated wife.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof takes us back to when the performances of actors were simply enough to draw audience. The story only revolve around family domestics, but it keeps the viewer interested and thoughtful until the final scene because of the pain, torment and greed of its characters. It was a pleasure to see such wonderful and talented performers at the top of their craft, and it is a terrific salute to the way dramatic film should be made. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"22 January 2006","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" The Pollitt family gather to celebrate the 65th birthday of Big Daddy (Burl Ives), wealthy land owner and cotton merchant. Amongst the group are Big Daddy's wife, Ida, their eldest son, Gooper (Jack Carlson), Gooper's wife Mae (Madeline Sherwood) and their five children and the Pollitt's youngest and favourite son Brick (Paul Newman) and Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).The movie opens with Brick, in a drunken stupor, attempting to recapture his lost glory days on the athletics track. Unfortunately, the only glory he gains is a broken ankle. Brick is a former star footballer who has become a miserable alcoholic. He spends his days in a deep depression, hobbling around on his crutch, grieving for the death of his best friend, Skipper, and yearning for the love of his father that he has never had. Brick is so wrapped up in feelings of disgust and sadness; he can't even bear to make love to his wife Maggie (whom he accuses of seducing and sleeping with Skipper). He lies on the couch swilling whiskey, nursing his broken ankle and wounded pride and rejecting Maggie's seductive advances as well as refusing to care about the family quarrelling downstairs.The story really heats up towards the middle of the film. As a thunderstorm erupts outside, the gloves come off. Determined to find out the cause of Brick's alcoholism, Big Daddy battles Maggie and Brick behind closed doors. Several revelations finally come to the surface. Brick's hatred of himself over losing his best friend and 'crutch', finally bring him out of his emotionless state as he starts to talk about the events leading up to Skipper's death. His deep blue eyes slowly well with tears and his grief-ravaged face crack through his father's harshness towards him. Big Daddy realises that his son's 'very close and almost obsessive' friendship with Skipper replaced the love that had been denied by his father for so long. During the heated arguing, Brick lets it slip that to Big Daddy that he has been lied to about his illness. Stunned with the revelation that he has terminal cancer and he has been lied to, Big Daddy wanders off to be alone.Brick searches for Big Daddy to apologise, and finds him in the basement, where they both have a deep and meaningful talk about their relationship. Father and son then realise how much they need each other. Brick doesn't care about wealth. All he wants is a father, not a boss. Both men are physically crippled &#150; Brick with his broken ankle and Big Daddy with cancer. However, they become emotional crutches for each other, which in turn ease the physical pain. With a new found respect, understanding and love for each other, father and son help each other up the stairs to face the storm brewing in the living room between the remainder of the family. This particular scene is the strongest and most emotional in the entire movie.The family gather for a 'final confrontation' in the living room. It is uncovered that Gooper and Mae have drawn up papers to try and take Big Daddy's plantation from under him due to his terminal illness. With these revelations out in the open, Maggie cunningly takes the opportunity to give her 'birthday present' to Big Daddy. She announces that she is in fact pregnant with Brick's child. Of course Big Daddy knows that it is a lie.

In doing so, Phantasm IV becomes the most atmospheric and haunting one yet. Just don't expect long scenes of exposition or plot-details being unsubtly wrapped up, the mystery of the Tall Man is too strong to ever fully end.As you should remember, at the end of Phantasm III Mike disappeared into the darkness after the Tall Man did some kind of unnecessary brain surgery on him and Reggie was literally left hanging after being pinned to the wall by a dozen killer spheres. Well you can relax, the Tall Man knows that killing Reggie will achieve nothing and focuses on catching Mike, who has a plan to draw him out into the open by hiding in the desert. Reggie closely follows, driving through loads of deserted towns already pillaged by the Tall Man. And the ghost of Jodie (now looking like the identical twin brother of Stellan Skarsgard) comes back to offer some suspicious advice.It's all very, very minimalist and reminds me a lot of the Myst video games in regards to the overwhelming sense of abandonment and isolation, the journal-keeping, the doorways to other worlds, the stark silence of desert landscapes and the weird contraptions. The true identity of the Tall Man is finally revealed but the forces behind him are still kept in the dark. The answers are hinted at rather than announced and the dialogue sparse without being empty.Another cool thing about this sequel are the many eerie and haunting (and haunted?) locations such as a lonely beach, spooky rock formations, a lifeless Wilshire Boulevard (the biggest street in LA) and barren salt flats that give it such an otherworldly and supernatural feel that the typical mausoleums and old graveyards of II and III didn't.Again the Tall Man steals the show from Reggie, who is putting up a harder fight to make it his movie. Both are great characters who shrug off the typical characteristics of villain and hero and become people who you can REALLY root for. Yes, you can side with the Tall Man! It's a shame that Angus Scrimm has never really gotten any huge recognition outside of the cult-horror circles as his approach to the character is very unique and he takes his acting very seriously. Since Don Coscarelli shot so much unused footage for the original Phantasm film he incorporates some of it into the story, thus heightening the already warped space-time continuum the Phantasm universe exists in. As a result of this the ending may seem annoyingly ambiguous but can be interpreted in so many different ways. Since Coscarelli is busy with other projects right now it seems unlikely that the long-rumored Phantasm's End will happen any time soon. But when you enjoy a series of films so much do you really want to see it end? The non-closure of Phantasm IV keeps the story alive after the credits roll instead of finishing it for good. Which is how I would prefer it. If you watch it with company, this tends to lead to much discussion afterwards, something more straight-forward horror films don't. I've always thought that if you wish to tackle something outlandish and imaginative that you must have an equally as strong counter-imagination to fully take it in and comprehend. If you prefer films like Bridget Jones and turn your nose up to Lost Highway then your probably best steering away from the Phantasm series. If you're better than that then you're in for one helluva crazy ride.

Instead of making X-Men about nothing but big mutant action, he's managed to make a good action movie with a good plot and puts everything in the movie together nicely and with some style in a few areas.Considering the mutants included in this movie, Singer has done, if I may say so, an excellent job in selecting the actors and actresses for each role. As far as bring their character to life, Jackman does the best job as Logan or Wolverine as he's better called by fans. Paquin does a good job at capturing the confused and seemingly stressed feeling of Rogue. But Patrick Stewart is the smartest choice in particular, even though Jackman does the best at being Wolverine. Not only does Stewart have the perfect look for Professor Xavier, but he also has the right personality and attitude, a kind of know-it-all but helpful and not-so geeky kind of personality makes him one of the more believable characters. Ian McKellen is a great choice for Magneto. Not only is he the smartest choice for Magneto, but McKellen creates a charming and calm kind of feeling towards his character, which even as a baddie he manages to make the audience like him. All the other performers of X-Men do their part to bring their mutant role to life, and they all do it successfully and almost perfectly.X-Men's plot is actually one of its better elements. Yes, you could go on saying how cool each of the mutants were, how great the special effects are and how cool the vs. battles were, but to talk about this movie and not mention it having a good plot is almost an insult. The thing I like about this movie is that it takes its time to let the audience understand everything that's going on and the movie takes what some might call a risk in not being so involved in the action sequences and using up a majority of the viewing time to let the story of the movie flow and lets the action and performers go and unfold the events that happen throughout the film. But since I don't want to spoil the simple but more than above-average plot for you, I'll keep it on the down-low from now. Just know that if you're looking for a good plot in X-Men you won't be disappointed.The action in X-Men isn't that much of a focus of the movie as the plot is, but not to worry, the action is more than satisfying and most of the time pretty cool. The special effects in this movie aren't used in a way that it'd make X-Men the king of CGI like King Kong and Titanic are, but they're nothing short of impressive and make the action sequences much more stylish. Most of the action is thrown out near the end and it all leaves a good feeling with the audience to make them feel satisfied and to have gotten a good share of action.But even with all that I've said in X-Men, it just doesn't seem to rise to that mark to make it an Oscar-worthy film. It's not that the movie lacked anything, not at all, everything in the movie was pieced together right, but it's just one of those movies that doesn't give the viewer that wow or now that's a stunning masterpiece impression once the movie ends, but instead comes out being a great movie that only lacks the beyond belief factor that the biggest movies deliver. But by no means is X-Men a bad film, there's absolutely nothing that I could say was particularly wrong with the film, it's only when you stack it against the best movies that it comes short, and X-Men almost seems to want to challenge those films in some way.

As far as bring their character to life, Jackman does the best job as Logan or Wolverine as he's better called by fans. Paquin does a good job at capturing the confused and seemingly stressed feeling of Rogue. But Patrick Stewart is the smartest choice in particular, even though Jackman does the best at being Wolverine. Not only does Stewart have the perfect look for Professor Xavier, but he also has the right personality and attitude, a kind of know-it-all but helpful and not-so geeky kind of personality makes him one of the more believable characters. Ian McKellen is a great choice for Magneto. Not only is he the smartest choice for Magneto, but McKellen creates a charming and calm kind of feeling towards his character, which even as a baddie he manages to make the audience like him. All the other performers of X-Men do their part to bring their mutant role to life, and they all do it successfully and almost perfectly.X-Men's plot is actually one of its better elements. Yes, you could go on saying how cool each of the mutants were, how great the special effects are and how cool the vs. battles were, but to talk about this movie and not mention it having a good plot is almost an insult. The thing I like about this movie is that it takes its time to let the audience understand everything that's going on and the movie takes what some might call a risk in not being so involved in the action sequences and using up a majority of the viewing time to let the story of the movie flow and lets the action and performers go and unfold the events that happen throughout the film. But since I don't want to spoil the simple but more than above-average plot for you, I'll keep it on the down-low from now. Just know that if you're looking for a good plot in X-Men you won't be disappointed.The action in X-Men isn't that much of a focus of the movie as the plot is, but not to worry, the action is more than satisfying and most of the time pretty cool. The special effects in this movie aren't used in a way that it'd make X-Men the king of CGI like King Kong and Titanic are, but they're nothing short of impressive and make the action sequences much more stylish. Most of the action is thrown out near the end and it all leaves a good feeling with the audience to make them feel satisfied and to have gotten a good share of action.But even with all that I've said in X-Men, it just doesn't seem to rise to that mark to make it an Oscar-worthy film. It's not that the movie lacked anything, not at all, everything in the movie was pieced together right, but it's just one of those movies that doesn't give the viewer that wow or now that's a stunning masterpiece impression once the movie ends, but instead comes out being a great movie that only lacks the beyond belief factor that the biggest movies deliver. But by no means is X-Men a bad film, there's absolutely nothing that I could say was particularly wrong with the film, it's only when you stack it against the best movies that it comes short, and X-Men almost seems to want to challenge those films in some way.

His works included Time Bandits, Brazil, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. So you know pretty much what to expect when you go into one of his movies. A fantasy filled world of dark humor and love. This film is no exception.Quite possibly the best of Gilliam's post-Python films, it tells the story of radio DJ, played by Jeff Bridges, who, through no real fault of his own, ends up convincing a psychotic man to kill a bunch of people and himself in a nightclub after asking Bridges for advice. The DJ feels very responsible for this and decides to stop everything and try to cope with it.After three years he gets attacked by hoodlums and is saved by a homeless man played by Robin Williams. The two get to know each other and Bridges reluctantly becomes friends with him after finding out how the two are connected.Bridges and his girlfriend, played by Mercedes Ruehl, try different things to get Williams to fit in with the rest of New York City and to not be a bum. This results in some amusing situations involving the girl of Williams' dreams, played by Amanda Plummer, and another quest for the Holy Grail.The film revolves around itself to bring us the tail of two not so different men in a big city where it seems everyone is different. Especially Mercedes Ruehl who ends up being the wise conscious of Bridges. She won a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but we don't see much of her these days.All in all, The Fisher King seems like something the children would like, but the adults would find amusing. I guess that means that it's a good film, but still a little dark for younger audiences. I thought that it was well done, but like most Gilliam works, something held me back from giving it a higher rating. The same thing happened with Twelve Monkeys, but I guess I have to see more of his films to find out why this is.

In 1984, Ridley Scott, director of the famed sci-fi Alien, set out to tell a defining fairy tale. Once he was joined by writer William Hjortsberg, the duo started off on a creative journey to conjure what would become the beloved film Legend. The film was further more given the appropriate elements for the general fairy tale. The Princess, the Hero, the Villain, the Goblins, the Fairies, and the other magical characters and creatures such as the Unicorns and Honeythorn Gump. Seeing as the film is intended to be a definitive fairy tale, this would also mean tracing the modern genre back to its' roots, Grim style. Indeed, the completed product was pure in it's woven fables. Just as it is tender, and bright, is it also dark, surreal, nightmarish, and ultimately entrancing. More of the film deals with the overshadow of darkness in the magical land. A proper way to show the sudden switch from light and happy, to dark and fearsome indeed.In the story, we have the world, happy, beautiful, completely compelling in its' own nature. The dark truth lies within its' own reality. Darkness once ruled the world, but has since retreated into the lower levels of the earth, to groan and complain of times in a better existence. The world is happy, because the Unicorn, a very dear, and sacred animal, rules the land. These gorgeous creatures know only love and laughter, and thusly, protect the world from evil. They are attracted to one element in man kind, innocence. Princes Lily is pure at heart, as well as mind and spirit. Her soul friend, Jack, leads her to the creatures, as a gesture of love and affection. Quite unfortunately, however, the Lord Darkness has sent his own army after the creatures too. Once both sides are at the right place, and the wrong time, the Unicorns are harmed, and the earth, in danger. Thus begins a journey full of action, adventure, and suspense.Tom Cruise has only performed well in this one film, for me anyway. He is actually quite affective, and believable as the hero Jack. He shows both strength and bravery, to contrast with confusion and fear of the unknown. Very plausible indeed. Mia Sara is so gorgeous, naive, and pure as the Princess. Her characteristics consist of a blind ambition, love stricken playfulness, and of course, Innocence. Never, has this genre seen such a perfect portrayal. Now, Tim Curry turns in one hell of a performance. Thanks to modern film-making, Curry is a frightening, disgusting, and yet sexual portrayal of ultimate Darkness. The three stars are all mixed together in a real Fairy Tale, with a message at the end. (note, this message is only seen in the 2002 restored Directors Cut).I do not feel the need to bring up the controversy that ensued the principal photography, as it is well known by fans and film buffs of all kind. What I can say, is that Ridley Scott was certainly determined to give us the product of his imagination. That said, he gave us a real fantasy. he has given us a real story of magic,, love, hate,adventure, and all kinds of elements that create what a film like this should be. One thing to truly be mentioned, however, is the late Jerry Goldsmith. This master at film composition of the musical persuasion, gave us his ultimate best, and that was being generous and forgetting about getting stabbed in the back during the processing of Alien. Again, the great musician was tricked, and his beautiful score was thrown out the window from US versions, leaving the film to sugary and sappy. Even worse, important scenes were cut, leaving much of the film uneven and seemingly rushed. Sad enough, this kind of treatment happened a year earlier with 1984's Supergirl. Fortunately, however, we were given the true version of the film in mid 2002, and rightly so. The film has since then, been seen, and loved by fans as myself, who loved it way back when....as well as now.The best I can say, is that this movie has a full blown mastermind to it, and the producers and creators etc finally gave the film justice.

Unfortunately the reality is that since both of the first 2 movies were great, this movie had high expectations. Ultimately, Alien3 is not worthy to be accepted as part of Alien series.Alien3 had some good acting and music and some excellent cinematography I thought. It was also darker than the first 2. Also, the concept of crashing in a maximum security prison was a good one I thought. But since this review only rationalizes a 3\/10 for this movie, I will spend the rest of the time explaining what made this movie a bad one.First of all, it completely ruins the second Alien movie for three reasons Firstly by introducing the egg that had been on board that had hatched into an alien. How the heck did that egg get there anyway? No explanation is offered. Secondly by introducing the fact that Ripley somehow had a queen alien chestburster inside of her. How did that get there? No explanation is offered. Thirdly by killing off 2 of the main characters from Aliens, Newt and Hicks, right at the very beginning, giving them senseless deaths. Many say this was for shock value. Shock value my ass, it was just a letdown. Killing them off halfway through or something would've been more effective. Besides, they could've developed Newt and Hicks a lot more. The sole fact that the innocent child Newt has to live in a maximum security prison makes for some good character development. Hicks would've been a bit trickier, but with some creativity they could've come up with something (i.e. maybe Hicks went to prison when he was younger and he's scared of them now and has to deal with it). Maybe if Hicks and Newt were the first victims, it would've been more satisfying (and then Ripley would be a loner again, which is what her character is all about IMO, as nobody would believe her about the alien again, etc).Another element lacking in the third movie is the absence of one of the dominant themes in the first 2 movies, about the protection of the innocent. Ripley went out of her way to protect Jones (in Alien) and Newt (in Aliens) but there was none of her motherly role in this movie. I felt this element was important to the first 2 movies, yet it became non-existent in the third.Another negative point was that I feel this movie sort of ruined the image of the alien. Having the alien run after people at high velocities and having the people herd it like a sheep is not what the alien is supposed to be. The aliens are supposed to be slow, sneaky, and stealthy and pop out from behind you when you least expect it. By making the alien run, they were trying to make it scarier, but they actually made it less scary. Come to think of it, the scariest bad guys in movies are never fast moving creatures. And the aliens are supposed to be smart, not stupid. Remember in Alien how the alien was hiding in the escape ship at the end? Or in Aliens how the queen used the elevator and then stowed away? A final point that made this movie bad was a stupid stylistic decision Kill off the main secondary character, Clemens, halfway through the movie. They had just begun to develop his character, and he could've been the next Hicks or Newt, but no, they kill him off halfway through. Then instead they try to develop the character of Dillon, however, they only get to developing his character halfway through as well. As a result, we have 2 half-developed characters (both of which die by the end), leaving Ripley the only character the viewer really cares about (unlike in Aliens where we had Hicks, Newt, Bishop, Vasquez, Apone, etc).In conclusion, this was a well made movie with terrible stylistic decisions that essentially ruined it. The only good decision was to have Ripley sacrifice herself for the protection of humans at the end. This was done very well and ended off the movie well (albeit it was a sad ending).

What could have been a wonderfully subtle story was instead hammered painfully at the viewer. Penn's direction was ham-fisted and often bordering on the sadistic. A wonderfully interesting performance by Nicholson is completely ruined by Penn's choppy cutaways to ridiculous shots of flying birds and zooming cars, (or worse, violent burning corpses and shocking crime scene shots), when we would really rather be seeing Nicholson's emotions. Worse, Penn seems to take particular glee in portraying literally every man in this film as a closet pedophile. Then we have the only woman in the movie as a horribly battered woman who finds love with a man who ends up using her child as bait for a sex killer. (Charmingly, Penn cast his wife in this role.) I mean, I don't need my movies to be totally politically correct. I saw this movie at a noir film festival. I am a serious fan of noir and of dark films in general.

Also be aware that even if you have a strong stomach, if you think you might have a problem seeing horribly graphic shots of brutally butchered 6-year-old girls, (as most of us do), you should probably avoid this movie. It's got a lot to disgust you with nothing to redeem it, other than some vestiges of what clearly could have been great performances by Del Toro, Nicholson, Penn, and Eckhart.

In a way it's hard to find what the dramatic conflict of the film would be if not for the push & pull struggle between the scientists and his 'test' subject of sorts, Victor, the wild child of the title. But somehow it does- Truffaut laces the film with a kind of undertone of logic for the audience (how can a boy for most of his life be out in the wild and become suddenly domesticated), while making a sort of nature versus society statement. The film also has the director's trademark lightness, which helps to not make the film's subject matter too bleak or disparaging. For it could be- Truffaut actually gives a kind of suspense to the narrative at times, that just when you think Victor is on his way to success, he stumbles and starts to act out on the floor or escape into the wild for a breather. It's a very curious film, not just because Truffaut (in one of his few times) gives himself the starring role, but also that the child- like Makim Munzak in Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala- had his only significant role ever in the film. And it's quite the seemingly impulsive, and always alive, performance that filmmaker's rarely get out of children.Victor is named this only halfway through the film, and it starts off with him being chased by a small mob and their dogs through the woods. It's maybe the most exciting part of the film, but then this segways into the early stages of the boy's troubles. He's placed in a deaf and dumb school, beat up by the other kids, and still with the passions and intelligence that the woods have given him. It becomes a fascination in the story of what the limits, if any, are for him to learn everything real boys do. Once he's put into Dr. Itard's (Truffaut) care, then the film sets off onto a very direct path- how will he learn, will he, and how long will it it take? As with his other films, the literary aspect kicks in as the scientist takes repeated notes on the boy, using a kind of pre-Darwinian way of scientific methods. But it's within the little moments in the film, like when Victor is out on his walks, or makes his little successes, where Truffaut as a filmmaker picks up the best parts of the film.This could be a very routine picture, and for some it may actually be a little dull and disheartening. Will the boy ever learn? The film actually does raise questions within its format, as it is based on a true case (from taking science classes I know there are also others of this kind as well). It brings to mind about what is pure and delicate about the ways of an animal and what separates them and humans. Each little test becomes dramatic conflict in the structure Truffaut puts forth, and in a way it's rather experimental. And it even becomes delightful in certain scenes, like when he first learns how to ask for milk, and then this expands. This, along with a sweet Vivaldi score in the background, and interesting visuals (love the iris usage), makes it a worthwhile entry in Truffaut's oeuvre. Not one of his absolute best, but up there.

The moral implications of a gay man and a straight woman deciding to raise a child together are indeed challenging and very much up-to-date. Here the comedy aspect is overlaid by some sincere issues that make this movie more interesting than the beginning has implied.The movie even turns into a family drama and becomes very emotional. You will love Malcolm Stumpf as Sam, the protagonists' son. He is very convincing and shows substantial natural talent, which adds considerable quality to the story. The final dramatic climax is an ensuing court room struggle for custody of the little boy between Robert and Madonna with her new boyfriend Ben. This causes very strong moral and emotional implications. Robert's desperate struggle and his honest commitment to be together with his beloved son goes straight into your heart and addresses the issue of homosexuals and their rights to raise children. Here again Malcolm Stumpf bears a significant part of the emotional burden, and does so genuinely.This movie is very simple in its equipment, but the messages delivered and the characters portrayed make it worthwhile. Rupert Everett does a great job, and Madonna shows that she can act if she has to. It is a very tough subject, and in the end you will not consider the movie a comedy any longer. This is a good thing.

Plot Citizen Kane still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. And in the end when everyone suspects that Rosebud is something Kane wanted and never had, or something he had lost along with everything else, the irony is there, as they give up by saying that a man's life cannot be described in one word. Even though Rosebud is the very name of the sleigh he had as a boy when he lived with his mother as a boy, and is the only thing he took with him, Rosebud was always in his mind reminding of the event as he made moves through his life that would react to this deeply wounding event. And the scene of the men burning Rosebud in the fire is breathtraking, leading you to the conclusion that the answer they were looking for to Kane's life was right there but destroyed by choice as it was for Kane. THe movie is breathtaking and may not be or be the best movie in history, it's your choice, i personally think that it is at the top, if not, the top. But I personally love Vertigo, read my review for Vertigo also, it has so many ingredients to project what we call the best picture in cinematic history, while Citizen Kane falls short to me, somewhere, although I can't place my finger on it and what it's missing. I think it's just the genre and how Vertigo's thrilling aspects interest me, but this is undoubtedly the most important film in all of history, rent, or better yet, buy the two-disc set, featuring an amazing documentary on disc two, which was nominated in 1995, for best documentary, by the Academy. And then you will understand this review completely, thank you.

The movie was one of the first of many to display an influence of the French on technique and form, yet it's ideology really set off much more debate and controversy than did it's style. As J. Hoberman points out in his book The Dream Life, Historical context overdetermined the movie's reception. He's not talking about the issue of fictionalizing or romanticizing history in the film itself, although there are certainly problems in doing such, but the historical context of American society within which the film was released. Looking at the film today without having personally been alive in the sixties makes my reaction to it much different, considering that I am not embodying a the same sense of zeitgeist that I would have if my contemporary settings were the same. Obviously, there is the task of historicizing the work in an attempt to not only understand it better, but also the reaction that was had to it. I can imagine what it would be like to have seen this movie when it was first released, but there are of course limits to that also. Nevertheless, there are themes in the movie that still exist today, and perhaps approach a certain level of universality in recent American society. The generational gap, of course much newer and more self-conscious in the 1960's but still present today, can be identified with still, or the polarized worlds of domesticity and constant traveling on the road. The test of time is certainly an interesting topic, and really begs questions pertaining to the politics of aesthetics. Bonnie and Clyde was different from classic Hollywood cinema because it broke from stylistic frameworks and the supposed invisible cinematic style. The opening scene is obviously stylized, with the close ups on the lips and the unconventional framing shots or lack of exposition. The most obvious scene that employs stylistic effects such as the filter, slow motion and disjointed cuts is the picnic scene with the families. Similar to the way that Brecht employed alienation effects in his plays, the effect that these overly stylized forms of editing and filming change the dynamics of viewing the film. The consciousness of the viewers is no longer assumed to be usurped by the film itself and distance is created between the film and the audience. The audience is more conscious of the film existing apart from reality, and more conscious of being in the act of watching a movie that does not completely represent reality. This is really a liberating thing for a filmmaker because he or she could theoretically wash his or her hands of any undesirable effects that the content might have. The fact that movie goers, especially at the time of its release, were not use to this type of viewing experience might make the issue not quite so clean, but it is an argument in favor of this type of film. The issue of violence, for example, is what caused much of the controversy over the film. If the main critique is that the identification of movie goers with Bonnie and Clyde will cause a romantification of violence and its subsequent proliferation against authority, then the critic misses the artistic quality of the film. There is an art of creating a film that has narrative, but has enough auteristic style so as to present the narrative in a way that will be less likely to result in a subconscious identification with the characters and an embodiment of their ideology. As Hoberman said, the film was really granted much more ideological ramifications than most likely intended to because of the historical context within which it was released.
