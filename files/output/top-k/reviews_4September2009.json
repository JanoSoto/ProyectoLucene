Gregory Peck dominates this realistic film as Brigadier General Frank Savage. He has the onerous task of whipping a demoralized squadron of B-17 Flying Fortress crews into shape after they lose their beloved leader. Scenarists Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr., who flew bombing missions during World War II, adapted their novel for the screen and it qualifies as 'a maximum effort' by everybody, with Dean Jagger and Hugh Marlowe taking top honors behind Peck. Indeed, Jagger received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.The strength of this film lies in its persuasive performances by a top-flight cast, King's taut helming, and four-time Oscar winning Leon Shamroy's gripping black & white cinematography. Just to give you an idea how highly his peers thought of Shamroy, they nominated Shamroy fourteen times for the Best Photography Oscar and he received two nominations in the same year for Cleopatra and The Cardinal. Cleopatra clinched Shamroy the Oscar in 1963. Anyway, this war film keeps its heels firmly planted at attention on the tarmac and doesn't physically take off with aerial footage until its last half-hour. Incredibly, King stages everything with such verve on the ground that you don't realize that they haven't gone aloft until they do.The 918th Bomb Group has run into tough times. The group is making horrendous mistakes and its commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), does his best to cover for them. The commanding general, General Pritchard (Millard Mitchell of Thieves' Highway) decides to relieve Davenport and replace him with General Savage. The chief reasons for Davenport's dismissal is he keeps an eye on his men like a vigilant mother, flies every crucial mission with them, and the strain of overidentifying with them has interfered with their efficiency. Savage is a likable enough guy until he climbs out of his staff car moments before it rolls into the 918th base. He has been riding up with his sergeant chauffeur and apparently doesn't pull rank until he finishes his cigarette, climbs into the backseat and lets his sergeant wheel him onto the premises. Savage chews out the base M.P. and orders him to scrutinize everybody, even the highest ranking generals before he allows them on base. Once Savage has arrived, he cannot find any of the commanding officers. One of the arguments that led to having Savage step into Davenport's shoes concerned a navigator, Lieutenant Zimmerman (Lee MacGregor), who committed suicide when he was relieved of duty after Davenport was sacked for incompetence.Meanwhile, Savage learns that it isn't going to be a picnic rebuilding morale. The 918th group pilots and crews worshipped Davenport, so Savage pours on the pressure enough that he earns the sobriquet Irontail. He doesn't cut them any slack and makes the men fly practice missions to improve their skills. He relieves Lieutenant Colonel Gately (Hugh Marlowe of Desperate Siege) and accuses him of cowardice for abandoning his post as camp commander and getting drunk after Zimmerman killed himself. Savage forces Gately to paint the name 'Leper Colony' on his B-17 and every member of the crew will be those fliers who screw up. Savage requires that Gately fly every mission. The blood really turns bad when Savage learns that everybody in the group has put in transfer papers. Savage's older adjutant Major Stovall (Dean Jagger of Bad Day at Black Rock) arranges it so that it takes a long time for their papers to make it through the proper channels, thus giving Savage a chance to win the men over to his brand of command.Twelve O'Clock High in some ways resembles a sports movie where a new coach must win the trust and respects of his team before he can lead them to victory. Along the way, the coach has to lay down the law with his men to develop discipline. Bartlett and Lay have done a grand job of having our hero blow in out of nowhere, read everybody the riot act, and then challenge them to accomplish more than they imagined. The only signs of sentimentality that descend come near the end with Savage's breakdown. King and his scenarists manage to pull it off, but they come narrowly close to blowing it. Interestingly, Bartlett has the distinction of flying as the bombardier in the lead plane on the first bombing mission over Berlin in March of 1942. Moreover, he was the first American to drop bombs on Berlin. Bartlett's co-scenarist Beirne Lay, Jr., flew bombing missions over Germany and was shot down in France where the French Resistance helped him escape.Twelve O'Clock High was a new breed of war film that could never have been made during World War II because it deals with the psychological friction among Americans as they rebel against one of their own and the protagonist's efforts to bring them around to his way of thinking even when he suffers a nervous breakdown. Gregory Peck is absolutely spellbinding as a martinet with a human side who must make miracles happen. Hugh Marlowe gives him a run for his money as the discredited Lieutenant Colonel Gately. Marlowe is simply terrific in a role that has every bit as much nuance as Peck's protagonist. Credit must also be given to the Allied photographers who lensed footage under actual combat conditions as well as Luftwaffe footage. King blends them almost seamlessly in with the movie mock-ups of the B-17 Flying Fortresses. Twelve 0'Clock High surpasses its closest competitor Command Descision as a better movie largely because it gets off the ground in his last half-hour.

He has the onerous task of whipping a demoralized squadron of B-17 Flying Fortress crews into shape after they lose their beloved leader. Scenarists Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr., who flew bombing missions during World War II, adapted their novel for the screen and it qualifies as 'a maximum effort' by everybody, with Dean Jagger and Hugh Marlowe taking top honors behind Peck. Indeed, Jagger received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.The strength of this film lies in its persuasive performances by a top-flight cast, King's taut helming, and four-time Oscar winning Leon Shamroy's gripping black & white cinematography. Just to give you an idea how highly his peers thought of Shamroy, they nominated Shamroy fourteen times for the Best Photography Oscar and he received two nominations in the same year for Cleopatra and The Cardinal. Cleopatra clinched Shamroy the Oscar in 1963. Anyway, this war film keeps its heels firmly planted at attention on the tarmac and doesn't physically take off with aerial footage until its last half-hour. Incredibly, King stages everything with such verve on the ground that you don't realize that they haven't gone aloft until they do.The 918th Bomb Group has run into tough times. The group is making horrendous mistakes and its commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), does his best to cover for them. The commanding general, General Pritchard (Millard Mitchell of Thieves' Highway) decides to relieve Davenport and replace him with General Savage. The chief reasons for Davenport's dismissal is he keeps an eye on his men like a vigilant mother, flies every crucial mission with them, and the strain of overidentifying with them has interfered with their efficiency. Savage is a likable enough guy until he climbs out of his staff car moments before it rolls into the 918th base. He has been riding up with his sergeant chauffeur and apparently doesn't pull rank until he finishes his cigarette, climbs into the backseat and lets his sergeant wheel him onto the premises. Savage chews out the base M.P. and orders him to scrutinize everybody, even the highest ranking generals before he allows them on base. Once Savage has arrived, he cannot find any of the commanding officers. One of the arguments that led to having Savage step into Davenport's shoes concerned a navigator, Lieutenant Zimmerman (Lee MacGregor), who committed suicide when he was relieved of duty after Davenport was sacked for incompetence.Meanwhile, Savage learns that it isn't going to be a picnic rebuilding morale. The 918th group pilots and crews worshipped Davenport, so Savage pours on the pressure enough that he earns the sobriquet Irontail. He doesn't cut them any slack and makes the men fly practice missions to improve their skills. He relieves Lieutenant Colonel Gately (Hugh Marlowe of Desperate Siege) and accuses him of cowardice for abandoning his post as camp commander and getting drunk after Zimmerman killed himself. Savage forces Gately to paint the name 'Leper Colony' on his B-17 and every member of the crew will be those fliers who screw up. Savage requires that Gately fly every mission. The blood really turns bad when Savage learns that everybody in the group has put in transfer papers. Savage's older adjutant Major Stovall (Dean Jagger of Bad Day at Black Rock) arranges it so that it takes a long time for their papers to make it through the proper channels, thus giving Savage a chance to win the men over to his brand of command.Twelve O'Clock High in some ways resembles a sports movie where a new coach must win the trust and respects of his team before he can lead them to victory. Along the way, the coach has to lay down the law with his men to develop discipline. Bartlett and Lay have done a grand job of having our hero blow in out of nowhere, read everybody the riot act, and then challenge them to accomplish more than they imagined. The only signs of sentimentality that descend come near the end with Savage's breakdown. King and his scenarists manage to pull it off, but they come narrowly close to blowing it. Interestingly, Bartlett has the distinction of flying as the bombardier in the lead plane on the first bombing mission over Berlin in March of 1942. Moreover, he was the first American to drop bombs on Berlin. Bartlett's co-scenarist Beirne Lay, Jr., flew bombing missions over Germany and was shot down in France where the French Resistance helped him escape.Twelve O'Clock High was a new breed of war film that could never have been made during World War II because it deals with the psychological friction among Americans as they rebel against one of their own and the protagonist's efforts to bring them around to his way of thinking even when he suffers a nervous breakdown. Gregory Peck is absolutely spellbinding as a martinet with a human side who must make miracles happen. Hugh Marlowe gives him a run for his money as the discredited Lieutenant Colonel Gately. Marlowe is simply terrific in a role that has every bit as much nuance as Peck's protagonist. Credit must also be given to the Allied photographers who lensed footage under actual combat conditions as well as Luftwaffe footage. King blends them almost seamlessly in with the movie mock-ups of the B-17 Flying Fortresses. Twelve 0'Clock High surpasses its closest competitor Command Descision as a better movie largely because it gets off the ground in his last half-hour.

Based on Booth Tarkington's novel, The Magnificent Ambersons tells of a wealthy family of which mother Isabel Amberson Minafer (Delores Costello) becomes reacquainted with Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) who has just started making a new invention called the horseless carriage or automobile. Her spoiled son George (Tim Holt) himself seems smitten with Morgan's daughter Lucy (Anne Baxter) who likes George enough but sees him as a little arrogant and not very ambitious. There's also an Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) who also likes Eugene. That's all I'll say of the story. Welles, as narrator, takes us through what importance the title family once had to their town before their decline. For the first hour, things seem to occur naturally before the obvious cuts come in the last 20 minutes. Despite that, I was mostly spellbound by what I saw until the last scene when something of an abrupt happy ending seemed tacked on. So obviously, this version of Orson Welles' second directorial feature isn't a complete masterpiece. Still, what I watched was compelling enough with fine performances from the main cast that I mentioned above.

These two handle their roles extremely well and the creepy atmosphere of the story makes you believe you're in for a good Stephen King thriller about a small town about to be devastated by vampires seeking nourishment.There's even a pretty girl (MADCHEN AMICK) who flirts with the new boy in town, first at the movie theater where she works and then at high school--and these three characters carry the first part of the film nicely. You start to wonder whether the girl is going to be an easy victim of the mother and son team or whether she'll fight them off.But as the plot thickens, so does the absurdity of the whole thing, all directed in comic book style so that none of the characters have any dimension beyond being puppets in a horror story that is so grotesque and over-the-top, particularly in the last half-hour, that you'll wonder whether a sane hand had any part in these proceedings. All of the business involving a menagerie of cats that sit on the couple's front lawn becomes laughable before the story uses them in a way that lacks any credibility at all.To be fair, there are some scenes that do hold the interest, usually because a quirky supporting character, such as the black cop with his trusty traveling companion Clovis (a cat), provides some much needed humor--but those moments are few and far between. And any attempt to provide humor by having Stephen King play an obnoxious local man seeking help from a sheriff, fails utterly to do anything but convince the viewer that King should leave bit roles to professionals.Whatever potential it had as a thriller is diminished by the outlandish ending which has Alice Krige losing her marbles completely. She hasn't had an eerier role since she played the girl who came back to life to haunt men in GHOST STORY ('82). But as good as she is, she can't save a trashy horror film from looking absurd.

Haunted by his traumatizing experience heading up a combat motion picture unit during World War II, Stevens made far more sober, serious-minded films afterward that focused on the plights of society's outsiders. This time, the outsider is primarily the eponymous gunman, but that sense of personal isolation is felt one way or another by every principal character in the film. Written by A.B. Guthrie Jr. and inspired by the infamous Johnson County War (which also inspired Michael Cimino's infamous disaster, Heaven's Gate), the story unwinds slowly as a reformed gunslinger stumbles upon a resolute conflict between peace-loving sodbusters and threatening cattle ranchers in 1870's Wyoming. Tensions escalate when Shane's bloody past comes back to haunt him as he defends the homesteaders, in particular, the Starrett family.Shane becomes close to the family, especially the young son Joey who worships him as the hero figure that his father cannot seem to be. Complicating matters is corrupt cattle baron Rufus Ryker, who wants to rid the valley of the farming families to allow his cattle to roam free. When Ryder recruits a ruthless outlaw named Jack Wilson to instill fear into the farmers, it forces a showdown with the inevitable consequences. For a western, there is one major fist fight and surprisingly little gunplay; however, the impact of those events has strict dramatic purpose and brings a pervasive sense of mortality to this oft-told story. Character actor Van Heflin (Airport) is often overlooked in reviews of this picture, yet he effectively provides the film's sometimes precarious backbone as Joe Starrett, the moral compass for the homesteaders. In her last big-screen role, Jean Arthur brings a subtle poignancy with only a hint of her past scintillating charm as his wife Marian. Stevens coaxed the 51-year-old Arthur to make the film after a five-year absence from the screen, and she slips easily into the painterly backdrop emerging almost fleetingly as a conflicted woman with an unspoken affection for Shane.Much more demonstrative in his love for the gunslinger is ten-year-old Brandon De Wilde, who gives an indelibly memorable performance as Joey. In one of his earliest roles, Jack Palance barely has any dialogue or screen time for that matter, but he makes every menacing moment count as Wilson. Nevertheless, it is the underrated Alan Ladd (This Gun for Hire) who brings the picture together with a superbly rendered performance in the taciturn title role.

In her last big-screen role, Jean Arthur brings a subtle poignancy with only a hint of her past scintillating charm as his wife Marian. Stevens coaxed the 51-year-old Arthur to make the film after a five-year absence from the screen, and she slips easily into the painterly backdrop emerging almost fleetingly as a conflicted woman with an unspoken affection for Shane.Much more demonstrative in his love for the gunslinger is ten-year-old Brandon De Wilde, who gives an indelibly memorable performance as Joey. In one of his earliest roles, Jack Palance barely has any dialogue or screen time for that matter, but he makes every menacing moment count as Wilson. Nevertheless, it is the underrated Alan Ladd (This Gun for Hire) who brings the picture together with a superbly rendered performance in the taciturn title role. Known unfairly for his misperceived diminutive stature (he was actually 5'6), the actor vividly captures Shane's sense of honor and remorse with a barely concealable fury. You will likely recognize Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show), Edgar Buchanan (Petticoat Junction), Ellen Corby (The Waltons), and Elisha Cook Jr. (The Maltese Falcon) in smaller parts. The 2000 DVD offers a pristine print transfer as well as an excellent commentary by the director's son George Stevens Jr. and the film's associate producer Ivan Moffat. A theatrical re-release trailer is also included on the DVD. If you haven't seen it, you should and on a big screen if possible.

Thelma & Louise might be far from a blood-pumping fugitive crime thriller, but action and excitement is not what this film hangs its hat on.Even director Ridley Scott, who directed probably the greatest suspense movie with a female lead of all time in Alien, recognizes that Thelma & Louise is relationship drama at its heart as two women discover themselves as they push each other over the edge.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as the titular characters, one a suppressed housewife and another a chain-smoking waitress who plan a weekend getaway together only to end up trying to get away from the authorities after Louise shoots a man at a bar who tried to rape Thelma. After deciding there's no way to come clean of their crime, they run for the Mexico border as authorities (led by Harvey Keitel) try and track them down.Davis and Sarandon are an incredible duo playing the most detailed of characters. Davis as Thelma is the best of the two as she takes Thelma through a complete transformation from warm, acquiescent housewife looking to let loose to a fully committed armed criminal. Sarandon plays Louise as a colder, self-assured type who learns that she really doesn't have it all together.

Disney has perfectly blended classic animation with computer animation. The computer animation enhances the classic animation with movement drawings couldn't do. In many scenes, Tarzan (child voiced by Alex D. Lintz; adult voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is sliding on large tree branches rapidly. In the classic animation style, they would not have been successful in following Tarzan through the trees as well as they could with computer animation due to the rapid movement.There are very few dark colors in the scenery. In fact, the only dark colors were used for the gorillas, shadowing and human hair. Most of the colors are light gray, lots of green (it is in a jungle) and other brighter colors.There are some pretty good performances in this film. However, none really stood out in my opinion. I was not that impressed with some supporting characters, as they had little screen time and thus had no time to develop. Rosie O'Donnell was a delight as Terk, who was Tarzan's best gorilla friend.If you ask me, they really missed the mark to make a memorable villain in this film. They had two chances, but killed one, and just did a horrible job making a human villain.As for music, which Disney is known for, there isn't a lot performed on screen by characters like in previous movies. In fact, characters burst into two songs. The rest of the soundtrack is done mainly by Grammy and Academy Award-winning Phil Collins. The songs by Collins is easily a lot more memorable than the rest of the musical score. In fact, all I really can remember is Collins songs. However, the Collins songs, which he wrote and performed, is not as memorable as some of the classic songs Disney is known for. Therefore, if you hear the songs by Collins, you won't be catching yourself singing these tunes, nor will you think of the movie when you hear the songs. The songs did fit well into scenes though.The movie is well paced, however I did think the story was really rushed due to the 89 minute length of the film. They really rushed the part where Jane (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the team she was with tried to bring Tarzan back to civilization with some of the animal characters as prizes. They also did a pretty good job with the famed relationship between Jane and Tarzan. If this movie was a little longer, they really could have worked on many scenes, character development and the relationships between the characters.

For once, they didn't just remake the same movie, which is a common problem with most sequels, but they took it into a completely different -genre-. Whereas the first movie was an artfully realized cross between a haunted house movie and a monster tale, Aliens is a balls-to-the-wall science fiction action flick. This decision to take the story of the previous movie and transfer it into a completely new realm is what makes the story work as brilliantly as it does. There's also the satisfying feeling you get knowing that the people behind this picture genuinely cared about crafting a good movie, and not just making money (a common problem with most sequels).The story picks up half a decade after the events of the first movie, when a deep salvage team stumbles across Lt. Ripley floating out in space, still in a deep hyper-sleep (which apparently keeps the subject from aging, it seems). She is rescued only to tell her story to a group of disbelieving suits that represent the company she once worked for, who promptly dismiss her claims that there are dangerous aliens roaming around on planet LV-426. They're soon proved wrong, however, when the company loses contact with a colony of civilians now living on the planet to help stabilize the atmosphere.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 September 2009","score":"","review":" Films like this are ten a penny, but not many can boast the kind of cast this one can. Renee Zellweger plays an ambitious journalist who, under pressure from her college professor father (William Hurt), finds herself having to juggle her career while nursing her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep). Zellweger's character initially feels she is living under her brilliant father's shadow and considers her mother to be shallow, and looks down upon her community activities with her like-minded middle-aged friends. Of course these attitudes are destined to change. Forced to care for her mother Zellweger founds herself effectively forced to live her mother's life, accompanying her on her Good Samaritan duties at first until the unspecified cancer develops and she must assume all domestic duties.Although, as I wrote earlier, the story isn't particularly original, the study of these three main characters &#x96; the fourth family member, Zellweger's younger brother, is pretty much shunted to the sidelines &#x96; is quite well written. We learn about Zellweger's parents as she does mother has hidden depths the daughter never suspected, while the father she has for so long tried to emulate reveals a hidden shallowness that opens her eyes to the misconceptions under which she has laboured. The only thing that bothered me about the script was its occasional tendency to make its point in the most obvious ways Hurt asks Zellweger to write an introduction for his forthcoming book of essays then immediately asks her to wash his shirts, for example; on another occasion, when Zellweger tells her doctor her mother doesn't need a nurse because her mother can confide in her the doctor pointedly asks 'Can she?' Considering the number of subtle ways in which the script succeeds in other respects, these weaknesses are both surprising and obvious.It's probably the father's character that undergoes the biggest test, mainly because he attempts to carry on his life as normal while his wife is dying and the mental pressures these place upon him are too immense to conceal for any length of time. Forced to face up to the reality of the situation the script allows us to believe that he has become a better person, able to accept his limitations. William Hurt gives a typically accomplished performance in the role, as does Meryl Streep as the mother. While the film is told from Zellweger's viewpoint, it's these two who get all the best scenes The film does tend to become a series of emotional speeches and set-pieces in the final couple of reels, with each character going through their own revelatory moment. The parents learn from the child (and from each other) as the child has learned from the parents, and the dignity of life, however shallow or bedevilled by secret doubts it might be, is reinforced. If you're one of those people who blubs easily at films make sure you have a box of man-size tissues close to hand because you're going to need them, and even if you pride yourself on remaining dry-eyed during scenes of high emotion be prepared to swallow the lump in your throat every now and then.

I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.The dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard. Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.And the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part? Overall, terrible. You may like it, and I have no problem if you do, but as a die hard fantasy fan, I hated it.
