Haley Joel Osment is obviously everyone's favorite child actor of the past five or six years, and he does a remarkable job here, although his character growth is almost nil (more on that later, and it's not his fault).  Jude Law plays the charming Gigolo Joe, a pleasure Mecha who stumbles into trouble at a murder scene and by hooking up with David (Osment).  Frances O'Connor is also very compelling as Monica, David's 'mommy', who abandons him in the woods after David unintentionally almost causes the death of her natural son.  Even William Hurt, who I think is overrated, does a very nice job here.However ... this movie shares David's problem it has no real soul, only glurgy, false emotions that make you want to believe it does.  First, for a science fiction movie, it gets science appallingly wrong.  The setup for the movie is that global warming has caused the polar caps to melt, lifting sea levels to the point where the great coastal cities are submerged.  OK, fine, it's a premise, although not a particularly plausible one if you get your science from other sources than Susan Sarandon.  However, at the end of the second hour, we're told that the oceans freeze in what must be the Earth's worst ever Ice Age!  How in the world (pardon the pun!) do you get from being so hot that the polar caps melt, to an Ice Age of monstrous proportions, IN 2000 YEARS???  Global changes take eons to develop, and while global warming might only take a couple of centuries -- maybe -- global freezing would take hundreds of thousands of years, probably millions.  Earth has had Ice Ages in its past, but not to the point of extinguishing all life, and humans (as a group) would be expected to migrate to habitable areas, not simply freeze to death like deer in the headlights.Second, as other reviewers have pointed out, the climactic scene, after two-and-a-quarter hours, is where Monica is reconstituted from a lock of hair clipped from Monica's head while David was living with her.  There is a completely laughable explanation from an alien explaining how her memories will be reconstituted along with her, but that's not the real problem -- the real problem is that hair DOES NOT CONTAIN DNA.  Only the hair ROOT has DNA.  Hair is simply a protein (and so are fingernails, the other substance suggested by the alien).  And here's another thing if all they need is DNA, then they certainly should find abundant samples of it for humans, although not necessarily a specific individual ... all you need is a body, and every cemetery has lots of those.  They could 'meet' as many humans as they desired, and wouldn't that have been a switch -- having them reanimate humans as if they were robots, and David helping them to control the experiment?Instead, through the bad elementary science, we are given a Pinocchio story that cannot possibly end well.  David travels the world looking for the Blue Fairy that will make him into a Real Boy, and Osment makes this quest heartbreaking, to be sure.  After barely escaping a Flesh Fair (sort of a Disney version of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome) where Mechas are destroyed, he goes with Gigolo Joe to Rouge City to see Dr. Know, a Mecha encyclopedia of knowledge (Robin Williams), who directs him to a submerged Manhattan.  Eventually he meets his maker, Dr. Hobby, and discovers that he is not unique -- he chances upon assembly lines of Davids waiting to be sold to childless couples.  David, who was made in the image of Hobby's dead son, does not take well to this; he destroys another David-bot who wanted to be his friend, and Dr. Hobby seems peculiarly unconcerned with David's feelings.  At this stage, we would expect an intelligent character to have made some self-discoveries, such as* I am not a human being, but a machine * I am not a unique machine, but the first prototype of a mass production model * Humans will never love me like one of their own, or even like Mecha Teddy, because I am a threat (just like the other David was to him)And we think this is what happens, too, because David tries to drown himself, although he is saved by Gigolo Joe.  But David sees the Blue Fairy at Coney Island, and winds up trapped there, praying for centuries for her to make him a real boy, even though at this point it would kill him.  Then the world freezes and it's 2000 years before aliens free him up.  Aliens, I might add, with television screens for heads.Pardon me, and my long explanation, but this movie is empty of soul and purpose, although it's full of Spielberg quirks absent\/uncaring father, abandonment and\/or loneliness in childhood, overdeveloped fantasy world, yearning for parent's love, robots, cuddly toys, and of course aliens.  When the aliens first appeared, my wife said, They even threw in the kitchen sink, didn't they?  Yes they did, and the ending was simply another throw-in, although Osment and O'Connor made it seem magical and heartbreaking.  This is episodic moviemaking, where things happen only because they happen and little reason is provided for the viewer to care much.I give this soggy mess a 6, because the acting was top-drawer and the cinematography was excellent.  The script, however, is a huge disappointment.  (See Minority Report for a much better futuristic Spielberg movie.)

As a matter of fact, this movie was made to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's film. Still, in the long run, this is actually one of the better 1980's slashers. Although it adheres to the traditional formula, it holds up better than much of the subgenre, including some of its own sequels. While the plot may be a bit thin, it does have a certain eerie, gritty atmosphere generally lacking in many other slashers. This is due in no small part to Sean S. Cunningham's effective lensing; in fact this may be the best-directed entry in the series. It did have a pretty low budget, but that rarely hurts the film; its dark, shadowy look lends it a creepy feeling a more polished film may have lacked. The use of point-of-view shots is copied from Halloween, but its put to good use as the killer stalks the young cast; it is thankfully not overdone. The legendary Chi Chi score comes into use for the first time; it may have grown redundant as the series proceeded, but it works like a charm here.One refreshing aspect of the film is that the teenage characters are not nearly as irritating or obnoxious as most of their counterparts in later entries. We are invited to identify with them and sympathize with their plight, as they fail to realize that a killer is in their midst. Some of the murders are fairly memorable, especially the part where a character gets an arrow in the throat. Said character is played by a pre-fame Kevin Bacon, perhaps the most interesting bit of casting in the series. Betsy Palmer gives an over-the-top performance as the legendary Jason Voorhees' psycho mother, seeking vengeance for the drowning (more on that in a moment) of her son years earlier. It's very unsubtle, but it works in the context of this movie. Her death scene is as gratuitous and crude as they come, but it's a logical conclusion for a slasher. Oddly enough, Friday the 13th wasn't intended with sequels in mind--at least I think that is what the writer said at one point. Still, the ending, with Jason's spirit haunting the lone survivor of the massacre does allow for that possibility. It's still a pretty eerie scene. Of course, the very next film would contradict this, saying that Jason has been living in hiding for many years. Later on, they would take even more liberties with the character's parameters, to the consternation of some purists. These type of films are not renowned for their sense of continuity in any case, so let us not dwell upon this further.

As a matter of fact, this movie was made to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's film. Still, in the long run, this is actually one of the better 1980's slashers. Although it adheres to the traditional formula, it holds up better than much of the subgenre, including some of its own sequels. While the plot may be a bit thin, it does have a certain eerie, gritty atmosphere generally lacking in many other slashers. This is due in no small part to Sean S. Cunningham's effective lensing; in fact this may be the best-directed entry in the series. It did have a pretty low budget, but that rarely hurts the film; its dark, shadowy look lends it a creepy feeling a more polished film may have lacked. The use of point-of-view shots is copied from Halloween, but its put to good use as the killer stalks the young cast; it is thankfully not overdone. The legendary Chi Chi score comes into use for the first time; it may have grown redundant as the series proceeded, but it works like a charm here.One refreshing aspect of the film is that the teenage characters are not nearly as irritating or obnoxious as most of their counterparts in later entries. We are invited to identify with them and sympathize with their plight, as they fail to realize that a killer is in their midst. Some of the murders are fairly memorable, especially the part where a character gets an arrow in the throat. Said character is played by a pre-fame Kevin Bacon, perhaps the most interesting bit of casting in the series. Betsy Palmer gives an over-the-top performance as the legendary Jason Voorhees' psycho mother, seeking vengeance for the drowning (more on that in a moment) of her son years earlier. It's very unsubtle, but it works in the context of this movie. Her death scene is as gratuitous and crude as they come, but it's a logical conclusion for a slasher. Oddly enough, Friday the 13th wasn't intended with sequels in mind--at least I think that is what the writer said at one point. Still, the ending, with Jason's spirit haunting the lone survivor of the massacre does allow for that possibility. It's still a pretty eerie scene. Of course, the very next film would contradict this, saying that Jason has been living in hiding for many years. Later on, they would take even more liberties with the character's parameters, to the consternation of some purists. These type of films are not renowned for their sense of continuity in any case, so let us not dwell upon this further.

Then when it was released on DVD  it was hammered by fans of the original three Star Wars adventures, but I think we all know why that is. Most of the rabid fans saw Star Wars as youths and as they grew older, they held on to the magic of the movies. This is great, I think and I like the original films too, but when The Phantom Menace rolled around, these fans were no longer youths, but adults instead. Just as the original films were aimed at a younger audience, so is The Phantom Menace and as such, the grown up fans were displeased. Yes, this is a silly, wild ride through the Star Wars realm, with annoying characters and tons of merchandising potential. But come on, so were the original three movies and while an argument could be made for Empire, A New Hope and Return of the Jedi are clearly aimed toward the younger folks. And while the fans ignore the countless plot holes and annoying characters in the original trilogy, they lambaste The Phantom Menace, simply because it wasn't how they remembered Star Wars to be, what a joke. This installment has some classic scenes and some bad ones, just like the original films, period.Also this film seamlessly merged animation and live action, and  ought to be considered one of the most important, dazzling, ground-breaking movies ever made. This 1999 production, which brought director George Lucas out of a quasi retirement, revealed that some of his skills had rusted, particularly his feel for dialog and his feel for casting. His subsequent shepherding of that dialog through that cast leaves much to be desired . . Then you have the introductory nature of the story itself and the political stuff. This slower pacing turned off people expecting a major epic like stuff found in the Galactic Civil War that was chronicled in Episodes IV, V, and VI. Also, a lot of the time the movie seems disjointed. You go from fast action to long periods of slow scenes before getting back into anything else.On a positive note  this  is a  perfect example of what a DVD film can and should be, the new 2-disc Fox release of the 4th Star Wars film (though it is the first episode of the epic story) is impressive indeed. Well, this isn't the same Phantom Menace you saw in the theater. Including about three minutes of new footage, this transfer has been struck from the same high-definition master created for the video and broadcast releases over a year ago, albeit with the new additions. The 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sound, which has EX enhancements, whips up the film's excitements at every turn. The bass is aggressive, the surround effects are distinctive and plentiful, and the film's sound mix is as creative and pervasive as its special effects. Presented in 2.351 anamorphic widescreen, and THX-certified to boot, Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace boasts a generally stunning, though not quite perfect transfer.Another way to look at this movie is that on it's own, for non-or casual Star Wars fans it's a rather cruddy movie with one or two cool sequences. As for regular Star Wars fans, they  see the movie as the introductory chapter of a six-chapter book that is just meant to show where the major players come from and set up the next two chapters in the prequel trilogy.  Again, the movie is just the beginning and some people weren't expecting that. Personally seeing how Palpatine rose to power is kind of cool, but for non-fans it's a bore.*************spoiler alert*************************** Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his young Padawan learner Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have been sent to settle the dispute, but things don't quite go as planned. This opening scene is one of the first things that caused people to question the continuity of the prequel. Obi-Wan told Luke that Yoda trained him, but the first time you see him in Episode I, he is with Qui-Gon. Young Ben mentions in this scene that Yoda tells him to be mindful of the future, and in the audio commentary George Lucas explains that a Jedi would be trained in the temple (where Yoda is) until about eight or nine and then he will become a padawan to a Jedi Knight. So all is well so far in the continuity department.As the negotiations go sour, the two Jedi sneak onto a droid army invasion force landing craft and go down to Naboo where Qui-Gon runs into the completely CGI created character Jar Jar Binks . Ok, Jar Jar. As with almost everyone else I cringed when he first opened his mouth, and yes I do think that he is too much of a clumsy presence in the movie and is way overdone. The Pod Race sequence as it was in the original version was a ride that many thought was worth the price of admission alone. From the incredible sound featuring specific engine sounds for each pod, to the ultra fast CGI effects, the race was very fun.Before that happens, the dreaded Midichlorian explanation rears its ugly head. So instead of being just an energy field that binds the galaxy together that some people are able to sense, the Force is drawn to people by microscopic life forms called Midichlorians. This revelation p***ed off fans even more than Jar Jar (if that is possible...) and it looks like it isn't going anywhere. In the audio commentary Lucas addresses the Midichlorians and basically says that he always wanted to explain why some people could use the Force and others couldn't and the Midichorians were the way. That doesn't help the matter as it changed one of the central things of the Star Wars Mythos and that along with Jar Jar are the two gaping wounds on the movie for me.Obviously the best one of the four scenes is the dual. It's exactly what people were expecting in a new Star Wars movie and it is my absolute favorite scene in the movie. You have two Jedi from the time when the Jedi were in their prime fighting off an expertly trained Sith Lord. It's the ultimate Star Wars fanboy scene.On the other hand, the Gungan battle with the Battle Droids is the ultimate Jar Jar haters' nightmare as it is basically nothing but Jar Jar accidentally killing a bunch of droids. It is a great effects scene as it is pretty much 100% CGI, but still. By the time you get to this scene in the movie, you are absolutely sick of Jar Jar and you just want him to go away.The same thing could almost be said about the space battle as Anakin accidentally crash lands inside the Droid Control Ship and then accidentally fires off two torpedoes into the main reactor to blow it up. Sure, Anakin is a great pilot, and yes the Force is extremely strong with him, but that all is just a little two convenient even for a fully trained Jedi Knight much less an eight year old boy.In the final analysis The Phantom Menace is a fun, but brisk and light romp, one that the entire family can take time and again. This two disc edition from Fox is more than up to task, so if you're at all interested, The Phantom Menace is recommended.even though it's the worst of the four current movies but still very enjoyable  Also both the Star Wars fan and DVD fan in me were not disappointed. The disc has plenty of great extras and an absolutely fantastic presentation that fits with the theme of the movie perfectly. I gave it an 8\/10.

Personally seeing how Palpatine rose to power is kind of cool, but for non-fans it's a bore.*************spoiler alert*************************** Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his young Padawan learner Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have been sent to settle the dispute, but things don't quite go as planned. This opening scene is one of the first things that caused people to question the continuity of the prequel. Obi-Wan told Luke that Yoda trained him, but the first time you see him in Episode I, he is with Qui-Gon. Young Ben mentions in this scene that Yoda tells him to be mindful of the future, and in the audio commentary George Lucas explains that a Jedi would be trained in the temple (where Yoda is) until about eight or nine and then he will become a padawan to a Jedi Knight. So all is well so far in the continuity department.As the negotiations go sour, the two Jedi sneak onto a droid army invasion force landing craft and go down to Naboo where Qui-Gon runs into the completely CGI created character Jar Jar Binks . Ok, Jar Jar. As with almost everyone else I cringed when he first opened his mouth, and yes I do think that he is too much of a clumsy presence in the movie and is way overdone. The Pod Race sequence as it was in the original version was a ride that many thought was worth the price of admission alone. From the incredible sound featuring specific engine sounds for each pod, to the ultra fast CGI effects, the race was very fun.Before that happens, the dreaded Midichlorian explanation rears its ugly head. So instead of being just an energy field that binds the galaxy together that some people are able to sense, the Force is drawn to people by microscopic life forms called Midichlorians. This revelation p***ed off fans even more than Jar Jar (if that is possible...) and it looks like it isn't going anywhere. In the audio commentary Lucas addresses the Midichlorians and basically says that he always wanted to explain why some people could use the Force and others couldn't and the Midichorians were the way. That doesn't help the matter as it changed one of the central things of the Star Wars Mythos and that along with Jar Jar are the two gaping wounds on the movie for me.Obviously the best one of the four scenes is the dual. It's exactly what people were expecting in a new Star Wars movie and it is my absolute favorite scene in the movie. You have two Jedi from the time when the Jedi were in their prime fighting off an expertly trained Sith Lord. It's the ultimate Star Wars fanboy scene.On the other hand, the Gungan battle with the Battle Droids is the ultimate Jar Jar haters' nightmare as it is basically nothing but Jar Jar accidentally killing a bunch of droids. It is a great effects scene as it is pretty much 100% CGI, but still. By the time you get to this scene in the movie, you are absolutely sick of Jar Jar and you just want him to go away.The same thing could almost be said about the space battle as Anakin accidentally crash lands inside the Droid Control Ship and then accidentally fires off two torpedoes into the main reactor to blow it up. Sure, Anakin is a great pilot, and yes the Force is extremely strong with him, but that all is just a little two convenient even for a fully trained Jedi Knight much less an eight year old boy.In the final analysis The Phantom Menace is a fun, but brisk and light romp, one that the entire family can take time and again. This two disc edition from Fox is more than up to task, so if you're at all interested, The Phantom Menace is recommended.even though it's the worst of the four current movies but still very enjoyable  Also both the Star Wars fan and DVD fan in me were not disappointed. The disc has plenty of great extras and an absolutely fantastic presentation that fits with the theme of the movie perfectly. I gave it an 8\/10.

Then when it was released on DVD  it was hammered by fans of the original three Star Wars adventures, but I think we all know why that is. Most of the rabid fans saw Star Wars as youths and as they grew older, they held on to the magic of the movies. This is great, I think and I like the original films too, but when The Phantom Menace rolled around, these fans were no longer youths, but adults instead. Just as the original films were aimed at a younger audience, so is The Phantom Menace and as such, the grown up fans were displeased. Yes, this is a silly, wild ride through the Star Wars realm, with annoying characters and tons of merchandising potential. But come on, so were the original three movies and while an argument could be made for Empire, A New Hope and Return of the Jedi are clearly aimed toward the younger folks. And while the fans ignore the countless plot holes and annoying characters in the original trilogy, they lambaste The Phantom Menace, simply because it wasn't how they remembered Star Wars to be, what a joke. This installment has some classic scenes and some bad ones, just like the original films, period.Also this film seamlessly merged animation and live action, and  ought to be considered one of the most important, dazzling, ground-breaking movies ever made. This 1999 production, which brought director George Lucas out of a quasi retirement, revealed that some of his skills had rusted, particularly his feel for dialog and his feel for casting. His subsequent shepherding of that dialog through that cast leaves much to be desired . . Then you have the introductory nature of the story itself and the political stuff. This slower pacing turned off people expecting a major epic like stuff found in the Galactic Civil War that was chronicled in Episodes IV, V, and VI. Also, a lot of the time the movie seems disjointed. You go from fast action to long periods of slow scenes before getting back into anything else.On a positive note  this  is a  perfect example of what a DVD film can and should be, the new 2-disc Fox release of the 4th Star Wars film (though it is the first episode of the epic story) is impressive indeed. Well, this isn't the same Phantom Menace you saw in the theater. Including about three minutes of new footage, this transfer has been struck from the same high-definition master created for the video and broadcast releases over a year ago, albeit with the new additions. The 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sound, which has EX enhancements, whips up the film's excitements at every turn. The bass is aggressive, the surround effects are distinctive and plentiful, and the film's sound mix is as creative and pervasive as its special effects. Presented in 2.351 anamorphic widescreen, and THX-certified to boot, Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace boasts a generally stunning, though not quite perfect transfer.Another way to look at this movie is that on it's own, for non-or casual Star Wars fans it's a rather cruddy movie with one or two cool sequences. As for regular Star Wars fans, they  see the movie as the introductory chapter of a six-chapter book that is just meant to show where the major players come from and set up the next two chapters in the prequel trilogy.

Not just because of its gross out humour, but also because it's frankness, realism, and outstanding direction, and acting. The characters in American Pie were not merely a bunch of kids trying to get laid, like in the Porkies movies.  The main idea behind the characters was that they were REALISTIC stereotypes. Kevin was struggling to know if he was in love and what would happen with his girlfriend.  Oz was falling in love and trying to be nice.  Finch was dealing with being a social reject.  And Jim was that awkward geek that most guys are.  The characters were real, they were depictions of everyone we knew at High School, played in human sense, rather than a film character sense. But where did American Pie 2 go wrong???  Suddenly the characters lost all their punch.  Due to bad direction, and poor script writing we see Oz and Heather in the film for about five minutes, delivering deadpan, and emotionless dialogue.  Their storyline of long distance love is something so many people can relate to and its uniqueness had the potential to go far - however it was merely shoved aside so that the audience could have an over abundance of Stifler. The characters in American Pie 2 are tacky, and stereotyped beyond comprehension.  While yes they were stereotypes in the original, they had their human aspects which made them differ, and made them unique.  Finch, for example, was a geek who scored with an older woman - every teenage boy's dream.  He was always an outcast, but seemed real.  In AP2, all of a sudden hes become this guy obsessed with Chinese Scripture, and other sorts of art. And he uses this to ultimately score again with 'Stifler's Mom'.  Stupid. Plain stupid. Stifler is another example.  While his chauvanism, and light hearted view of life was a much needed break from some of the serious rigors of AP, in AP2 he is suddenly the star, and the over abundance of him becomes infuriating, as he spouts second rate pick up lines, and inserts f**k into every second word of his sentence.  Once again, its just stupid and makes an unrealistic stereotype. And what about Jim's dad.  His awkwardness, and fumbling attempts at guiding Jim through his hormone charged adolesence, were hilarious, and touching in the first.  Now hes just some lame guy, who is more desperate for his son to get laid, than his son is. Rogers has taken some of the minor aspects of American Pie, and made them into Major aspects of the film in American Pie 2.  The Weitz brothers knew such aspects in large doses would not work, and their smaller dosage, secondary nature to story, and characters that actually mean something, is what makes American Pie gold.  Roger's direction is childish because it merely takes the trendiest, which is not neccesarily the best, and makes it predominant. The sequel should never have been made.  It takes away from the bittersweetness of the original's ending.  And if it had to be made, Rogers shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near the set, and the Weitz brothers should've been given whatever they wanted, so this could be a half decent film, and not merely an insult to the brilliant, and much underrated original. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Why would they bother?

Well, I could start by saying that, Baz does it right again! Part of Baz's talent is the fact that he can take some of the weirdest subjects in the world and make them into wonderful movies. WONDERFUL movies.Now I know that some critics did not like Moulin Rouge, or Romeo+Juliet, or Strictly Ballroom, but those are movies that you need to see twice before you like them. By the second time, the initial shock is gone.I'll admit, the first time I saw Moulin Rouge; I skipped right to the end when I heard Ewan McGregor say (in the first five minutes) that the woman he loved was dead. The second time I saw it, I watched the entire thing and was blown away. By the third time, I was hooked.Nicole Kidman, who I had never seen in a movie before this, has a wonderful voice, and I think that this movie, a fun, romantic, hilarious movie, must've been good for her considering her recent divorce from Tom Cruise. Her voice blow you away first during `Sparkling Diamonds' and then again during her solo `One Day I'll Fly Away' Though her death scene went on just a bit too long, her performance in this movie was astounding, and thank God the people at MTV have more sense than the Academy, considering she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Actress.Ewan McGregor, Good Lord Ewan McGregor. I had seen him in Star Wars before this, but I had never really known the depth of his acting. Once I saw Moulin Rouge, I was in love. Seriously. For a month, I seriously considered marrying him. That is, until I realized he was already married (that's always the catch isn't it?). I got over that though and I am currently on a mission to see every movie he's been in. Ewan, who really, really, looks good in this movie, can sing better than some of the hot stars now *cough-boy bands-cough-cough-rappers-cough*, makes me want to automatically skip to the `Your Song' scene, just so I can hear his solo.Speaking of, the music of this movie is so.out of this world that, at first glance, it's hard to even realize what it is. Suddenly, Dolly Parton and Elton John are being mixed. Old men in tuxedos are singing Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit'. Then Zidler and the Duke are singing `Like A Virgin' as though it's a Broadway number. And the mix is perfect. Don't even try messing with it.The best song is `Tango de Roxanne' which is a remake of the Sting song. No offense to Sting, but his version-well-sucked. This version is a mix of a tango and the original song. It starts out with the Narcoleptic Argentinean telling Christian `Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, it always ends BAD!' Then, he proceeds to sing the song, a haunting rendition, with thirty couples in the background doing the same steps. It truly is the perfect piece to go with the scene which is when *SPOILERS SPOILERS* the Duke realizes that Christian and Satine are in love and tries to rape her. Dark music for a dark scene. Take that people who said that they thought the movie was pointless!If you are a person who never watches a whole movie after twenty minutes, claiming that you disliked the first bit and the rest should be just as bad, stick with Moulin Rouge. Many think that the beginning was stupid and funny, and that the movie must have no worth. The first thirty minutes or so are funny, and needed, so just wait awhile for the seriousness to kick in.And it does get serious. When Christian and Satine are in love, they have to hide that from the overly jealous Duke. Satine has Consumption, and the only cure for that in 1899 was prayer. She had violent coughing fits that left her unconscious and spitting up blood. And the Duke has a violent, possessive temper that results him in ordering his manservant Warner to kill Christian.So it's not a happy movie. But it is. Ewan and Nicole have such great chemistry together that, when she dies you start yelling at the TV-if you have the strength, this death scene will make you cry for ten minutes straight-, `That's not the way it's supposed to end! Satine's supposed to become a great actress, and Christian is supposed to be a great author, and you're supposed to get married and have kids and be happy!' But maybe that's just me. When the two sing, it's like forget the outside world, these two are just too good together.So, go rent Moulin Rouge. It will be the best movie you've seen. I swear to you that it is.

Don't even try messing with it.The best song is `Tango de Roxanne' which is a remake of the Sting song. No offense to Sting, but his version-well-sucked. This version is a mix of a tango and the original song. It starts out with the Narcoleptic Argentinean telling Christian `Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, it always ends BAD!' Then, he proceeds to sing the song, a haunting rendition, with thirty couples in the background doing the same steps. It truly is the perfect piece to go with the scene which is when *SPOILERS SPOILERS* the Duke realizes that Christian and Satine are in love and tries to rape her. Dark music for a dark scene. Take that people who said that they thought the movie was pointless!If you are a person who never watches a whole movie after twenty minutes, claiming that you disliked the first bit and the rest should be just as bad, stick with Moulin Rouge. Many think that the beginning was stupid and funny, and that the movie must have no worth. The first thirty minutes or so are funny, and needed, so just wait awhile for the seriousness to kick in.And it does get serious. When Christian and Satine are in love, they have to hide that from the overly jealous Duke. Satine has Consumption, and the only cure for that in 1899 was prayer. She had violent coughing fits that left her unconscious and spitting up blood. And the Duke has a violent, possessive temper that results him in ordering his manservant Warner to kill Christian.So it's not a happy movie. But it is. Ewan and Nicole have such great chemistry together that, when she dies you start yelling at the TV-if you have the strength, this death scene will make you cry for ten minutes straight-, `That's not the way it's supposed to end! Satine's supposed to become a great actress, and Christian is supposed to be a great author, and you're supposed to get married and have kids and be happy!' But maybe that's just me. When the two sing, it's like forget the outside world, these two are just too good together.So, go rent Moulin Rouge. It will be the best movie you've seen. I swear to you that it is.

Well, I could start by saying that, Baz does it right again! Part of Baz's talent is the fact that he can take some of the weirdest subjects in the world and make them into wonderful movies. WONDERFUL movies.Now I know that some critics did not like Moulin Rouge, or Romeo+Juliet, or Strictly Ballroom, but those are movies that you need to see twice before you like them. By the second time, the initial shock is gone.I'll admit, the first time I saw Moulin Rouge; I skipped right to the end when I heard Ewan McGregor say (in the first five minutes) that the woman he loved was dead. The second time I saw it, I watched the entire thing and was blown away. By the third time, I was hooked.Nicole Kidman, who I had never seen in a movie before this, has a wonderful voice, and I think that this movie, a fun, romantic, hilarious movie, must've been good for her considering her recent divorce from Tom Cruise. Her voice blow you away first during `Sparkling Diamonds' and then again during her solo `One Day I'll Fly Away' Though her death scene went on just a bit too long, her performance in this movie was astounding, and thank God the people at MTV have more sense than the Academy, considering she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Actress.Ewan McGregor, Good Lord Ewan McGregor. I had seen him in Star Wars before this, but I had never really known the depth of his acting. Once I saw Moulin Rouge, I was in love. Seriously. For a month, I seriously considered marrying him. That is, until I realized he was already married (that's always the catch isn't it?). I got over that though and I am currently on a mission to see every movie he's been in. Ewan, who really, really, looks good in this movie, can sing better than some of the hot stars now *cough-boy bands-cough-cough-rappers-cough*, makes me want to automatically skip to the `Your Song' scene, just so I can hear his solo.Speaking of, the music of this movie is so.out of this world that, at first glance, it's hard to even realize what it is. Suddenly, Dolly Parton and Elton John are being mixed. Old men in tuxedos are singing Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit'.

German Uli Edel directed this and Desmond Nakano wrote the screenplay. Stephen Lang plays Harry Black, the leader of the strike unit and Jennifer Jason Leigh is Tralala, a lost soul who works as a hooker for the various soldiers and other drunken males that use the services of the hookers drinking beer and acting dirty. The film explores the forms of love and how desperate we are for it, because living without it is not too easy or even possible as it belongs to being a human being.The film opens with a line from the Bible which thickens the theme of the film and the above thing I wrote. Soon we get introduced to the main characters who don't seem to be too happy. Harry doesn't care about his wife and child but seems to be very attracted by a sensual and very attractive transvestite who lives with other transvestites in their own apartment while the straight prostitutes are mainly in the streets. This relationship between Harry and the transvestite(s) is very great and emotional and depicts the nature of love and caring as it doesn't always involve just different sexes together. Just watching Harry's eyes when he first sees his new interest in the street shows how powerful cinema can be without one single word.Another important character is of course Tralala and she is also involved in the film's harrowing and almost unbearably sadistic and ugly end scene that finally (or what happens after that) makes the film a very strong experience. She is completely lost even though she meets a nice sailor who truly falls in love with her even though Tralala doesn't understand it at once. She understands it during the end scene as well as the meaning of the crying boy she first gets to meet during the act. Last Exit to Brooklyn explores love and caring between human beings and how strong it can be. Tralala wouldn't survive without the motorcycle boy, or she would live the rest of her life in pure emptiness and void. The film handles also violence and weak human nature desperate for sex and other of his instincts. The violence is very harsh and off putting and the film's view of life is dark to say the least. Violence is here as unjustified and brutal as in real life, too, and maybe that's why so many seem to dislike the film and its honesty saying it is unpleasant and repellent. The sets are very impressive and the atmosphere in this film is all the time like the actors could any minute start singing and dancing their lines! This creates also a very strong feel of danger and clock ticking as the workers and strikers wait for the decision by the authorities and it is like it is night all the time. The film feels like a depiction of the world's last day that still may not be the last but no one knows it yet for sure.Equally great with the photography and sets is the music by Mark Knopfler. The beautiful theme is played during the film restrainedly and it makes the strong events and situations even stronger, as always a great soundtrack does. The very conclusion is pretty optimistic and again the music makes it look even brighter and hopeful. Some characters didn't manage to learn before it was too late, but at least those who did have a chance for a better tomorrow.The major negative sides in the film are in the occasional restlessness as the writer tried to give us more information than it was necessary. I mean mostly the scenes involving Burt Young character's family tragedy with all its screaming and shouting and crying. These scenes are not too powerful but more irritating as they could have been different. The characters' motivations are not always clear and sometimes they seem to develop too fast. What they tried to express through screaming and horrible noise should have been done more aesthetically and with the tools of the art and much more effectively.Last Exit to Brooklyn is a powerful, challenging and at the end, beautiful film about the most important and universal things in life and about humanity, and it is also a great film visually.

The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'  ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"14 December 2002","score":"10 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  If you don't like teen comedy\/drama films, then don't bother seeing this film, you're going to hate it.  There is nothing terribly original or spectacular about this film, compared to similar films, but it's still got some good stuff.  There really isn't a whole lot of comedy in the film, so I'd be much more inclined to classify this film as a teen drama, so don't watch this film expecting a hilarious movie.The cast is surprisingly good in the film.  Melissa Joan Hart does a great job in her first starring role and puts on a pretty good show for the most part.  She also looks very attractive throughout the film.  The other main character, Chase, played by Adrian Grenier is a new face to me, but does a good job with his role.  Ali Larter looks very nice in the film as well and does a fine job in her role.  Stephen Collins was another familiar face to me, and does a good job, although his role is rather minor.  Susan May Pratt caught my eye in 10 Things I Hate About You and pulls off another good job in this film as well.  Keri Lynn Pratt (I wonder if they're related) is another new face to me, but I will definitely keep my eyes open for her future work after seeing her in this film.  She is also quite easy on the eyes.  The rest of the cast did a good job as well.  Nothing to complain about in that respect.Most of the characters were actually rather interesting.  I really liked the characters of Ray and Dave, they both seemed like very likeable people and quite the underdogs (gotta root for the underdogs).  I also really liked that even the jocks in this film were not really made out to be idiots and jerks (of course one of them in particular was...Eddie).  The character, Brad, was the most important jock-character and he wasn't made out to be a bad person or unlikeable person at all, just a guy that Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) was head over heels for...and then wasn't.Another thing this film really had going for it was that it stayed away from all the gross-out, stupid comedy that is so abundant in most teen movies these days.  I can really appreciate a film that doesn't resort to that...sure sometime it's really funny, but most of the time it's just un-needed.If you are the kind of person that likes teen comedy\/drama films, then give this one a chance, you just might like it.  Other than that, I would recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere.  If you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.

Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some tough bugs to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family.  This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above it all to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than Antz, A Bug's Life does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.351 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound. Above all, this movie is visually stunning. STUNNING. It is amazing to watch. 9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Everything that was great about Toy Story, Pixar's first feature (and the first-ever all-computer animated movie), is even greater in A Bug's Life.
