All the characters are great, and the story while ridiculous was quite hilarious, plus Ben Stiller is simply amazing in this!. Stiller had a really funny accent, and Ben and his father Jerry obviously had a hoot working together, plus the only thing I didn't like about this film was Will Ferrell's performance it just wasn't funny in my opinion, plus Stiller and his real life wife Christine Taylor worked very well together surprisingly. It's very well made and written, and the fashion suits Stiller and Owen Wilson wore cracked me up, plus it has so many cool cameo's as well!. The walk off between Stiller and Owen Wilson was especially funny, and all the characters were extremely likable (except for Ferrell's), plus the ending was very silly but still quite funny. This should be higher then 6.1 in my opinion, and the the mining segment with Stiller and Voight was also quite funny, plus it has some really awesome gags in it too. This is a very funny film, that's really entertaining, a typical Ben Stiller Comedy, I absolutely loved it, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Ben Stiller does a great! job here with solid camera work, fine angles and just keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Ben Stiller is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely hilarious, had a cool wacky accent, obviously had a blast playing the part, had some wacky costumes, and had some really funny scenes with Owen Wilson,He is one of the best Comedy guys out there! (Stiller Rules!!!!!!!). Owen Wilson is really funny here, he works so well with Stiller, and was rather unlikable at 1st, but became really funny near the end, I loved him!. Christine Taylor is incredibly gorgeous and does excellent in her role here as the reporter,she played it straight, and had good chemistry with Stiller,I really liked her. Will Ferrell is OK but rather unfunny, for me sometimes he's on, but a lot of the time he's off, here he was off, as I actually didn't laugh at all, he just over does it. Milla Jovovich was OK, but was too serious for me to enjoy,she's good looking though. Jerry Stiller is hilarious in his role, he had some great scenes with Stiller. David Duchovny and Jon Voight are funny in there small roles. Donald Trump,Christian Slater,Cuba Gooding Jr.,Tommy Hilfiger,Natalie Portman,Fabio,Lenny Kravitz,Gwen Stefani,Heidi Klum,Paris Hilton,David Bowie,Fred Durst,Lance Bass,Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' ,Claudia Schiffer,Vince Vaughn,Billy Zane and Winona Ryder all do great in there Cameo's.

It is a buddy movie about two women, and it is one of the best road movies to ever grace the screen.Louise (Susan Sarandon) and Thelma (Gina Davis) are two friends who plan a road trip into the mountains for the weekend. Neither one of their lives seems exciting at the moment. Louise waits tables at the local diner and is also waiting on boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen)who is always traveling and seems destined to never settle down. Thelma is a sexually repressed housewife who lives at home with a self-important husband (Christopher McDonald) who doesn't seem to care much for her at all except when she is not fulfilling her house-wife duties like having diner made and the house cleaned.It is no wonder these two decide to take a trip for the weekend to the mountains to get away for awhile and have fun. Of course there is an event that happens not long after they have started their journey, and right after said event, things quickly spiral out of control as the two girls find themselves racing for Mexico with the law quickly on their heels.This movie could've been just another boring road picture, but both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon along with a fine script and clever pacing by director Ridley Scott, make it much better. Davis and Sarandon have great chemistry together, and the script is loaded with offbeat humor to go along with its clever story. The movie is never boring because Ridley Scott makes it so by slowing the pace down at the right moments, and then picking it back up when necessary. I enjoyed all the characters, including the minor ones which included a cameo by Brad Pitt as the young hitchhiker JD who Thelma quickly falls in lust with.Some people may see this as the ultimate female picture, but I think it is more than that. Harvey Keitel is the inspector on the case who believes that these girls really aren't as bad as some may think, and his character is interesting as well because he seems to understand why everything involving the girls has lead up to this series of unfortunate events. Michael Madsen, as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy, also adds depth to his role as a man who though upset with what Louise is going to do understands and loves her still. These two characters add something more to the story which makes it less of a feminist picture without once taking away from the two leads. If that was even possible.My only gripe with the movie would be the ending. Not the way it ended but how quickly it rushed to the end credits. I for one, like Roger Ebert who stated the same thing in his review of the movie, believe that the ending should of lasted a little longer before fading out. That's my only problem, and it's the only reason why the movie doesn't get a perfect score from me.

The 1988 update for The Blob, by director Chuck Russell, widely surpasses the 1958 original and that's not exclusively because it got released in a decade when visual & special effects had remarkably advanced. The original simply isn't a very good film, despite being considered as a minor genre classic by several critics and fans. The script suffers from severe pacing problems from start to finish, the character drawings are very implausible and overall the atmosphere completely lacks the typical 50's charm that other Sci-Fi milestones featured. As you probably know by now, The Blob revolves on a meteorite that crashes down in a remote American town and its substance &#150; a thick and funky red kind of jelly &#150; consumes the villagers in order to increase in size. Teenagers in love Steve and Jane face huge difficulties when trying to convince the rest of the town of what exactly is happening. One of the many reasons why I'm such a sucker for old (50's &#150; 60's &#150; 70's) Science Fiction movies is because of the sublime portrayal of mass hysteria and paranoia. Titles like War of the Worlds and even Day of the Triffids were great because the fear on people's faces looked so real! The Blob doesn't feature this tension, mainly because the intergalactic pudding takes over the earth so damn slow! It pays a visit to the doctor's office first, moves on to a cozy little restaurant and continues his journey to the local theater, but it pretty much avoids all the obvious public places. That's why it also takes too long before the teenagers can convince the rest of the population of the danger. The blob in the aforementioned 80's remake follows the same path but its threatening presence is much clearer. The blob here appears to be on a sightseeing tour instead of on a conquest to invade our planet. Another negative element here is the casting choice of the hero. As much as I like Steve McQueen, he simply can't pass for a rebellious teenager who spends his Friday nights on lover's lane watching the stars. McQueen was 28 when this film was shot and he already looks older, so his youthful behavior wasn't very convincing. In the 80's remake, Kevin Dillon's character was a social outcast that constantly was in trouble with the law and thus much more plausible. Is there still anything left to recommend? Yes, of course! The basic idea of an alien monster looking like shapeless blubber, and thus different than the usual spaceships or Martians, was quite original and special effects are rather engaging. It's not much, but I hate to be entirely negative about an influential movie like this.

Titles like War of the Worlds and even Day of the Triffids were great because the fear on people's faces looked so real! The Blob doesn't feature this tension, mainly because the intergalactic pudding takes over the earth so damn slow! It pays a visit to the doctor's office first, moves on to a cozy little restaurant and continues his journey to the local theater, but it pretty much avoids all the obvious public places. That's why it also takes too long before the teenagers can convince the rest of the population of the danger. The blob in the aforementioned 80's remake follows the same path but its threatening presence is much clearer. The blob here appears to be on a sightseeing tour instead of on a conquest to invade our planet. Another negative element here is the casting choice of the hero. As much as I like Steve McQueen, he simply can't pass for a rebellious teenager who spends his Friday nights on lover's lane watching the stars. McQueen was 28 when this film was shot and he already looks older, so his youthful behavior wasn't very convincing. In the 80's remake, Kevin Dillon's character was a social outcast that constantly was in trouble with the law and thus much more plausible. Is there still anything left to recommend? Yes, of course! The basic idea of an alien monster looking like shapeless blubber, and thus different than the usual spaceships or Martians, was quite original and special effects are rather engaging. It's not much, but I hate to be entirely negative about an influential movie like this.

However the film itself is definitely worthy of recognition. I remember being very taken by this movie as a young child, and now several years later and find myself still enjoying this film. I can't help but to feel that it lack something though. It had great potential to be extraordinary, and yet somehow it fails to deliver fully out and ends up being just a good movie with a original idea, when it could have been so much better! Its visuals are beautiful in a depressing and sad way, with a surreal and dark feel to it. The acting from Brandon Lee is great as avenger of his wife's murder and Michael Wincott's performance as the main villain is above average, however I feel it's missing something. His character could have been portrayed better by a different actor perhaps. Ernie Hudson gives a solid performance as well as Rochelle Davis as young Sarah. Also nice work from David Patrick Kelly playing his usual role as a psycho. Overall the acting is unfortunately a bit uneven on behalf of the rest of the cast.The pacing of the film is just about right. But as stated before I do feel that some elements are missing in order for this to be a totally mesmerizing experience. I can't really put my finger on it but it lack some depth. The quite original idea that Eric Draven is brought back from beyond the grave by a crow is excellent, and how the crow works as his link to the world and his temporary immortal state. Yet I would have wished for more of a build up, so we can feel his pain and loss. Shelley is seen only in flashbacks for instance. I also feel something else could be added to the plot in order for it to grow and be a really great film.To sum up it's a good film with an original idea and quite good acting, that just simply lack something to be as great as it could have been.

Unfortunately, when she got there she found that she had misunderstood and that it was Peter, not Roger, who was getting married. Christina was so upset that she left the wedding early- which meant that she missed the excitement when Peter and his intended bride Judy both decided, quite independently of one another, that they didn't want to be married after all.

The title The Sweetest Thing might strengthen that impression, being derived as it is from a slushy old thirties ballad called Love is the Sweetest Thing. The film, however, is not a rom-com of that sort at all. Far from it. It is just another example of Hollywood's recent mania for what might be called gross-out comedies, American Pie, There's Something About Mary (which also starred Cameron Diaz) and Scary Movie being others. The idea behind the genre is to try and make tastelessness an art-form in itself. There are plenty of attempts to get laughs out of sex, but it goes beyond mere bawdiness. Just as important are the attempts to get laughs from jokes about bodily functions, the cruder the better. The plot of the film is little more than an excuse for a string of gags of this nature.Unfortunately, the attempts to get laughs are fated to remain just that- unsuccessful attempts, although that is not due to any want of trying.

Occasionally, films of this sort can provide a few crude belly-laughs (there were, for example, some genuinely funny moments in There's Something About Mary), but The Sweetest Thing just provides the crudeness without the laughter.

It heralded a genre the film De Banlieue whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like Bye-Bye (1995) or ma 6-T Va Crack-Er (1997). La Haine remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. Assassin(s) (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and les Rivières Pourpres (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen Gothika (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.To better be immersed in his plan, Kassovitz shot his film in one of these high-risk French suburbs (I can't remember its name but you can check it in the filming locations rubric when you arrive on the page of the film on this site). This gives his movie an ultra-realist sensation which rings true. In the space of a day, his camera follows a threesome of ruffians. There's Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who acts the tough guy. He is proud of having stolen the gun of a cop and hopes to make good use of it. When he is asked to make an effort of reflection, he loses his temper. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) a pacifist who craves to get out of this daily hell but where to go? He also knows that hate breeds hate. It's both the catalyst of the riots and adds fuel to the fire in the incessant conflicts. And also Saïd (Saïd Thagmaouï), a brazen teenager. The three of them wander in their neighborhood and in Paris between visiting of friends, relationships with the riffraff, the police, arguments, reconciliations and foolish things. An ordinary day during which the trio appears as prisoners of their suburbs and have a life with no horizon. A day which will lead to the inevitable, marked out by the time which often appears on a black screen.Kassovitz did his best to create a stylish film and it paid off well. It was a good idea to have shot his film in a black and white cinematography because it bestows it with a very gritty aura; sometimes there's a documentary whiff which pervades the film. His camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings, static shots and circular movements according to the vibe a sequence could convey. It also helps to enhance the scenery which is perhaps the fourth main actor of the film after the trio. Overrall, his film is a hard-hitting assessment of a faltering universe (the high-risk suburbs) in which latent tensions and hate reign and it can awake at any time in violence. This hate in question which the inhabitants of these suburbs feel towards the cops is also smoldered in the cops and I wonder if Kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor, especially when some ruffians are kept in police custody. In the beginning of the film, the audience learns that a suspect, Abdel is in a coma at hospital because he was badly injured by the cops during questioning. When they learned this, the toughest guys of these suburbs sparked off a riot. In a way, the attitude of the police helps to fuel the hate and to separate farther the gap and the incomprehension between the inhabitants of these suburbs and the police. That said, Kassovitz doesn't generalize. Not all the cops are monstrous. Check the two sequences when in the first one, a policeman tries to make the riffraff understand in a sensible manner that they can't stay on the roof of a building and the second sequence when Vinz, Hubert and Saïd are in Paris and they ask their way to a policeman who guides them in a polite way.The actors were discerningly chosen and perfectly directed. It seems that Kassovitz fostered improvisation. It was the right method to confer his film with an authentic feeling. They deliver dialogs full of slang, coarse lines and sometimes they're inaudible so you'll have to be very attentive to catch what they say. However, this drawback isn't really irritating and was surely wanted by the director to reinforce the unique spontaneity of the film. With his build and his face of ruffian, Vincent Cassel was ideally cast as the stubborn Vinz while his two main partners are amazingly true to life. And there are some famous French actors who have cameos and who weren't afraid of having demeaning parts like Vincent Lindon, a drunkard or Zinedine Soualem, a sadistic cop.Kassovitz remains as objective as possible and doesn't offer solutions to solve these problems. More than ten years after it reached the streets, his films is still a topical one and the riots and violent incidents which broke out in high-risk suburbs in many French cities the last fall alas show that these tensions aren't alas ready to subside.

It heralded a genre the film De Banlieue whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like Bye-Bye (1995) or ma 6-T Va Crack-Er (1997). La Haine remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. Assassin(s) (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and les Rivières Pourpres (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen Gothika (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.To better be immersed in his plan, Kassovitz shot his film in one of these high-risk French suburbs (I can't remember its name but you can check it in the filming locations rubric when you arrive on the page of the film on this site). This gives his movie an ultra-realist sensation which rings true. In the space of a day, his camera follows a threesome of ruffians. There's Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who acts the tough guy. He is proud of having stolen the gun of a cop and hopes to make good use of it. When he is asked to make an effort of reflection, he loses his temper. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) a pacifist who craves to get out of this daily hell but where to go? He also knows that hate breeds hate. It's both the catalyst of the riots and adds fuel to the fire in the incessant conflicts. And also Saïd (Saïd Thagmaouï), a brazen teenager. The three of them wander in their neighborhood and in Paris between visiting of friends, relationships with the riffraff, the police, arguments, reconciliations and foolish things. An ordinary day during which the trio appears as prisoners of their suburbs and have a life with no horizon. A day which will lead to the inevitable, marked out by the time which often appears on a black screen.Kassovitz did his best to create a stylish film and it paid off well. It was a good idea to have shot his film in a black and white cinematography because it bestows it with a very gritty aura; sometimes there's a documentary whiff which pervades the film. His camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings, static shots and circular movements according to the vibe a sequence could convey. It also helps to enhance the scenery which is perhaps the fourth main actor of the film after the trio. Overrall, his film is a hard-hitting assessment of a faltering universe (the high-risk suburbs) in which latent tensions and hate reign and it can awake at any time in violence. This hate in question which the inhabitants of these suburbs feel towards the cops is also smoldered in the cops and I wonder if Kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor, especially when some ruffians are kept in police custody. In the beginning of the film, the audience learns that a suspect, Abdel is in a coma at hospital because he was badly injured by the cops during questioning. When they learned this, the toughest guys of these suburbs sparked off a riot. In a way, the attitude of the police helps to fuel the hate and to separate farther the gap and the incomprehension between the inhabitants of these suburbs and the police. That said, Kassovitz doesn't generalize. Not all the cops are monstrous. Check the two sequences when in the first one, a policeman tries to make the riffraff understand in a sensible manner that they can't stay on the roof of a building and the second sequence when Vinz, Hubert and Saïd are in Paris and they ask their way to a policeman who guides them in a polite way.The actors were discerningly chosen and perfectly directed. It seems that Kassovitz fostered improvisation. It was the right method to confer his film with an authentic feeling. They deliver dialogs full of slang, coarse lines and sometimes they're inaudible so you'll have to be very attentive to catch what they say.

What we have here is a world, apparently the current era (i.e. the mid-80's) wherein, there are robots everywhere that are super helpful to humanity. Just like the apes in one of the Planet of the Apes movies. The robots don't look too bad, thankfully, they aren't androids, so they're a wee bit more believable. They're built to be functional&#133; and cumbersome.At any rate, Tom Selleck is a cop on the runaway robot beat. See, anytime a robot goes haywire, ol' mustache here gets called in to shut it down. Well, pretty soon, it's not about runaway robots, it's about some lunatic (Gene Simmons&#151;no sh*t!) who is developing evil chips to go in the robots to turn them into killing machines. And Tom Selleck suddenly finds himself running around trying to find and defeat the Demon from KISS.Overall, this film isn't too bad. It's cheesy as all hell and rampant with unexplained phenomena. Like Tom Selleck running around doing stuff that doesn't seem to be connected to catching crazy robots. The robots themselves are pretty odd, and only somewhat believable. Maybe if the film took place in the distant future, say, 2010 or something, it'd be a bit easier to swallow. But the robots seem to have massive computing power and skill at a time when they could barely assemble parts of cars&#151;when preprogrammed to do so. The film also has trouble shaking the image of being a somewhat weak cop drama kind of film. Gene Simmons is pretty funny, even though I don't think he's supposed to be. The atmosphere is decent and the special effects are entertaining (lots of explosions), and there is brief nudity. Sometimes the acting is a little hard to swallow. Almost like the actors didn't really buy what they were saying or doing, so they just made the best of it. Not Crichton's best work.5\/10 (www.ResidentHazard.com) ","genre":null},{"date":"2 May 2006","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Runaway, Quickie Review This thing was written and directed by Michael Crichton, long before he was dishing out cloned dinosaurs and feasible plots.
