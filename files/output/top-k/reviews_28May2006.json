I place solely the blame on Cuba Gooding, Jr. What happened to him? From the opening scene in Miami to the ending embarrassing catch-phrase, I felt like Cuba should have handed the Academy back the award and apologized to everyone profusely. There are lines in Snow Dogs that were obviously read from a cue card. There were moments when it was obvious Cuba didn't care. He showed no range of emotion, no rational credibility, and again, there was no character. Who was Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this film? Just like a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know!

What was his story, what made him gruff, what &#133; what &#133; what &#133; just too many questions running through my mind with these key actors that it makes me feel sorry for the child audience this film was aimed towards. It was very clear that neither of these actors were passionate about the story for they would have stopped early and backed away. I would have thought that Cuba (or at least James Coburn) would have put their hands down when it was discovered that SISQO (Mr. Thong himself) was going to be a key player. Unbelievable is the level of lacking respect that both of these actors had for themselves. The proof is in Snow Dogs.What bothered me the most about this film was the lack of intelligence aimed towards children. This was a family film, yet racism seemed to be slapped directly in your face. There was a scene that sticks out in my mind when Gooding tries to find his real father and assumes that it can only be the other black man in town. When it is discovered that it is someone else, there is a shock in the community. This film was released in 2002, with the society that we live in why would this be such a shock to the system? Couple this with the fact that Michael Bolton brings us the inspirational line from the film, It doesn't matter what color you are, everyone can have soul. Egh. Where did this come from, and is this a good message to send to children? This ranks right next to the feeling that Gooding's love-interest was the only woman within a 100-mile radius, and that those living in Alaska are grizzly men with bad teeth. I felt midway through this film that Disney executives were in their offices insisting on another Cool Runnings-esquire film (there was even a Volkswagen moment in this one).

A great cast with Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore and John Goodman and it had Martin Scorsese at the helm. What could go wrong? Quite a lot actually! Bringing Out the Dead is boring from start to finish and even though Sizemore and Goodman are both fun to watch in their segments, they can not overcome the sense of boredom this film gives you. I have no problem with slow paced films, if there is a certain amount of intelligence involved or if suspense is being built but this film can not boast either of these. With the plot surrounding a paramedic, there could have been more adrenaline rushes to give a greater sense of urgency, thus, allowing us to understand the stresses of the job more. Instead, the film gets tangled up in the main character's past and with his ambivalence towards his profession and in the end, the audience cares little for the outcome of the film.At fault in all of this is Scorsese, a rarity indeed. This is a tarnish on his near perfect career but he only has himself to blame. He knows how to grip an audience and how to construct a good film but he fails miserably on both counts. It is visible at some points that Scorsese had a message but it never got conveyed within the plot. The fact that the screenplay was by frequent Scorsese collaborator, Paul Schrader makes it even more shocking how poor the film is. The best bits of the film probably are down to Cage and Arquette's (their characters!) relationship as it is very interesting and not the average Hollywood romance.The actors in this didn't really put a foot wrong. All the characters are very unique, with Tom Sizemore doing his typecast psychotic role very well and with Ving Rhames playing a devoted Christian, being the pick of the supporting cast. Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performances, he is very understated in this and plays his character with great subtlety. Arquette, as always, is great but is very different to how she normally approaches her characters. The fun, bouncy Patricia is gone and we're given a much more shy and restrained character. She is very good and it could well have been this film that lead to her successful television role in Medium. If acting could save a film, Bringing Out the Dead would be superb but instead, I feel sorry for the actors wasting their talents.This should have been a great film, but it failed miserably on most counts. Whilst not making any effort to entertain, there is also no effort to break new grounds. If you want to see a great Scorsese film that is a relatively slow, character driven piece, watch Taxi Driver. The attempt at dark comedy falls short and the plot does not possess the power to carry the film for two hours.

Carefree but always in trouble, one prank goes too far and sees a passer-by killed and the boys sent away for 18 months to a young offenders home. Once there they are subjected to cruel and persistent sexual abuse and beatings from the guards, led by Sean Noakes. Years go by and the friends drift apart &#150; with Tommy and John becoming gangsters. When the pair spot Noakes in a bar they kill him and walk out, but are picked up later by the police and charged with murder. With revenge on their minds, DA Michael takes the case with the aim of making getting his friends off while also exposing Noakes for who he was; meanwhile Lorenzo sets out to help him with the set-up, while also taking revenge on the rest of the guards.Sold on the back of the heavy star cast, I went to see this film at time of release and must admit that I wasn't that impressed by it that much. Rewatching it recently I had no reason to change my mind with a film that lives on the surface and, although providing some powerful moments to get the audience on its side, has much a simplistic moral outlook that it significantly damages the telling of the story. The use of narration makes the film drag and this is particularly evident in the first stage where the boys are free. The second stage is more interesting and disturbing as it documents the abuse suffered by the boys &#150; although in my opinion is far too safe and sanitised with the cop-out that the memories are buried too deep in our narrator's mind to recall clearly. The final third brings matters to a close and is easily the most engaging as many viewers will find the flow of the story enough to hold their interest.However for me what I couldn't shake off was the lack of questioning in the film; other than a thoughtful Father Bobby silently wrestling with his conscience (in just one scene!) the film never even hints that what the men might be doing is morally wrong. Now it may well be that the circumstances means that they were fully justified but the fact that the film never even broaches the subject and just expects us to get behind the cold revenge of Michael et al was a problem for me. Wouldn't the moral complexity of their actions be worth looking at, even if the outcome was the same wouldn't it have been more interesting if the audience were being pushed to ask questions of themselves? Very likely the answer is yes, but with Levinson driving we are not to know; for him this is a straight drama with right defeating wrong in a manner that makes for a nice courtroom drama.The simplicity of the writing and delivery leaves the cast with very little to do in the main group of roles. Patric is flat and dull &#150; qualities that could easily describe his narration which is delivered to the general detriment of the film. Pitt is equally as poor, with little to get his teeth into. Eldard and Crudup just seem to enjoy their minor roles alongside such a starry ensemble. With such weak turns from the main players, Bacon easily dominates the film with a monstrous character that he makes larger that life. Not comparable to his much better turn as a child abuser in a much different film recently, but he still dominates the middle section of the film. De Niro sleep walks a character that is so simplistic that it looks like Father Bobby had been developed using Microsoft Paint; he is a welcome presence but adds little. Hoffman is OK but again is just a nice addition to the cast. Minnie Driver is present for some reason I didn't get but the only performance that gets close to being interesting is that of an older Kinney; despite everything else he gets the closest to producing genuine interest in me (sadly the film has no interest beyond him doing this as part of moving the story forward).Overall then a star-heavy film that wears it's worthy credentials on its sleeve and refuses any debate or examination in favour of a straight drama.

Carefree but always in trouble, one prank goes too far and sees a passer-by killed and the boys sent away for 18 months to a young offenders home. Once there they are subjected to cruel and persistent sexual abuse and beatings from the guards, led by Sean Noakes. Years go by and the friends drift apart &#150; with Tommy and John becoming gangsters. When the pair spot Noakes in a bar they kill him and walk out, but are picked up later by the police and charged with murder. With revenge on their minds, DA Michael takes the case with the aim of making getting his friends off while also exposing Noakes for who he was; meanwhile Lorenzo sets out to help him with the set-up, while also taking revenge on the rest of the guards.Sold on the back of the heavy star cast, I went to see this film at time of release and must admit that I wasn't that impressed by it that much. Rewatching it recently I had no reason to change my mind with a film that lives on the surface and, although providing some powerful moments to get the audience on its side, has much a simplistic moral outlook that it significantly damages the telling of the story. The use of narration makes the film drag and this is particularly evident in the first stage where the boys are free. The second stage is more interesting and disturbing as it documents the abuse suffered by the boys &#150; although in my opinion is far too safe and sanitised with the cop-out that the memories are buried too deep in our narrator's mind to recall clearly. The final third brings matters to a close and is easily the most engaging as many viewers will find the flow of the story enough to hold their interest.However for me what I couldn't shake off was the lack of questioning in the film; other than a thoughtful Father Bobby silently wrestling with his conscience (in just one scene!) the film never even hints that what the men might be doing is morally wrong. Now it may well be that the circumstances means that they were fully justified but the fact that the film never even broaches the subject and just expects us to get behind the cold revenge of Michael et al was a problem for me. Wouldn't the moral complexity of their actions be worth looking at, even if the outcome was the same wouldn't it have been more interesting if the audience were being pushed to ask questions of themselves? Very likely the answer is yes, but with Levinson driving we are not to know; for him this is a straight drama with right defeating wrong in a manner that makes for a nice courtroom drama.The simplicity of the writing and delivery leaves the cast with very little to do in the main group of roles. Patric is flat and dull &#150; qualities that could easily describe his narration which is delivered to the general detriment of the film. Pitt is equally as poor, with little to get his teeth into. Eldard and Crudup just seem to enjoy their minor roles alongside such a starry ensemble. With such weak turns from the main players, Bacon easily dominates the film with a monstrous character that he makes larger that life. Not comparable to his much better turn as a child abuser in a much different film recently, but he still dominates the middle section of the film. De Niro sleep walks a character that is so simplistic that it looks like Father Bobby had been developed using Microsoft Paint; he is a welcome presence but adds little. Hoffman is OK but again is just a nice addition to the cast. Minnie Driver is present for some reason I didn't get but the only performance that gets close to being interesting is that of an older Kinney; despite everything else he gets the closest to producing genuine interest in me (sadly the film has no interest beyond him doing this as part of moving the story forward).Overall then a star-heavy film that wears it's worthy credentials on its sleeve and refuses any debate or examination in favour of a straight drama.

Unfortunately she lives on a tropical island off the coast of Brazil and he finds himself stuck on the island with her. If that wasn't bad enough he learns that the pale, 12 year old member of her tribe (Mimi-Siku) is actually his son. In order to avoid looking at the morality of her not telling him about this life, the story then requires Mimi-Siku to go to New York for reasons too boring to explain and laughter ensues and Michael learns some lessons that we all saw coming from a mile off.It is rare for me not even to have the energy to type a decent plot summary for a film but for this one I make an exception. Part of the problem is the fact that the plot manages to be embarrassingly predictable from start to finish and provides nothing of value along the way. This is only made worse by the lack of laughs and the regular scenes of Mimi-Siku failing to fit in, one of the most embarrassing of which sees him dancing with his father on the street. It is a string of obvious scenarios all run together just as you'd expect and there is nothing of any interest developed along the way. There are plenty of wild fish out of water in big city films already kicking around and this offers no reason to add this to the list of the ones you've seen.The cast are equally lost in the midst of all this stuff and resort to mugging and overplaying at every opportunity.

The rest of the cast have little to do and even a turn from Stiers adds no value.Overall a roundly poor film that takes the wild fish out of water in city genre, ticks as many boxes as it can, writes lots of predictable and weak scenarios and places them all within a story that is so poorly developed that you pretty much know where it is going from the very start.

Annoyed but accepting his fate, Max decides to take revenge on the staff and bullies &#150; safe in the knowledge that he'll be long gone before being punished.Although it is rather unrelentingly in your face and energetic, I actually quite enjoyed this movie because it was consistently amusing albeit in a way that is aimed at young teenagers. The plot is obvious and is a nice if busy frame for several plot lines smashing together in a colourful load of noise. It lacks sophistication and subtlety (evident in some spoofs that are hammered home when a softer touch would have been just as effective and better for it). However it does have a certain imaginative charm to it and it moves quickly with plenty of subversive touches. Yes at times it feels like a poor man's copy of Malcolm in the Middle style humour with Scrubs etc but it still worked and I surprised myself by finding it distracting and entertaining.The cast all get into it which really helps. Linz avoids being an annoying cute kid; yes he is a bit irritating but mostly his performance is good and he is likable and easy to watch. Miller has an obvious character and obvious material but delivers it really well and makes the most out of it.

No. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert, by the magnificent and colossal natural structures in Wadi Rum and the seemingly infinite vacuous space covering the land. It was difficult to believe that there are actual places on earth like these.Second, the script was brilliant. I had a bit of trouble following the plot, but it mattered not; I was too busy admiring the visuals and the almost poetic dialog. On my second viewing, I had no trouble understanding the plot.In short, this is perhaps the most beautiful film I've ever seen.Though, I must warn The movie is heavily fictionalized. The historical inaccuracies are numerous, however they don't take away from the film at all.In fact, not long after purchasing the film for myself, I've done quite a bit of reading about the Arab Revolt, T.E. Lawrence, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the infected blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.

But to come back to my point This is the greatest movie ever and I will surely recommend it to everyone I know.Like a lot off people before me said it's a heartbreaking story of addiction in every way possible. For example Ellen Burnstyn's addiction starts with her television-set and then expands to something much bigger. Darren Aranofsky is by far the best director I'm currently aware off. I had never seen Pi before but I sure will after seeing this movie although I don't think that that movie can beat this. The storyline is about 4 people each with their own fears and addictions. Sarah Goldfarb has become a TV-junkie after her husband had died. Her son Harry is mostly a heroin-junkie but does all kinds of drugs together with his girlfriend(Connely) and best friend(Wayans).The movie starts when Harry is stealing his mother's TV again in order to buy some drugs. From that point on everything is going downwards for the characters, but it's not unbelievable at all. Most drug-movies aren't portrayed as realistically as this one. My mom is an elderly lonely woman and this movie shocked me badly. I was actually thinking about the fact that this could happen to her as well. There's no use explaining the whole storyline because that would spoil a part of your viewing pleasure. What I can say is that all the actors in this movie are perfect for their characters. All the actors aren't well known in Holland except for Ellen Burnstyn ( The exorcist of course ) Ellen Burnstyn has to be the best female actor in the world today. The scene in which Harry finds out his mom is on uppers just rips my heart out, I can't describe it. Marlon Wayans proved he is a valid actor, in Holland he's only known for the Wayans bros. Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto are the perfect counterparts and you can feel the chemistry between them the entire movie.I would also like to mention that the soundtrack of this movie is incredibly good. Every time I hear the song Lux aeterna ( the main theme) it brings back the feeling I had after I had seen the movie.

The scene in which Harry finds out his mom is on uppers just rips my heart out, I can't describe it. Marlon Wayans proved he is a valid actor, in Holland he's only known for the Wayans bros. Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto are the perfect counterparts and you can feel the chemistry between them the entire movie.I would also like to mention that the soundtrack of this movie is incredibly good. Every time I hear the song Lux aeterna ( the main theme) it brings back the feeling I had after I had seen the movie. To make a long story short Perfect story , good acting, great director and a stunning soundtrack that still gives me the chills every time I hear it.It's a movie you want to see but the second time it's even harder to watch.

It is filmed beautifully, the music is great, the sets are nice to look at, there is even some clever camera work. But this is a comedy, and that's the one thing this film lacks. It just really isn't that funny! I just watched this film for the first time since the late 70's, when it used to run on cable TV non-stop. I guess being a child helped, because I recall this film being rip-roaring hilarious. What a letdown! As an adult, in between a laugh here and there, I just kept thinking, wow, that was so unfunny, I can't believe they thought that was funny. As I said, there are a few laughs. When the head Knight who says Ni tells Authur to chop down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring, that was funny. The guard in the castle who couldn't get his instructions correct, that was funny. The running gag of people who weren't quite dead yet was OK. And a few more little laughs, but really, for the most part, this just is not that funny! But the film does look good. It's obvious some decent effort went into this. And the Python guys, they're all great, as far as delivery goes, making faces, etc. I especially like Eric Idle and John Cleese the most in this movie. But who knows, maybe it's the whole British humor thing. I don't want to make it sound as if there were no laughs here, because there were scattered laughs in the film. But one of the greatest comedies ever? Greatest films ever even? So high in the IMDb top 250? That boggles the mind.And I certainly hope that the Python fans don't do the whole well you just don't get it thing when someone expresses they aren't crazy about this film. I get it. I most certainly, definitely get it. It is just not funny.There are just too many groans in the film for me. Particularly unfunny was the running joke of Authur and the knights being hunted by the cops, and especially the ending. Sooooo unfunny. Like so much else here. The cows catapulting. The French guys. Bring out 'cha dead. The animator suffering a heart attack, so the cartoon monster dies. Sir Robin the coward and his minstrels. The knight with three heads (that was VERY bad). The black knight (even though he did look cool just standing there). The intermission. The subtitles at the start of the film. The cartoon God. The girl's castle.

Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place.A very important part of The Godfather's iconic status is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. His profile from the first film has provided a symbol which represents all three films, despite Brando only being in the first instalment, and an icon that commands respect. Brando appeared long finished as an actor, his looks diminishing and his status being lost but his classic performance in The Godfather put him firmly back on the acting map, where he now has a permanent place. His performance is excellent in this film, despite his mouth being crowded by moth balls! OK, so you can't hear every word he says, but you don't need to when his body language and non-verbal cues say so much for themselves. The character of Vito is very powerful, yet very frail and Brando puts these two qualities in perfect juxtaposition. A classic display, which still gets talked about 30 years on. Al Pacino whose film career was just beginning with this film, is also fantastic and ensured that wherever the film was plot wise, that powerful displays were on show at all times. His character transformation is compelling and his storyline with Diane Keaton is intriguing to give Godfather a more personal atmosphere and also to provide a much deeper plot. This film is seen as a landmark for acting, with Brando winning an Academy Award and with Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval all receiving nominations.Central to the films core is the plot which is so intensely dramatic, that two hours does not seem enough to justify such a story. There are dozens of relationships involved in this story and there is an assassination plot and both Michael and Vito Corleone have their own separate storyline. All of these are done fantastically, ensuring the audience can have full empathy for all the characters and also be thoroughly entertained. Mario Puzo is clearly a gifted writer and does a fantastic job of portraying criminal organisations and what goes on in these families, a true representation or not, it makes for a fantastic film. Whilst his success in film was mainly limited to The Godfather series and Superman, Puzo must be gifted to write such material and was definitely worthy of the awards he won. The Godfather is a prime example of what is missing in most of today's films; a character driven plot. This film shows that you do not need explosions and high octane chases to keep an audience gripped and that a quality script and fascinating characters are enough to amass an audience.This is all wonderfully brought together by Francis Ford Coppola who, because of this film, has left his mark on the film world for eternity. It is the atmosphere he builds in this film that makes it so effective. Everything is dark and bleak except for when Pacino is exiled but that ends in tragedy. Coppola does brilliantly to emphasise the point that the world of criminal organisations is not a nice place and that no matter how safe you feel, your fate is waiting for you just around the corner. The film contains very little in the way of set pieces, instead everything appears very intimate, highlighting how personal the Mafia can be. The uncompromising nature of the film must have been very shocking at the time as there is a lot of violence that would have been skirted around at the time.The classic score to The Godfather is also integral to the film as it compliments all the visual elements on the screen. The sophisticated appearance of the Mafioso for instance and the general demeanour of the higher ranked gangsters are emphasised by the slow classical music.This film is responsible for most of the post modern approach to film making and acting and his also the landmark to which other crime movies compare themselves. The Godfather's image and style live to this day and will for generations to come. The first of a fantastic series, Godfather is an example of how films should be.

All across the nation, people were running out of the theater in shock of what they were seeing. The film cost $100,000 to make, and wound up grossing about $30 million. In other words, 300 times its budget. Not bad for an indie horror flick.Over the years, TCM has garnered a reputation as being extremely gory, perverted, and being a symbol of everything that is wrong in America. The film has been banned in many countries due to its content, and is equally reviled as it is praised.It was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had avoided it due entirely to its reputation. But what happened as I was watching it was interesting. For the first time since seeing The Exorcist 4 years earlier, I was completely terrified by a movie. On the edge of my seat, squirming, heart racingly TERRIFIED.To start off, there is hardly any blood at all in the movie. Yes, people get butchered by Leatherface, and there is the girl on the meathook, but its all done with sound effects and imaginative camera angles. There's literally only about 2 ounces of blood seen in the entire movie. Secondly, you don't even really see what's happening when the people are slaughtered. Your imagination is forced to take over, which is even scarier than all the blood and guts in the world.Is the movie any good? Yes! The reason I praise The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is its unparallelled ability to horrify the viewer. This film comes as close to a living nightmare as any film could possibly come. This film is absolutely ruthless in its attempt to drive you right out of your mind. The infamous dinner scene is one such example. For 10 solid minutes there's nothing but yelling and screaming and all-out craziness going on. The fantastic camera angles and Marilyn Burns' terrifying screaming is enough to drive anyone mad. You are pulled into whats happening on screen, and you are not even given a second to breathe.Marilyn Burns is extraordinary as the film's heroine. As you watch the movie, you cannot even tell she is acting. Also, she is one hell of a screamer! During the dinner scene, you can tell that she is truly terrified, and cannot believe what is happening around her. You feel for her, and cannot believe what is happening to her, which makes the film even more horrifying. Gunnar Hansen is also fantastic as Leatherface. He adds a human quality to this cannibalistic monster that makes the movie even more unsettling.Tobe Hooper's direction is first rate. He decided to shoot the movie like a documentary which makes the film even more horrifying. You think what is happening on screen is actually happening to the people right at that very moment. The graininess of the picture adds even more to the feel of the film.Simply put, this is one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. Everything is first rate, and I highly suggest that anyone who has an appreciation for true horror see it. It ranks right up there with The Exorcist as one of the scariest films of all time.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"28 May 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" This story, and the director who envisioned it have serious flaws and misconceptions about what an audience will accept. And none of this is the fault of the actors. Pfeiffer usually rises above content (White Oleander and Frankie and Johnnie). And we expect more from Redford.I am very curious why he accepted this role.This film was based on Joan Didion's career as a TV newscaster, and was written by John Gregory Dunne. Didion always delivers (her novel Play it as it Lays was unique realism). This movie however, has the worst screenplay I have seen in some time. Joe Mantegna as Bucky Terranova a TV bigwig-enough said. Mantegna is limited in scope, and his part in this movie serves as unintentional comedy.Pfeiffer is portrayed in a misogynistic ditzy form- she wears a bright pink suit to interview for a job at a major TV station- she looks more like the Mayflower Madam. The crux of the story is, she is simply trying to make it in the big bad world of TV journalism. I doubt this topic would work today, since most educated audiences realize correspondents are talking heads, bought and paid for by slanted political interest groups.As Tally (as she is so fondly called by Redford), is helped by him to move up the ladder of success, she is miraculously transferred from Miami to Philadelphia, where people like Stockard Channing reign supreme (i.e. the audience likes to see a woman who can read and speak properly!).An amusing scene is when Tally reports Fernando Buttanda (Ray Cruz) has won a prize for the first New Year baby in Miami. Anyone who has ever lived in South Florida will be laughing at this banality. Deco Drive is the most popular TV show in South Florida right now, so a newsgirl reporting fluff would NEVER get a northeastern market unless; ah yes, she is involved with veteran Redford, who has connections.That being said, this movie proves you can have excellent actors, who cannot resurrect bad material. I have liked most of the actors in other projects, (Redford, Nelligan, Pfeiffer and Channing). They should have passed on this one.
