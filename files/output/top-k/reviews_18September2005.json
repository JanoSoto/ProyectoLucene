I myself was really surprised by the twist ending, and the car chase at the beginning was just awesome!, plus i thought Willi's acting was fantastic!. I really felt for Willi's character, and it also had a great supporting cast as well, plus Brion James is excellent as the asshole you will hate him!. Robert Pastorelli is very creepy, and the film is very engrossing throughout!, plus This should be much much higher then a 5.3 rating!.

I think I liked it and had always wanted to see all of it, especially because I wanted to see all the top 5 lists I missed. So I rented it today.It is a decent film. I don't think it's great, or as good as I felt is was before. The main reason is that all the trials and tribulations Rob goes through, just seem like a waste of time. How can you feel empathy for a character that has the time and luxury to do all this worrying and scrutinizing? Especially when it comes out that most of the problems he suffered were self-induced. How can you forget that you dumped a girl because she didn't put out? Or not realize that someone you were dating before was a whack-job? It just seems like if any decisions that should have been pondered earlier weren't, and that again makes it tough to swallow a character who is obviously very into introspection.Another problem for me was that we have seen so much more of Jack Black's antics since this movie was released, that his part did seem more tame this go-round. He is still one of the strongest characters in the movie however. I also didn't wholly understand Lisa Bonet's character. Was she the actualization of the 'Fantasy Girl' girl Rob talks about later, just for an emphasis in reality that the ideal is un-attainable in any sense of permanency? If not, why didn't he just stick with her. There were some really funny parts, and it had a nice sweet ending, but I did find myself looking at the movie timer quite a bit. I now have a strong urge to go read the novel, and maybe that'll open up some things that I didn't get straight away from the film.

This is due largely to the many one-liners and snippets of dialogue about the situation that evolves. But it is important to point out that the dialogue likely would not have worked had it not been for the impeccable timing and delivery on the part of Michael Caine. Mr. Caine is clearly one of the best actors of all time and had his part been played by anyone else, the movie likely would have been a total flop in my book.I am a sucker for great one-liners and this movie was full of them.Some people might find the topic of this movie inappropriate, distasteful, or perverted, but I just don't see any justification for that. We're talking about consenting adults here - this is not Pretty Baby. Fortunately this movie does not take itself as seriously as some viewers might.The performances of Michael Caine, Valerie Harper, and Joseph Bologna were strong, with a very strong lead by Mr. Caine. Michelle Johnson was perhaps the weakest actor in the film, but there was something about her amateurish delivery that contributed to the film. Somehow it made her character more believable. If that was your plan all along, Ms. Johnson, my most sincere apologies. Although Demi Moore was a stronger actress, I felt like she was a bit of a wet dish rag throughout most of the movie. Yeah, she was supposed to be the smart, practical one, but it would have been nice to have seen more signs of life come from that important character.We go to movies for a variety of reasons, but for me one of the primary reasons is to be entertained. This movie did just that. The dialogue is hilarious with great delivery by Michael Caine and others. I will admit that I was mesmerized by the striking beauty of Michelle Johnson.

I always wanted to see her in more serious movies (even with her clothes on). Today I'm flagging some of her more recent films as Must See on IMDb.

Murray Abraham), but I even enjoyed the black-gang scenes (because I was rooting for Jimmie to get mad and take his tormentors down). Can you tell that I was entertained? -)This is the kind of movie to rent if you're in the mood to watch a good and truly innocent man get knocked around by nasty people you'll seriously love to hate (crooked cops AND prison gang members), watch the guy suffer a bit, and then watch him get back on his feet and get his revenge on his tormentors (without losing his humanity).

Indeed, he saves the movie; everyone else is decent, but play like back-up singers to Chirstian Bale's main show. The way he portrayed Patrick in such subtleties and quiet complexities perfectly compliments the character, and he certainly seems to have enjoyed playing the part.American Psycho is actually a much more worthwhile film than the cheap trailer would have one suspect the trailer plays as a cheap slasher flick, whereas the violence is almost second party to the satire of the 80's and yuppie way of life. Particulalrly memorable in my mind is the scene where Patrick is in the men's room and manages to goad the man in the next stall enough to stick his head over and demand Do you mind?! I am trying to drugs here! such is the chagrin of his disturbance.The film is also vaguely comical (not least of all in the scene where Patrick entertains Paul in his apartment. All together now Hey Paul! AHHHHHHHH!) and is just light enough to keep the violence in equal balance.Without this vaguely comical tone, which in turn adds the absurdity I spoke of, the violence would be exploitative.

In some ways it is as if not more meant for kids than Time Bandits and Brothers Grimm, because the humor a lot of time is in that wacky vein for them (and Sara Polley as Sally is the key performance in the film aside from Neville as Munchausen himself). It may not be then as accessible to the adults who usually like Gilliam's films, on the other hand, at least at first.At its very best, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is what Gilliam set out to achieve, a live-action version of all those over-the-top, visually spellbinding Disney animated films from the classic days. At its weakest, the script isn't as strong or funny as it could be (sadly, some of the funnier bits like the explanation of Wednesday were left on the cutting room floor), some of the performances (i.e. Robin Williams) are going in ten different directions at once, which is amusing but frustrating, and the whole scope of the technical aspects- the camera-work, design, art direction, special effects, visual effects, battles- overwhelm some of the more charming aspects in the actors and some scenes.

Directed by Gil Junger and written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik it was a widely successful movie with an entertaining storyline loosely based on Shakespeare's comedy 'The Taming Of The Shrew.Although the film follows the stories of several different characters it is mainly based around Kat (Julia Stiles) who is the difficult older sister of the beautiful and very popular Bianca (larisa Oleynik) who's father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister does. When Cameron (joseph Gordon-Levitt) starts the first day of his new school he instantly falls in love with Bianca. However he has some tough competition from the overwhelmingly egotistical Joey (Andrew Keegan), but he shows that he is substantially more intelligent than the unbearably vain Joey and forms a clever plan involving Trailer park rebel Patrick (heath Ledger) and tricks Joey into helping him get the girl.However this film is more than your usual clichéd teen movie. The storyline and script have a genuine depth which demands more of the viewer than most other films in this genre. The characters are wonderfully played by top quality actors and actresses who play their parts with amazing insight into the characters and how they are portrayed to the audience.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film because not only is the main character female, she is also an extremely strong and intelligent person who is never afraid to express her own views and feelings. The fact that she is not your average teen-movie dumb-blonde type or completely gorgeous and impossibly popular also helps people relate much more easily to the character and makes you want to get to know her. I particularly admired her witty comebacks to any insults from people who disagreed with her less than conventional attitude to her social life and popularity. This character is a particularly good role model as although she made mistakes she learnt from them and never let any 'guy', or anybody else take advantage of her again. This film is also very different to most of it's genre as the script and storyline are extremely intelligent and well put together. It is an excellent modern adaptation of a classic play which hopefully would encourage more teenagers to be willing to enjoy the works of Shakespeare, and help them realise that the aim of his writing was to entertain and that his plays were certainly not written to be taught in schools. It also carries on the comedy genre of Shakespeare's play as the film is genuinely extremely funny. This is exaggerated by the fast pace of the film and the witty jokes and comments from characters. The screenwriters manage to successfully retain Shakespeare's original sophisticated aim and similar morals are communicated to the audience, along with added ones which are more relevant to teenagers today. The blend of old and new ideas works surprisingly well and enhances the quality of the film, making it modern but classic at the same time.My favourite part of this film is where Patrick sings 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' to Kat in front of a playing field full of his fellow students. The band starts playing along to the tune and everyone stops to watch. Now in your average teen-movie this would be unbearably sleazy but in 'Ten Things I Hate About You' it is made hilariously funny when Patrick runs around after policemen, who are attempting to restrain him, and slaps their bottoms. The swift movements of the camera in all directions and the jaunty camera angles in this scene exaggerate the humour and everything from the huge idiotic grin on his face to his sarcastic run adds to this effect and gives this scene two very positive qualities humour and romance. The only part of this film which disappointed me is the ending. Like most other teenage movies this film of course ends with a prom. For such a thoroughly entertaining and quite unpredictable film this is an extremely discouraging ending which seems to have had very little thought or enthusiasm at all put into it.

Directed by Gil Junger and written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, starring Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Larisa Oleynik it was a widely successful movie with an entertaining storyline loosely based on Shakespeare's comedy 'The Taming Of The Shrew.Although the film follows the stories of several different characters it is mainly based around Kat (Julia Stiles) who is the difficult older sister of the beautiful and very popular Bianca (larisa Oleynik) who's father has forbidden her from dating until her older sister does. When Cameron (joseph Gordon-Levitt) starts the first day of his new school he instantly falls in love with Bianca. However he has some tough competition from the overwhelmingly egotistical Joey (Andrew Keegan), but he shows that he is substantially more intelligent than the unbearably vain Joey and forms a clever plan involving Trailer park rebel Patrick (heath Ledger) and tricks Joey into helping him get the girl.However this film is more than your usual clichéd teen movie. The storyline and script have a genuine depth which demands more of the viewer than most other films in this genre. The characters are wonderfully played by top quality actors and actresses who play their parts with amazing insight into the characters and how they are portrayed to the audience.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film because not only is the main character female, she is also an extremely strong and intelligent person who is never afraid to express her own views and feelings. The fact that she is not your average teen-movie dumb-blonde type or completely gorgeous and impossibly popular also helps people relate much more easily to the character and makes you want to get to know her. I particularly admired her witty comebacks to any insults from people who disagreed with her less than conventional attitude to her social life and popularity. This character is a particularly good role model as although she made mistakes she learnt from them and never let any 'guy', or anybody else take advantage of her again. This film is also very different to most of it's genre as the script and storyline are extremely intelligent and well put together. It is an excellent modern adaptation of a classic play which hopefully would encourage more teenagers to be willing to enjoy the works of Shakespeare, and help them realise that the aim of his writing was to entertain and that his plays were certainly not written to be taught in schools. It also carries on the comedy genre of Shakespeare's play as the film is genuinely extremely funny. This is exaggerated by the fast pace of the film and the witty jokes and comments from characters. The screenwriters manage to successfully retain Shakespeare's original sophisticated aim and similar morals are communicated to the audience, along with added ones which are more relevant to teenagers today. The blend of old and new ideas works surprisingly well and enhances the quality of the film, making it modern but classic at the same time.My favourite part of this film is where Patrick sings 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' to Kat in front of a playing field full of his fellow students. The band starts playing along to the tune and everyone stops to watch. Now in your average teen-movie this would be unbearably sleazy but in 'Ten Things I Hate About You' it is made hilariously funny when Patrick runs around after policemen, who are attempting to restrain him, and slaps their bottoms. The swift movements of the camera in all directions and the jaunty camera angles in this scene exaggerate the humour and everything from the huge idiotic grin on his face to his sarcastic run adds to this effect and gives this scene two very positive qualities humour and romance. The only part of this film which disappointed me is the ending. Like most other teenage movies this film of course ends with a prom.

She has a loyal following from lots of fans; but one fan has taken it to far. Not happy that Mima has left Cham, this way to loyal fan starts to effects Mima's life, molding it to his vision. Though Mima has her own problems. With threats from her fan, she starts to lose the plot, unable to distinguish between reality and imagination. Though Mima tries to battle on, starting her movie career. Much in the vain of Jodie Foster, Mima has a scene in the movie where she is raped. From this her fan starts killing people involved with the movie; in a real bloody fashion.When you start to watch this, you may feel this is just a simple drama about change, but this is so much more. This is a dark, twist psychological thriller about perfection in the eye of the beholder. Much like whats going on in Mima's mind, you cant tell what is really happening or just imagined.Much like the series Paranioa Agent; also by Satoshi Kon, this deals with change, gossip, the effect of society spreading rumors, escaping perfection and an inverted spin on Stockholm syndrome. With a lot of red herrings throw all over the place, this slowly builds to one great revelation. Its much like the old saying, Don't trust anyone.This is abit of a slow burn to begin with, but it does quickly picks up the pace. The animation is detailed, yet very simplistic. This also has one of the most haunting scores i've heard in a long time. Using a low key violin, with a looping hum and a very tribal chant, it will be in your head days after you've listened to it.If you like this movie, i highly recommend the series Paranioa Agent, as it runs very parallel with this. The only thing wrong with this movie is that its not very long; only about 80mins, but it would have been annoying if it got dragged out to much.This is one of the best thrillers you'll see in a long time, just don't let the animation stop you.

I came across this movie quite by chance. I like suspense movies and I watched Charade starring Audrey and Cary Grant. Audrey's acting in that movie impressed me so I decided to watch Roman holiday too. Too be very frank I was not really looking forward to watching this movie. Like most people of this generation I dislike black and white movies.Man was I wrong. I have never seen a movie, which had so much romance, comedy and emotional drama. It would be fair to say that magic was created in this movie. The plot I guess everyone knows, a young princes tired of her regulated life runs away and hooks up with a reporter (Gregory Peck) for a day of fun in Rome. The reporter lies to her that he is a businessman and she lies to him about her true identity. They both have fun visiting Rome's historic places. But the reporter has a hidden agenda. He wants to write a story on the princess's escapades in Rome and enlists the help of his photographer friend (Albert). Things work according to plan for the reporter until he finds that he is really starting to fall in love with the princess.The story line may appear to be simple but take my word for it that Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn create magic and the movie will take a hold over you like nothing else you have ever seen. This is Audrey's best movie and the only movie she got an Oscar for and she was never so charming, innocent and beautiful as she is in this movie.One of the reviewers has suggested that Cary Grant would have been ideal for the role that Gregory Peck plays. I only have to say this to the devotees of Cary Grant that he would never have worked as a romantic lead in this movie. He was 50 years old at the time this movie was made and the sight of him cavorting around with a girl half his age would have removed from the movie it's romantic element. It would have become perhaps a slightly funnier movie but without the heart wrenching almost magical hold it now has. Also it is my humble opinion after seeing Charade that Cary Grant is too suave to play the role of a struggling reporter convincingly.History has already spoken; this movie is regarded as one of the all time greats, why would we want to change something, which is already perfect. Gregory Peck is ideal for the role of the reporter, he is incredibly handsome in the movie, a kind of man a young girl could fall in love with even after being with him only for a few hours. In this movie, Gregory Peck acts his heart out, especially at the end and he has a wonderfully chemistry with Audrey, which is the reason this movie still seems so fresh and charming even after 50 years.This is one of those rare movies that works across cultural and national borders. I was surprised to learn that according to a poll in Japan even after so many years Roman Holiday still is the number one foreign movie of all time.This movie is simply the best.

What if I had these powers.....? Really fun movie. I somewhat recognize the great American actress Betty Davis and I somewhat recognized the great British or English actor Christopher Lee and thought nothing whatsoever about whether this was beneath them or not. Why should I? I enjoyed their participation in the showing of this story. Now here comes Die beste freudin and his miserable seeming know it all comments ( I know this is an open forum). What I don't understand is why do you suggest having to view another work of said actor's repertoire when this was the work said actor or actress was involved in? I am critical of what I watch. But, the two movies, and this coming from a Disney in the mid-70s and post-star wars, were\/are two films that somehow brought in those necessary elements one it has to have participation of the viewer and 2 it has to be fun. I'm talking about Escape from witch mountain and the unexpected sequel, Returm from witch mountain.

The first time I saw this movie as an adolescent, I didn't ask myself this question. Early on, Mrs. Robinson was sexy and mysterious. I wanted Ben to sleep with her. Then I was ready to forget all about her when Ben met her daughter Elaine. I fell in love with Elaine, and from then on wanted Ben and Elaine to live happily ever after. I started to hate Mrs. Robinson, because she tried to keep them apart. At the end, (spoiler alert!) when the camera shows her silently cursing as Ben breaks up Elaine's shotgun wedding, I felt a vindictive pleasure.It's different for me now. My mind fixes on the stilted hotel room conversation between Mrs. Robinson and Ben. She keeps Ben at arm's length with distant answers to his naive questions about her life. Ben doesn't see her face here, but we do. And we have a chance (one that I missed on my first viewing) to see much more clearly than Ben how much Mrs. Robinson is actually revealing about herself.She married Mr. Robinson in an era before The Pill and legal abortion. They had sex in Mr. Robinson's Ford and the pregnant, future Mrs. Robinson had little choice. For the sake of petty bourgeois respectability, they got married, and Mrs. Robinson began playing the role assigned to her of wife, mother, and cocktail party attendee.Mrs. Robinson tragically made a deal with her devil. She will make her husband breakfast every morning. She will smile graciously at social engagements with his business associates and their wives. She will drown her sorrows in alcohol. She will distract herself from her boredom by having an affair with young Benjamin--perhaps not her first. And if anything were to upset the uneasy balance of this, she may be expected to sacrifice her own daughter on the same altar (literally) of social expectations.Elaine escapes her mother's fate. Mrs. Robinson screams, It's too late! as Elaine and Ben are fleeing the church, but Elaine answers, Not for me! Too bad nobody tells Mrs. Robinson that it's not too late for her, either.The only problem with the film is Elaine's character. After Ben stupidly humiliates her at the burlesque club on their first date, we suddenly cut to the now happy couple chatting away at a burger joint. What happened in between? Why didn't Ben's cruel behavior end the date right there? The filmmakers don't seem to know. Elaine runs away with Ben at the end without ever mentioning that it might have hurt her when he broke up her family. It's another inexplicable, unearned forgiveness. What real woman acts like Elaine does in this movie? How could someone so flighty and spineless make the stand that Elaine does at the end of the movie? It's as if the filmmakers, like Ben, don't know how to behave themselves around a pretty girl.I would understand if this ruins the movie for some viewers. I personally can forgive the filmmakers because, even if they don't understand Elaine, they understand Ben perfectly and show a surprising level of (accidental?) insight into Mrs. Robinson. These strengths, along with a whole series of unforgettable visual moments, help me to appreciate the film's satire and philosophy.Director Mike Nichols has said that the last scene in the bus was more or less an accident. Bewilderen by Nichols' fierce directions, the actors gradually stopped laughing and started looking around blankly, not knowing what to do next. It was inspired for Nichols to decide to keep these reactions. By getting on that bus, Elaine and Ben made a thrilling getaway. But where are they going? They don't know. They're young and they still have a lot of things to figure out. Hence the stares. This ending alone earns this film classic status. At their age, neither Elaine nor Ben is ready to make any sort of lifelong commitment, let alone the carefully calculated marriage and career commitments that their parents expect them to make. And they sense something artificial, something plastic, about their world that they find abhorrent. That's the rebellious thread that so many viewers have identified with while watching the movie. Mrs. Robinson's tragedy is the role she reluctantly plays in propping up the institutions that Elaine and Ben rebel against. Mrs. Robinson would stand to gain a lot from the very same freedom that Elaine and Ben seek, but do not know how to find.
