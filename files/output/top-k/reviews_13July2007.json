Numerous sequels and millions of dollars of box-office money later, I believe Maltins words at this point are irrelevant. This movie was a genuine shocker to me, Sean Cunningham had previous experience in trauma\/make you feel creeped out flicks working with legendary filmmaker Wes Craven on The Last House on The Left which is probably more terrifying than Friday the 13th but Cunningham showed in this movie that he hadn't lost his touch nor flair for filmaking yet. Betsy Palmer turns in a great performance as the obsessed\/oppressed mother of a child who drowned as a boy. Adrienne King does a good job as Alice (the main character) and we can't forget good 'ol Kevin Bacon, we love ya man. This movie really got the slasher flick ball rollin' real quick, many greats followed such as The Burning The Prowler Nightmare on Elm Street and so on and so forth. I personally prefer the 2nd installment (part 2) because of the inclusion of Jason but this movie still gives me creeps.

I had seen such a thing about evaluation of life I have never seen before.The story is really quirky, keeps your mind moving from the first minute to the last one. Apparently, it is found by some of the people, who have seen this film, freak as they had been expecting something utterly different. Personally, I got the point and I am really happy with it. There are some quotes I am really keen on, like The sweet is never really sweet without a sour., or Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around. Besides, I love the sound editing which conveyed supremely the melancholic atmosphere and ambivalent ardour of Vanilla Sky.After all, without a fine directing (which is not flawless though!) and a superb acting it all would not have been so fantastic. Tom Cruise proved he is not lost, he did a great job just like in Jerry Maguire which is directed by Cameron Crowe as well as Vanilla Sky. Cameron Diaz has never been a favourite actress of mine, sometimes I find her especially annoying but the role as a stalker fits her very well.

Sidney Lumet grabbed the point of film-making in this movie, made a genuine, unprecedented and essential classic masterpiece. What is virtuosity, if not shooting a meaningful discussion in the 90% of a movie in a room?! There is no strong acting or outstanding camera work, but everyone shares equally in setting up this incomparable courtroom drama. What an editing, what a great simple base story! The release year of the film is 1957 and I think it is a perfect timing because from my viewpoint it refers to communism, and people's disbelief in it. I mean by that that not everything is what is looks like, and it is easy to agree with the majority on obvious evidences.

Disney tells this story with its personal touch and classic humor.I don't know if the Disney version is totally faithful to the real story, but that's not the point.Arthur, called Wart by Sir Ector (his adoptive father) and Kay (Sir Ector's son), is overworked and humiliated by them both. Wart is almost like a Cinderella boy. But despite these problems, he remains optimistic and still dreams about being a great warrior and a knight's squire. Somehow Wart was the inspiration for the character Taran from The Black Cauldron.In the meantime, he meets the powerful but clumsy and hilarious wizard Merlin, who wants to give him education and culture. Merlin believes that pure strength means nothing when a person has no brain.Together, Merlin and Wart live great adventures, funny moments and Merlin teaches everything he knows to Wart.

Despite having the extra money and time not wasted on producing a killer screenplay, they'll all have tiny budgets and gaps in the story where the commercials go. And oh yes, they will be made-for-TV - the kiss of death for any movie project as far as I'm concerned. This was the kind of prejudice that almost made me avoid watching this movie when my Better Half threw in the DVD. So it says something when I found my attention diverted to this harrowing and beautifully shot drama based on a horrifying true story.In 1972, a plane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team was crossing the Andes when their plane crashed in bad weather in the mountains. A number were killed and the survivors quickly began to realise that the unforgiving weather, lack of supplies and a called-off rescue mission would mean certain death. But some weren't ready to give up without a fight, meaning that they would have to overcome impossible odds just to survive. Faced into an unimaginable situation, what lengths would they go to in order not just to survive but to escape the icy grip of the Andes? Looking and feeling the business, Alive is a genuine triumph of film-making. Filmed high up in the mountains with little else to see besides snow and rocks, it forces home the hopelessness of the unfortunate souls trapped up there. Featuring a largely unknown cast, the horror of their predicament is all the more real. Ironically, the person who dispels the illusion that this is drama and not documentary is the biggest star on screen - Ethan Hawke, though his performance is as faultless as the rest. So with a truly inspiring story of how difficult the human spirit is to defeat, an jaw-dropping vision of brutal isolation and hardship and a cast who give it their everything, why doesn't Alive score higher than it does? The simple reason is that despite the story and everything going for it, Alive is the sort of film that you can only watch once. It reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption, another great film with a rousing finale and a touching tale of spirit but a film that I have little or no resolve to watch again. Watch them once, certainly, but after the magic has gone, what's left? The other thing that works against this film is it's sheer unrelenting sense of disaster. At times, you can't help but feel that it is just too much, even for a film like this. It's just one thing after another but of course, it did happen exactly as you see - the survivors who worked as technical advisers made sure of that. In short, this film is a stunning testament to those who survived the most traumatic of experiences and a solemn memorial to those who lost their lives. Alive is a real achievement, both in its making and its watching.

Watch them once, certainly, but after the magic has gone, what's left? The other thing that works against this film is it's sheer unrelenting sense of disaster. At times, you can't help but feel that it is just too much, even for a film like this. It's just one thing after another but of course, it did happen exactly as you see - the survivors who worked as technical advisers made sure of that. In short, this film is a stunning testament to those who survived the most traumatic of experiences and a solemn memorial to those who lost their lives. Alive is a real achievement, both in its making and its watching.

Despite having the extra money and time not wasted on producing a killer screenplay, they'll all have tiny budgets and gaps in the story where the commercials go. And oh yes, they will be made-for-TV - the kiss of death for any movie project as far as I'm concerned. This was the kind of prejudice that almost made me avoid watching this movie when my Better Half threw in the DVD. So it says something when I found my attention diverted to this harrowing and beautifully shot drama based on a horrifying true story.In 1972, a plane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team was crossing the Andes when their plane crashed in bad weather in the mountains. A number were killed and the survivors quickly began to realise that the unforgiving weather, lack of supplies and a called-off rescue mission would mean certain death. But some weren't ready to give up without a fight, meaning that they would have to overcome impossible odds just to survive. Faced into an unimaginable situation, what lengths would they go to in order not just to survive but to escape the icy grip of the Andes? Looking and feeling the business, Alive is a genuine triumph of film-making. Filmed high up in the mountains with little else to see besides snow and rocks, it forces home the hopelessness of the unfortunate souls trapped up there. Featuring a largely unknown cast, the horror of their predicament is all the more real. Ironically, the person who dispels the illusion that this is drama and not documentary is the biggest star on screen - Ethan Hawke, though his performance is as faultless as the rest. So with a truly inspiring story of how difficult the human spirit is to defeat, an jaw-dropping vision of brutal isolation and hardship and a cast who give it their everything, why doesn't Alive score higher than it does? The simple reason is that despite the story and everything going for it, Alive is the sort of film that you can only watch once. It reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption, another great film with a rousing finale and a touching tale of spirit but a film that I have little or no resolve to watch again.

However, beyond that this is nothing to hold it up. I don't care how great the acting is, there's just no real plot. OK, there is a plot but it's totally beside the point.There's a heist that involves a group of criminals who have to split up and meet up later. An undercover cop who is in on the heist watches as another cop gets tortured. Tempers flare amongst the criminals and one gets shot. Despite being criminals and not really knowing each other, some show loyalty. That's pretty much it.Some friends have told me that I missed the part in the end where you hear the cops show up and gun some of the criminals down. That doesn't change much. I'm not compelled in any way to really care for any of the characters. There's not really any background on any of them. There's no substance. It's all one-dimensional even down to the stupid mr. pink mr. white names they're given. Twelve Angry Men is an awesome film that does the opposite of this and uses pretty much one boring room as the entire setting. Yet it's interesting because the plot is good and it's all about the characters. Breakfast Club is a totally different film that does the same. Both make more lasting statements than are made here. The most memorable of which deals with lyrics from a Madonna song and Michael Madsen's almost comical Are you gonna bark all day...? ooh i'm a bad-ass line.No one will ever make a movie that can beat Tombstone in that category. And yeah that movie is all style, but there's still a story to it. The characters resemble people.The fact is that Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen and most of the rest are all great actors. They all play their parts well and exhibit that one color as it were. There are some cool lines here and there. The music is great. The violence is sort of inventive (using the old trick of letting your imagination fill in the blanks IS brilliant). The rest of it is...well I don't see anything going on. There is no rest of it as far as I'm concerned.

If only the first half had been so terrible--there was actually a touch of substance for once in one of Quentin's movies, I should've known it wouldn't last--I would've turned it off then and not wasted my time.The 4 rating is mostly due to Cheech Marin's 30 second onslaught of hilarity and the acting chops of all but Quentin in the beginning.
