He was shot and left for dead, but now he has returned to New York and he is a little upset that his money has been stolen from him and he wants it back. Now it is no more Mr Nice Guy as Mr Porter starts to track down those who stole his money from him.Payback is a gangster movie with numerous people all trying to kill Mr Porter. There is the syndicate, which has become the organisation, which has Mr Porter's money which it has no intention of returning; also there are the Yakuza, whom Mr Porter originally stole the money off. Val is the guy who turned on Porter, but he dies quickly because he is stupid and Mr Porter is really smart. When Val does not return Porter's money, Porter decides to go after the Syndicate's bosses, Carter and Ferguson, and the big boss, Bronson. Along with all of this are two crooked cops and a small time drug dealer who wants to get in on the Syndicate's action.Mr Porter is a really smart guy, one has to be to go from near death to crawl one's way up to enact revenge. He knows how to get things and how to use them to the best of his advantage. He also knows how to get into people's minds and to think the way they do. As such Mr Porter is the type of character I like because they are smart and are always out-thinking their opponents. It is something that I could never become, but I do admire people with that ability. I guess the catch is that either Mr Porter is really smart, or those who he is dealing with are really dumb.The thing that is cool about this movie is that it is funny. It is the type of movie with a lot of wit and the occasional clever one liner. I simply liked the way Porter conducted himself, and how he was never concerned with those blackmailing him because he is able to handle himself. If he wasn't then he would not be alive. The previews suggest that he is a good guy, but he is really not - Porter is a crook who is dealing with crooks.This movie seems to borrow things from gangster movies, and the scenes are all dark and dirty. We are not looking at a good against bad, we are looking at gangsters fighting gangsters, and as such the scenes reflect that. Even the very wealthy scenes have the feeling of a dark and dirty reality. This movie is cool, and one of Mel Gibson's better ones.

That was a little annoying, but for some reason I wanted to see this movie so I managed to talk my friend into it and we went to see it and in the end I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a couple of highwaymen, Plunkett and Maclaine. Plunkett was once an alchemist but after is business failed and his wife died, he took up highway robbery to earn enough money to sail to America. Things were going slow until he ran into Captain Maclaine, a noble who loved to drink, wrench, and gamble - and because of this he had thrown away all of his money and was now in debtor's gaol. Maclaine doesn't want anything to do with Plunkett at first because Maclaine is a noble and Plunkett is a commoner, but reality comes home when Maclaine falls over in front of some nobles and is scorned by them. It is then that he realises that he is no longer in their midsts and is determined to claw his way back.There is also a character named Chance. He is a brutal man whose job is to enforce the law, and he does this by any means possible. At this time there is debate over whether to enact a police force or not - the argument is that a police force will take freedom away from the people - but at this time the people are so poor that they have little freedom anyway; and now the rich are being targeted by Plunkett and Maclaine and none feel safe.Yet they have earned the name of the Gentlemen Highwaymen namely because Maclaine is so nice to the ladies when he robs them. At first he robs the girl that he has fallen for and apologises as he is robbing her, but he has such a smooth mouth that he takes the title with glee and begins to play upon it inciting the imaginations of the noble and the commoners alike. The women swoon over them but the men hate them. Maclaine milks it for all its worth, because he is a man that loves fame, women, and people taking notice of him. Plunkett simply wants to get to America and plans on quitting when he has enough money. Unfortunately that is never going to happen because Maclaine is too interested in stealing Plunkett's money and wasting it. As it is said, there is no honour among thieves.Maclaine does nothing to deserve Plunkett's mercy. At first he manages to get them out of gaol, but as Maclaine becomes more obsessed with his partying, the original goal vanishes. Anyway, Maclaine has no intention of going to America - all of the fun is in England. The women, his legend, and the parties. Plunkett wants a new life while Maclaine simply wants to continue living the life he has. He can't afford it, but that does not matter because he will simply steal more.One final character that I must discuss is Rochester - he is a very quirky character. It is implied, but never stated, that he is bi-sexual. The quote is do you still swing both ways?; No, I swing all ways! There are numerous suggestions to homosexuality but it is never stated - this is left for our imagination. What we are given though is a class of debaucherers. The nobles live a life far above their means and enjoy it at other people's expense. We see a society here where the poor live in the mud - and this is not hidden as we see Maclaine go from the very poor to the very rich, but even so there is still a dirty feel to the movie - as if the nobles, even though they live is luxury, are still incredibly dirty on the inside.The interesting thing about this movie is that it is set in the 18th century, but the soundtrack is very modern - almost 90's.

In Snow Falling on Cedars, a Japanese-American in the Northwest is accused of murder because a white fisherman is found dead in his fishing net not long after World War II. The setting is in the wake of racial animosity because of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The case is largely brought forth because of prejudicial attitudes prevalent at the time rather than strong evidence. (Ironically, German-Americans did not suffer the same fate as the Japanese during the same period.) The brilliance of the film, which I assume is more or less faithful to the book, is its handling of several separate but intertwined stories. At the forefront is the murder trial of Kazuo Miyamoto, a young Japanese-American in the 1950's who fought on the American side of World War II, played brilliantly understated by Rick Yune. He is accused of murdering Carl Heine, a fellow fisherman, who now has land previously owned by Japanese who were forced to give it up (as well as most of their possessions) when they were unjustly forced into interment camps on the West Coast.The other stories involve Hatsue Miyamoto (played wonderfully by Youki Kudoh) and Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke in possibly his best performance since Reality Bites) as star-crossed lovers before adulthood. We learn, largely through flash-backs, that the American white boy and Japanese girl met and fell in love on the eve of Japanese-American internment. Their story parallels the later court case, and the loss of their relationship is because of the racial divides imposed by the US Government, fearing that all Japanese-Americans were suspect because of their ancestry, rather than any evidence they were actually secretly in conspiracy with the Japanese Empire. The love between Hatsue and Ishmael is told through flash-backs. Hatsue is now the wife of the accused, and Ishmael has followed in the footsteps of his father and become a reporter and journalist. We learn that Ishmael still has strong feelings for the woman who once loved him when they were but children, but he is side-lined from their lives.Like Mockingbird, Cedars is largely about the tragedy of prejudice and racism. One aspect of the story which emerges, possibly not consciously, is how the Japanese-Americans are largely similar to their white counterparts. They like much of the popular American music of the 1940's, they play games, they enjoy good food and wine. Of course, their interests in Buddhism are different, but I believe the point of the story is that the similarities between cultures are often overlooked in favor of our few differences. Although most of the focus is on the white community being wary of their Japanese neighbors, in a poignant scene, the young Hatsue is told by her good-intentioned mother that her daughter should not look at white boys, and should marry a Japanese boy. So prejudice cuts in both directions, often with tragic results. Some of the most heinous crimes in human history are perpetrated out of fear. And if someday, we could let go of our fears of the other, maybe the world would be a better place.

So prejudice cuts in both directions, often with tragic results. Some of the most heinous crimes in human history are perpetrated out of fear. And if someday, we could let go of our fears of the other, maybe the world would be a better place.

But worst of all, they don't have enough interest in seeing such a film because they simply can't stomach the thought of no sound coming from the actor's mouths. However, for those who do know what silent films are, the name that first comes to mind when talking about silent movies is usually Charlie Chaplin, and for good reason. I can't think of any silent filmmaker other than Charlie Chaplin whose works have still been able to please nearly everybody who's watched them several years later. So it makes it all the more interesting to note that his last and greatest silent film, Modern Times (1936), isn't really a silent film. Although there is a musical score and a couple bits of sound, it isn't even a sound film either. Basically, Modern Times is a silent film and a sound film both at the same time, but most importantly, it's a unique piece of art. Modern Times follows a factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) who loses his monotonous job on the assembly line after suffering a mental breakdown. He recovers from that breakdown, but he's soon mistaken for the leader of a Communist demonstration and is then thrown in jail. After he prevents a jail outbreak, he's released early for good behavior. While he's searching for a new job, he comes across an orphaned gamine girl (Paulette Goddard) who has recently been experiencing bad luck just like him. With no one else in their lives, these two stick together and do what they can to make it through a modern society in which more emphasis is being placed on industrialization than on the individual. I don't recall seeing a film that blended comedy and drama quite as well as Modern Times. This truly is a film that's side-splittingly funny and heartbreakingly sad both at the same time. Though it's highly unfortunate that Chaplin's character accidentally lands in jail as many times as he does, life outside of the jail cell for him is almost just as harsh and unforgiving. He has significant trouble at performing his jobs correctly and he keeps getting fired from job after job as a result, and yet he still maintains a generally positive attitude and still puts in his best effort anyways. To create a likable character with those characteristics is no easy task especially considering that this is someone who lands in jail multiple times. But not only does writer-director Charlie Chaplin manage to pull off that tricky challenge, we're also able to relate to the main protagonist in more ways than one. An example of an excellent scene that shows the factory worker's humanity is on the first and last day of his new job at the shipyards. He has to find a large wedge for his boss identical to the one in his hand. Without ruining the joke of that scene, let's just say he finds such a wedge in the wrong place. There are similar scenes like that throughout that make Modern Times such a charming silent film. Another classic scene is when the factory worker has to test out the feeding machine. This feeding machine, of course, is designed to feed the workers their food while they are still on the job, so the company's production increases. And while this scene is very funny and executed exceedingly well, it makes us all the more grateful that no such machine exists in today's workforce due to its unintended consequences. But there's more to Modern Times than the straightforward hilarity and humanity that's melded into it. There's an important and life-changing message about society in general that Chaplin gets across very well. Modern Times is a film that emphasizes the idea that every person is different and that humans aren't machines like society wants them to be. No matter how hard we try, we all make mistakes and we can't please everyone we come across. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, we all come from different backgrounds, and we all have our own unique skills and theories. This film basically reassures even the least talented individuals that not only will everything still be okay in the end, but that it's also okay to stand out from the crowd. Chaplin expresses this encouraging idea to his audience perfectly through well thought out writing with brilliant character development and plotting, and excellent direction that blends perfect comedic timing with tender emotion. I loved Paulette Goddard as the orphaned gamine who accompanies the factory worker through tough times. I admired how active her character was and how she does whatever she can to either survive or help the factory worker out. By letting her do stuff like stealing bread, finding some sort of shelter, or even landing a job, she becomes a more three- dimensional character and easier for anyone to identify with her. I'm uncertain whether the relationship between the Goddard character and the Chaplin character is a romance or a friendship. But whatever it is, their on-screen chemistry works well for me. The fact that they're loyal and content with each other's company makes me warm up to them instantly. Modern Times was a very special film in my life the first time I watched it, and it still is now. It was the first silent film I'd ever seen, and I couldn't have been more blessed with this film having that distinctive honor. I've only seen a few silent films since then such as City Lights (1931) and The Artist (2011). Though the silent films I just mentioned are well crafted in their own right, it's still going to be exceedingly difficult finding a better silent film that Modern Times. It's funny, sad, relevant, relatable, heartwarming, and easily one of the all-time greatest films.

No matter how hard we try, we all make mistakes and we can't please everyone we come across. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, we all come from different backgrounds, and we all have our own unique skills and theories. This film basically reassures even the least talented individuals that not only will everything still be okay in the end, but that it's also okay to stand out from the crowd. Chaplin expresses this encouraging idea to his audience perfectly through well thought out writing with brilliant character development and plotting, and excellent direction that blends perfect comedic timing with tender emotion. I loved Paulette Goddard as the orphaned gamine who accompanies the factory worker through tough times. I admired how active her character was and how she does whatever she can to either survive or help the factory worker out. By letting her do stuff like stealing bread, finding some sort of shelter, or even landing a job, she becomes a more three- dimensional character and easier for anyone to identify with her. I'm uncertain whether the relationship between the Goddard character and the Chaplin character is a romance or a friendship. But whatever it is, their on-screen chemistry works well for me. The fact that they're loyal and content with each other's company makes me warm up to them instantly. Modern Times was a very special film in my life the first time I watched it, and it still is now. It was the first silent film I'd ever seen, and I couldn't have been more blessed with this film having that distinctive honor. I've only seen a few silent films since then such as City Lights (1931) and The Artist (2011). Though the silent films I just mentioned are well crafted in their own right, it's still going to be exceedingly difficult finding a better silent film that Modern Times. It's funny, sad, relevant, relatable, heartwarming, and easily one of the all-time greatest films.

But worst of all, they don't have enough interest in seeing such a film because they simply can't stomach the thought of no sound coming from the actor's mouths. However, for those who do know what silent films are, the name that first comes to mind when talking about silent movies is usually Charlie Chaplin, and for good reason. I can't think of any silent filmmaker other than Charlie Chaplin whose works have still been able to please nearly everybody who's watched them several years later. So it makes it all the more interesting to note that his last and greatest silent film, Modern Times (1936), isn't really a silent film. Although there is a musical score and a couple bits of sound, it isn't even a sound film either. Basically, Modern Times is a silent film and a sound film both at the same time, but most importantly, it's a unique piece of art. Modern Times follows a factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) who loses his monotonous job on the assembly line after suffering a mental breakdown. He recovers from that breakdown, but he's soon mistaken for the leader of a Communist demonstration and is then thrown in jail. After he prevents a jail outbreak, he's released early for good behavior. While he's searching for a new job, he comes across an orphaned gamine girl (Paulette Goddard) who has recently been experiencing bad luck just like him. With no one else in their lives, these two stick together and do what they can to make it through a modern society in which more emphasis is being placed on industrialization than on the individual. I don't recall seeing a film that blended comedy and drama quite as well as Modern Times. This truly is a film that's side-splittingly funny and heartbreakingly sad both at the same time. Though it's highly unfortunate that Chaplin's character accidentally lands in jail as many times as he does, life outside of the jail cell for him is almost just as harsh and unforgiving. He has significant trouble at performing his jobs correctly and he keeps getting fired from job after job as a result, and yet he still maintains a generally positive attitude and still puts in his best effort anyways. To create a likable character with those characteristics is no easy task especially considering that this is someone who lands in jail multiple times. But not only does writer-director Charlie Chaplin manage to pull off that tricky challenge, we're also able to relate to the main protagonist in more ways than one. An example of an excellent scene that shows the factory worker's humanity is on the first and last day of his new job at the shipyards. He has to find a large wedge for his boss identical to the one in his hand. Without ruining the joke of that scene, let's just say he finds such a wedge in the wrong place. There are similar scenes like that throughout that make Modern Times such a charming silent film. Another classic scene is when the factory worker has to test out the feeding machine. This feeding machine, of course, is designed to feed the workers their food while they are still on the job, so the company's production increases. And while this scene is very funny and executed exceedingly well, it makes us all the more grateful that no such machine exists in today's workforce due to its unintended consequences. But there's more to Modern Times than the straightforward hilarity and humanity that's melded into it.

There is also 2 things I can guarantee about this movie for you. 1) You will be surprised at the star power this man got and 2) you will be in shock at their performances.So I'll skip the plot because it's about as interesting as watching someone read an entire book silently. I'll talk about the star power... Wow. That's the only word to sum it up - Wow. I mean they got Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch, Marlon Wayans and Richard O'Brien... Also not one gives a good performance. Marlon Wayans looks like he is channeling Chris Tucker with his role (of which if he was intended to be annoying - that would be great!), Tora Birch looked like she wanted to be somewhere else (to be fair, THAT I can understand), Richard O'Brien delivers his lines in a laughable way and Jeremy Irons... I know he can carry a bad movie but here... This is like a Saturday Morning Cartoon villain acting as an over-the-top villain - That's how over-the-top he is.Well Now I'm done with the acting now lets go on the technical side of things... I'm not one to judge effects but I've seen more realistic effects from Doom. You really have to be told this cost $45 million to make. It looks like something Syfy would release. The establishing shots are also bad... Just have a CGI artist draw a building... We don't need to spiral up the outside.Now the story side... Rule-101 We CAN'T get emotionally invested in a character that's channeling Chris Tucker through his performance... We're supposed to care for Marlon Wayans' character once he dies (I'm not kidding you have about 4 scenes where it's supposed to force this down your throat) but instead of crying when he dies, you cheer! Not to mention it's the same with Isthmir. You can't get invested in a world that confuses you all the time and has you scratch your heads.So how does this movie hold up? I'd say it's so bad it's funny. I mean I know a lot of the fans of the game were angry at the movie and I can see why loud and clear despite me never playing the game. It's just one of the movies that you just hate and like at the same time. Much like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Troll 2, The Room and your standard episode of Agents Of SHIELD it's just one of those movies that are horrible yet fun to watch.

The opening scenes and music lead me to think of it as a horror film with the playback of memory slides, and the quite mysterious music at the background. However, as the movie progresses, I quickly abandoned the idea of being a complete horror movie, but with the mysterious music playing throughout the film, I have to keep the idea that it is at least a thriller.The movie did not disappoint me. My attention was completely focused on the movie trying to not miss a scene. I did not try to solve it, I simply sat and tried to let the movie take me away. And I recommend that you watch it in that way too as that is the best way to experience any movie.I once tried to confirm to myself that everything happened is just a game. But there are so many scenes that happened that try to smash this idea. The cab into the water, any slower reaction, and Nicholas could really be drowned in the water. The shootings (without even guessing that it is loaded with planks) that I thought could have killed Nicholas. The confession made by Christine when Nicholas was drugged. There are so many risky places that could lead to an early end to the game. For example, what will happen if Nicholas decided to not follow Christine and let the cops coming from the CRS car to arrest him? What would happen if the planks shot him before he could get away from so many scenes? What would happen if Nicholas (at a very small chance) tries to expose his experience to the public? Just to give myself an explanation, I guess I can say things happened the way they were, and hence they worked. But those are exactly what caused the plot- twists of the movie -- to let you think that it is, and let you think again that maybe it is not.I give the movie only 8 points because I think the end, the final twist, happened too fast. Assuming the gun from the book is really under control as well and it is loaded with planks, there are still a number of questions I have.First of all, assume the CRS guessed that Nicholas would open fire under such pressure, why is the back of Conrad's shirt also dyed with blood? I cannot find a proper reason why would the back also contain a blood pack even though that did make it realistic if Nicholas were to check Conrad's back right after Nicholas shot him. But I think the chance of Nicholas shoots Conrad, goes up to the body to examine, and flips Conrad over to check the back as well, is too low. The fact that Nicholas did not check Conrad's body, but they still showed Conrad's back of the shirt have the blood pack is quite intriguing.Secondly, the guy said he would have pushed Nicholas down the building if he didn't jump himself. It seemed like a nice add-on to have, but having Nicholas drop from that high, I can only say it is lucky that he fell back first onto the lights. If he fell face first, god knows what may happen to him. Also what if he jumped from the other two sides? Maybe that place only has one side?Thirdly, with both the top two ignored, the turn at the end happened way too quickly. One minute before we are grasping at the death of Nicholas, and the next minute a party begins. It explains it well, but I find it hard to accept. If it were to happen a little slower with a few more transition I would find it more pleasurable.With all that being said, I will give the movie 10 out of 10 if not I don't think the ending is wrapped up careful enough.

One's Ted, a sales executive for a Chicago based multinational, the other's Fred, who works for the US military.A comedy of manners, Barcelona's first half watches as Ted embraces the optimistic self-help models of Ben Franklin and Dale Carnegie (The classic literature of self-improvement really is improving!). Fred, meanwhile, clashes with a Spanish populace which detests US militarism. Both characters are cheerleaders of corporate life, particularly Ted, who spews corporate maxims and displays a religious zeal for the culture of sales. If the film's first half ridicules American arrogance and bluster, the film's second half does the opposite. Stereotypes of American religiosity become something softer and more sympathetic, and the film's Spanish characters, who throughout the film disparage our duo, learn to realise that their own hate has far reaching effects. Other scenes exist to complicate stereotypes, like one in which Ted reads the Bible whilst dancing suggestively and another in which Fred plays to European faux sophistication by inventing outlandish stories about the Marquis de Sade. These oppositional forces &#x96; puritanism and pop, sophistication and vulgarity &#x96; become emblematic of American and European cultures that are equally contradictory.For most of its running time, Barcelona portrays Fred as a monomaniacal patriot who is obsessed with fighting for freedom, defending democracy and who is woefully ignorant of American history. Anti-Americanism has its roots in sexual impotence, he says proudly, insulting every local who criticises his ethos. Earlier he is accosted by a group who call him fascist, a term which Fred appropriates and flips around. I comb my hair and wear a coat and tie and I'm a fascist? he says sarcastically. Then surely fascism must be something good!Later, due to an article published by a left-wing journalist, Fred is attacked and almost killed (the journalist asserts that Fred works for the CIA and was sent to Europe to crush progressive unionism). Fred's earlier arrogance isn't forgiven, but Stillman nevertheless condemns the reflexive anti-Americanism which spurred the attack. Elsewhere Fred's girlfriend Marta, a Spanish woman who routinely insults Americans (What would it be like to live in America, with all its crime, consumerism and vulgarity?), is taken down a peg. Stillman portrays her as a fool (she thinks US uniforms are party costumes), a hypocrite (hates Americans but dates one), a thief (she borrows money from Americans) and then shows her being unfaithful. When you lived in Rhode Island to study English, Fred then asks her, was the crime and vulgarity really so bad? She shuts up, her anti-Americanism exposed as but a fashionable attitude. Later Stillman portrays Marta as a drug addict with a severe case of entitlement (I need that money, it's mine!). In other words, like a stereotypical conservative's stereotypical view of a stereotypical liberal.Stillman was brought up in a radically left-wing family. Some critics read his films as reactions against his upbringing, whilst others read his films as reactionary apologias for a certain type of conservatism. Because Stillman's tone is ironic, dry and his scripts happy to insult everyone, clear-cut readings of his films are almost impossible. We see this with the various anti-American characters in Barcelona. Their irresponsibility is condemned, but does this mean that Stillman is endorsing his two expats? More likely, Stillman is interested in showing how what we perceive to be warped politics and sexual behaviour stem from a form of moral relativism.

Maybe in adolescence, she was right. Fast forward to 10+ years later and I decide to check a DVD copy out of the library just for old times' sake for no real reason. Prior to now (I'm a 27-year-old single man), I have discovered lots of movies I was too young to see circa 1993...A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, The Terminator, Road Trip...OK, that movie didn't come out 'til 2000 and it's not an absolute classic like the first three, but you get the idea! I popped the movie into my player this evening to see if the movie held up. And wouldn't you know it...it does! In fact, I cried so much at the end, my ears are still moist half an hour after it ended.Truth be told, however, the first few minutes are pretty stupid, but it does show Chance and Sassy's resentment to one another, which is important to the story. The real magic comes when the three animals (especially Chance) realize what home and family really means when their child owners leave them on a farm. That's when they decide to make their escape and from there, it's an adventure that may be dangerous, but in the words of Sassy, I laugh at danger. The most touching scenes are Sassy finding her way back to Chance and Shadow after she was rescued from being drowned and Shadow finding the lost Molly in the woods. The touching musical score from Bruce Broughton is also a major factor.I'd like to note I work with pets sometimes, so I know how it would feel if one of them (or even all of them) just disappeared. My family's favourite cat died of old age in July 2011. As you can imagine, I was heartbroken, but at that time, I was sharing a house with a middle-aged couple who had two shihtzus, so before I went out to do my errands that day, I made sure to say hello to the two little dogs because although one of my family pets was gone, I had two other ones who could be a beacon of hope for me.No matter how old you are or what your tastes are or if you generally can't stand anything that comes from Disney, you seriously must see this film and you'll feel redeemed that way. And as piece of advice don't be afraid to let a song or a movie or a TV show turn on the waterworks for you; it means you have a soul.

And as piece of advice don't be afraid to let a song or a movie or a TV show turn on the waterworks for you; it means you have a soul.

This movie did not grip me, moreover I was waiting for it to end so I could go home and sleep.The plot is pretty basic.

I went in thinking that she was supposed to be a strong woman and when it turn out that she wasn't really that strong, I was somewhat disappointed.

Admittedly, I marveled at the unique comic genius of Andy Kaufman, and sadly we have seen no one like him since he left us. Andy was the absolute king of the put-on -- no entertainer has has ever done it better. And this movie says it in the comedic, sometimes raw and unnerving, manner in which it took place and as performed. Jim Carrey, an actor who delivers inconsistent performances, is simply outstanding in his dead-on portrayal of the physical and mental comedic genius Andy Kaufman. This movie beautifully exemplifies the two classic masks of good drama, which are Comedy and Tragedy. The fact that many actors in this movie depiction actually did know and work with Andy is also a testament to a unique comedic talent who left us too early. And thanks do Danny DeVito who worked with and knew Andy, for not only appearing in the movie but producing it as well. For those who never had the experience of seeing, when it was first aired, or who didn't appreciate his SNL performance of 'Mighty Mouse', for those who never saw or who didn't appreciate Kaufman's Elvis, for those who never saw or didn't appreciate Kaufman and Michael Richards on Fridays, and for those who cannot appreciate the show biz put-on that professional wresting is, you probably need not see this movie as you may never be able to comprehend all of it or appreciate it.

The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word perfection? Well, The Godfather parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely perfect in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the American Dream; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2?

Produced by David L. Wolpor and beautifully directed by John Guillermin the picture has, over the years, gained something of a cult status and besides being a great favourite with collectors is regarded as one of the more memorable war classics of cinema. Released through United Artists it was photographed in Panavision and colour to dazzling affect by Stanley Cortez and is underlined throughout with a super gutsy score by the always welcome Elmer Bernstein. Also of note is the location filming. It was filmed in 1968, not in Germany, but in Czechoslovakia which wonderfully doubled for Germany with the Remagen Bridge scenes shot at Davie on the Vitava River using the old bridge where fake towers were constructed.It is the closing weeks of WW2 and the only escape route for Germany's 15th. Army is across the Obercassell Bridge over the Rhine at Remagen. But Berlin wants it destroyed in case the Americans can put it to their own use. Germany's General Von Brock (Peter Van Eyck) instructs Major Paul Kreuger (Robert Vaughan) to blow it up but to delay its destruction as long as possible so as to facilitate most of the 75,000 retreating German troops who will be crossing the bridge. Meanwhile the Americans under acting C.O. Lt. Phil Hartman (George Segal) head towards the bridge to destroy it. But later however Brig. Gen. Shinner (E. G. Marshall) changes his mind and decides not to destroy it but to secure it instead. The picture ends with the Americans storming the bridge and taking it.Performances are superb from all concerned. Taking the lead is George Segal as the laid back cynical but dutiful C.O. Usually cast in romantic comedies this was a real departure for the actor and is the best thing he has ever done. Excellent too is Robert Vaughan as the ill fated German commander desperately trying first to save the bridge then failing to destroy it and Ben Gazzara as Angel the colourful brash and thieving Sergeant. Those in smaller roles are also outstanding like Bradford Dillman as the the self absorbed Major detested and distrusted by his company and the always impressive Peter van Eyck as the General of the German high command. This was to be Van Eyck's final screen appearance. He died the same year from Sepsis at the age of 54. And carrying the whole thing along is the rollicking score by the always pleasing Elmer Bernstein. Best known for his many scores for westerns the composer here turned in a powerful score of great depth and excitement. His main theme is a dramatic martial statement which segues into a reflective melancholy theme pointing up the plight of the many hapless refugees trying desperately to cross the bridge to safety and not forgetting the bold and engaging trumpet theme for the German Command. The score is Bernstein's best work for a war movie.THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is a gripping and exciting well produced war epic and hasn't dated at all since it was made in the sixties.
