Clerks was great, Mallrats was entertaining, Chasing Amy was perfect, and now comes Dogma. The word for this is... Perfect. Kevin Smith proves for the second time that he knows how to make a comedy hilarious, and thought provoking at the same time. Chasing Amy started out funny, and eventually, started making you think. The dialog in Dogma that makes you think, is all funny. It makes some daring, but really deep, and thoughtful points about religion, and makes you question God (in a good way).The film follows two angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck), and Loki (Matt Damon). They have been banished from heaven a long time ago, and for the past 1000 years, have been stranded in a place far worse than hell... Wisconsin. Until one day, the Catholic church makes a new law. Anyone who passes through the arches at a particular church, shall be forgiven for all their sins, and given a morally clean slate. The angels see this as a loophole to sneak back into heaven. What they don't know, is that if they pass through the arch, they'll destroy existence.In desperation, unable to find God (Alanis Morrisette), the angel who speaks for God, the Metatron (Alan Rickman), summons the reluctant last descendant of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), to track down and stop the angels from entering the church. She sets off on a quest, aided by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and the 13th apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock). This is a long movie, but it's so darn entertaining, that you won't want it to be over when it is. Jay and Silent Bob, Smith's recurring characters, have their biggest role yet. It's also their funniest (until Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Jay is hysterical. He's the kind of guy who you think is awesome, but also needs to get his ass kicked. And Matt Damon has his best role ever, as Loki, the former angel of death. In one scene, he and Bartleby are discussing their upcoming mass genocide right in front of the gun store owner. They intend to punish the staff of a children's show called Mooby the Golden Calf. They think the creators of the show are committing idolatry, but it's really just a fatal coincidence. This leads to the funniest scenes in the movie.The film always maintains it's light, comedic tone, even when the plot takes some rather serious turns. The blood-soaked finale proves to be one of the most suspenseful climaxes I've ever seen in a comedy, even if it does involve things like drunk angels, and Jay with a machine gun (don't ask). The film is often as thrilling and intense as Chasing Amy was sad and heart-wrenching. And any film maker who can combine those tones with such big laughs has to be a genius. Be warned though, Dogma is one of the most violent comedies I've ever seen. Though it doesn't ever seem to get acknowledged, the film contains surprisingly graphic stabbings, shootings, exploding heads, splattered... you get the picture. Squeamish beware. Also, screw the protesters, this is one of the most pro-God movie's I've seen. Though most bashers of this movie won't believe me, my faith really boosted when I saw this... maybe I'm alone, but I hope not.I award this show a full 10\/10.

The first one that got my attention was Paul Schrader's script for the ultra violent Rolling Thunder (1977) with William Devane. In that fairly sadistic movie, Devane is an honored Viet Nam Vet who's family is murdered by a gang of thugs searching for money he received as a hero. It had one scene that made many people leave the theaters, when his hand is forced down a garbage disposal with Devane still refusing to give in. He is then shot, but lives to take his ruthless revenge on the killers, with Tommy Lee Jones joining in to help him. Gruesome thriller, but this only set the stage for what was to come, which is The Exterminator.When I saw The Exterminator in the theaters in 1980, the movie was already denounced as a sleazy over-the-top crude exploitive graphic and gory worthless piece of crap. So right off, I knew this was MY kind of movie. And it was, the opening scenes of The Exterminator are impossible to forget, as three Ranger soldiers in Viet Nam are tied to stakes with the enemy trying to get them to talk by torture. When they don't, one of movies all time great special effects takes place, compliments of Stan Winston and Tom Burman. Almost in slow motion, a Viet Cong soldier takes a machete and decapitates one of the soldiers in the single best decapitation scene I have ever seen period. It is so realistic, and catches you off guard, that it etches in your mind the horror of it all. And in this new director's (James Glickenhaus) version DVD, nothing is spared, the scene is much longer and more graphic, and the other Viet Nam scenes are also much longer, as the other two Rangers make their escape. One of the two is John Eastland, portrayed by Robert Ginty in his best role ever. That's not saying much, because he never did anything close to this role. The story moves to modern times, and he's working with his Viet Nam buddy on the docks in New York. After his buddy is paralyzed by a band of thugs over some beer being stolen, Eastland goes on a rampage to exterminate the gang. He does in rather extraordinary means, and then goes after a big time gang boss in one of the more memorable scenes. He kidnaps the boss, takes him to a warehouse, and chains him up over a giant meat grinding machine. Eastland's idea is to take all the bosses money and give it to his buddy's family. When the boss withholds some information about a vicious dog in his home when Eastland goes to get the money, Eastland comes back to make hamburger meat out of the boss. That's after he dispatches the dog with an electric knife in a bloody fight. After that, Eastland turns into The Exterminator and notifys City Hall, he is taking on the bad guys, because the police are not doing their job. This puts Christopher George, as Detective James Dalton, on the trail of Eastland. It seems the CIA has gotten interested in this too, and wants Eastland found because it makes the current administration in Washington look bad too.In the meantime, Eastland comes across a young prostitute that has been brutally burned by a sadistic pervert in a chicken dive. (a place for perverts to have sex and torture young boys called chickens). After that, Eastland has a Taxi Driver scene, as he files down his 44 magnum cartridges, filling the tips with mercury, and soldering them back. After that, he visits the chicken dive, sets the sleezy owner on fire, and kills the pervert while freeing his chicken boy. There's a couple more such scenes as he comes to the rescue of an old lady mugged in the park, and then Detective Dalton starts to move in on him. The ending is not expected at all, but it does leave the door open for the expected sequel The Exterminator 2, which is not anywhere near as good. It's a pretty shoddy sequel, mainly featuring Eastland with a flame thrower all through the movie. This movie is a classic to me, and a lot of other gorehounds, and even though it's very low budget, it delivers the goods in every respect.Now as far as the new DVD released by a company called Tango it is bare bones, except for one excellent feature. The menu which has only one option, PLAY, it continually plays the best action scenes from the movie. This is pretty cool, I wish more dvds would do that. There is no audio selection, just straight digital stereo, and the audio is the only minor problem. There are a few dropouts in the audio, but nothing to discourage anybody from getting it, IMO. The video is excellent and completely uncut, and that's the only thing I was interested in. A nice bright transfer, with scenes included that I have never seen before in this movie, mostly from the opening Viet Nam segment, but a couple other graphically violent scenes too. Yes, this is a very sadistic nasty movie, but our anti-hero is always going after the bad guys, usually very bad guys, and makes them pay dearly. People that I knew back in those days, that I went to with most of these types of movies loved The Exterminator, and it stands well today as one of the best and most gruesome. It makes the Death Wish movies look like kiddie stories, and takes a movie like Rolling Thunder to a new level of violence and sadism. For you twisted minds out there, and I know you're reading this, this is one you want for your collection.

His films are the most progressive, challenging, cutting-edge, darkest being made.Nowhere is one of my favorites. I also love Doom Generation and Mysterious Skin (Splendor isn't bad but it isn't one of my favorites). Nowhere is essentially (for me, anyway) a simple story about high school life among a bunch of kids told through hyperbole. Everything is stretched out, exaggerated, hyper-exposed and drawn out and revealed. It is very much like high school as I remember it. Colors are three times as bright, everyone moves three times as fast. Cars fly everywhere. The music is bright and loud and jarring. There are lots and drugs and drinking. Everyone is constantly going somewhere or coming from someplace. It's a world on the brink of total disaster. And a world that is desperately searching and aching for love and tenderness. Someone else was correct when they said it was like an LSD trip. Video visions of an LSD world. The basic plot is simple. Four or five different stories involving teens who know each other play themselves out over a 24-hr period, American Graffiti-style. Bart and Cowboy are a queer couple who are also in a band together. Bart's spiraling heroin use threatens their relationship. Egg and Dingbat are nerdy best girl friends. Dingbat is in love with Egg's virginal brother Ducky. Egg has a chance encounter in a cafe with a television idol dreamboat that seems too good to be true and, in fact, is. (encounters in this movie begin innocently and turn nightmarish). Dark is a brooding young video-obsessional (and the film's main character) who wants simplicity in his relationship with girlfriend Mel, a raving hedonist who pursues sex with anyone, including vicious lesbian Lucifer. Dark secretly has thoughts about anxiety-ridden schoolmate Montgomery, who seems to like him back. Mel's younger brother Zero is desperate to impress his girlfriend Zoe, and assures her he knows where the big party all the high schoolers are going to that night (Zero and Zoe seem to be junior high age). It starts with everyone ditching school and going to a sleazy cafe where there are foreboding whispers of that day being the predestined date of the apocalypse. There's also talk of the big party later. Then everyone goes their separate ways and has adventures (most of which are fairly grim in a cool way). Recurring characters pop in and out - the drug dealer who supplies Bart as well as the two ultra violent S&M girls he pimps (Dark fantasizes over them), a giant scaly alien from outer space with a ray gun who wanders in to blast teenagers from time to time (this also may be the key to the apocalypse talk), and a soapy televangelist with an 800 number who actually becomes the key to the film's point. That is another matter. Some will say this film does not have a point. I disagree. The point to this film is in its texture and in the ultimate fates of Bart and Egg. I believe Araki is making a statement about modern kids. I don't believe this is lost among the nihilism either. It also has to do with the song that is played over the end credits. That is my take\/. I'm not sure what high school was like for everyone else but for me it certainly wasn't anything like 90210 or Gilmore Girls or Dawson's Creek. Not AT ALL. I remember intense fights and disappointments, intense romances. Heartbreak. All of the stuff that is covered in this movie Plus alien abduction!!!!!!!!!!!! What more could you want???

Quite simply, this is the single most intense, nail-biting, white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat suspense film of all-time. But just what is it that makes Cape Fear so intense? Well, a couple of factors.First of all, the superb performances from Gregory Peck and, more importantly, Robert Mitchum. Peck plays the every-man, and he gives a solid performance all around. However, Mitchum is simply outstanding as the relentless villain. His character is already rather frightening, as he is not just a drooling lunatic, but a clever and ruthless fiend who is careful and meticulous in every detail of his diabolical schemes. Mitchum comes off as utterly cold-blooded, yet at the same time, gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as, after all, he is a villain with reason. He lost a wife. He lost a child. He lost eight years of his life. For a few moments here and there, the audience just may actually sympathize with him. However, this doesn't detract from the inhuman nature of his character. He is also not simply a brute, but something of a charismatic charmer. But after all, could Mitchum ever not be charming? Secondly, the plot, the pacing, and the direction. This is a rather tense story to begin with, but the intensity is augmented by the gut-wrenching pace at which the story unfurls. It is both exciting and scary to watch. By the time, the climax arrives, I can almost guarantee that the audience will be jumping around in their seats.The direction is not only extremely effective, but, for its time, very innovative and fresh, and it still holds up today. There is a tense raw and sexual energy to everything, and it's quite remarkable that the filmmakers got away some of the material this film contains back in 1962.And thirdly, everything is greatly enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's classic score. It really is the ideal soundtrack for a thriller. From slow build-ups to discordant, pounding climaxes, everything just falls into place perfectly.If you think you've been thrilled by movies before, think again. Watch Cape Fear, and get ready for a nail-biting experience in classic cinema.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The plot is simple enough a dangerous ex-convict (Mitchum) moves to a friendly small town in order to terrorize and exact revenge upon the lawyer who put him behind bars for eight years (Peck) and his wife and young daughter.Cape Fear is a straightforward thriller, and let me tell you, is it ever thrilling.

Mitchum comes off as utterly cold-blooded, yet at the same time, gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as, after all, he is a villain with reason. He lost a wife. He lost a child. He lost eight years of his life. For a few moments here and there, the audience just may actually sympathize with him. However, this doesn't detract from the inhuman nature of his character. He is also not simply a brute, but something of a charismatic charmer. But after all, could Mitchum ever not be charming? Secondly, the plot, the pacing, and the direction. This is a rather tense story to begin with, but the intensity is augmented by the gut-wrenching pace at which the story unfurls. It is both exciting and scary to watch. By the time, the climax arrives, I can almost guarantee that the audience will be jumping around in their seats.The direction is not only extremely effective, but, for its time, very innovative and fresh, and it still holds up today. There is a tense raw and sexual energy to everything, and it's quite remarkable that the filmmakers got away some of the material this film contains back in 1962.And thirdly, everything is greatly enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's classic score. It really is the ideal soundtrack for a thriller. From slow build-ups to discordant, pounding climaxes, everything just falls into place perfectly.If you think you've been thrilled by movies before, think again. Watch Cape Fear, and get ready for a nail-biting experience in classic cinema.8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"9 December 2005","score":"10 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the single worst film I have seen this year.The humour is low-brow throughout and if it wasn't for the frequent soft-porn and smut scenes it would be suitable for very undemanding 10-12 year olds.Bill Murray (an actor whose work I appreciate usually) is at his unfunniest here.

American Psycho is just nothing like that, you will think one heck of a lot. Christen Bales performance is just amazing, he gives one of the best performances in years, he is just phenomenal.

In the beginning, at least there was some discussion on the aliens' bodies and why they were hostile towards doves, but those questions never got answered or even fueled. Lastly, this movie cannot hope to illustrate any morals or hidden messages.

Followed close by Rear Window in second place and others in third, fourth and so on&#133; The first time I had seen this film was not that long ago and I only saw the second half of the film. The second time I saw it, I was in to it so much, I probably only blinked a half a dozen times. Everyone knows that you blink every six seconds but when I saw this film, I hadn't realized one blink at all! This is a movie I would add to my must-see\/recommended list along with The Untouchables and other classic films. The main star in Vertigo is John Ferguson (James Stewart) who is afraid of heights (I have acrophobia which gives me vertigo and I get dizzy, he says). This is one film where you are&#133; let me stress the word&#133; required to listen to the dialog. At first I hadn't listened to the dialog and so I was extremely confused. So what you have to do is listen very carefully to get the point (main point) of the movie. In this movie, Ferguson is madly in love with a woman named Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). If you listen to the dialog in this film, you'll know why John had to go searching for her and to follow her every move. If you didn't listen to the dialog, too bad for you. This film is definitely Hitchcockian because it has drama, some scenes of humor, romance, mystery, suspense, everything you want from a Hitchcock film. One thing I was expecting was the cinematography. Hitchcock always has a great cinematographer to do his films. I think the same cinematographer probably does every one of his films. Alfred is also physically in his films. Not only does he direct, but he also has a cameo in each of his films. Every film of his I try to point out where he is and I always find him because of his distinctive look and his plump body. Of course he's no longer with us anymore because he was born in 1899 and not to many people live to be 106 years old (he would be that age if he was still around). His last film was in 1975 and it was called Family Plot. Now there is a lot to the story of Vertigo but it's still interesting and easy to catch on to if you are a good listener. Now Madeleine (who's real name is Judy Barton) seems possessed in John Ferguson's eyes but he still loves her. She seems to not know where she is or why she's there when it comes to her great grandmother. Every day she goes to look at her great grandmother's grave and her portrait that hangs in a museum. John Ferguson is required by her so-called husband (you'll know what I mean when you see it) to follow her and see what she's up to. With John's former occupation of being a detective (now he quit the job and starts to wander), he was called back again by Judy's so-called husband to watch her. In my eyes, it's like a case that needs to be solved. Madeleine (real name Judy) tries to trick John Ferguson several times by falling in to the San Francisco Bay and others. This wonderful Hitchcock film (to me it is) has the biggest twist (in my opinion) of all his movies and the best one yet!

Overall worth a watch i suppose but you could do a LOT better. ** out of 5 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"9 December 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an average Reeves flick, that's very uneven and rather dull at times, with decent enough effects but bland performances. All the characters are simply so so, and the story is very uneven, plus while i am a very big fan of Keanu Reeves, he looks really bored here and sleepwalks through the whole thing. Dina Meyer is probably the best character here, and while i am also a very big fan Of Lundgren he was way way too OTT here for my liking, plus The action is also rather bland. There are some moments, that were fun to watch, and the story was really quite intriguing and had a lot of potential, however, it just does not work. At times it seems like a dated poor man's version of The Matrix, and i really could care less about what happened to the characters here, plus Ice-T looks extremely bored here, and was laughable in his role. The ending was kind of cool, and the set pieces were quite cool as well, plus it takes way too long to get going and even when it does, it's still inconsistent. This is an average Reeves flick, that's very uneven and rather dull at times, with decent enough effects, but bland performances, i suppose it's worth the watch, but you could do a LOT better in my opinion. The Direction is so so. Robert Longodoes a so so job here, with good camera work, great angles, lots of stylish shots, however the pace is extremely inconsistent. The Acting is quite bland. Keanu Reeves is not his usual amazing self here, because he looked very bored, and basically sleepwalked through the whole thing, his chemistry with Meyer was OK though, it's just there was no life in his character, he still did OK though(Reeves Rules!!!!!!). Dina Meyer is very hot, and did excellent with what she had to do, she was my favorite character here, and had OK chemistry with reeves i really liked her. Ice-T is terrible here, he was extremely bland, and looked very bored and i don't blame him. Dolph Lundgren is also not his usual amazing self, he was way too OTT, and was simply laughable, and a result i found his character to be bland as well, he also had some terrible lines.

Where to start with the things that suck about this movie.....1.) Not all black people break into song every few minutes of their lives.2.) Not all white people listen to country music.3.) All state championships are not won on the final play.4.) A team would not be running the ball with 20 seconds left in a game, risking a fumble. They would have just taken a knee and the game would be over.5.) There were more than 8 songs released in the 1970's. Apparently, Hollywood never got that memo.6.) The little girl. Enough said.7.) The transformation of the Gerry character happened way too fast to make it realistic. Over the course of a 2 week football camp, he went from telling the coach he didn't need any of them on the defense, to being the main guy who brought the races together.8.) Even without knowing the real story, you could see the car accident coming light years away.9.) No football team would ever just throw guys into a game on defense in the 2nd half of the state championship game who had never played on defense previously.10.) Awesome waste of Kate Bosworth. Now that you've won some football games with both black and white players, I'm willing to shake your hand Julius. If only she had gone to the training camp. Then she'd understand it all so much better.11.) Let's throw in a California hippie to show that white people can be discriminated against too. The audience will never see that coming.12.) We're supposed to believe that the Sunshine character would actually doubt whether he should go into the game because he can't throw an option pitch?? 13.) Way too many impassioned speeches about being perfect and this being our time. I was afraid they might run out of music to score these scenes.14.) Love the slow clap and standing ovation for Gerry's mother. Of course, the TV commentators would announce when she enters the stadium as well. By the way, did they really televise high school state championship games in 1971? 15.) Ryan Gosling's character giving up his spot to Petey because Petey's just better coach.16.) This whole racism thing is important and all, but I really wanted to make the Virginia high school sports hall of fame. Now that's some big time stuff right there.17.) Let's use the white coach's trick play on the last play to show just how far these two men have come so they're winners in life as well as on the field.18.) Apparently, every time a new player comes into a game, he makes a game changing great play within the first two plays that he's in there, propelling the team to an easy victory.19.) Darn those crazy backup quarterbacks. They'll getcha every time. Can we see a movie where the starting QB gets hurt, and the season goes to hell because the backup QB sucks? There's your reality.20.) And finally, what a great message the movie gives by showing how winning football games is the solution to all the world's problems. Want to end racism? Just win some football games.

Tommy Lee Jones is worse, and I don't believe he's that good of an actor to begin with. And in some parts of this movie he seriously reminds me of Mugatu in Zoolander.
