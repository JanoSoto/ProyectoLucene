I thought it was fun enough, but I wasn't blown away by it (other than the animation, which is quite spectacular). Then I saw Shrek 2 in a theatre on my honeymoon, and went to the Shrek 4-D attraction at Universal Studios, and I loved them. I think they made the original better in my memory. I got Shrek 2 for Christmas, so I had to get the original on DVD to compliment it.Watching it tonight for only the second time, I was struck by how quickly it has aged. Only four years since its release, and the humour and trappings of the film are getting old. That's sad, because animated family movies used to be classics. I watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a child as though it was contemporary, even though it was made in 1937, and felt nostalgic for it when on the Snow White ride at Disney World in February. Something tells me I won't feel the same way when I go on the Shrek ride at Universal with my kids in ten years (something else tells me that the Shrek ride will go the way of Captain EO in less than ten years).It's not the animation that has gotten old, it still looks as impressive as ever (more impressive than last time for me, since we were watching it on my wonderful TV). It's the littering of pop culture references and pop soundtrack that makes the film seem outdated already. All that is wrong with the film is represented with the opening credits sequence, as we get a glimpse into the gross life of the ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers). He showers in mud, uses squished bugs for tooth paste, farts in swamps-- killing fish that he'll eat for dinner, all to the strains of Smash Mouth's All Star. The scatological jokes, which aren't my cup of tea, weren't what made this scene so bad. It's that they were accompanied by Smash Mouth that made it so offensive. I was immediately taken out of the movie and taken by the horrifying thought that there was a time, not too long ago, when people liked their music. And then I was embarrassed and ashamed. I didn't get back into the movie until the comically brilliant scene where Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) tortures The Gingerbread Man (hands down, the best scene in the movie). This is why you don't use pop music in movies that should be timeless, because it immediately assigns an era to your picture (to compound the problem, the movie ends with Smash Mouth's remake of I'm A Believer. Yes, that's right, the movie begins and ends with Smash Mouth).It's really too bad, because this is a movie that was soooo close to being timeless. So close to greatness that many of us were fooled the first time around into believing that it had achieved it. Shrek could be a modern-day fairytale, one that could rival all of the ones of the public domain that Disney has taken hold of and this movie pokes fun at (and pokes fun at Disney for doing). Instead, it went the route that seemingly all animated movies have been going since Aladdin, the hip route, to draw in the date crowd along with the family crowd, and to appeal to today's more media-savvy child. As a result, it isn't anything more than an entertaining romp that I suspect will be less and less entertaining with each viewing.Still, it has some genuinely funny moments (even though he isn't portrayed as being funny, I thought Shrek was far funnier than the much-heralded Eddie Murphy-voiced Donkey), some good action scenes (I pop for the wrestling scene, although there are a few too many dropkicks. The ankle lock is the best), and dazzling animation that is a true cinematic accomplishment. Also, I find the character of Shrek incredibly charming and lovable. But, the story and delivery is too average to score any better than a 6 out of 10.

Was this Lester's influence, or was the plan always to lighten the tone of the sequel to create more of a popcorn film? Well, we all got our answer in 1983, when Superman III debuted, this completely under the guiding hand of Richard Lester.From the film's opening credit sequence, a completely farcical series of events, you get that sinking feeling and realize that anything resembling cheese and slapstick in the second film was directly the influence of Lester. The first Superman was grounded in a sense of reality, even if it was a comic book one, which is noticeably absent from much of Superman II. In the first film, Metropolis always seemed like a real city with real people inhabiting it. The second recalled a city on a sound stage with only the vaguest sense of a distorted reality. Well, the filmmakers decided to distort reality further in Superman III by ignoring what made the franchise great and going with a hipper, more today approach. They accomplished this by centering the film around the casting of Richard Pryor. The problem with this approach is that there is absolutely no reason for Richard Pryor to appear in Superman III other than the fact that he's Richard Pryor.The idea behind Superman III is actually a fairly intriguing one, where a computer genius constructs a super-computer, which in a unique turn of events alters the mental stability of Superman, turning him away from his All-American persona. Suddenly, Superman is no longer the hope for all mankind, but the anti Superman intent on destroying us. It also contains one of the best moments in the series, as Clark Kent and the evil Superman actually battle each other. It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.So what went wrong? I would put the blame squarely at the feet of Lester and the Salkinds, who seemed to want to make a Richard Pryor Superman movie rather than a film that was true to the spirit of the characters and the original film. Pryor is given far too much screen time despite the fact that he's not even the main villain. The producers obviously figured that, if they're paying Richard Pryor, they may as well use him, whether it benefits the film or not. So what would I have done differently? Well, the plot about a super computer and an altered Superman is a fantastic direction for the film to go, but that's where they left it. I would have eliminated the character of Ross Webster, the ultimate corporate bad guy, and everyone around him in favor of Gus Gorman, the computer genius trying to dominate the world on his own. The Webster character is totally unnecessary and a more maniacal Gorman working in solitude would have been far more menacing But the catch is that with Pryor in the role of Gorman, the producers obviously felt a need to allow him to redeem himself in the end, so I say they should have removed Pryor, too. This could also have cut out much of the unnecessary comic drivel that ruins Superman III.Ultimately, Superman III is not the worst entry in the series, but not for a lack of trying. Richard Lester proved once and for all that he really didn't understand what a Superman movie should be, seemingly relying on British slapstick comedy that is taken right out of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus where it belongs! and a pathetic, poor script that he and probably only ten other people found amusing. He must have forgotten that Superman is aimed towards an American audience. The movie does actually start to get good from the moment supes becomes anti-supes, Watching the dual between Clark and Superman really lets you see how the whole movie could have been made dark and serious and kept out of the silly comedy path even with Pryor and other factors etc If Superman III had been made this way it probably would have been better then II!. The Superman vs. Clark scene proves this, In Superman II where Zod and Superman battle it out, the end result is disappointing and nothing really happens other then Superman throwing Zod into a Coca-Cola sign, the confrontation in III is far far better!.

Ever. I have only tried to watch it (tried and failed!) because I bought the Trilogy on DVD, being that it was only a few bucks dearer than buying just the first movie by itself, and it came in a nicer box. Plus, I thought it was a novelty to be able to see Moya Brady in a film (any fans of The Bill would know her as Robbie Cryer), and there was the added bonus of Jack Black as well.I had extremely low expectations of this film, and I must say, I was still shocked at how bad it was.Worst. Movie. Ever.This film should have NEVER BEEN MADE. Especially since the second film in the trilogy was such a huge disappointment.I find it an absolute insult to the original film, the book, and Michael Ende that this rubbish shares the name The NeverEnding Story. The character of Falcor has been murdered beyond recognition. This was the part that made me really angry, and that really made this a waste of film. Same for Rockbiter.

For anyone in that position, as Tim Rice reminded us in the lyrics to Evita, the most important question is Where do you go from here? For any film-maker in the Eighties who had just had a success, there was an obvious answer to that question; you made a sequel. This was the golden age of the sequel; any successful film was liable to be followed up not just by a single sequel but by a whole series of them. This became something of a joke; comedians used to speculate whether we would see a Superman VII, a Rocky X or a Friday the 13th Part 13. Such long-running series became known as franchises, a name which emphasised the commerciality of the enterprise, as though making a film was the same as running a McDonald's restaurant.There was, however, a problem with Crocodile Dundee. The original film, although it also contained elements of satire, was essentially a romantic comedy. This is a type of film particularly difficult to follow up with a sequel because falling in love is, generally speaking, something that most couples only do once. The Philadelphia Postscript? Lunch at Tiffany's? The Postgraduate? The Second Time Harry Met Sally? A Fifth Wedding and Another Funeral? Just a few of the follow-ups to classic rom-coms that never got made. This being the Eighties, however, a sequel to Crocodile Dundee was unavoidable, but Paul Hogan obviously recognised the problem as Crocodile Dundee II was made in a quite different style to the original, being an adventure comedy rather than a romantic comedy.At the beginning of the film, Mick Dundee is living in New York with his girlfriend Sue. Sue's ex-husband Bob is working as an investigative journalist in Colombia, helping to expose the local involvement in the drug trade. Unfortunately his cover is blown and he is murdered by the traffickers, but not before he has mailed Sue a roll of film incriminating Luis Rico, one of the wealthiest and most powerful dealers. Rico kidnaps Sue in an attempt to recover the evidence; Mick manages to free her from Rico's mansion with the aid of a local street gang. The scene then shifts to Australia. (This reverses the pattern of the first film, which starts in Australia and then moves to America). Mick has taken Sue back to his home town of Walkabout Creek in the Northern Territory, thinking she will be safer there. Rico, however, tracks them down, and Mick and Sue disappear into the bush with the drug dealer and his gang in pursuit. Mick must use his skills as a tracker and his knowledge of the outback in order to outwit the villains.The film does not come close to achieving the success of its predecessor because, although some of the elements- Hogan's larger-than-life comic character, the beauty of Linda Kozlowski as Sue, Mick's bumbling, timid friend Walt- that made the original film such a success are present, others are not. The first film succeeded largely because of a combination of romance and satire. Not only is the element of romance played down in the sequel, but much of the satire is also lacking. Most of the humour in the original arose from Mick's innocent reactions to the unfamiliar ways of the big city. In the sequel, he has been living in New York for some time and is consequently more street-smart- and less funny. There are some amusing scenes, such as the one in which he prevents a suicide from throwing himself off a high-rise building, but not many.The scenes of adventure in the bush never generate much excitement. Mick's knowledge of bushcraft and aboriginal lore are so superior to those of pursuers that we never experience any anxiety on his behalf or doubt that he will triumph over them. The original Crocodile Dundee was, in my view, the first great Australian screen comedy.

Jack Nicholson is usually one of my favorite actors but you could somehow tell that he was in the wrong movie. As for the second, it was a total disaster.

Tommy Lee Jones has expressed his regrets in ever making this movie and who could blame him with a co-star like Carrey. Carrey pretty much bulldozes him in every scene they appear together. Nicole Kidman is kind of bland but that's understandable. What can you do when all the best lines go to the male actors. The only serious fault I will point out is Robin's background story. I think it was a mistake to have Bruce Wayne attend the circus performance where Dick Grayson's parents and siblings were killed. It robs the Robin character the mystery which has always surrounded the Batman character to simply show you what happens on screen. Other than that Chris O'Donnell was the right choice for the role.

To say that the dour tone of the first two movies needed to changed is an understatement and I think Joel Schumacher did a great job relieving the tension of very serious themes in the movie like revenge and scarred pasts. At one point the Wayne character says Even Chase (Kidman) thinks being Batman is a curse. That sums it up pretty well but in the end he also says For I am both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

I remember going to the theater, extremely excited, soaking in the nerdy atmosphere of childish bliss, knowing that even if the movie sucked it would still have an awesome lightsaber fight in the end. You can imagine how I felt leaving, provided only with a lame Gladiator\/Rancor scene ripoff, an all too brief fight where Obi-Wan gets his butt handed to him, and two subsequent lightsaber fights that could have been great but wound up being trite, meaningless five-second bouts.What was Lucas thinking when he wrote the scene when Anikan and Padme are sitting in the fields talking about politics...and what was he drinking when he wrote the following scene where Anikan rides some bulbous brown alien beast that looks more like something you'd find in an Episode of South Park? The man's talent has been drained by his children, as well as this once well-crafted space opera which has grown far out of his control.He has attempted to put it back into his control, obviously, but it seems now that he's doing everything he wants, he is forgetting all that is good about story telling, dialogue, and action sequences. Episode II is nothing but a filler, a mish-mash of flashing lights and colors that tries so desperately to have validity through a few shadows and dark, brown leather tunics.I almost feel bad for Lucas after watching this movie. Because he honestly seems to think it's good. It is not. Episode II is a yellow brick road that leads nowhere near as cool as Emerald City. It just keeps going round and round with a parade of irritating Munjkin like characters that have no develop, utter the dumbest lines in the world, and ultimately end up being inconsequential.This doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. It seems like a lame TV rip off CBS might do. Even Episode One had a sense of grand epic scope, going from undeniably exciting pod-race scenes to superb lightsaber duels. And at least Liam Neeson was in that one. Schiendler with a Lightsaber is a winning combination.The strongest aspect of Episode Two is Ewan McGregor and Jango Fett.

The wordplay and sight gags are packed so tightly that it takes several viewings before a viewer can catch them all. I must admit that, when it first came out, Blazing Saddles made me slightly uncomfortable, but I finally rationalized my laughing at it by figuring that Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor had the right to make fun of Jews and Blacks if they wanted -- and stupid Honkies while they were at it -- so why not join the fun? I don't give this movie a 10 because I don't feel that it's consistent all the way through. In my opinion the laughs peak at the fireside flatulence scene, and after that the film wanders off in some directions which aren't as funny as the first part. It's still worth seeing, as long as you aren't offended by scatological and racist references delivered with great enthusiasm and hilarity.

Viggo Mortensen, is good and adds some charm to his short role here. Dan Hedaya, is decent in his limited role. Karen Young, is good here and had okay chemistry with Jay O. Sanders. Danielle Harris, is GORGEOUS!, and is fine here, and wish she had more screen time, but i really like her as an actress so it didn't bother me too much, great to see her again!. Claire Bloom, and Colin Fox are both good together and had good chemistry together. Sage Stallone is good here, and did what he had to do well.

It's extremely thrilling and tense from start to finish, and the last 10 to 15 minutes are especially good!. i really liked all of the characters, and rooted for them all, it also had a creepy vibe to it, because the tunnel looked very creepy.The Special effects are amazing I can't believe this has gotten so many negative reviews, and only a 5.4 rating on IMDb!, in my opinion it's a fantastic movie,that i personally loved every minute of!. Sure it has flaws, but it's an action movie and a very damn good one at that!. It is kinda sad though, as quite a few sad things happen in this. The Direction is excellent!.

this world has been forever cast out.The opportunistic film making industry has in this film provided an attempt or even the suggestion that there is such as they have showcased which of course there is not.The place that such a value entertains is not for this but for the Glory of God and though this be but a motion picture it allows for no uncertain truth as is in the very risen flesh as borne through our creators risen Son,Jesus Christ.The film for all its arrogance is in fact not about what it suggests but more so pertaining to the world that is known by these interests represented in this motion picture.There is an element of insincerity that is so strong that I'am surprised that this was allowed to occur.There is no friend in this film to the truth only interests of the film which provide for a wink of an eye to one as to another.Gantry is that type of personality an overt con man who knows no brother nor any allegiance to God or any other belief outside of some con which he just happens to be working on a particular day.The discredit that is paid to one and all is perhaps best seen as ridicule rather then some story about religion and revivalism.The power provided for is strictly speaking not of the Holy Bible nor are there claims of Evangelizing the world worthy of true discipleship.This pictures claim is a cover for a mean aggressive spirit designed to con a con with a wink to one as to the other.The unholy spirit of a circus side show is what seems to be what Elmer Gantry brings to the Sister Falconer crusade and indeed the inability to provide for an inspired albeit Holy Ghost message leaves the viewer with only a warning to the purpose had by this film and others like this whose claims are not what they are made to look like.The problem is that this is a motion picture and as such provides only a sinners way to shake a fist at our Father who art in Heaven with a promise that I will get you yet.The Ten commandments provides that Thou Shalt not worship Graven Images nor it provides Thou Shalt not place any other Gods before me.This film is an attempt to dissuade a belief of any kind and it is more so,a lesson in what is involved in the motion picture industry in the marketing of a film and what does all this have to do with the press.The elemental nature of the finished product is in its own right the workings of an alchemist and will materialize only when these various poisons coalesce to provide an graven image.This entertainment medium is nothing more than a lie fostered by the Kingfisher himself,Lucifer.The Father of Light as God gave Lucifer the claim provides a means by which we see,and that isn't really true because the Light as to this film is a spot light and is as un-natural as even the alchemy which invented it as well.These films are not a compliment by any stretch but are an attempt to force a participation through an illusion albeit a side show.Thats all this is-a loud vulgar illusion created for the sole purpose to fool you into participation of a sort that is neither worthy nor honorable in its purpose.We would be very much the mis-lead were we to believe in this type of discredited entertainment.There is nothing short of misery that is given its due,when upon entering a church,with an all Negro congregation,Gantry joins the congregation in chorus and verse singing,I'm on my way!up to Canaan Land,I'm on my way up to Canaan Land.I'm on my way,Glory Halleluiah,I'm on my way.This is one of the few inspiring moments and it occurs early in the film and very late in the film as well.The Sister Falconer crusade is mean spirited with as much a con as Gantry provided plus the fact that God did not make money.Her sermons do not allow our senses to be peaked by her earnest appeals,even in front of the camera they are nothing more then vehicles to move to and fro through out the picture.It is worthy to suggest that the interest of the film is sin and lust and the con of a con trying to get into your pants so to speak.It is very much a scandal ridden film with neither the word of God nor in its preaching allowed to flower as would be the seed that Christ planted.The answer as well is the equivalent of no answer because the result yielded only Death and peril for all.A terribly unfair and unfriendly film whose principal contribution was in song and perhaps it is in song only that this film should be mentioned.This is as much a warning as anything that there is nothing here to represent either nature nor does any claim here represent the truth.The place of the press is likened to a poison pen,it wants a story,only back then there were story makers who wrote it before it happened or so it would seem.The place of What is referred to as yellow journalism seems to have its place and it provides for the impetus of the films popularity.It is suggested from time to time within the films confines that it is a bit much to allow all that is portrayed to be anything more than that and that be an entertainment medium as insincere as it is fraudulent.This film has been given a false importance and that is what it is to me.Its credit is unjustified though

Steven Spielberg's story about a family haunted by ghosts in their suburban home is a very thought out and chilling tale of the family's fight to save their daughter Carol Anne who has been taken to the other side by the paranormal forces at work.Heather O'Rourke was the perfect choice to play Carol Anne and was an absolute sweetheart (she died sadly in 1988). JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson play the lead roles of the parents (reprised in II) and are very convincing, you could really relate to the family and believe what was happening to them. I always thought Zelda Rubinstein was the perfect choice when I first saw her appear as Tangina and she always managed to keep you hooked with her spooky theories about what is actually happening to young Carol Anne trapped on the other side. Jerry Goldsmith's music score for this film is also just fantastic and really adds dimension to the surroundings, along with a terrific lullaby theme for Carol Anne. He later scored the 1986 sequel which is also highly remembered amongst film score listeners.This picture definitely has its classic moments, the tree, the clown, the closet and cute little Heather O'Rourke saying the classic tag-line, They're here!.

I watched this with my father, who actually followed Nixon's career to some extent, and I can't deny that without his giving me cliff notes to explain actions and motivation of the characters every so often during the film, I wouldn't understand any of what happened. And that's the sad truth... if you don't know almost everything about Nixon, his time, the political situation, what happened during that period of time, etc. you won't understand it. The film hints at so many things, instead of making what happens clear, and presumes you know everything behind every situation, instead of providing any back-story. We get scene after scene, one situation after another with people we're supposed to know beforehand, situations we're expected to know of and understand and if you don't know of these, and you have no way of knowing them, you certainly won't know after watching the film. The film really isn't the story of Richard M. Nixon as much as it's Oliver Stone's objective presentation of him. How are we supposed to judge this man, his staff, or any of their actions when we don't know the situation or the background of it? Then there are of course those who do know these things... but why would they watch it? They already know the things presented in the movie, and probably from a far more reliable source. So, I guess what it comes down to is who is this film actually aimed at? Who can watch this and really enjoy it? My father suggested that Stone's intention with this film was to tell the story to young Americans, teenagers who weren't even alive when what the film is about happened. A good cause, but again, it requires them to already know of Nixon. And that is ultimately this movies downfall. The plot is very good, and from what I understand, quite accurate. The pacing is... off, I think is the right word. It switches between going insanely fast and painfully slow, making the film a sure-fire head-ache machine. The acting is perfectly flawless, and most, if not all of the characters based on real people are historically accurate in personality and appearance. The time-line is somewhat messed up, but the basic idea is that Nixon is actually sitting and thinking back on all this stuff, so it makes perfect sense and is used nicely(as opposed to as a cheap gimmick). The film is good, definitely, it's just so limited in who it will appeal to, and the pacing is a real killer(and I don't mean that in the good way). I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Nixon and big fans of Oliver Stone. I suppose very big fans of members of the cast might want to give it a chance as well. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After sitting through this painfully long and very drawn-out film, I can't help but feel that it is just slightly... redundant.

The kids that do become his friends are a bunch of kids who get together and play baseball. Their leader is a kid named Benny who sleeps, eats, and breathes baseball! The new kid has no clue how to play baseball so the other kids kind of take him under their wing and show him the ropes! I like the pool scene the best! This movie takes me back to when I was a kid playing baseball with a bunch of my friends! I like James Earl Jones' character in this movie playing the mean, old neighbor man.

You give him a grim dark face, something along the lines of Bela Lugosi, deprive him of any sense of humor, have him speak with an accent, and light his face from below with a hideous green key light. While you're at it, make him a full foot shorter than his American counterpart, played here by John Cromwell who -- and this is a little-known fact -- is the third tallest human being on the planet. All these conventions are adhered to in this movie. The Russian Premier thinks as reasonably as the American president, but it's hard to believe his lines when they come from a mouth with lips that resemble a fresh two-inch incision on somebody's belly.The real problem isn't making someone look like the enemy. It's deciding who should be the enemy in the first place. The Soviets provided us with bad examples for decades but -- well, they are, let's say, no longer available to Hollywood. As the Cold War wound down, even Ian Fleming had trouble. The real SMERSH had to be changed to the fictional SPECTRE because Fleming's conscious was beginning to trouble him.In The Sum of All Fears, the Nazis are resurrected, a kind of generic villain to whom no one will object. How could things possibly go wrong? Is someone going to write an angry letter to the New York Times and say, Hey -- wait a minute! My grandparents were Nazis and I'm offended? The movie calls them terrorists and throws in, let me think, Aryan supremacists, and some others into the stew, but they speak German and we all know who they are.The plot? This group of terrorists decides (for reasons I seem to have forgotten) to blow up a nuclear bomb in America, an act which they figure will provoke a response against Russia, who will then respond because they must show their strength, and so forth, until there is a nuclear exchange and the world is basically blown apart. Jack Ryan, or Doctor Ryan as everyone calls him, figures out the plot and barely prevents the plan's success.I enjoyed watching the movie. Great shots of airplanes. Special effects, some of them a bit obvious, involving the exploding bomb in Baltimore during the Superbowl. (Does Baltimore have a pro football team? The Crab Cakes or the McHenrys or something?) There's a big hole in the middle of the movie though. Ben Affleck has a big chin and looks the part. I'm sure he's a good guy but he is lightweight for the part. Both Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford were able to bring strength and some underlying humor to the same role whereas Affleck hits his marks and speaks. I hated to see Morgan Freeman die half-way through. And John Cromwell is a splendid actor but the part doesn't allow him to do much with his character.The climax is borrowed from The Godfather. Nessun Dorma -- the aria de jour -- swells in the background while we see the president and the premier signing some sort of joint anti-war treaty, and this triumphant scene alternates with bloody assassinations.Tom Clancy is an interesting guy. I've only read The Hunt for Red October and I can understand why it was all the rage at the military academies. It was really retro. But it was also filled with exciting bits of technology -- how nuclear powered subs work and all that. He evidently used to spend a lot of time shooting at targets with a large caliber pistol. And I saw him perform for his charity, along with three other celebrities, on Jeopardy. The other contestants bungled their buttons and stumbled over their answers and joked about their own inadequacies. Clancy didn't do that. He smiled politely throughout, was thoroughly decorous, and answered every question flawlessly and without iterative comment. He demolished the competition. In interviews he's been candid and friendly. I'd like to have a beer with the guy sometime. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2005","score":"","review":" It's easy to make somebody look villainous.

Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with Dexter's (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciorra.When i first watched The Cure on TV, i didn't know what to expect, but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about. Dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with AIDS, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour Eric, which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys, but they soon became good friends.During the film, i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys, as they kept me wondering. I wondered how the heck they would get to New Orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an inflatable crocodile behind it. There were other great scenes throughout the movie.But the part that reached out to me was the part when Dexter's health started to deteriorate. You just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out. I thought at the first prank they played, that Dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't, silly me. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter. At that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor Dexter had died. At that part i lost it. I balled my eyes out, and from that scene onwards i was crying. You just have to. As the end nears you start to understand Eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with Dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river.Overall this movie was excellent. It has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. When you put that in a blender you get an excellent, must watch film. Peter Horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best. But for now, i will try to search for this movie on DVD, if it exists that is. Once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster.
