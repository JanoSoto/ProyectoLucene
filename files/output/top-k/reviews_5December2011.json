I have seen it numerous times but as i decided to have a Halloween Marathon in October, i decided to watch it once again and yes it still had that same old nostalgia and creepiness that you might experience after the very first watch. So this psychological Horror movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, i have seen so many King's adaptation as i look back and he is a genius when it comes to suspense. Though i heard he wasn't too happy with this movie which really makes me think why? Anyways this movie is directed by the best Hollywood filmmaker Stanley Kubrick so yes you should not just expect the exact replica of what you have written i mean this man has his own way of doing movies. I have seen his movies like 2001, Dr. Strangelove and Clockworks orange and all three of them are the movies you would find in my Top 200 all time favorite movies list placed one after another. Now this movie to be honest i would not call it one of his very best work or a outstanding adaptation in a way it just doesn't come out so mind blowing like Clockworks Orange which again was based on a book but thanks to Kubrick and his style, this movie doesn't fall flat or average but in its own way it is just outstanding. I might have one or two complains but they aren't quite big, i still love this movie and i call it one of the scariest movie experiences i have ever had. This movie is the reason i still get scared of looking at Mr Jack Nicholson. Critics back then gave this movie some mixed reviews but now it is considered as one of the classic scariest movies. So somehow it got out of its own bad reputation and got what it really deserves, some praise.I don't know if anyone agrees with me but i think a Book and the movie adapted from it doesn't always have to be similar, one can use there own style and vision to create something different. But then this is not something everyone can handle, some filmmakers tries to do that and they create a mess but there are few who really has this ability to create classics from it and that is the exact case here. This movie The Shining is about a writer, Jack Torrance who takes a job of take care of a big hotel in the off season time with is son and wife. This hotel has some past which is still fully alive, his son has some psychic abilities or call it an accident but he is able to see weird things from Past and Future like ghosts. They are trapped by a snowstorm and Jack slowly becomes influenced by all of these supernatural presence that makes him totally mad and in this madness tries to kill his wife and son. Before taking this job as a winter caretaker, he have been told that this Hotel is built on Indian burial site and it becomes fully covered with snow and that a previous caretaker got cabin fever killing his family. His son already has this premonition about the hotel and you would see him from the start as a troubling kid talking to his imaginary friend, we are also being told that Jack had drinking problem from which he is now fully recovered as he one day hurt his son's arm. So some times passes but Jack still can't finish his writing project that he thought will complete in this isolated quite and peaceful environment and slowly kind of transcends into this violent and mentally unstable man. I don't think i should give away all the plot but will mention some of my favorite scenes, the problem with me is that i just don't like to synopsize a movie but rather give away the plot or basic points of the plot while avoiding the ending.There are some pretty terrifying moments in the movie and some really exciting scenes that are just a work of freaking genius. I just love that whole REDRUM scenes and that room 237 scenes. That long shots of the Gold room were a great idea. That final showdown in that maze or the typing of All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy in different styles on the endless papers by Jack. Or those infamous Axe scenes that took months to shoot. I mean there are so many scenes in this movie that will absolutely shock you and are so much fun. You might have seen all these and the other scenes being adapted in many other movies or videos nowadays and who can forget the parodies of them in various comedies. Well this movie has a really frightening atmosphere that slowly develops and Kubrick really makes sure it does. You really get scare by the every sight of the hotel and your heart pounds so fast at every scene. It has excellent cinematography being done, the camera moments are excellent and create a great sense of paranoia like we ourself are experiencing everything being shown.......

There's no doubt in my mind that ON THE WATERFRONT is one of the greatest movies ever made if not the greatest of all time. The movie is about as raw, gritty and downbeat as anything ever made and at the same time it has a certain power that is still as strong as the day it was released. Everyone says this was director Elia Kazan's way of making good for what he had done in his personal life but I really don't think it's that simple. What makes the film so powerful is the rawness that he brought it but you've also got Brando's performance, which is probably the second or third greatest in the history of cinema. I think the only think I'd put above it are Robert DeNiro's in RAGING BULL and Brando's own performance in LAST TANGO IN Paris. The way he plays the rather dimwitted Terry has been copied countless times over the years but each time I view this film I see something that I hadn't noticed before. I love the accent, the way he actually makes this guy feel like a real character and just watch how many changes he goes through. Brando is just so believable in the part that you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real person working on a real dock. There are countless legendary scenes but of course the one in the back of the taxi really stands out in terms of Brando's acting but so does an earlier scene where he finally admits the truth to the woman he loves. The only negative thing about the performance is the fact that it's so great that it has pretty much over shadowed the rest of the actors and all of them are perfect as well. Saint is believable in her part as is Rod Steiger as the brother. Everyone seems to overlook the fact that Steiger was in the cab scene as well and certainly helps with its power. Lee J. Cobb is marvelous as the hot tempered crook and Karl Malden add terrific support as the priest trying to help Terry. Even the supporting non-actors do a very good job in their small parts. Kazan's direction is spot on from start to finish and you can't help but be amazed at the power he's able to get out of the story and the performances. The music score is one of the greatest out there, the cinematography top notch and in the end there's really not a single negative thing to be said.

Indeed, the measure of greatness of Scorsese movies is how they stack up against this classic and the question is often what is his best since.So my expectations were high to say the least. There are some scenes in Goodfellas which would make me proud to have it included in my list of top movies - from intimidating the mailman by shoving his head in the oven to Tommy's reckless blasting away of Spider over a trifle, to Henry Hill waking up to his wife pointing a gun in his face, and, my favourite scene, when Tommy is shot dead and blood flows slowly from his head out over the floor.And I could go on listing scenes. This is exactly the point - there is something lacking, even poor, in the story as a whole i.e. in the pace of the film. Henry following Tommy along to the double date is a turning point in the narrative, with Karen coming into the story at this point. The initial scene at the restaurant just seems to fit in as another part of the lengthy orientation. Then the two have an argument on the street - again it all seems to fit in. Then all of a sudden Henry's voice-over tells us that he finds her attractive and Karen's opinion somehow changes and they decide they'll go out, this time on a proper date - this is way too unrealistic. The awkwardness of the first date is conveyed so well, with the contrast between Tommy and his girl, and the voice-over from Karen, that it's fair to wonder why she even wanted to go on the second date. After the Copacabana date you can believe that she was impressed with him but I'm sure most people found it odd that she wasn't repelled to begin with and got caught up in the whole thing. It takes ages for anything narratively significant to happen, and when it does it's out of nowhere.The film seems to be confused what its emphasis is. The opening scene is taken out from a late point in the movie, giving it that mystery-movie style revelation when we realise the context of that scene. This is inappropriate - by the time we figure out what that scene was about we know that the gangsters kill people all the time, and sometimes over practically nothing, especially Tommy. There's too much of a similarity between the murders of Spider and Billy Batts to give special importance to Batts; sure, Spider was a nobody and Batts was a made man, but there should have been more done to show why Batts was more serious. The filmmakers couldn't have expected audiences to grasp the intenseness of killing a made man. Goodfellas isn't a movie about the Lufthansa heist, not really. The filmmakers obviously chose to sacrifice a traditional story for an in depth, more holistic view of mob life. The cost is that the climax lacks some depth. The filmmakers were never interested in the heist, they were interested in its aftermath, because that's where the characters interrelate. All those involved are slowly killed off by Jimmy Conway, and in the sense that we finally see the fullness of Jimmy's gangster quality (besides throwing 100s to operating doormen and bartenders) there is some interest and drama. But this is compromised because the heist is an opportunity that the gangsters merely stumble upon - there is no reason or meaning involved in the actual robbery besides their normal greed. Jimmy Conway has nothing personal in it, no journey towards it, and it is this extra psychological depth that would have made the ending truly masterful. The filmmakers, and hence the audience, are too caught up in the characters' relations to think about them individually.A lot will disagree with this, but I think The Departed is better. It has all the same great hallmarks of directing but it has a masterfully crafted story that isn't spontaneous and doesn't drag (even though The Departed is longer) and it is psychologically deep (the main female character is a psychologist, what more could you want?). This said, Goodfellas is a quality movie and a proud part of the Scorsese canon, and if a friend came and told me he recently watched it I would still light up and be ready to talk about all the amazing scenes.In short, to be a Masterpiece, EVERYTHING has to go right - and although there are lots of awesome films there are few masterpieces, and Goodfellas is definitely an example of the former and not the latter.

The initial scene at the restaurant just seems to fit in as another part of the lengthy orientation. Then the two have an argument on the street - again it all seems to fit in. Then all of a sudden Henry's voice-over tells us that he finds her attractive and Karen's opinion somehow changes and they decide they'll go out, this time on a proper date - this is way too unrealistic. The awkwardness of the first date is conveyed so well, with the contrast between Tommy and his girl, and the voice-over from Karen, that it's fair to wonder why she even wanted to go on the second date. After the Copacabana date you can believe that she was impressed with him but I'm sure most people found it odd that she wasn't repelled to begin with and got caught up in the whole thing. It takes ages for anything narratively significant to happen, and when it does it's out of nowhere.The film seems to be confused what its emphasis is. The opening scene is taken out from a late point in the movie, giving it that mystery-movie style revelation when we realise the context of that scene. This is inappropriate - by the time we figure out what that scene was about we know that the gangsters kill people all the time, and sometimes over practically nothing, especially Tommy. There's too much of a similarity between the murders of Spider and Billy Batts to give special importance to Batts; sure, Spider was a nobody and Batts was a made man, but there should have been more done to show why Batts was more serious. The filmmakers couldn't have expected audiences to grasp the intenseness of killing a made man. Goodfellas isn't a movie about the Lufthansa heist, not really. The filmmakers obviously chose to sacrifice a traditional story for an in depth, more holistic view of mob life. The cost is that the climax lacks some depth. The filmmakers were never interested in the heist, they were interested in its aftermath, because that's where the characters interrelate. All those involved are slowly killed off by Jimmy Conway, and in the sense that we finally see the fullness of Jimmy's gangster quality (besides throwing 100s to operating doormen and bartenders) there is some interest and drama. But this is compromised because the heist is an opportunity that the gangsters merely stumble upon - there is no reason or meaning involved in the actual robbery besides their normal greed. Jimmy Conway has nothing personal in it, no journey towards it, and it is this extra psychological depth that would have made the ending truly masterful. The filmmakers, and hence the audience, are too caught up in the characters' relations to think about them individually.A lot will disagree with this, but I think The Departed is better. It has all the same great hallmarks of directing but it has a masterfully crafted story that isn't spontaneous and doesn't drag (even though The Departed is longer) and it is psychologically deep (the main female character is a psychologist, what more could you want?). This said, Goodfellas is a quality movie and a proud part of the Scorsese canon, and if a friend came and told me he recently watched it I would still light up and be ready to talk about all the amazing scenes.In short, to be a Masterpiece, EVERYTHING has to go right - and although there are lots of awesome films there are few masterpieces, and Goodfellas is definitely an example of the former and not the latter.

Bruce took advantage of the Beatnik subculture of the late 1950s who had pushed against obscenity and tender sensibilities enough to leave the door ajar, and then he crashed in recklessly, too self involved to realize that there are times when it's a lot better for you and everyone you care about if you just shut the hell up, that preaching, like drugs, can turn into self indulgence.It's sad to see an essentially good-natured and well-intentioned man commit slow suicide. It's sad to watch someone throw away success with such little grace. And it's sad to know in retrospect that the director, Bob Fosse, identified so intensely with Bruce that the release of the movie was delayed for a long time while Fosse agonized over the editing.All that aside, the film has another problem. It all seems mighty dated, as if we were viewing these Big Social Issues through the wrong end of a telescope. I guess that's not the movie's fault. It was no small matter at the time. It's just that the movies and the internet are now awash in pornography and, far worse, in gory images of heads exploding and limbs being sawed off. Hearing the F bomb spoken in front of an audience of eager adults is nothing compared to having to sit through an example of torture porn like Unthinkable. None of the difficulty can be attributed to the principal actors either. Dustin Hoffman is fine as he slowly morphs from the ambitious kid trying to please an audience in the Borscht Belt into a self-absorbed egomaniac with glittering eyes. And Valerie Perrine is believable as his despairing junkie wife. Fosse has wisely cast Jan Miner as the optimistic and permissive Jewish mother, instead of a stereotype. She chides him about his heroin use but claps him on the back after a successful and obscene show.Fosse's direction is sure enough. He knows what he wants to do and he does it with deliberation. There are, thank God, no dizzying, whirling camera movements, no instantaneous cuts, no sharp negative images, and no itchy electronic noise on the sound track, but mostly Miles Davis, early and late. Is there any way to resuscitate directors with that kind of style? Any way to shove the pendulum back to its former position? The structure of the film didn't exactly come from Citizen Kane but must have been influenced by it. Fosse was to use it again in Star 80. There are a couple of heartbreaking moments in the film in which we watch Bruce humiliate himself by being drunk on stage and by being obstreperous in court. At any rate, they made me wince. He's so wrapped up in himself and the indignities visited on him that he can no longer take the role of the other. He doesn't know that an audience is there to be entertained, not to listen to him read aloud long sections from the trial transcript. He doesn't realize that when a sympathetic judge finally says, Not another word, what the judge means is not another word. Bruce's death may not have come at the worst time. He was pretty far gone, broke and inadequate to any further work. I watched an interview with him during his last year or two and he was falling all over himself and slurring his words -- worse than Truman Capote at his worst.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"5 December 2011","score":"","review":" Big is the kind of film that is impossible to dislike no matter how 'big' the flaws can get. It doesn't avoid some clichés, some over-the-top acting, but all in all,l Penny Marshall's fantasy classic is an endearing piece of originality deprived from cynicism and convenient political incorrectness, with this perfect dosage of comedy and poignancy that appeals to both adults and kids. I, for one, forgive what I said about predictability, since I can't even avoid formulaic expressions while reviewing Big.Big is a sincere and genuine invitation to value childhood and its underrated impact on our lives. Big reminded me of Stand by Me, Rob Reiner's bittersweet classic where the narrator remembers what being thirteen was like playing, sharing secrets, having fun with pals before girls started to invade private thoughts, never needing to act seriously, expressing imagination and sticking together while enduring the bullying from the elder and naturally, the torment of being 'small'. Big magically translates the inner insecurity of childhood through the portrayal of a little boy who desires to become a grown-up, 'big' in his own words.What really precedes the magical transition hardly matters, and I guess this is why the film gets so quickly to the point, it's very hard to imagine why Josh Baskin, wants to be big, to do the roller-coaster? to impress a girl, obviously too mature for him? The wish he makes to a magical fortune-telling machine seems more like a strong will to be and to act like an adult, which contrast with his surprise to wake up the day after as a grown thirty-something man. David Moskow played young Josh with such realistic maturity that the connection with Josh in Tom Hanks' body is hardly noticeable unless I considered that it's Josh' defensive reaction of becoming an adult that awakened the most childish mannerisms. Still, Hanks acted as 10-11 year old kid.This is why I talked about flaws, but never mind, Tom Hanks acts in such a convincing way as a little kid that sometimes it's very hard to 'get', especially in the beginning, but as the movie progresses, it gets more and more natural. And the part where he's forced to sleep in a motel and breakdowns in his bed in a fetal position was particularly heart-breaking. It takes some acting talent to make people laugh by keeping natural, and as a kid stuck in an adult body, Hanks delivered one of the subtlest and finest comedic performances ever, rightfully earning him his first nomination to an Oscar in 1989. I used to love a movie dealing with the same themes, Like Father Like Son when Dudley Moore and his teenage son played by Kirk Cameron exchanged their bodies, yet, unlike Big, it fell into the trap of overacting when Moore played his role as if he was a ten-year-old boy.Big works better because it doesn't overuse the fantastic element which only serves for the set-up. Like in Groundhog Day, we never know the reason of the time loop phenomenon, in Big, and we don't need to know, it's all about how a kid would live his life if he was stuck in a grown-up body, a very simple and original plot device that would pave the way to a series of extremely funny situations. And with such a Big idea on hands, the writers did the best without dealing with too much adult material, it's all about the situations that would lead him to get a job in a toys company, to be regarded as a goldmine for bright ideas, and seen with eyes of admiration, from MacMillan, Robert Loggia as a lovable CEO, of temptation, by Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), the office slut who finally found something 'special' in Josh, and eyes of jealousy by Paul, who sees in him, a dangerous competitor.The condition of Josh provides nice cinematic touches and memorable situations, among them the famous walking piano scene with Loggia, Josh insisting to be on 'the top' during his sleepover with Susan. And gradually, as the story evolves more confidently, it seems to inhabit its own maturation process, the clues about Josh's age cease to be as obvious, we don't need to see his house full of toys, his relationship with Billy, his best friend, Tom Hanks carries the film and there are some part where hints of childhood are betrayed by looks or smiles, his reaction to Susan's indirect declaration of love is the highlight of Hank's performance, he was perfect at that moment.The third act carries all the tenderness and poignancy that redeem the little moments where the film gets too stereotypical, we see a mother missing her child, we see a grown man who doesn't want to play anymore, he looks serious with his necktie and costume, but something in his heart is desperately missing his childhood. And this is what Penny Marshall, and the Oscar nominated script of Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg has a message to say.

It doesn't avoid some clichés, some over-the-top acting, but all in all,l Penny Marshall's fantasy classic is an endearing piece of originality deprived from cynicism and convenient political incorrectness, with this perfect dosage of comedy and poignancy that appeals to both adults and kids. I, for one, forgive what I said about predictability, since I can't even avoid formulaic expressions while reviewing Big.Big is a sincere and genuine invitation to value childhood and its underrated impact on our lives. Big reminded me of Stand by Me, Rob Reiner's bittersweet classic where the narrator remembers what being thirteen was like playing, sharing secrets, having fun with pals before girls started to invade private thoughts, never needing to act seriously, expressing imagination and sticking together while enduring the bullying from the elder and naturally, the torment of being 'small'. Big magically translates the inner insecurity of childhood through the portrayal of a little boy who desires to become a grown-up, 'big' in his own words.What really precedes the magical transition hardly matters, and I guess this is why the film gets so quickly to the point, it's very hard to imagine why Josh Baskin, wants to be big, to do the roller-coaster? to impress a girl, obviously too mature for him? The wish he makes to a magical fortune-telling machine seems more like a strong will to be and to act like an adult, which contrast with his surprise to wake up the day after as a grown thirty-something man. David Moskow played young Josh with such realistic maturity that the connection with Josh in Tom Hanks' body is hardly noticeable unless I considered that it's Josh' defensive reaction of becoming an adult that awakened the most childish mannerisms. Still, Hanks acted as 10-11 year old kid.This is why I talked about flaws, but never mind, Tom Hanks acts in such a convincing way as a little kid that sometimes it's very hard to 'get', especially in the beginning, but as the movie progresses, it gets more and more natural. And the part where he's forced to sleep in a motel and breakdowns in his bed in a fetal position was particularly heart-breaking. It takes some acting talent to make people laugh by keeping natural, and as a kid stuck in an adult body, Hanks delivered one of the subtlest and finest comedic performances ever, rightfully earning him his first nomination to an Oscar in 1989. I used to love a movie dealing with the same themes, Like Father Like Son when Dudley Moore and his teenage son played by Kirk Cameron exchanged their bodies, yet, unlike Big, it fell into the trap of overacting when Moore played his role as if he was a ten-year-old boy.Big works better because it doesn't overuse the fantastic element which only serves for the set-up. Like in Groundhog Day, we never know the reason of the time loop phenomenon, in Big, and we don't need to know, it's all about how a kid would live his life if he was stuck in a grown-up body, a very simple and original plot device that would pave the way to a series of extremely funny situations. And with such a Big idea on hands, the writers did the best without dealing with too much adult material, it's all about the situations that would lead him to get a job in a toys company, to be regarded as a goldmine for bright ideas, and seen with eyes of admiration, from MacMillan, Robert Loggia as a lovable CEO, of temptation, by Susan (Elizabeth Perkins), the office slut who finally found something 'special' in Josh, and eyes of jealousy by Paul, who sees in him, a dangerous competitor.The condition of Josh provides nice cinematic touches and memorable situations, among them the famous walking piano scene with Loggia, Josh insisting to be on 'the top' during his sleepover with Susan. And gradually, as the story evolves more confidently, it seems to inhabit its own maturation process, the clues about Josh's age cease to be as obvious, we don't need to see his house full of toys, his relationship with Billy, his best friend, Tom Hanks carries the film and there are some part where hints of childhood are betrayed by looks or smiles, his reaction to Susan's indirect declaration of love is the highlight of Hank's performance, he was perfect at that moment.The third act carries all the tenderness and poignancy that redeem the little moments where the film gets too stereotypical, we see a mother missing her child, we see a grown man who doesn't want to play anymore, he looks serious with his necktie and costume, but something in his heart is desperately missing his childhood. And this is what Penny Marshall, and the Oscar nominated script of Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg has a message to say.

That's what I thought anyways after seeing the trailer for Reign of Fire, Rob Bowman's 2002 post- apocalyptic thriller about dragons and the humans that fear them. Christian Bale and Mathew McConaughy, who play the lead roles, went on to have successful careers after this movie.    First off, Rob Bowman deserves substantial credit for agreeing to direct this movie, considering the riskiness of such an endeavor. Bowman, who produced many of the X-Files episodes, was no stranger to the sci-fi thriller genre when he signed onto this. However, the prospect of making a high budget special effects film about the dragon apocalypse must have seemed a little far-fetched. After all, how would a bunch of dragons manage to defeat the world's military and burn the entire surface of the earth to ash? Why couldn't they be stopped? Most importantly though, why dragons of all things? Certainly a unique premise, it appears as though the film did not come together as well as it could have. Reign of Fire does succeed however in creating a great post-apocalyptic atmosphere, which bears significant resemblance to the world seen in the future sequences of James Cameron's Terminator movies. The trench-coat clad gunmen coupled with the burnt out English countryside help to establish a similar feeling of impending doom and gloominess to that of John Conner's future war against the machines. Copious amounts of ash and fog, ever present in the film, help to intensify this effect. Bowman also made a great decision to stray away from the typical Godzilla-style monster movie by sacrificing the over-the-top scenes of carnage that the genre is notorious for in order to leave room for character development.The problem is that the people responsible for this movie forgot to include character development. Perhaps they were too excited about the dragons. Much of the plot revolves around Christian Bale, who plays a thirty something year old English man named Quinn. Quinn, who accidentally woke up the original dragon that started the whole mess, now protects a group of survivors by not wearing his shirt. Sadly, Bale's character is an insult to his talent. Quinn spends much of his time on screen being depressed and shouting at people without having any revealing dialogue.We never really get to learn too much about Quinn however, because Mathew McConaughy shows up about thirty minutes in and steals the show, although you'll wish he hadn't. McConaughy, who inexplicably goes by the name of Van Zan, rides up to Quinn's fort straddling a tank gun and quickly establishes himself as the film's leading source of phallic imagery. A full-bodied yet empty character, Van Zan, or Thrust Meat-Chunk, looks as if he had just stepped out of an Unreal Tournament game. He also claims to be an expert dragon slayer.Somehow, Van Zan, has managed to pilot a huge cargo jet full of American stereotypes over to England to save the day because hey, that's what America does, right? He plans to do so by defeating the original dragon that Quinn unwittingly released at the age of eight. Van intends to accomplish this feat through the use of motorcycles and a helicopter. Unfortunately, Van Slam-Chest quickly proves himself to be one of the most incompetent action heroes in film history, leading one to wonder how he's survived so long without being eaten. Van's habit of knowing nearly everything about the dragons leads one to doubt whether or not the film-makers knew how to resolve the movie.By the end of the film, the audience will likely be rooting for Van Zan's death and wondering why it hadn't come earlier. Essentially, it's McConaughy's character who ruins Reign of Fire, which otherwise may have been a decent sci-fi thriller. While Van appears to have good intentions, his arrogance and destructive nature prevent him from being a suitable protagonist.Despite Van Man's excessive screen time, Reign of Fire does contain some redeeming qualities. In particular, it does a good job of capturing humanity's pitiful state in the post industrial era. Most notable is the the light saber duel that Quinn and his friend put on in the decaying church for the children's amusement. It is moving to see the adult generation's efforts to preserve the culture of a bygone age of human history. Overall though, Reign of Fire fails to be a successful thriller. The moderate special effects do not make up for the fact that this film lacks the exciting action sequences, quirky dialogue and fun character's that define its genre.

But this movie shows up is the limit and what is right and wrong in order to get the job done and taking down the bad guys. This is noir done right with some great storytelling. It really does get down to the dirty aspect to the police force back in the early 50's and has enough grime and grit to intrigue most audiences that is into this type of genre. Even if your not into this types of genre, it's still a movie that should be watched by anyone at least once. The story revolves around 3 police offices one who is a smart and yet not willing to bend when it comes to the law no matter what and is a bit of a snitch. Also sometimes he comes off as a character that cares about the image he thinks up for himself than actual integrity. The second is a hot tempered cop that is willing to get his hands a bit dirty in order to get the job done and unleashes his own person justice. The third is a selfish cop that only care about himself and nothing really matters as long as he reaps the benefits and there is a payoff. The movie will have the audiences attention because it's entertaining with it's intelligent investigation and put together well without it being way too convoluted, the way it's all connected is integrated in a way where you can't help but pay attention to what is going on. And the audiences are going to have to pay close attention to the investigation to get the most out of this movie. The dialogue is also sharp and the acting performances are the same as well. I was looking forward to seeing how every piece of the of puzzle is gonna be made at the end. And the ending is good and the puzzle to the investigation is put together almost brilliantly.

This is the case with Sleepers, a film about four boys living in Hell's Kitchen. These four boys are the best of friends, pulling all kinds of antics on the streets. However, one day a prank of theirs goes horribly wrong and they land themselves in a brutal correctional facility for boys. In this facility they are subjected to torture and rape by the guards, forever changing their lives and draining them of their youth. Years later two of the boys get revenge, leading to their trial in which the lead prosecutor is one of the victims. He devises a clever scheme to fulfill their revenge against the scum that abused them so terribly. It's a heartfelt and emotional film, albeit a tad bit Hollywood.I mentioned starpower earlier and I was serious. This film rounds together an incredibly talented collection of male actors including Robert DeNiro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patrick, and others. All of these fine actors give it their all for this film, and their dedication to acting really shines. Barry Levinson directs his film with the utmost care and respect towards a powerful story and he also gives it a screenplay that certainly packs a punch. Sleepers has all the right elements for a truly incredible film.Yet, here is a film that tries its absolute hardest to be the best it can be, at times trying a little too hard. It's emotional, it's moving, it's touching, and it's sincere. However, it is pretty easy to place the emotions elicited by this film. It's not a particularly challenging film and we know what to expect and what to feel. The film doesn't necessarily insult our intelligence with its melodrama or cliché. Instead, it uses these things as a device to make us remember this film and to allow us to enjoy it during its two and a half hour duration. Yet after the film a little reflection reveals the way this film works in fairly simplistic ways, telling us what to feel and when to feel it, not letting the audience make their own conclusions about the morals presented in the film. Had the film lacked the talent behind it I would have had a much bigger problem with this, but because I was treated to a fine script, fantastic acting, and skilled directing I had an easier time letting it slide.Don't go into Sleepers looking for a particularly challenging film. Don't expect a masterpiece and just take the movie as it comes. As far as the validity of the film's story goes, I can't speak to that. All I do know is that the events depicted in the movie, whether they be true or false, make for a fine film that had the potential to delve much deeper into themes like the loss of innocence and the fading of youth.

Terminator 2 draws together all the traditions of its predecessors for calculated effect.Like the original 1984 movie, Terminator 2 has a plot that is holier than the pope's colander, with numerous contradictions and logical fallacies. Fans of the series have long argued over the plot holes and even theorised back-stories to explain them away. They are missing the point. Terminator 2's prime directive is to thrill and entertain, and the plot is a servant to this purpose. Does it, for example, seem remotely likely that John and Arnie and the T1000 would converge on the mental hospital not only at the same time as each other, but also at the exact point that Sarah Connor made her escape after years of incarceration? Of course it doesn't &#x96; but it makes for an exciting sequence in the movie. That's not to say the plot is dispensable. Even if it doesn't make technical sense, the motivations and development of characters must follow some kind of pattern. We need to accept Arnie as sympathetic, not scary as he was in the first movie. The fact that the first thing he does when he arrives in the present is beat up a load of cocky bikers endears us to him immediately.James Cameron's direction is geared towards a continuous movement and activity. When we first see Linda Hamilton, he has the camera swoop in on the mental hospital, then cuts straight into a moving shot panning from the window over to her. It's more dynamic than a simple establishing shot followed by a cut to an interior, and it helps keep up that tense rhythm and show off her character as someone to be reckoned with. Often cars and other vehicles will drive straight into shot, sliding across the foreground to fill the frame, really making the audience feel involved in &#x96; or rather, jolted by &#x96; the action. There's some CGI of course, something I don't normally approve of, but the CGI here is neat because it stays within its own limitations. The main subject of computer animation is those liquid metal goo, and smooth blobs were about the only thing CGI could do convincingly back then. Having said that, the technical flawlessness of Terminator 2 is still not a patch on the rickety low-budget charm of the 1984 picture.Speaking of things staying within their limitations, Terminator 2 sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the only role he could ever do convincingly &#x96; a robotic killing machine. As usual the awkward woodenness comes completely naturally. I wonder if he ever realised the irony of this? Robert Patrick makes a great contrast to the muscular Arnie; a lean, wiry frame like a metal spring, and a believable portrayal of a mechanical mind. Linda Hamilton is a little better than she was in the first movie, and certainly convinces as the tough cookie. By and large though the casting here is more about looks and body types than actual talent. This is not a movie that demands such depth.Or is it? There is another strand running through Terminator 2 that was not present in the first picture, and that is its humanist streak. From the very opening moments &#x96; scenes of children in a playground &#x96; we are shown what is at stake. Something deeper is added to the simple people v. machines set-up by showing the robot being taught about humanity and acquiring emotion. It is ostensibly just the stuff of subplot, and yet by giving us something to believe in, by giving reason and sympathy to the heroes, it makes all the frenetic action worthwhile.

Terminator 2 draws together all the traditions of its predecessors for calculated effect.Like the original 1984 movie, Terminator 2 has a plot that is holier than the pope's colander, with numerous contradictions and logical fallacies. Fans of the series have long argued over the plot holes and even theorised back-stories to explain them away. They are missing the point. Terminator 2's prime directive is to thrill and entertain, and the plot is a servant to this purpose. Does it, for example, seem remotely likely that John and Arnie and the T1000 would converge on the mental hospital not only at the same time as each other, but also at the exact point that Sarah Connor made her escape after years of incarceration? Of course it doesn't &#x96; but it makes for an exciting sequence in the movie. That's not to say the plot is dispensable. Even if it doesn't make technical sense, the motivations and development of characters must follow some kind of pattern. We need to accept Arnie as sympathetic, not scary as he was in the first movie. The fact that the first thing he does when he arrives in the present is beat up a load of cocky bikers endears us to him immediately.James Cameron's direction is geared towards a continuous movement and activity. When we first see Linda Hamilton, he has the camera swoop in on the mental hospital, then cuts straight into a moving shot panning from the window over to her. It's more dynamic than a simple establishing shot followed by a cut to an interior, and it helps keep up that tense rhythm and show off her character as someone to be reckoned with. Often cars and other vehicles will drive straight into shot, sliding across the foreground to fill the frame, really making the audience feel involved in &#x96; or rather, jolted by &#x96; the action. There's some CGI of course, something I don't normally approve of, but the CGI here is neat because it stays within its own limitations. The main subject of computer animation is those liquid metal goo, and smooth blobs were about the only thing CGI could do convincingly back then. Having said that, the technical flawlessness of Terminator 2 is still not a patch on the rickety low-budget charm of the 1984 picture.Speaking of things staying within their limitations, Terminator 2 sees the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing the only role he could ever do convincingly &#x96; a robotic killing machine. As usual the awkward woodenness comes completely naturally. I wonder if he ever realised the irony of this? Robert Patrick makes a great contrast to the muscular Arnie; a lean, wiry frame like a metal spring, and a believable portrayal of a mechanical mind. Linda Hamilton is a little better than she was in the first movie, and certainly convinces as the tough cookie. By and large though the casting here is more about looks and body types than actual talent. This is not a movie that demands such depth.Or is it? There is another strand running through Terminator 2 that was not present in the first picture, and that is its humanist streak. From the very opening moments &#x96; scenes of children in a playground &#x96; we are shown what is at stake. Something deeper is added to the simple people v. machines set-up by showing the robot being taught about humanity and acquiring emotion. It is ostensibly just the stuff of subplot, and yet by giving us something to believe in, by giving reason and sympathy to the heroes, it makes all the frenetic action worthwhile. It is this angle which really brings the movie to life.

I absolutely enjoyed it. It was very risky for the time, but it showed that since the approval was not in effect anymore, that such acts like robbery, and sex were allowed to be shown or implied. I found it to be straight forward as the characters who did not know each other, just suddenly became partners in crime. The whole connection and also distance between Bonnie and Clyde is frustrating because the audience wants them to work out, but the constant tension and disregard that Clyde shows is aggravating. The movie in some senses, implied that robbery was a fun and cool thing to do which again was very risky. But the movie ended up being a fantastic hit and was very enjoyable to watch!

It was produced, written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles, when he was just 26 years old. This movie is one of the first movies ever to accomplish such unique technical advantages, and it redefined the legacy of cinema. The movie begins as Orson Welles, playing Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon, who is introduced in the opening scene, on his deathbed, saying his final word, Rosebud, before dropping a snow-globe to the floor. Then, it follows to the perspective of a reporter who is investigating the meaning of Rosebud, and it leads to a series of flashbacks that shows glimpses of Kane's life. Okay, let's just say, I enjoy black-and-white movies a little bit, but the thought of seeing this was just plain enjoying. The story was found fascinating and interesting, but it's not really spectacular and remarkable. But it's Orson Welles that helped lead the way to show cinema the true meaning of filmmaking. I also enjoyed all the innovating camera techniques used to make the movie more unique, which includes so many uses of deep focus, long shots, soundtrack, film editing, transitions, shadows, and lighting. These techniques were too impossible to accomplish in the past, but it was Welles that made the impossible into possible. From an interesting script to a fine cast, it just proves that Citizen Kane, after many years, is still a movie that impresses audiences everywhere, with a movie that beat the odds of cinema, and it's an incredible recommendation for true movie lovers. Citizen Kane, in my review, a brilliant masterpiece, masterfully accomplished.
