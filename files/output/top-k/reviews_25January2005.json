Oh, how scary! The movie in itself is FX. The rest is a ripoff of Red Planet (but without Carrie Anne Moss walking out of the shower), Star Wars and Men In Black (the creatures...), and some dreadful b-sci-fi movies.Diesel pulls out some sort of Dom (the guy he played in Fast & FUrious), while the rest of the cast spend their time trying to justify their being in this film.I never thought a movie would deserve a 1. There's something always worth remarking. Well, it's not enough with FX, and the movie is too sorely bad.

I eventually caught MISSION TO MARS on TV and I was glad I didn't see it at the movies or even rented it. But now I rented RED PLANET last night and I have to say that I liked it a lot. It's much better than the hokey De Palma movie. There are a lot of weaknesses in it but even with all it's faults, the whole package worked.The problems with RED PLANET Val Kilmer is miscast. He doesn't seem interested in the story and his acting is lazy. He looks like a lost surfer dude on Mars. They should have hired another actor instead of Kilmer. Some characters were weak (Stamp and Bratt). The designs of the ship's interior were a tad cheesy. The dialogue was sometimes terrible. And the story had some major holes in it, like the idea that the ship's censors didn't detect the breathable atmosphere on Mars.But aside from those problems, the rest is fun. It's a straight forward science fiction story. If you don't like that kind of story, you'll certainly won't like this. It reminded me of ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS or PITCH BLACK, in the way it respected the sci-fi themes and elements without watering them down for the audience. Tom Sizemore and Carrie-Anne Moss are excellent in their roles. Some of the cinematography is excellent. And while the fx are uneven (sometimes spectacular, sometimes obvious), the overall look of the film is always credible. And the ending is thrilling.If you like straight forward science fiction films like me, you'll enjoy this movie.

It had been years since I previously viewed the film, but it is an experience of lasting effect that sticks with you--from the monotonous, minimalist score (like Halloween, its repetition gets under your skin), the crisp pacing, memorable characters, occasionally quirky dialog, and Carpenter's sheer mastery of building on-screen suspense, it's a movie that achieves a visceral intensity few of today's big-budget wonders can match. Upon my recent viewing, the similarities to George Romero's Night of the Living Dead were bolder (Austin Stoker looks AND sounds like Duane Jones; the station DID seem like that farmhouse; and the anonymous youth gang is easily the zombies' equal); yet at the same time, Carpenter's film is more economical, with a pace that never lulls into all-out-action or all-out-exposition for very long (granted, it is lacking in Romero's developed allegory), and the motives and personalities of the gang members are left fittingly vague (thus making their threat more monstrous). Against a pitch-black Los Angeles night, Carpenter creates a true sense of isolation and desperation that's surprisingly potent--this film inspires more feelings of heart-in-throat terror than most certifiable 'horror' fare. Matched with a strong atmosphere and setting, Carpenter succeeds in getting structured, memorable performances out of his nameless cast (though Darwin Joston and Tony Burton had small roles in Eraserhead and The Shining, respectively)--Stoker as the level-headed policeman; Laurie Zimmer as a steely, monotone secretary; Darwin Joston as a convict who is as tough as he is funny (Got a smoke?).In short, Assault on Precinct 13 is Carpenter's true masterpiece. Just see it.
