It has all the typical genre elements present and a great, oh so important, dark and gritty atmosphere. This is crime\/film-noir at its very best!The Asphalt Jungle is a quite typical heist movie with all the formulaic characters and elements present in it. I however really like the approach of this movie on its story. It provides us a view in the dark violent criminal underworld of the '50's and it chooses to not really have a main character. Instead the story focuses on all of the major players that are involved in the heist; before, during and after. It makes every plot line and character just as engaging and interesting as the other. It makes The Asphalt Jungle a consistently powerful crime\/film-noir that is filled with all the necessary elements, such as backstabbing characters and honor amongst thieves. Combine that with a perfectly dark and gritty atmosphere and the end result is one of the most consistent and engaging heist movies ever created, if not the best of all time.The story is told really well. Instead of having only fast paced action sequences, the movie maintains a steady pace during its entire running time. It doesn't make one moment slow or the other fast, it instead is a very consistent movie that thanks to its steady pace doesn't ever have any boring or too slow moments, like often is the case with movies from the same period. Also the fact that it focuses on more than one storyline or character, makes the movie even more interesting to follow. Due to this, every event and character in the movie becomes just as interesting and engaging as the other. The formulaic screenplay is made really interesting and powerful thanks to John Huston his refreshing directing and take on the story. He makes the story look more exciting, tense and engaging than it was on paper. It makes the character introductions, the heist itself and its aftermath work all extremely well and the one just as powerful and interesting as the other. It's certainly one of the most consistently great movies I have ever seen.Like you would expect from a genre movie like this, the atmosphere plays a very important role for the movie. This particular movie does have a great atmosphere. It's deliciously dark and gritty and has some great cinematography and use of light, done by Harold Rosson, who was one of the very best cinematographers of his period. The musical score by Mikl贸s R贸zsa is also wonderful, though its unfortunately not often enough present in the movie.Film-noir's always are very straight-forward and have a certain feel of realism. The movie is not only realistic due to it's atmosphere but it's also mainly very realistic, due to its character treatment, dialog and well cast actors.The acting in this movie is great. The actors in this movie are by no means some of the greatest that ever lived but they all suite their roles extremely well. Especially Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley is fantastic. Very raw and tough. Also really well cast were Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern and Jean Hagen. Marilyn Monroe is also really good in this movie. She doesn't play a very large role but her presence is big and impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.Impressive, realistic, gritty heist movie in typical film-noir style brilliantly directed by John Huston. An absolute must-see for the fans of the genre.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one real classic and great heist movie.

By the time that the magical 117 minutes were over, we had been through the most stressful movie of our life, but at the end, there was a sigh of relief.As I watched the film for the first time, I took into notice a few of the most prominent ideas and philosophies of the movie.Alien tells the story of a crew of seven space truck drivers. When they are awoken from their deep sleep they realize that they are not in our galaxy (they were on their way home to earth)and that Mother has startled them so they can investigate some type of signal on a remote planet. At this point in the film, the story feels very realistic and believable, because of the fact that there is no hokey magic, or some type of destiny that one of the characters will fall into. These are ordinary people doing their job, and all they want to do is get it done with and be on their way home. This fatal trip to the remote planet will in the end be their undoing.

Simply put, this movie is passable, and certainly not one of Carpenter's better efforts. In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of remakes, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic. This one isn't. It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either. The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see. I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual. Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough atmosphere to make up for the fact that nothing is actually going on. And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland. (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.) And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre. But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah. Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.Frankly, this movie is a perfect candidate for remake. Good concept, passable execution. I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this material was 'watered down' for the remake. Hah! This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it. We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt. That's about it. The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far. The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.) Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be. Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time.

Well, I dunno if you really need to see either of them, particularly if you're not a huge horror fan. Just go watch 'The Thing' again, or perhaps check out Carpenter's under-appreciated 'In the Mouth of Madness'.

This film may have a considerable cult following, but he is not at the level of, say, William Castle, the director of the original House film. This, however, is his magnum opus and he has managed to create a truly terrifying horror film, paying a great homage to its predecessor.Obviously, this remake doesn't quite match up to its predecessor. But regardless, Malone creates a surprisingly creepy horror film that really captivates the atmosphere and feel of William Castle's original film, the atmosphere of the fun houses in amusement parks we all enjoyed as a kid.Basically, here's the back story Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt, a sadistic brute of a doctor is the director of the critically celebrated, R.B. Vannacutt Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He performs bizarre experiments on the patients taken into his care, including vivisection and electroshock treatment. In late 1931, the patients grow tired of the tyranny of Vannacutt, so they burn the asylum to the ground, cutting the doctor apart in the midst. All but 5 of the staff's doctors die in the fire (these probably would have been different statistics, but Vannacutt locked the entire place down using the asylum's security system- if he was gonna die, they were all gonna die). Enter Stephen Price 60 years later, the owner of Price Amusement Parks. He is a bitter, cynical, sarcastic man - the point of blame for these traits seem to be his unwilling marriage to his wife, Evelyn Stockhard-Price, the kind of bitch you just love to hate. After seeing a documentary on Dr. Vannacutt, Evelyn decides to have her upcoming birthday party in the recently-restored House. Price tries to change her mind, but she's set with it. Price invites a group of money-hungry guests to the party - for some strange reason, the people who arrive are an absolute different group of strangers. Why, why? The reasons, of course, are revealed later on in the film. Things get interesting as the lock-down mechanism (last used when the place burned down) mysteriously activates again.The acting is superb. Geoffrey Rush has a great time with his role as Steven Price, the bitingly sarcastic Greg House-like billionaire, whose role is an obvious tribute to Vincent Price, the actor of the original millionaire in the 1959 edition. Famke Jannseen delivers a great performance as his equally sarcastic and sadistic wife. Comedian Chris Kattan pulls off the broken-down, tittering, Watson Pritchett, the seemingly cursed owner of the Asylum who's accepted his inevitable death (I'd love to get laid before I died). The rest of the supporting cast (Peter Gallagher as Dr. Blackburn, Taye Diggs as Eddie Baker, Ali Larter as Sara Wolfe, and Bridgette Wilson as super-bitch Melissa Marr) delivers decent performances, and, even though their characters are not the most interesting, deliver their fair share of good one-liners. And, Jeffrey Combs, who definitely deserves a mention, plays the demented Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt - the director of the asylum that started all the trouble in the first place. Combs, though having at the most, 5 minutes of screen time, pulls the role of Vannacutt off terrifyingly well. The way that he walks around the house scared the hell out of me, and the look of his character in itself is dominating.The asylum is excellently designed. The exterior is so bizarre and offbeat, it looks like a lighthouse-turned-prison. Rather normal during the day, but terrifying at night. And the interior itself is beautiful in a very dark sense - I really wouldn't mind living there were it not for it being haunted by Vannacutt and the rest.So why doesn't this movie work? Well, the ending has to do with most of this. The screenwriter, Dick Beebe, creates a very intense buildup in his story throughout the first hour\/half-hour of his film, and I was really expecting a final twist in the plot for the ending. Unfortunately, Mr. Beebe throws away his efforts and concludes the film by throwing in some evil spirit and killing off the remaining characters in a very overplayed fashion. It's a shame, considering what the finale could have been.To say the least, this is worth a rental.

This film may have a considerable cult following, but he is not at the level of, say, William Castle, the director of the original House film. This, however, is his magnum opus and he has managed to create a truly terrifying horror film, paying a great homage to its predecessor.Obviously, this remake doesn't quite match up to its predecessor. But regardless, Malone creates a surprisingly creepy horror film that really captivates the atmosphere and feel of William Castle's original film, the atmosphere of the fun houses in amusement parks we all enjoyed as a kid.Basically, here's the back story Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt, a sadistic brute of a doctor is the director of the critically celebrated, R.B. Vannacutt Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He performs bizarre experiments on the patients taken into his care, including vivisection and electroshock treatment. In late 1931, the patients grow tired of the tyranny of Vannacutt, so they burn the asylum to the ground, cutting the doctor apart in the midst. All but 5 of the staff's doctors die in the fire (these probably would have been different statistics, but Vannacutt locked the entire place down using the asylum's security system- if he was gonna die, they were all gonna die). Enter Stephen Price 60 years later, the owner of Price Amusement Parks. He is a bitter, cynical, sarcastic man - the point of blame for these traits seem to be his unwilling marriage to his wife, Evelyn Stockhard-Price, the kind of bitch you just love to hate. After seeing a documentary on Dr. Vannacutt, Evelyn decides to have her upcoming birthday party in the recently-restored House. Price tries to change her mind, but she's set with it. Price invites a group of money-hungry guests to the party - for some strange reason, the people who arrive are an absolute different group of strangers. Why, why? The reasons, of course, are revealed later on in the film. Things get interesting as the lock-down mechanism (last used when the place burned down) mysteriously activates again.The acting is superb. Geoffrey Rush has a great time with his role as Steven Price, the bitingly sarcastic Greg House-like billionaire, whose role is an obvious tribute to Vincent Price, the actor of the original millionaire in the 1959 edition.

The opening is a little slow and you might get bored, but it's necessary to establish the film's realism and make you believe in the characters and their world.It may not be the best horror film ever.. But it's probably the scariest. Jaws and the Shining are better films overall, but the exorcist is more disturbing and frightening then either one of them. Taken as a whole it's more shocking and unforgiving than any Fucli film.

The exorcist doesn't really show anything visually or contain any content that equal's films like visitor Q, but the way the subject matter is handled causes it to hit home very forcefully.

This film is about a crew of asbestos cleaners who take a job at a large, old asylum located out in the woods. The place is completely dilapidated and is literally falling apart, but they take the job anyway because nobody else seems to want to do it (Hmm... I wonder why?). Tensions between the crew members start to rise during the job and they become increasingly angry and short tempered with each other. One of the crew members becomes consumed with the recorded sessions of an former patient at the hospital, listening to each one. The ghosts of the past patients then begin to make themselves know, terrorizing the workers.This was surprisingly well done horror\/thriller, tightly bound with all around good performances, a unique story, and some really frightening moments throughout. The first half of the film was a little slow-moving, but it picks up during the second half and turns out be rewarding in the end. The underground tunnel sequences under the hospital were scary as hell, the viewer never knows what's going to come around a dark corner and some terrifying things take place down there. I've always found old mental hospitals to be extremely spooky anyway, so it was great to see such a good movie that is based around one. The movie was filmed at the Danvers State Hospital (which was recently demolished, I believe) which is an abandoned insane asylum that is said to actually be haunted by ghosts, and according to cast and crew, they had some strange occurrences while filming the movie.

Together with Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) they all decide to visit a gypsy fortune teller named Bela (Bela Lugosi) who happens to be a Werewolf & attacks Jenny later that night, Larry hears Jenny's screams & rushes to help her. Larry sees a large Wolf attacking her so he beats it to death with his silver headed cane but sustains some bite marks himself. The next day & the local copper Paul Montford (Ralph Bellamy) is confused as Jenny is indeed dead but no trace of any Wolf only another body, that of fortune teller Bela & Larry's supposed wounds are now completely healed. It's not long before Larry discovers that the uncontrollable curse of the Werewolf has been passed on to himself...Produced & directed by George Waggner I have to say I was disappointed with The Wolf Man. The script by Curt Siodmak is far too talky for me, sure there's plenty of character development but there's only so much I can take before I start to get bored. It's past the 40 minute mark before Larry turns into the Wolf man, that 40 minutes where next to nothing happens except dull exposition. The film takes itself very seriously & I think it's a film of it's time & it hasn't aged that well with stiff 40's dialogue, dodgy police procedures & is anyone actually convinced this is set in Wales? Having said that at only 70 minutes the film isn't too long & some may find some charm in it's story & the period in which it was made & set. Personally I just didn't find much here to enjoy, I can barely remember anything happening & as a whole the film just didn't interest or grip me at all.Director Waggner does an OK job, the swamps & forests are obviously sets but they add a certain atmosphere with all the low level fog. The town looks more Eastern European than Welsh & no one will be impressed with the special effects these days although everything considered they ain't all that bad.With a supposed budget of about $180,000 The Wolf Man has pretty good production values even if those outdoor sets look like they're made from cardboard at times. The acting is alright.OK, I'm prepared for all the 'not useful' votes because The Wolf Man seems to be a well liked film overall & people will vote my comment down but for me it just didn't entertain, scare or interest. I can't say I hated it because I didn't but at the same time I can't say I particularly liked it because I didn't so I'll say I found it watchable & an average way to pass 70 minutes, overall though disappointing.

John Cusack? John Malkovich? What more could you want? Now, I would have been hesitant if I had known Cameron Diaz was going to show up, but she was a minor part of the film and handled herself well. One or two more good films and I might finally forgive her for Vanilla Sky.The story is very absurd a young puppeteer finds a door in his office that goes in side John Malkovich's mind. That's strange enough, but it gets so much wackier from there (but I won't ruin it for you). You have Malkovich in the primary role, who is by far one of the greatest actors in history. And you have Cusack as the secondary role, who is also a great actor - one might even say more versatile (his costume in this film makes him almost unrecognizable as Cusack).What more can I say without giving this away? First, the film is really deep (existential) but also very funny. When Cusack first tells his co-worker about the portal, she asked who is John Malkovich? which I find hilarious - both because I wondered the same thing when the film first came out, and also because it begins a long string of self-deprecating Malkovich moments.The only other thing you need to know if you're not already sold this film is a Charlie Kaufman creation. Who's Kaufman? The guy who made Adaptation. And if you haven't seen that, you really ought to (I'd even say it a better film than this classic). There you go I just suggested a double feature.

Or, to be more forgiving, a group of musical fans that will do anything to see the genre return.I'm glad so many people liked it, and I agree, Newsies wasn't terrible. It had singing and dancing, with Mencken at the lyrics, so we musical fans have to give it at least a five. And it's great to see men dancing - not that this rivaled West Side Story, but it offered the high energy dancing as only young men can do. And it was based on a real inspirational event (coming from Disney, it had to be that or a heartwarming children's classic). Christian Bale has incredible appeal, Max Casella is good, and David Moscow shows potential. Ann-Margaret, unfortunately, must have been forced to be in the film, because she played her part like she was under heavy doses of anti-depressant medication. Now that I think about it, she was very authentic for the times.Music was great, especially the range offered. The other day my husband flipped to the Hallmark channel and I could tell he was watching a Disney movie just by the way the horns were played (turned out it was the Ugly Daschound - quite the classic).

Not a single urchin. You couldn't call them ragamuffins - none of them wore rags. Please. No crooked teeth. Not even dirty hair. I think they even used hankies. And such clean streets! Times Square is dirtier now, after the renovation. Concept and basic story were excellent, and I suppose I can't fault Disney for throwing in the romance and the poignant storyline. The writing (especially lyrics!) and music was beautiful and long missed from other movies. But the production itself could have been miles better.

The passage of time and a keener focus reveals a lot more going on in this movie than a conflict between two good men and the killing of an outlaw gunman. Surface generalities aside, the story is about the passing of an era, with the bullets of a bygone time about to be replaced by the subtler but just as lethal machinations of the political machine.There's another way to look at the events surrounding the death of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Suppose Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) made up the story about shooting Valance to save Ransom Stoddard's hide. It would have been just another savage way of further emasculating Jimmy Stewart's character upon realizing that Hallie (Vera Miles) was never going to be his girl. After all, he wasn't above humiliating Ranse with the mean spirited paint can demonstration where his rage was more palpable. I'm not advancing that hypothesis by the way, but it's an interesting conjecture that fits, and isn't denied by any of the other facts of the story.There's a rather strange moment in the picture that director Ford opted to keep. When Stoddard addresses the town meeting about to nominate representatives to Washington, he walks from behind a desk and hits his head on the bottom of the stairwell. He looks at the stair, and without skipping a beat, keeps on talking to the audience. I wonder if it hurt?Even stranger though is the sequence when Wayne's character leaves town after drinking heavily and arrives home with his ward Pompey (Woody Strode). In town he has a black shirt, arriving at home it's a light colored one. Breaking the door in, the shirt is black again, and when Pompey saves him from the fire, it's not only light colored again, but with a set of buttons that go down to the belt line. Finally, the shirt is black again in the final scene of that sequence.For his final team up with John Wayne, Ford seems to go for caricature with many of the figures here. Most obvious is Lee Marvin's title character, Liberty Valance. He's pretty much allowed free reign as a nut case, and even though Andy Devine's usual persona as a do nothing lawman is somewhat expected, he's totally ineffective in enforcing anything in the town of Shinbone. Liberty's henchman Floyd (Strother Martin) is irritating as a whiny outlaw, and Lee Van Cleef has disappointingly too little screen time to be of consequence. Perhaps the most over the top performance is delivered by John Carradine, with macho exuberance and a name to match as Major Cassius Starbuckle.There's a lot going on in 'Liberty Valance' with repeat viewings recommended to uncover even more nuances. This is one Western that doesn't fit the typical mold, where preconceptions are shot down like cans on a fence post. It's a look at the wild west coming to an end with a blend of nostalgia, romance and grit that offers an effective glimpse at legend before succumbing to fact.

Breaking the door in, the shirt is black again, and when Pompey saves him from the fire, it's not only light colored again, but with a set of buttons that go down to the belt line. Finally, the shirt is black again in the final scene of that sequence.For his final team up with John Wayne, Ford seems to go for caricature with many of the figures here. Most obvious is Lee Marvin's title character, Liberty Valance. He's pretty much allowed free reign as a nut case, and even though Andy Devine's usual persona as a do nothing lawman is somewhat expected, he's totally ineffective in enforcing anything in the town of Shinbone. Liberty's henchman Floyd (Strother Martin) is irritating as a whiny outlaw, and Lee Van Cleef has disappointingly too little screen time to be of consequence. Perhaps the most over the top performance is delivered by John Carradine, with macho exuberance and a name to match as Major Cassius Starbuckle.There's a lot going on in 'Liberty Valance' with repeat viewings recommended to uncover even more nuances. This is one Western that doesn't fit the typical mold, where preconceptions are shot down like cans on a fence post. It's a look at the wild west coming to an end with a blend of nostalgia, romance and grit that offers an effective glimpse at legend before succumbing to fact.

Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.This is, in more ways than one, Doris Day's film. Not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement, and that they both realise it.After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage - he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions, in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.The potency of that voice is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At the Albert Hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the Embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. By contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the Albert Hall, and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed, thus depriving the Police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice, in the rescue of Hank from the embassy, that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.Far from being forced into the film to give Day an opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas; 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. It also neatly prepares the way for the finale, in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow Doris to save the day.The most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature - the build up to the assassination attempt in the Albert Hall. This lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing Hitchcock committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. We see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We don't need to - the images say everything. It is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, matched to the music perfectly. There isn't a frame out of place - anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is playing out. It builds slowly, but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. When Jo screams, it isn't just a relief for her, but for the audience.The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty, and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick-in-the-mud Nonconformist church. The Embassy sequence seems a little flat after the Albert Hall one that preceded it on first viewing, but second time around actually seems more effective, with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of Day singing in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-ambient-noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be foregrounded effectively.Bernard Miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but with a dry wit. He's outshone by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin - her stance is pure gangster's moll, belying the Middle-England exterior, but she clearly has a soft side, and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank.Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock really did always cast him as 'Everyman', as the Director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophiliac in Vertigo. Day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but neither does she sell it short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for the McKennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.

In this follow-up, Regan is now a bit older and attending college. But she is still haunted by the subtle memories of her possession by the devilish demon, Pasuzu, when she was twelve. Regularly visiting a children's hospital, she somehow gets hooked up onto this synchronizer machine where a doctor can somehow enter her subconscious or something along those lines. But now, Pasuzu has returned, and is tormenting Regan all over again.I haven't seen this film in awhile, but I don't think it was anything too special. The whole synchronizer premise to the film was pretty far fetched, and apparently the crowd used to test screen the film found the movie to be awful after that element was introduced. I don't completely agree, I think that concept isn't very realistic and a bit ridiculous, but in the context of the movie they somehow manage to make it work. The biggest problem with this movie is the absence of Ellen Burstyn, who gave a remarkable performance in the original film as Regan's mother. Linda Blair is back though, and she is a very good actress, so she gave a good performance. Richard Burton who played the priest in this film was also very good as was Louise Fletcher, who plays a guidance counselor. One of the good qualities to this film, however, was the flashback sequences to Father Merrin's time spent in Africa, which had some really distinctive visuals. Although, I think the back story was a little bit bizarre and unneeded, but whatever.Overall, I didn't think Exoricst II The Heretic was a complete waste of time, and I think some people were a little harsh on it. It's not nearly as good as the original movie was, it is below average, but watchable at the least. Far from perfect, but still decent enough.

This is no PILGRIM'S PROGRESS with characters named Christian, Faithfull, Talkative, Envy, and Mr. Worldly Wiseman. The characters represent economic and national types, such as labor (John Hodiak), capital (Henry Hull), the media and feminism (Tallulah Bankhead), Canada and the Empire (Hume Cronym), fuzzy headed American isolationism (William Bendix), the third world watching (Canada Lee), and the threat of German efficiency (Walter Slezak - maybe his best performance).LIFEBOAT is the story of the survivors of the sinking of a steamer by a German u-boat (the ship sinking is done in the opening credits, and we hear the explosion, and see smoke, but the only thing we see sink is the smokestack of the ship as it goes under - a typically brilliant sequence by Hitchcock). The submarine was hit by a shell from the ship's gun (apparently one of those ships that the British merchant marine have as converted war vessels). As the survivors gather one mentions the sub was sunk. And sure enough an additional survivor turns up - a German (Slezak).From the start there are frictions between the survivors. Hodiak, a member of the crew in the engine room, is very turned off by the way Bankhead commandeered the lifeboat for herself - and her luggage. She is a reporter, and instead of showing the gravity of the moment towards the dead, she boasts of how she photographed a dead baby. Hodiak is very happy when Bankhead loses her camera - the first of many things she loses. But as she loses her possessions she slowly picks up on her humanity again. Bankhead's movie career was very mixed, and this film is her zenith as a movie actress.Henry Hull and Bankhead get along better as Hull is Rittenhouse, a prominent capitalist. He actually is a decent sort, but as the film progresses his card games with Hodiak become a running commentary of capital v. labor, to the point where when he thinks he's beaten Hodiak a wind blows their cards away, and Hull angrily accuses Hodiak of cheating him. Hull has a unique symbol. Like Bankhead he grabbed the first box of cigars from his room that he could and raced to the deck and the lifeboats. Ironically the box only had one cigar in it. For the entire film Hull has to just keep that one cigar (constantly in his mouth) to satisfy himself.There is tragedy among the survivors. One of them is a Mrs. Higley (a passenger played by Heather Angel) who had a baby. The baby was lost in the disaster, and she is in a state of shock. The others try to comfort her, but she can't be. Eventually they find her missing - she went off in the night to join her baby.William Bendix is Gus Schmidt (who has anglified his name as Smith, as an act of anger towards the Nazis). Gus has had a good marriage, but he and his wife pride themselves on their dancing. But his wounds (from burning oil) were such that he had to have his leg amputated in the lifeboat. He is in a messed situation because he wonders if his wife will remain with him now that he is crippled.And finally there is Willy. As I said before Walter Slezak probably never had a better part. It was also the only time he worked with Hitchcock. It is easy to demonize Willy - he is a Nazi submariner (and - we eventually learn - it's Captain). He does work quietly to take the lifeboat to a rendezvous point with a Nazi ship. And (SPOILER COMING UP) he is responsible for the death of Gus.That scene though supports what I said earlier. If this was a pure allegory of the war against the Nazis, Slezak's killing of Bendix would be done without any conscience at all. Actually Willy shows a degree of humanity here that the nicer people fail to show. Gus is not doing well, and is physically suffering. He is also emotionally low because he suspects that he is not going to be finding his wife supportive now that he is a cripple. Willy speaks to him at night and Gus does show he's suicidal. Willy is not acting opportunistic about this. He knows that if Gus survives he will be miserable for the rest of his life.He does convince the groggy Gus to go over the side, and so it seems absolutely horrific (especially as Bendix starts screaming for help after he goes over the side and can't float). So we tend to think that Slezak is heartless. But what really would have been poor Gus's future? And if it is just a murder of an enemy in war (hard to really build on that point), Slezak certainly would not have requested that Gus return to his using the original German name that he gave up. There would be no need for that. The fact is that it is a type of euthanasia killing - which the Nazis favored for people who were feeble minded or physically defective. The viewer may be horrified by Bendix last screams, but we would still wonder if his life would have been better if he had survived with the others.

The characters represent economic and national types, such as labor (John Hodiak), capital (Henry Hull), the media and feminism (Tallulah Bankhead), Canada and the Empire (Hume Cronym), fuzzy headed American isolationism (William Bendix), the third world watching (Canada Lee), and the threat of German efficiency (Walter Slezak - maybe his best performance).LIFEBOAT is the story of the survivors of the sinking of a steamer by a German u-boat (the ship sinking is done in the opening credits, and we hear the explosion, and see smoke, but the only thing we see sink is the smokestack of the ship as it goes under - a typically brilliant sequence by Hitchcock). The submarine was hit by a shell from the ship's gun (apparently one of those ships that the British merchant marine have as converted war vessels). As the survivors gather one mentions the sub was sunk. And sure enough an additional survivor turns up - a German (Slezak).From the start there are frictions between the survivors. Hodiak, a member of the crew in the engine room, is very turned off by the way Bankhead commandeered the lifeboat for herself - and her luggage. She is a reporter, and instead of showing the gravity of the moment towards the dead, she boasts of how she photographed a dead baby. Hodiak is very happy when Bankhead loses her camera - the first of many things she loses. But as she loses her possessions she slowly picks up on her humanity again. Bankhead's movie career was very mixed, and this film is her zenith as a movie actress.Henry Hull and Bankhead get along better as Hull is Rittenhouse, a prominent capitalist. He actually is a decent sort, but as the film progresses his card games with Hodiak become a running commentary of capital v. labor, to the point where when he thinks he's beaten Hodiak a wind blows their cards away, and Hull angrily accuses Hodiak of cheating him. Hull has a unique symbol. Like Bankhead he grabbed the first box of cigars from his room that he could and raced to the deck and the lifeboats. Ironically the box only had one cigar in it. For the entire film Hull has to just keep that one cigar (constantly in his mouth) to satisfy himself.There is tragedy among the survivors. One of them is a Mrs. Higley (a passenger played by Heather Angel) who had a baby. The baby was lost in the disaster, and she is in a state of shock. The others try to comfort her, but she can't be. Eventually they find her missing - she went off in the night to join her baby.William Bendix is Gus Schmidt (who has anglified his name as Smith, as an act of anger towards the Nazis). Gus has had a good marriage, but he and his wife pride themselves on their dancing. But his wounds (from burning oil) were such that he had to have his leg amputated in the lifeboat. He is in a messed situation because he wonders if his wife will remain with him now that he is crippled.And finally there is Willy. As I said before Walter Slezak probably never had a better part. It was also the only time he worked with Hitchcock. It is easy to demonize Willy - he is a Nazi submariner (and - we eventually learn - it's Captain). He does work quietly to take the lifeboat to a rendezvous point with a Nazi ship. And (SPOILER COMING UP) he is responsible for the death of Gus.That scene though supports what I said earlier. If this was a pure allegory of the war against the Nazis, Slezak's killing of Bendix would be done without any conscience at all. Actually Willy shows a degree of humanity here that the nicer people fail to show. Gus is not doing well, and is physically suffering. He is also emotionally low because he suspects that he is not going to be finding his wife supportive now that he is a cripple. Willy speaks to him at night and Gus does show he's suicidal. Willy is not acting opportunistic about this. He knows that if Gus survives he will be miserable for the rest of his life.He does convince the groggy Gus to go over the side, and so it seems absolutely horrific (especially as Bendix starts screaming for help after he goes over the side and can't float). So we tend to think that Slezak is heartless. But what really would have been poor Gus's future? And if it is just a murder of an enemy in war (hard to really build on that point), Slezak certainly would not have requested that Gus return to his using the original German name that he gave up. There would be no need for that. The fact is that it is a type of euthanasia killing - which the Nazis favored for people who were feeble minded or physically defective. The viewer may be horrified by Bendix last screams, but we would still wonder if his life would have been better if he had survived with the others.

Allen excels in sequences of chatty couples interacting, with the dynamics of two sparking something unintended; he also loves delving into the romantic complications between teacher and student, usually with infidelity a key ingredient, and all of those aspects work their way into this story, which has a moral, grounded center despite the cheating adults (even a younger teen gets a guilty moment, having sex in a forbidden place, but of course she feels cheap afterward!). Allen loves a contradiction as well as any writer, but his main character (played stunningly by Gena Rowlands, who also narrates) is living in the subconscious, and is forced into continually being enlightened. This is handled quite well (with dreamy interludes and flashbacks to childhood), but this narrative actually should be more compelling; instead, it's gossamer drama, with Bergman or Chekov overtures. A last-act fling between Rowlands' husband and a friend is disappointing, with Woody falling back on the clich茅 (couldn't Rowlands leave her sexless marriage on the basis of boredom alone?). As a director, Woody is very careful and strict with his actors, and Gene Hackman as a novelist surprises the most (his harsh attempt at seducing Rowlands is straightforward and yet almost neurotic--and you can see the anguish and passion on his face); Martha Plimpton continues to be far too eager, but Rowlands, Ian Holm, Betty Buckley, Frances Conroy, and Sandy Dennis have some incredible moments. As the other woman, whose life parallels Gena's, Mia Farrow has very little on-screen time but her plaintive voice and sensitive face are just right for this brief role. A fine drama about choices and regrets; I'm not sure just how deeply a man like Woody Allen can empathize with a lady in her 50s trying to stay afloat in a loveless life, but there are several scenes here that really dig below the placid surface. *** from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2006","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Sedate and as fleeting as a paperback novel (despite its penchant for high-toned literacy), Woody Allen's Another Woman is a seemingly deeply-felt sonata about a 50-ish female writer in New York City who comes to the realization her current state of upscale well-being is a sham.

The film has questionable scenes and dialog however, a very mentionable theme that leaves the viewer with many personal questions, ideas and thoughts of racial inequality and prejudice. The movie leaves the viewer with an astounding ending and truly touches each viewer so as to keep them thinking; thinking of racial conflicts in the movie and in their own lives. The movie is directed wonderfully so as not to confuse the viewer when the main character's little brother, Danny, recollects past events in his family's life. The scenes that are of the past are depicted in black and white, unlike the colored scenes of the present. The acting performed by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong is exceptional; very dramatic and emotional. The movie contains the wonderful element of irony more than once. The overall theme stays with the viewer and is just inspiring; inspiring to do for all races because we are all people. The movie's music, dialog and eventful scenes all contribute to the mood of the movie very well. You, as the viewer, can truly feel the hatred the actors feel towards other races; you might even feel disgust on the basis of their thoughts and preemptive actions. The movie questions your own thoughts and actions towards others. The film is about how we, as individuals, choose to live. I recommend this film to young teens and adults all around. It is a very dramatic and inspiring film full of amazing tone, mood and irony. The movie will touch all in some way and stick with you while you keep thinking of racial issues discussed in the movie.
