If you want a movie you can enjoy over and over, I would reluctant to recommend it.THE GOOD - This is wonderfully acted by the two leads, Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman, who play a married couple Bob and Gail Jones. Keaton is dying of cancer and videotapes his last months on earth with his wife so that their new baby will have something to remember him by. The supporting actors who played Keaton's parents and brother also were excellent. For such a somber theme, the film moves remarkably fast for the two hours. There were good messages of forgiveness and compassion. There were some touching scenes, as you can imagine. The theme song is here is worth noting, too. It is beautiful, reminiscent of the magnificent title tune to Out Of Africa. The language is pretty tame in here, too, except when Kidman is giving birth.THE BAD - You would think that a younger man dying of cancer would be praying to God for a miracle, or asking God's help in dealing with the situation, or consulting a minister, priest or rabbi, but Hollywood is never going to go that route. Instead, Keaton goes to a New Age-type Chinese healer. Eastern religions are politically correct in America but not Christianity or Judiasm, of which this country was founded. Also, in a nice film like this, it would have been more apt with the f-bomb Kidman throws in.OVERALL - The good far outweighs the bad and the movie is good one. Recommended.

I didn't care for some of the anti-Christian tones in here, however. That is my only complaint of the movie. A key character - a minister - is made to look evil (typical film-world bias).The rest of the film has a lot to offer a great performance by Jack Nicholson; a very nice music score; good cinematography; interesting characters and a different, almost-shocking twist at the end.The best part of the film is Nicholson. As usual, Jack is very interesting, playing a low-key role here. The story might be too slow for a lot of folks but it kept my interest all the way.

Even Spielberg's heartwarming kiddie movies. They're often enjoyable viewing and they're suitable for children of all ages. Early conflicts between two people of honor are resolved. There's often a patriotic theme. Very few cuss words. The musical score tells us emphatically that this is a moving experience. Maybe not the Second Coming exactly but a dangerous trip to the moon or a damned good baseball game. And don't worry. Our side wins.This one is about a failed trip to the moon. The failed part of it is gotten past pretty quickly and the emphasis shifts immediately to a different challenge -- can we get the crippled craft and its stressed-out crew back to the earth in one piece? The answer of course is yes, so it turns the movie into a story of triumph instead of tragedy.I don't mean to apply too energetic a hammer to the real events or the real characters. It's pretty spooky stuff, being up there, looking at the earth when it's no bigger than a street lamp. The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land? There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking ambient temperature values and minimalizing coefficients. And Feynman asks politely, You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks? And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, Failure is not an option?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story.

The rest of us who tremble when we have to climb a ladder higher than the first-floor windows can only marvel.And the story itself, no matter well or poorly told, has enough suspense and awe intrinsic to it that we can't help being drawn into it.What's bothersome is the slick commercialism that seems to provide the craft and its story with its real source of power. You know ahead of time that we'll spend time with the anguished wife at home, that we'll see one endangered astronaut sharing pictures of his lovely family with the others. The reporters will becoming a nagging, intrusive nuisance. The wife will be given a line like, If this moon landing wasn't good enough for the press, why has it become news now that it won't land? There are a multitude of technical problem that arise when the side of the craft pops and deconstructs, and they're rushed through as if the audience doesn't really care about the challenges or how they're met. Or -- maybe not that the viewers don't care. Maybe they're too dumb to understand. The technical glitches and maneuvers seem to present challenges to the film makers as well -- how quickly can we get rid of the uninteresting metallic junk and get back to the suffering of the crew, the ground support, and the families? It succeeds extremely well in doing what it intends to do, but what it intends to do makes few demands on the maturity of viewers. It's like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle and after you put it all together you have a picture of three dogs in vests playing cards.You know what could be gripping? The real story of the Challenger disaster of 1986. With an emphasis on the groupspeak of Raytheon, Mission Control, and NASA. Maybe the hero could be Richard Feynman. You should have seen him cut through the blizzard of technocrap thrown up by the engineers and bureaucrats playing CYA at the hearings. Here they are, explaining what happened by evoking ambient temperature values and minimalizing coefficients. And Feynman asks politely, You mean when it gets cold the rubber shrinks? And he demonstrates by dunking a piece of rubber in a glass of ice water. Doesn't that have more cinematic potential than this movie's Ed Harris shouting, Failure is not an option?However, the kids should enjoy this, and it's worth watching for everyone, if only because it is based on a true story. Its heartwarming qualities aside, everyone involved in an enterprise like this -- successful or not -- should be applauded. And whatever they're being paid, it's not enough.

The company had a distribution deal but the company they were working with went bankrupt and distribution had to be found elsewhere. The timing was perhaps not the best - Garfield would be dead in four years and the director\/writer Abraham Polansky blacklisted. The company eventually died with only a few films made.Force of Evil is the story of two brothers, Joe and Leo - Joe is a shady lawyer and Leo is a shady businessman who runs a numbers bank. He wants nothing to do with Joe, whom he sees as the real crook of the family. He resents Joe for his success. Joe and his cronies are planning to rig the lottery so that when the number everyone has bet on hits, it bankrupts the smaller operations, thus making them ripe to be gathered up under one large concern. Joe doesn't want Leo to lose all his money, so he tries to warn him.This is a beautifully written film that is well acted and full of a tough, grimy New York atmosphere. Wonderful shots of Wall Street and a beautiful ending at the George Washington Bridge. Both Garfield and Thomas Gomez as the brothers give riveting performances. Gomez is sloppy and full of anger; he may be in a shady business, but he pays off on his customers' bets, and he gets by. Garfield is dapper, handsome, and mystified as to why his help isn't appreciated. He's both book and street smart, but he channeled his talents in the wrong direction looking for the kind of success the law-abiding world could never give him.Marie Windsor is on hand as the cool boss' wife who thinks that Joe could warm her up. Joe doesn't want her. Their scenes are electric.This is truly a no-miss and a film ahead of its time, the kind of thing that Scorcese would have made later on. It's a pity that Polansky's talent and Garfield's would be gone so quickly, one artistic death by blacklist and the other from a weak heart that couldn't withstand a real-life force of evil.

Danny Glover's and Matt Dillon's eyes tell it all. I think one reason we have so many humanitarian actors is because they have to play the roles of the downtrodden and in doing so, become empathetic with them.

Christopher Plummer's eccentric and slightly insane Van Helsing is pure class, proving he can be as unhinged as you like, and still look good in a three-piece suit. The only one I think lets the movie down is Justine Waddell as Mary Heller. Tough as it may be to constantly be in terror, she doesn't do such a grand job. She's cold, prissy and damned annoying. Now, if you knew Dracula was after your immortal soul, you'd put up a bit more of a fight really, wouldn't you? The soundtracks are also top-notch, and it brings the Dracula story bang up to date. You have to laugh, as Dracula stands transfixed under a huge video-wall blaring out a choice heavy rock tune along to images of gyrating strippers, nuclear explosions and body piercing. Brilliant! he says.

This film should make Marvel proud that people still want to turn their comic books into movies. It's dark, atmospheric, fast-paced, well scripted and visually brilliant. Blade is based on and adapted from the popular comic books by Marvel. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid spends his nights hunting down and killing off vampires. Using an array of big guns, big swords and sometimes just plain cool martial arts moves, he dispatches said creatures of the night in huge style, creating CGI orgies of vampire-death-by-disintegration and beating senseless anyone else that gets in his way (look out for Officer Krieger). Helped along by Whistler, his faithful yet badass human partner, Blade's quest is to rid the world of these pesky bloodsuckers altogether. However, a certain power-hungry vampire has other ideas, and he sets about clawing his way to the top of the food chain&#133;This is one of the few movies that are actually better than their accompanying trailer. Rare, I know, but it's true. Everything about this film is astounding. The casting for one, is fantastic. Wesley Snipes was director Stephen Norrington's first and only choice for Blade, and he does a fantastic job. Really the only film I truly like him in. Seeing him as any other character, he just looks strange without his black leather coat, sword, impossibly cool shades and tribal tattoos. This role was made for him. Stephen Dorff is brilliant as Deacon Frost, the maniacal and murderous un-pureblood vampire who wants to take over the world. (Ah, the old take-over-the-world ploy. Never fails.) He even manages to scare Udo Kier's master vampire Dragonetti into submission. Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is great &#150; a decrepit and world-weary creature, almost like a father figure who keeps Blade in good supply of guns, swords and easily wieldable Ultra-Violet light sources. As Blade details their relationship quite astutely he makes the weapons. I use them. Just happens to help that Whistler wants to wipe out the vampires as much as Blade does. N'Bushe Wright is fantastic as Blade's hematologist sidekick, Karen Jensen. She's attacked by Frost's second-in-command, Quinn, (brilliantly played by Donal Logue) and subsequently rescued by Blade. Most female action sidekicks tend to grate on the nerves after about five minutes of screen time, but Wright has a good mixture of sass, brains and she looks good carrying a shotgun. I don't understand why she didn't pop up in the sequels though. Traci Lords is aptly sexy and sinister as Frost's vampire minion Mercury (because of course, you have to have at least one slinky female vampire).The look of this movie is amazing too &#150; everything is dark, moody and ominous. Even the few daytime scenes are overcast and gloomy. The dialogue, cinematography and acting are all first-rate, but the action scenes are probably why this movie is so popular. They're brilliantly choreographed, snappy and just brutal enough to make you giggle. Thankfully, they're also filmed in such a way that allows you to actually see what's going on. Most fight scenes these days are filmed way too close to the actors, and everything just becomes a blurry mess. I want to see that fist connect with that guy's chin, damn it. The soundtrack to this film is outstanding too - a hardcore techno slice of musical menace that fits the film brilliantly. Listening to the soundtrack is almost as good as watching the film. But nothing beats the club scene at the beginning with blood spraying from a demonic version of a sprinkler system, and New Order's 'Confusion' thumping away at your eardrums. Sensory assault.Even though this film is nearly ten years old, it hasn't dated. The dialogue is still wry as hell, -There are worse things out tonight than vampires -Like what? -Like Me the gore is still gory and the characters are still impossibly cool.

Since sex sells, we'll have wet lips and vamping and wild joining of invisible parts. But we won't have life the way it really is, with all sorts of skin, intimacies and gentle touches. And smells.Into this space you'll find various intrusions. I really thought 9 Songs was immensely clever, justifiably cinematic. I also find from time to time clever ideas in ordinary porn. Private Teacher by an Orson Welles associate had some neat ideas sneaked in, as did La Foire aux sexes which was every bit a good new wave film.And then you'll have something like this, which perhaps by itself set back the whole notion of intimacy in film three decades.Its big, its loud, its stupid. Fortunately, this was before that insane silicone and shaved craze hit the girlie watcher's world. But its of the same ilk in a way. Just think Peter O'Toole, Hellen Mirren, John Geilgud for chrissakes! Not bad set design, in that Italian monstrosity tradition of Zefferelli. A script by Gore Vidal &#151; who knows nothing about how to flesh out a film (ouch, sorry), but whose larger arcs are solid. And Tinto Brass is not a bad filmmaker in the small, meaning he knows how to make a good image if not craft things as a project.It could have worked, because by the late seventies, audiences had plenty of examples of performances that referenced and encapsulated other performances, so we could have what this could have been a (film) performance of a (porn) performance of a (historical, voyeuristic-in-its-time) performance. And the projection of genital reality across those layers could have been intelligent as well as whatever else you may want.For decades after Kinsey botched things with flawed science, Playboy was the vanguard of the sexual revolution. I'm not making this up; there really was a Playboy philosophy which boiled down to sex is natural and pleasant and if it doesn't hurt anyone, why not? With hippies as a sort of mascot, this seemed intelligent, especially since the girlie pictures were surrounded with some of the best writing in print. Those centerfolds mattered.Then along came a sort of second generation magazine which exploited the fact that Palyboy's girls had no body hair or genitals and were too linked to a set of obsolete fantasies. Penthouse girls had hair and fluids and were aggressive. Fewer coy blonds; more adventure. It was an equally vapid set of fantasies which as these things go went obsolete as quickly. But in the period of 76-80, that magazine was in the forefront of vaginal honesty in life. A forefront, such as society would allow.And there was the Playboy tradition of wrapping things in intellectual goo. Which meant that this film could have been something that mattered, that changed things. It could have cast itself in the same useless space as the Romans it portrayed. But it made a strange bargain the story has these acts as perverted, distorted life. Where ordinary films went way out of their way to not show certain things in sex, this went as far the other way to show them. Its a strange world where sexual positions and acts are arranged precisely so that you CAN see.So I think like all great turning points in film, this film is important. Its not good, its ghastly. But its important because its mistakes hurt us in places that matter and missed an opportunity to make film better, richer.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Kiefer Sutherland sports a height-of-eighties-fashion bleach-blonde mullet and he still looks cool. It's a fabulous mix of vampire\/teen\/comedy\/horror and nearly 20 years after it's release, it still remains a favourite amongst many movie fans, and this has to be one of the most popular vampire movies of all time. Every child of the eighties knows and loves it, and the plot rings true with anyone who's been roped into doing something slightly dodgy by some git who's cooler than you are.The story centres on Michael Emerson. He, his mother and brother have recently moved to Santa Carla after his mother's divorce. With nothing to do until school starts, he spends his evenings mooching around the beachfront's boardwalk and eventually falls in with a motorcycle gang. Who just so happen to be vampires. Nothing unusual there, then. Egged on by the gang, Michael unwittingly drinks blood, which gradually transforms him into a vampire. Michael's brother enlists help from a pair of vampire hunting brothers to save Michael (and the rest of the town). The cast are superb &#150; they're all pretty 80s youngsters, obviously employed because of their market value at the time, but decent actors nonetheless. Jason Patric is perfect as Michael, the gorgeous but gullible new kid in town, who falls for the beautiful Star and unknowingly, descends into vampirism to get closer to her. Kiefer Sutherland does a great turn as the ultra-cool, menacing (but seductively persuasive) leader-of-the-pack-vampire, David. The vampire gang are impossibly cool, the epitome of 80s fashion and teen attitude. Not to mention having cast Alex Winter as Marco - Bill S. Preston Esquire with fangs! Jami Gertz's Star is fittingly mysterious and evasive, but for me, the real stars of the show are the Frog brothers - teenage vampire hunters\/comic bookstore owners, fighting the good fight for Justice, Truth, and The American Way. Michael's brother Sam enlists their help to put a stop to vampirism taking over his family (and, eventually, the town). With lines like Kill your brother. You'll feel better they're the best bit of comic relief in this movie. Corey Haim manages a good performance as Sam, Michael's younger brother and Diane Wiest is fab as their unsuspecting mother.The entire film really looks good too. It's comically gory, lots of body parts exploding, stakings and burnings. And it contains some of the more 'realistic' vampire-esquire makeup effects &#150; the vampires look like they really would like to tear your face off. Although the movie is nearly 20 years old, apart from certain elements of hairstyles and clothing, (like David's choice mullet and Star's exploding-poodle-style perm) it doesn't look that dated at all, and has a cracking 80s power ballad soundtrack. Set in Santa Carla's beachfront (so named to avoid associations between Santa Cruz and the film's gang-related themes.) it's full of carnival music, twinkling lights and sparkling nighttime beaches, which give it a slightly surreal atmosphere. Think what it'd be like living in Blackpool permanently. I think I'd turn to vampirism just for something to do. Of course there's always the token struggle between good and evil, from Michael's Mother nearly sucumbing to the charms of the head vampire, and Michael almost being shoved across the line into fully fledged vampirism, but it's all still very entertaining. Slightly darker than a teen movie, but just as fun, this will remain a firmly beloved classic for at least another 20 years.

The fact that it was released a few weeks after The Lost Boys probably didn't help. That movie had well-known stars, and a well-known director, and as much as I love it, Near Dark has a better cast, a darker story and much more gore.The story concerns Caleb; a young cowboy who becomes besotted with a young girl he meets called Mae. Mae is mysterious and evasive, panicking over the approach of dawn and nibbling Caleb's neck. Just a bit too hard for comfort. Convinced she just got carried away with herself, Caleb lets her go and begins his own journey home. Doubled over in pain, things get worse as the sun rises. He starts to burn. Just before he completely goes up in flames, and close enough to home to be within sight of his sister and father, Mae and her family 'rescue' him by bundling him into their caravan. Unfortunately for Caleb, Mae and her 'family' are roaming vampires who aren't too thrilled at the prospect of an unannounced addition to the group.For a vampire film, the V-word is never once mentioned, and the vampires themselves don't display the usual appearance traits i.e., fangs, glowing eyes, pale skin. And although they are certainly brutal and sadistic (check out the bar scene) they're constantly on the run - both from sunlight and the law.The main Alien cast come together again for yet another dark tale of death and survival. Still badass, still murderous, they all do great jobs of their characters. Lance Henrikssen is as menacing as they come as 'daddy-vampire' Jesse. Apparently he lost a lot of weight for this role, as he wanted to 'look' like he thought his character should &#150; a skinny moth-eaten savage who's spent more time on this earth than he cares to remember. Genius. Jenette Goldstein is quietly sinister as Diamondback, certainly the maternal force of the group. But when I say maternal I mean maternal in the sense that she'd rip your throat out if you talked back to her. Jenny Wright is sweet as Mae &#150; a blonde, waifish southern belle, obviously the daughter of the group. Adrian Pasdar is great as the very besotted but slightly confused Caleb (could they have gotten anybody cuter than him to play this role? I think not&#133;) but Bill Paxton is a sure-fire favourite as Severen. He unabashedly steals the show, nabs all the best lines and all the best killings and plays his character with devilish glee. The only character I feel that lets the side down is Homer, played by Joshua Miller. A little too much like the role of Laddie in The Lost Boys, (a small boy dropped into the middle of a gang of blood-thirsty vampires) Homer is a grumpy old man in the shape of a boy. And although some of his scenes are a bit dark &#150; smoking cigarettes, gambling and shooting people &#150; I couldn't help but feel pleased when he finally went up in flames. Though not as polished and glossy looking as it's famous counterpart, Near Dark is surely the better movie. More of a western than anything else, stark desert landscapes and sprawling black skies give us a sense of drifting isolation. In the 20th century where every unnatural death is investigated thoroughly, a vampire can have a hard time feeding. Even though these guys aren't the nicest characters you'll ever come across, you have to feel sorry for their nomadic lifestyle, having to skip from town to town to evade the long arm of the law. Especially since Caleb's father is desperately trying to find his son. The gore in the movie is brilliant, but is localised to mostly one blood-soaked bar scene. Although vaguely tame by today's gorenography standards, there are a few sufficiently messy killings (including the most imaginative way of using spurs) and a few nicely written lines I just want a few more minutes of your time. Which is about as long as the rest of your lives. A lot of critics (and IMDb members) wrote that the ending to the movie was 'disappointing', and while this is not the way I'd put it, it certainly seems a bit rushed. Compared with the rest of the film's careful dialogue and exploration of its characters, yes it is a bit overlooked. And yes it is a bit sickly sweet and light for such a dark and bloody film.

I thought the play was great, definitely one of the best I've read (although I haven't read too many), and was wondering what the film would be like. And I was blown away. The film centers around John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen), who find themselves immersed in the hysteria the grips the colonial town of Salem, Massachussets, when rumors of witchcraft and Devil worshipping break out. This hysteria is set off after a group of girls are found dancing naked in the woods at night, and drinking the blood from a sacrificed animal, obviously dabbling in some sort of black magic. Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) is a cruel, deceitful young woman who is the main accuser in the witch hunt, although she herself was actually part of the ritual herself, and begins pointing out innocent person by innocent person, soon accusing Elizabeth and John as a revenge tactic for her failed affair with the man.Having read the play, I can easily say that this movie was very loyal to Miller's original work, which is a fictional account of the infamous Salem witch trials. Only a few minor changes were made here and there, but for the most part it was the same as the play. Aside from the wonderful story (that Miller wrote to reflect on the Communist blacklisting event in the 1950's), the acting is the real strong point. Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are both exceptional - they have great chemistry, and are both great actors. Winona Ryder plays the manipulative Abigail wonderfully, I can't really say anything bad about any of the acting. Aside from that, the sets and costumes display the time period (late 1600s America) beautifully, and the last scene of the film was just flat out depressing, as was the final conversation between John and Elizabeth. It really shows just how harsh and unreasonable the Puritan society was.Overall, The Crucible is an excellent adaptation of a play brought to the big screen. The acting, story, settings, costumes, and everything else made this such a powerful film. Honestly, I'm not sure they really could have done it better, Miller's play was definitely done justice.

Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are both exceptional - they have great chemistry, and are both great actors. Winona Ryder plays the manipulative Abigail wonderfully, I can't really say anything bad about any of the acting. Aside from that, the sets and costumes display the time period (late 1600s America) beautifully, and the last scene of the film was just flat out depressing, as was the final conversation between John and Elizabeth. It really shows just how harsh and unreasonable the Puritan society was.Overall, The Crucible is an excellent adaptation of a play brought to the big screen. The acting, story, settings, costumes, and everything else made this such a powerful film. Honestly, I'm not sure they really could have done it better, Miller's play was definitely done justice. Elizabeth, your justice would freeze beer. 8\/10. ","genre":"Drama, History"}]
