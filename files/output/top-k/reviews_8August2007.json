[{"date":"8 August 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" 1999 was another year marking the end of a decade in film, a year which has provided some of the finest films ever to grace celluloid. Election was released to a small box-office intake, but a hugely positive critical response, which has since made it a cult film. It launched the careers of actors, such as, Chris Klein, who after his debut performance in Election went onto to star in the teen-garbage of the American Pie series. Yet, dead in the water actors like Matthew Broderick found that the film re-launched his career, notably due to the polar-opposite casting choice when you look back at his Ferris Bueller days. Then you have actress Reese Witherspoon who provides an unmatched performance (in fact one of the best I have ever viewed) in Election, which warranted all the critical acclaim it could muster and was the perfect display of acting needed to launch her continuously expanding career.Election has what the vast majority of high-school films do not, which is a profound aptitude of control and dissection of politics. Adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, Election creates a contrast of high-school politics against western country politics. Reese Witherspoon embodies the personality of Tracy Flick, an ego-driven, overly ambitious and obnoxious go-getter who &#150;as with everything educationally related- decides to run for the school president elections (certain that she will win). Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a teacher who has grown to resent Tracy for obvious reasons, as well as deeply-seated personal grounds. Tracy is the only student running for president and because Jim does not want to see Tracy succeed yet again he decides to bring a little competition into the game by persuading Chris Klein's character Paul Metzler to run for presidency too. Paul is one of the most popular guys in the school, meaning that Tracy feels a sting of competition due to his popularity advantage. From then-on-in the story starts to convey the personal trials and tribulations of each character as they desperately attempt to succeed in some form or another.Alexander Payne crafts not a comedy, but a satire on corruption and the clash of morals and ethics. Built on a screenplay of sarcastic, cynical hatred for a flawed system, Election puts school into an entirely unique, yet distinguishable perspective. On first viewing of Election (I have always been very fond of it) I felt the narrative was slightly unfocused and heavy-handed at times, but on a subsequent viewing I decided that, in fact, it is not. The editing is the primary key to the film, automatically engrossing the viewer to become engaged with a narrative which is recited through four diverse character perceptions. The body language of the characters is another fundamental element of the picture, being that it echoes a considerable amount of information on the traits and general persona of each person.Technically, the school is an allegory for the parable of school life being so prominently like that of the real world, but just not quite as unforgiving as that of the outside world. Many subtleties are littered throughout the film, for example, I noticed that seeing fruit within a scene would mark the perception of an unfortunate incident soon to occur (as well as the joke of Paul Metzler contradicting his choice of favourite fruit when he picks a banana from a fruit bowl). The non-linear tone of Election is what gives the film its instantly recognisable trademark style. It is the detailing of the subtleties and subtexts of school life which makes the viewer become engaged, since you want to digest everything the film is stating on the battle of justifying one's morals, while retaining society's ethics.Election says so much about school life, it enabled me to realise just how much a teacher knows about their pupil, and ultimately that they can read a pupil like a book, which is fairly intimidating. I cannot begin to express how much I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the peculiarities of high-school personalities and the consideration of thought-provoking comedy Alexander Payne has poured into this modern masterwork. Do believe the hype.
