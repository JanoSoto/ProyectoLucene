When I saw Elizabeth in 1998, I came to see some riveting performances, beautiful costumes gorgeous settings and stunning direction. I never let historical inaccuracies get in the way, because from my experience I know perfectly well that entertainment and historical facts don't collide very well in the Hollywood vacuum.Cate Blanchett was spectacular as the titular character. She just seemed natural for the role, both physically and mentally in character. However, I found the portrayal to be at times a bit uptight at times when it would have been more stimulating if she was more stone-cold. But I guess the Hollywood community wanted to emphasis on the uptight psyche that shines upon Elizabeth's inner struggles. I guess it's more complex to play a laid-back stone-faced queen while being manifested with inner anxiety.I was turned off the scene where Elizabeth was engaged in coitus with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) while her ladies catch them in the act. I might assume this is a hook by Hollywood to include a romantic entanglement in this Tudor film. However, I found the scene to be grotesque because for the sake of decency, they should have made their sexual entanglement to be a little more private.The scene where Elizabeth comes together as a monarch and uses low-key manipulative tactics towards her Parliament was executed to absolute perfection. Blanchett adds just the right touch of diffidence and nobleness along with subliminal humour to make this scene all the more effective. Elizabeth's shrugging over marriage is quite vocal and very determined fearing that if she should tie the knot, she will lose her powers as the top of the monarchy. The various scenes where our pale-faced majesty starts losing her grip on reality towards her power by consorting towards unremorseful and emotionally distant are brilliantly exhibited.My main desire was to have Elizabeth deliver a more devilish charm while at the same time keeping if more subtle. On a historical basis, she did treat her suitors like puppets as she solely structured her country's defenses in order to gain her independence, but the low-key elements were not properly exhibited here. On a regular basis, she barks out that she will never wed and there was very little in terms of the Spanish suitor who's infamous Armada did not fare very well against Elizabeth's powerful Navy. I was disappointed this chain of events never materialized in the script.Sure I may have done a rant a bit here, but overall the movie was not entirely terrible. It was entertainingly satisfying with plenty of historical references to please people who are aficionados of the Tudor Era period pieces.

Again, Lucas seemed to misstep with a lot of them. I laugh at this movie often, but you know, it's a much better movie than people remember. It has a tinge of darkness to it much like Empire Strikes Back does. There are many things in this film that I feel have to be addressed. So here we go.Ten years or so after the events of Phantom Menace, Queen Padme is now Senator Padme, who immediately starts the movie off with her nearly being assassinated. Talk about starting off with a bang! She suspects former Jedi master Count Dooku (played by the excellent Christopher Lee) of the deed, but the council is skeptical. Now grown up Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padme while his master Obi Wan is dispatched to solve the mystery of the assassin bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Fett has be used as the host for a secret Republic Clone Army (the ancestors of the Stormtroopers) While hiding Padme on Naboo, both begin to feel an attraction for one another, even though its forbidden for Anakin to love another as a Jedi. The story actually has a lot going on here. Lucas introduces threads that will be long lasting throughout the present Saga of films. We see where the Stormtroopers come from, we learn what the Clone Wars are, we see Luke and Leia's mother, there is just a lot here. But instead of focusing on that, Lucas puts his energy into two main stories. Story A, it seems, is the love story between Anakin and Padme. Story B is Obi Wan figuring out what goes on when Jedi don't look at invisible planets. Both stories are actually very well developed and take time for them to unfold. The love story works well considering the dialog. We all knew this was coming. The dialog during the love scenes isn't as good as the way it develops. Some lines are truly hokey or wooden in delivery. I feel this mostly comes from Hayden Christensen. In this movie he doesn't seem to be acting as he is sleepwalking through the movie, never really changing his tone unless he is screaming. Portman does her best to at least to seem interested, but if her co-star is sleepwalking, then she can't do much. Some of the lines are actually good, so we can't say every word is awful. The characterizations in this film are where I have a couple of issues. Obi Wan seems mean and condescending to Anakin in this film, but compared to the first film, his humor is far more funny and his timing is superb. Padme is a very sweet person and dedicated to her job and morals, and she does actually see some good things in Anakin that she loves, but she doesn't become sappy. Yoda and Mace Windu (played by veterans Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson in all their grandeur) are spectacular, nothing more to talk about. Count Dooku is a great villain, but it seems like the role was meant for Darth maul had he survived in the first film, but it's Christopher Lee playing him, so hes really good. But the one that I don't like is Anakin. In this film, he is played like a whiny teenager who wants to be master even though he is clearly not ready. One could make the argument that at this age, teenagers are like this, and perhaps that is what George Lucas was going for. But to me, it makes him slightly unlikeable. For some reason or another, the action scene is this movie seem like a been there, done that feeling. Except for one scene, they all feel a little done and way too necessary. The other films scenes were as well, but there was some kind of spark that made seem more spectacular and special then they really are. The exception(s) is the lightsaber battles. Wow! These are really good in pacing and the beauty of their choreography, but what makes it special is that we see YODA FIGHT! That alone should make this movie really memorable!The element of this movie that I think will forever stand the test of time in cinema is the score written by John Williams. Here we have one of the most beautiful themes ever in the history of recorded sound, the love theme known as Across the Stars. It's such a truly beautiful work of art that completely blends with George Lucas' vision of this world he has created. It's also Williams' best love theme since Superman, which itself is a truly beautiful composition. The action is music is also great, punctuating each movement and tick and making the action seem much more important then how they play out in the logic of the story.Final Verdict Its better than I remember, but it is still kind of hokey and funny. It has a well developed story, four interesting characters, and some fantastic music. But the rest is tired, slow, and really bad dialog. So it's better than Phantom Menace, but nowhere close to the next one.

The plan has a hitch though as Monescu recognises one of Colet's suitors, François Filiba (Edward Everett Horton), eventually with the help of another suitor, The Major (Charles Ruggles), that Filiba mistook him for a doctor, and he then remembers the thief robbing him while pretending to be a doctor, so Monescu and Lily plan to get the cash from the safe to make a getaway. The Mayor is holding a dinner party, but Colet cannot decide whether to attend or have sex with Monsecu, and Lily has caught on that he has fallen for her rival, so after confronting him she steals all the safe money herself, and Colet meanwhile refuses to believe from Filiba his story of her love being a fraud and thief. She does suggestively probe Monescu like she knows something, and he does confess he is a fraud and that the safe has been emptied, but he claims he did it alone, and he also suggests the manager of her business Adolph J.

You can see Fleming's hand in much of it, the use of the Lektor machine based on the WW2 Enigma decoder which was still not common knowledge to the public when the book was published but was to Ian Fleming through his wartime intelligence experiences. The spy techniques we see here are authentic, the KGB having men whose sole job is to watch the airport for interesting strangers, using the Bulgarians for their dirty work, Bond's recognition code, tunneling under the enemies embassy and staging a false emergency in order to raid their cypher room, the false flag operation of recruiting an agent who thinks they're working for one side when in fact they're working for someone else entirely. We're not too reliant on gadgets yet either, Bond has some cool gear that saves his life in a pinch but for the most part he gets by on his wits and his innate toughness, his vicious no holds barred fight to the death with the brutal Red Grant in the confines of the railway carriage perhaps the most adult action scene in all of Bond. He's very fallible here, falling for Spectre's scheme hook, line and sinker, only his ingenuity exploiting Grant's greed saving the day.His Turkish contact is one of the most memorable of all the Bond assistants, a man you could really buy as someone British intelligence would hire to be their man in Istanbul, his death affecting Bond who nevertheless keeps his professional detachment when telling his son of his death (made all the more poignant when you consider the actor playing him knew he was dying of cancer at the time). A few bad points, I find the heroine a bit insipid, good looking but a little too bland. BUT I guess she was selected by Spectre because she was like that, you could believe she would fall for Bond and betray her country for him. Rosa Kleb, the inspiration for the great Frau Farbisinau in Austin powers is the stereotypical evil lesbian of the early 1960s, you can see some of the nastier aspects of Fleming's attitudes to women seeping through, not least Bond's playful slapping of the heroine's backside and much less playful rough treatment of her when things get tense (he's quite ruthless with his girlfriend at the opening riverside scene too). But these are small points and all told it truly is an excellent film all around.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"27 January 2014","score":"","review":" Very much the atypical Bond film, more of a conventional Cold War thriller than the high-blown spectacle we would later come to know and love. You can see Fleming's hand in much of it, the use of the Lektor machine based on the WW2 Enigma decoder which was still not common knowledge to the public when the book was published but was to Ian Fleming through his wartime intelligence experiences. The spy techniques we see here are authentic, the KGB having men whose sole job is to watch the airport for interesting strangers, using the Bulgarians for their dirty work, Bond's recognition code, tunneling under the enemies embassy and staging a false emergency in order to raid their cypher room, the false flag operation of recruiting an agent who thinks they're working for one side when in fact they're working for someone else entirely. We're not too reliant on gadgets yet either, Bond has some cool gear that saves his life in a pinch but for the most part he gets by on his wits and his innate toughness, his vicious no holds barred fight to the death with the brutal Red Grant in the confines of the railway carriage perhaps the most adult action scene in all of Bond.

Death On The Nile has eccentric characters, humorous dialogue, extravagant costumes, fantastic scenery, and a star-studded cast that includes some of the most talented actors Hollywood has ever produced.Naturally there's a murder on the boat, which is a closed space, implying that the murderer has to be someone on-board. Peter Ustinov makes the perfect Hercule Poirot, the Belgium sleuth who always manages to be at the right place at the right time, to put all the puzzle pieces together, and solve the case neat and tidy. He tells one suspect I, Hercule Poirot, have eyes which notice everything; and I would add ... a brain that remembers everything.Probably the funniest suspect is the usually inebriated Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury), romantic novelist unobservant, galling, and a hoot when she dances the tango with an embarrassed Colonial Race (David Niven). But throughout, Mrs. Otterbourne can't quite remember Poirot's name, and thus refers to him as the famous French sleuth, Monsieur Porridge. Wonderful.The script contains witty put-downs, as in one scene wherein Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis), always disgusted with her sickly-looking maid Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), introduces her maid to another character My companion Bowers; she once did 15 rounds with Jack Dempsey; he was never the same man again.The plot is complex and intricate, and requires Poirot 23 minutes at the end to explain. It's totally contrived and not at all realistic, but who cares ... it's the puzzle that counts. The genius of Agatha Christie is that she wrote animated algebra. Each story is a puzzle that contains a basic, underlying logical equation that lies hidden beneath an ocean of irrelevancies. And it's up to the reader, or in this case the viewer, to solve the equation.For sheer entertainment, Death On The Nile is hard to beat. It's one of my all-time favorite films. Production values are top-notch. The cast and acting are almost perfect. One would be hard-pressed to find more spectacular scenery. And that ponderous score by Nino Rota marvelously adds to the Egyptian visuals.

The movie has as many facets as Mr. Ripley has talents, and it takes the viewer through an interesting and worthwhile experience. The movie is set in the late 1950s and begins just as Tom Ripley--if that is his real name--begins his grand act of deception. The movie is based on a series of novels written by Patricia Highsmith that are centered on Mr. Ripley. Tom Ripley, who is played by Matt Damon, deceives a man into believing that he knows his son well. That man decides to send Tom to Italy to retrieve his son, Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie, who is played by Jude Law, is privileged and arrogant, but he is also adored by those who know him. His father believes he has been sailing and schmoozing in Italy for far too long. Dickie's father promises to pay Tom's travel expenses and award him $1,000 to return with Dickie. Tom readily accepts the offer. The first scene that intrigued me was when Tom lands in Italy. He meets a pretty American girl named Meredith, played by Cate Blanchett, and he introduces himself as Dickie Greenleaf. I almost did not catch the lie at first, and I nearly forgot about it when Tom says goodbye to Meredith, returns to being Tom Ripley, and goes to meet up with Dickie. Tom pretends to meet Dickie by chance and tells him they knew each other in college. Dickie is with his girlfriend Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and, of course, he does not recognize Tom. Tom builds his talents for deception while making his way into Dickie's life, but he uses the truth of his mission to gain Dickie's trust. They quickly become friends. Everything seems to be going well for Tom, and it is at this point that I began to empathize with him because of his eagerness to participate socially and his obvious fear of loneliness.As he and Dickie become closer, Tom's attraction for Dickie becomes palpable. At the same time, Dickie takes note of Tom's infatuation and tries to brush him away by spending time with other friends. In a scene that left me shocked and confused, Tom's jealousy and passion overwhelm him while he and Dickie are sailing. They are arguing because Dickie tries to tell Tom he doesn't think that they should be friends anymore, and that Tom should return to America. Tom strikes Dickie with an oar and, after a scuffle, Tom beats Dickie to death. Tom cries as he hugs the bloodied corpse, once again leaving me unsure of Tom's plan--if he even has a plan. Tom's journey truly begins as he starts to cover his tracks and decides that his only option is to attempt to steal Dickie's life. Tom tells Marge that Dickie is just taking time away. He tells those who know him as Tom that Dickie is away, and he tells others that he is Dickie. He cashes Dickies checks and lives in his home. The other characters become pieces in Tom's game and he manipulates them to support his web of lies. Tom murders again when Dickie's friend, who has met Tom as Tom, is on the verge of discovering Tom's ruse. Once again, the murder does not seem predetermined, and Tom does it out of necessity because he cannot stand to lose his new lifestyle. Tom's lies and murders begin to spiral out of control as the police become involved. I found myself wondering if Tom would have to kill everyone in Italy that knew Dickie. I also began to empathize with Tom's delusional scheme because he seems to only want attention and affection from others. Dickie's friends become increasingly worried about his absence, and Dickie's father travels to Italy and hires a private investigator. Just as Tom's evil plan is about to break apart, Tom gets away clean. Tom forges a suicide letter from Dickie, and the police and private investigator come to conclusions that leave Tom innocent. Marge is the only person who suspects Tom, but she has become emotionally distressed and no one believes her. Dickie's father even leaves Tom some of Dickie's trust fund. Tom murders one last time as the movie ends. A man who had become his lover poses one last threat to his discovery because he still knows him as Tom, and others that know him as Dickie are aboard the same ship. Tom smothers him while crying to himself. I found this movie to be thrilling, and honestly, confusing. I could watch it again and again and probably absorb some new, interesting aspect each time. Matt Damon gives a great performance that shows range that I have not seen in his later performances.

From the beginning, it develops the sparks of the revolt. It nicely shows how all the small incidents and different thinking led to such a big revolt.The most and possibly only notable flaw with the film is its historical accuracy. Being a mainstream film, the characterization is binary. Captain Bligh is painted as antagonist and every action of Fletcher Christian is glorified in the film. The film has been made from the perspective of mutineers, considering this there isn't any big flaw in this film. However, I felt the role of Charles Laughton is not utilized properly.Apart from that I liked editing and entire production. The film stands tall when it comes to performances. The heat between Bligh and Christian is quite amusing to see. Charles Laughton is fantastic once again with his brilliant ascent. He brilliantly portrayed ruthless and inhuman actions of Bligh at the same time his character is a great seaman. On the other hand, it was quite an experience to see Clark Gable at his peak. His character is a good combination of a wise gentleman and an angry young man. Franchot Tone was also good.

Here are a few 1) There is only one R2D2. Don't try to cutesy up a movie with kid friendly characters = ditch the nice robots and keep the means ones. 2) There is only one 2001. The What just happened? ending only works in very specific circumstances = shoot for something more akin to the Alien ending. 3) Dialog is important, even in sci-fi = perhaps just get rid of Earnest Borgnine altogether. 4) Sci-fi movies need somewhat tight pseudo physics = floating into the vacuum of space must be taken with a degree of seriousness. 5) Good protagonists are almost as important as good villains = you don't need Han Solo, Gene Hackman from Poseidon would have doneHad they gotten these 5 points right, this could well be one of the finest sci-fi movies ever made. Here is what they got right 1) The visuals - The movie is beautiful, straight up. Stunning in fact. Forget the fact that you can't see a black hole, it looks so good, you can forgive that. And the matte paintings of space are beyond movie making. The dark, shadowed foreboding aura of the film is appropriate to what space is dark, cold and dangerous. Anyone trying to argue the visuals is just being silly. 2) The Cygnus - Sci-fi is all about the ships and this one is perhaps the coolest ship ever created for the screen. Jules Verne meets I. M. Pei, a Gothic trellis work skyscraper of monstrous proportions. The massive bridge with its floating planets, ordered instrument panels and sweeping view of the rest of the ship against the space backdrop is yet to be matched in any other film. To all the movie makers out there, please, someone do a movie with models instead of CGI. All the fly byes and moving shots of the ship, properly shadowed by real light blows all the CGI right out of the water. No matter how good tech gets, nothing beats large scale models. 3) The Villain - Schell is fantastic. His character and performance are spot on. He is just the right blend of genius and crazy. 4) The Henchman - Maximilian remains the greatest evil robot ever invented. He is frightening and psychopathic, all without ever voicing a single word. Children were scared out of their minds when this movie came out. 5) The mindless army - Perhaps even better than Soylent green is people! A space ship essentially manned by zombies?! Come on, beat that! Imagine how scary the movie could have been if instead of being hunted by silly robots, the good doctor turned an army of zombies on our heroes as they tried to escape the sinking Cygnus. The Poseidon Adventure meets Dawn of the Dead. 6) The Scenes - some of the best scenes in sci-fi history, Maximilian roto rootering Norman Bates, the doctor trapped and dying while he begs his zombies to help him, and the rolling asteroid (stolen for Raiders by the way). 7) The Score - Few movies can claim a score that reflects the overall feel of the movie as well as this. The opening credits are worth the price of admission due to the music.And to those lousy critics who want to trash this film for silly reasons, let me help you out with a few items. 1) No, this film is not a rip off of Star Wars. Its nothing like Star Wars aside from having a silly robot. Please come up with something more original than that. It is much more closely associated with 20k Leagues, 2001 and The Poseidon Adventure. 2) The special effects are REALLY GOOD considering the time. Better in fact than Star Wars, and people of the time agreed. Sure you can see a few wires if you look closely, but that stuff is hard given what they had to work with. Watch the rolling asteroid scene some time, and find any fault with it. Its better than what we could do today. 3) The pacing is not slow when taken in context of the time, neither was Vertigo in case you want to level that criticism at Hitchcock. In fact the 1979 NY Times review called this movie snappy. The fact that your current attention span can hardly tolerate anything slower than The Fast and the Furious says nothing about a movie made before Reagan was president. 4) The acting, aside from Borgnine, is not bad. The dialog is bad and so it can be hard to tell, but most of the actors are passable. Schell and Perkins are in fact quite good. 5) The design of the Cygnus is not absurd. Keep in mind that we find out that the Cygnus is a gross expenditure of taxpayer dollars dreamed up by the doctor. Its reasonable to believe that if you have reached the point in time that you can create artificial gravity, then getting materials into space to construct a large ship is likely no longer a barrier. Without the constraints of drag or gravity, and driven by an over funded, likely high corrupt government pork project, space ships may indeed become ridiculously sized.My dearest hope for movie technology is to come up with something to fix old movies without wrecking them, because with a few tweaks, this one could be a masterpieces as opposed to being a punching bag.

I really did.My friend and I made initial plans to see this movie, but I had one of my rare migraines that date. Still we went. I held my head almost the entire two hours while I&#x85;enjoyed the heck out of this.After many years, decades even, I revisited this 1990s disaster flick and still I thoroughly enjoyed it. Man, they do not make action movies like they did back in the 1990s. And this one had a special twist no bad guys.With a serious of misfortunate events, two sides to a NYC\/NJ tunnel are sealed shut, and a few survivors are lead by ex-chief, Kit (Stallone) who has a heart of gold, arms of a god and luck of an angel. I loved his character and would stand by his unrealistic, but charming savior attitude. He put himself into the center of the disaster to save just a few innocent (and some not so) lives.After event-after-event, these people band together to make it to the surface. Some might say if you've seen one 1990s disaster movie, you've seen them all&#x85;and they might be right. In this case, it's just a tad original here and there, but overall, it's what you'd expect.Does it mean it's any less entertaining? No, not at all. I loved it. It's clichéd yet fun. It's predictable, but enjoyable. And it has its charms in the right places while delivering heavy on the action and heroism.Not groundbreaking, no pun, but it's a tribute to a bygone decade &#x96; my personal favorite for REAL action films.

I won't mention the lady's name, or the newspaper she represented but the review was terrible and I remember thinking to myself well, nobody will be going to see THIS clunker. How that lady must have eaten her words! Today, Walkabout is thought of as a modern classic, and since I've just had the privilege of watching it for the first time, it I can understand why. Mysterious and beautiful, Walkabout is a stunning meditation on white civilisation in an age of so-called reason, which appears to be dragging nature over an apocalyptic cliff of indifference and destruction. For a film with such threadbare narrative structure, Walkabout never bored me, as if there was always something going on even though it wasn't being directly talked about on-screen, and perhaps these are the best kinds of films, but unfortunately they are few and far between. As directed by Nicolas Roeg the visuals of the Australian outback are outstanding, as two children abandoned by their father, seek to get back to civilisation before they die of thirst. The young boy and girl encounter a young Aboriginal man whose help becomes indispensable to their survival. Aboriginal culture as represented by renowned actor David Gulpilil is portrayed as a harmonious representation of living within nature's means, whilst white civilisation is portrayed as giving nothing back in its efforts to progress away from so-called savagery. John Barry's music is outstanding and I was also entranced by a number of experiments on the soundtrack in which the sound seemed on the face of it at least, to have little to do with what was going on visually. With the wonders of modern technology (ironically enough), I will soon be watching Walkabout again, in order to fully appreciate it's many moods and meanings.

Michael's search for redemption seems conflicted, insincere and ultimately unsuccessful. He continues to choose revenge and wreak destruction that damages his family and his soul. So why bother except maybe to cash in? The ending to GF2 was sufficient. There really is nothing new...except he dies (physically). The final shot in GF2 says it all.

Michael could have easily changed but instead chose to involve himself in an underhanded business deal with the Church. It makes his claim of seeking redemption and protecting his family seem insincere when contrasted with his desire to profit via the tainted Imobilare deal.The scene where the bosses are killed in Atlanta is ridiculous and illogical. Don Altobelo's poisoning seemed comical and far fetched as do the Arch Bishops and Leichesi's murders. I need to whisper in your ear. LOL!!! Many scenes seem stiff and forced.

This science is so bad it would actually distract me from a decent story even if there were one; as it's only down to laziness I won't excuse that.When characters are saved or lost on the basis of fantasy, it does detract from my ability to care what happens next.

Have they been redeemed yet? Will redemption require a noble sacrifice to save their fellow crew?

Examples follow...The opening's as clumsy as any set-up could be, giving a vague nod to the half-baked reasons why our blue- green ocean planet could be a less viable habitat than the destination &#x96;- a red dust-bowl with an atmosphere 1% as dense. A case of bad predictions? Well they claim the world was poisoned, beyond being saved, as early as 2000 -- the film's release date! However pessimistic your outlook, to suggest starting again on Mars is more hopeful than improving things on Earth is the kind of stupidity you can only learn in college. What a shame the makers had to cram in the popular ideology of the day. Is it not enough that humanity has a more certain future, the more worlds we colonise? We never know what the future holds. Would it be unrealistic to open with a mission to colonise Mars, without the drivel? Is it not something we want to do anyway?Ridiculously (and inconsistently) advanced technology with thin, generalised narrative themes, combined with those hot booby shots, convinced me this film was aimed not at a science fiction audience but at men who need to expand their porn collections. Lately we've been separating works of storytelling art from works of boob art, which I think represents positive progress for both. Had we made so little progress in 2000? Was this film behind the times? I pity boys of 14 who saw this with family, especially their mums. Even boobs could be wasted on those poor lads, who may have simply cringed &#x96;- a real shame.The characters are 2D and, for astronauts, astonishingly anti-intellectual and ignorant according to their unbelievable dialogue.

Just playing safe!)From start to finish, this film is LAZY. Research is non-existent. Astronauts (and presumably scriptwriters) are too ignorant of past missions to know the name of Pathfinder! (That rover, what's its name is one reference.) The geneticist talks about writing code with A, G, T and P! (It is C not P.) How little effort would it take, to get such basics right?Why did non-fans of science try making a space movie?What an insult to the audience this travesty is.If you watch, enjoy your eye candy, the gleaming white futurism and the boobies. Stop with the dishonest reviews. Wanking to this film ISN'T anything to be ashamed of, but dishonestly praising the film for its artistic integrity IS!Even Mission To Mars had fewer errors, better dialogue, more point, and fewer people killed by bad science. I almost feel like watching it again, for a dose of sanity.Of course accurate science isn't everything in storytelling, but a bit of authenticity wouldn't go amiss. This science is so bad it would actually distract me from a decent story even if there were one; as it's only down to laziness I won't excuse that.When characters are saved or lost on the basis of fantasy, it does detract from my ability to care what happens next. There are no real, well-constrained problems to ponder, to guess how characters might survive; no judgement can be made of likely outcomes, on any basis but the most fundamental rules of narrative Has a character been bad? Have they been redeemed yet? Will redemption require a noble sacrifice to save their fellow crew? Such basic (and vague) narrative rules are obeyed, but no peril nor solution is feasible, giving the whole story a pointless, vacuous feel.So don't confuse this space fantasy with science fiction; there's not a bit of science in it. We have unexplained artificial gravity, vanishing when the power does! It's only set in 2025! The FIRST manned Mars mission uses a ship like a futuristic luxury yacht inside, with ample floor space and bright white light. With Carrie-Anne Moss's side-boob shower shots so early, and unashamedly blatant nipple shots later on, it's certainly pleasing to look at; just don't expect plot that withstands any scrutiny. Examples follow...The opening's as clumsy as any set-up could be, giving a vague nod to the half-baked reasons why our blue- green ocean planet could be a less viable habitat than the destination &#x96;- a red dust-bowl with an atmosphere 1% as dense. A case of bad predictions? Well they claim the world was poisoned, beyond being saved, as early as 2000 -- the film's release date! However pessimistic your outlook, to suggest starting again on Mars is more hopeful than improving things on Earth is the kind of stupidity you can only learn in college. What a shame the makers had to cram in the popular ideology of the day. Is it not enough that humanity has a more certain future, the more worlds we colonise? We never know what the future holds. Would it be unrealistic to open with a mission to colonise Mars, without the drivel? Is it not something we want to do anyway?Ridiculously (and inconsistently) advanced technology with thin, generalised narrative themes, combined with those hot booby shots, convinced me this film was aimed not at a science fiction audience but at men who need to expand their porn collections. Lately we've been separating works of storytelling art from works of boob art, which I think represents positive progress for both. Had we made so little progress in 2000? Was this film behind the times? I pity boys of 14 who saw this with family, especially their mums. Even boobs could be wasted on those poor lads, who may have simply cringed &#x96;- a real shame.The characters are 2D and, for astronauts, astonishingly anti-intellectual and ignorant according to their unbelievable dialogue. Watch this film if you're too drunk\/stoned to care about storytelling, and if you know no better science than the lazy researchers in the production team. Otherwise don't waste bandwidth - - let alone money -- downloading.Powering down to the planet at such an angle requires no equations to see its wrongness! Any intuitive understanding, or just a good eye for Angry Birds Space, is plenty!Technical restrictions on plot, regarding fuel and so on, feel inconsistent and arbitrary; they're cumbersomely received from the dialogue.This is the opposite of hard science fiction; it won't get people thinking about what advances might be possible, in what order; it won't make children draw space factories at Lagrange points, served by elevators from the Moon; it'll only provoke, Wow! It looks really cool!, from the slow-witted and serve as masturbation fodder for Moss fans.Oxygen is the only acknowledged problem with breathing on Mars. Oxygen is found mysteriously higher than expected, thanks to plot elements I needn't spoil; this nod to the problem might appear sufficient to a poorly educated child. No mention is made of pressure, except to convey how bad a cyclone will be at one stage -- 840 millibars, lower than in any storm on Earth, higher than any pressure of atmosphere Mars could ever retain. Plus it conveys nothing, unless we know the usual Martian pressure for comparison.

That is pretty much the only achievement of the much derided first installment of the prequel trilogy. Some hate it, some like it and some, like me, are in the middle. While the originals were powerful and hugely enjoyable stories of freedom and character, this is a misguided and wooden film about... trade disputes. Are we meant to care about the politics of the Star Wars universe?! This isn't a terrible movie though. Yes, Jar Jar and yes, young Anakin but one annoying kid and one annoying alien can't sink an entire movie (Still, oh boy does Jar Jar come close). As routine as the visuals are, the film is visually stunning and the Star Wars universe is one I am always happy to return to. The film still has some interesting characters and mythology, and some of the action sequences, especially the pod race, are very entertaining while the final Lightsabre duel is among the best of the franchise and one of the great good moments in bad movies.So it doesn't deserve all the hate. But it doesn't deserve any love either. George Lucas shows he may be good at changing blockbuster cinema but he isn't a good director. His direction is tame and uninspired, and the film consists of cardboard characters drifting across artificial CGI landscapes. What's worse is the script, which might as well have been run over by a steam roller and while the film's got plenty of style it lacks a soul. The impressive cast all either spend their time either shouting Yippee!, failing to show emotion, screaming, performing monologues in monotone or ruining people's childhoods; frequently all at the same time. The politics make the movie even more annoying and did we really need what creates the force to be explained to us? An average movie, hyped to ridiculous levels. Definitely the weakest of the saga.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 January 2014","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The most anticipated and disappointing movie ever made.
