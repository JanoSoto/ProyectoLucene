Yes, that's right, it's only 93 minutes long, but if you make the mistake of checking this one out, you'll feel like it's a 3 hour yawnfest. In fact, the early scene with the characters caught in quicksand will sum up your viewing experience an imprisonment in a slimy, stolid muck and the struggle to pull your way through it.Of course, a big part of the problem is that most of the would-be jokes simply aren't funny. I'm amazed that a movie like this received the critical praise that it has. Comedy can be so much more than what Blazing Saddles throws on the screen. I think that some of the critics and award-peddlers might have been tricked into applauding the film because, unlike many comedies, it makes an attempt to examine --- or rather, to incorporate the issue of racism into its humor. Thus, some may be convinced that the movie exhibits intelligence by trying to deal with a serious theme, but any social statement it musters is neither solid nor accurate. Much of the movie's humor is based on the unrealistic supposition that all white inhabitants of the southwest were crass, easily-duped white supremacist WASPs who used racial slurs out of habit and detested blacks. Racism is a difficult subject to form comedy from, and here the concept is beaten over the viewer's head. The jokes are shouted out with no subtlety or wit, as if heavy-handedness makes them clever or socially perceptive. And as a source of humor, it wears out quickly, for that matter. The director Mel Brooks thinks it's funny to give all the white racists the generic name of Johnson. Har har. Never mind the fact that the US president who fought for black civil rights and appointed the first black Supreme Court justice was a white Texan named Johnson.It's true that some of the jokes could have worked, but the movie has such a poor sense of pacing that it fails to build anything resembling comic mood or momentum. You could call it dull, unappealing, even unimaginative. And it seems like Brooks was very determined to mug for the camera and bore the viewer during his lengthy on-screen appearances. His face kind of resembles Don Adams from Get Smart, but when it comes to being funny, make no mistake, Don Adams he ain't.While trying to stay awake around the 40-minute mark, I said to myself, OK, well, Gene Wilder should be showing up soon. He can be funny sometimes. But his presence is barely memorable at best. After Wilder delivers a slurred speech or two, the film introduces the quick-handedness of Wilder's gun-slinging character, which proves to be the film's only gag that is remotely funny and interesting. Alas, this provides but a minute or two of material. The writers seemed to have trouble finding a purpose for him, and so Wilder inexplicably spends most of the movie hanging around Cleavon Little's office. Instead of doing comedy, he is left to recite long stretches of forgettable dialogue.Let's see, what other comedy does the movie offer? There are the ho-hum attempts to recreate Monty Python-style absurd humor, especially at the end. Simply flat compared to what those British boys have done, and not enough to lift this picture out of the mud. And no discussion of the movie can ignore the bulk of the material, the continuous vein of low-brow, puerile rubbish not worth anyone's time. Another IMDb reviewer or two have labeled it seventh grade stuff. Well, I even bet there are a number of 7th Graders who would feel that this humor is beneath them. (That is, if they managed to sit through all the other boring scenes.)

The writers seemed to have trouble finding a purpose for him, and so Wilder inexplicably spends most of the movie hanging around Cleavon Little's office. Instead of doing comedy, he is left to recite long stretches of forgettable dialogue.Let's see, what other comedy does the movie offer? There are the ho-hum attempts to recreate Monty Python-style absurd humor, especially at the end. Simply flat compared to what those British boys have done, and not enough to lift this picture out of the mud. And no discussion of the movie can ignore the bulk of the material, the continuous vein of low-brow, puerile rubbish not worth anyone's time. Another IMDb reviewer or two have labeled it seventh grade stuff. Well, I even bet there are a number of 7th Graders who would feel that this humor is beneath them. (That is, if they managed to sit through all the other boring scenes.) I am perplexed that such dreck is being held up by some critics as high cinema.Unless you feel it is absolutely essential for you to hear Slim Pickens spouting the S-word, skip this one.

And it is a real disappointment since so much talent was wasted.  It appears to be an excellent sketch comedy bit, gone horribly, horribly wrong.

The coal mining scenes were a waste (Why have Vince Vaughn just sit there, couldn't Stiller think of a single line for him)  All the cameos were distracting, and none were very funny.  The spy scenes were silly, and were meant to be.  But Austin Powers proved that silly spy spoofs could still pack the laughs, despite the fact they are predictable.  The modeling scenes were parodies of a genre that has already been parodied enough. (See Scary Movie spoofing a spoof)  We all know Male models are vacant.  Telling us again doesn't make it any funier.

Funny for a five minute sketch, tiresome in a 100 minute movie. The film seemed unorganized and rushed.

They're the opposite ends of the spectrum of good and evil, except that Kyle isn't as purely good as Boyd is flat-out horrible.  Boyd's the consummate supressed control\/rage freak and it isn't an accident that he's not only not that bothered by the two deaths and one murder in Las Vegas, but relishes the opportunity to commit more of them. Kyle may be horrified at what's happened but he has the strange ability to internalize it, unlike the poor Berkow brothers and even Charles the mechanic. As played by the vastly underrated Leland Orser, Charles is great at showing us how a quiet, vacant fellow would react to this cavalcade of disaster (he reminded me of the Tobias Beecher character on OZ).The best or worst thing about this film, from an honesty standpoint, is that it hates everyone it sees and isn't afraid to say it. VERY BAD THINGS has vile portrayals of women, Cameron Diaz as a harridan whose final fate was darkly amusing, and Jeanne Tripplehorn is simply pathetic. The characters in the movie are also racist and anti-Semitic, but it's unclear to what effect that is being presented. Would they have not killed the security guard if he'd been white? Is there any reason to point out that the Berkow brothers are Jewish and have at least some insight into Jewish law and customs, beyond setting up Boyd's cruel comments to them and the disastrous funeral reception? No one in the movie is that nice, but there is some sympathy for Kyle and Daniel Stern's character, because they might have had OK lives if this hadn't happened (or would have deluded themselves into thinking their lives were happy). Everyone else here was headed for hell on earth anyway, I thought, and the events here just accelerated that process.Yet for all its nastiness and ugliness, this is also a very well-made film, the plotting is relentlessly ingenious, and it's one of the few films that plays better in an edited form without being neutered. I saw it on Comedy Central, where the most gruesome violence (like the chainsaw scene) was cut out and the language was dubbed (though you'd have to be clueless to not get what was REALLY being said). It worked on its chosen level, as a nihilistic and cruel comedy. I didn't much enjoy this film but I had to grade it on what it did, not how it did it.

I don't think many folks would want to watch something like this in the post-9\/11 world, but then again, TRAINING DAY is just as nihilistic as this movie and it made over $24 million in its first weekend.The key to VERY BAD THINGS are in the characters of Robert Boyd, played by Christian Slater, and Kyle Fisher, played by Jon Favreau.  They're the opposite ends of the spectrum of good and evil, except that Kyle isn't as purely good as Boyd is flat-out horrible.  Boyd's the consummate supressed control\/rage freak and it isn't an accident that he's not only not that bothered by the two deaths and one murder in Las Vegas, but relishes the opportunity to commit more of them. Kyle may be horrified at what's happened but he has the strange ability to internalize it, unlike the poor Berkow brothers and even Charles the mechanic. As played by the vastly underrated Leland Orser, Charles is great at showing us how a quiet, vacant fellow would react to this cavalcade of disaster (he reminded me of the Tobias Beecher character on OZ).The best or worst thing about this film, from an honesty standpoint, is that it hates everyone it sees and isn't afraid to say it. VERY BAD THINGS has vile portrayals of women, Cameron Diaz as a harridan whose final fate was darkly amusing, and Jeanne Tripplehorn is simply pathetic.

Don't Say a Word proves that the answer is Yes.  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question; you'll have to ask the producers about it.In the movie, Michael Douglas plays an affluent, happily married psychologist who has to contend (as Michael Douglas does in every movie), with a seriously disturbed woman.  The femme-looney in this outing is Elizabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a 10-year, 20-institution veteran with enough contradictory diagnoses to sink a DSM textbook.  He is called in to consult by a colleague (Oliver Platt) and then is bewildered as a shadowy band of Bad Guys snatch his daughter and demand that he work his famed empathy thing with poor Britt and get her to give him a ten-digit number that they need.  Her dad, it seems, ripped them off during the heist of a precious red jewel, and they need the number to find it.  Douglas figures out that while she has problems of her own, Elizabeth has been confounding her doctors by imitating various symptoms, in effect, staying institutionalized to hide from the evildoers.  Me, I would have gone to Tahiti; to each his own.The kidnap-flick tropes then come in fast and heavy the Panicked Discovery, the Initial Phone Call, The List of Rules (no cops, yada yada), No Deal Til I Talk to My Daughter, the Desperate Clock-Race Across Town, the Tough Female Detective trying to Figure It All Out, and more.  We get a host of other familiar faces, too the Bad Guys are a band of high-tech thieves (which are so common in movies, they must have a hell of a union), with black leather jackets, sleek laptops, and a guy whose job during the robbery is to stand in the middle of the bank with a stopwatch calling off the time, as though they were at the Olympic trials for the 100-meter Felony.But all this is skillfully handled, with just enough tweaks to the familiar formulas to make it feel fresh.  At one point, Douglas makes the kidnappers relocate to meet him, a nice twist on the usual kidnappers run the bagman all over town scene.  And the bit with the mental patient, well, it beats can-we-raise-the-money-in-time?  For his part, Michael Douglas does well, though he is a little too slick to portray besieged decent men.  My hunch is that Harrison Ford was first choice to play this role.  Famke Janssen is good as his wife.  Though the script gives her little to do, she is really the one who makes us feel the panic and despair that attend the abduction of a child, and though it's a familiar movie scenario, it is still able to play on the nerves quite effectively.  The little girl playing Douglas' daughter does well, too, cute but not cloying, smart but credible; there is an amusing scene where she attempts to make conversation with the hulking, tattooed murderer who is guarding her, eventually cajoling him into making peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches.  And, carrying on the proud tradition started by Alyssa Milano in Commando, does her level best to foil her captors.The Bad Guys are a little disappointing.  They are assigned quirks rather than characters (one never appears to have a name).  As the head villain, Sean Bean makes what he can of his feral charisma, but he literally phones this performance in.  I think the poor guy is doomed to spend the rest of his career playing Hibernian heavies in leather jackets.  Their operation seems a little too well-orchestrated, especially since the movie supposedly take place less than three weeks after they've been sprung after doing a dime in Attica (where one guesses they studied electronic eavesdropping in between lifting weights).  And while the movie doesn't say how much the priceless rock is worth, by my estimation, after splitting the proceeds and covering their overhead, surveillance equipment, and tattoos, the gang should have just enough left for a celebratory lunch at the IHOP.The best performance is by Brittany Murphy as the twitchy, wary Elizabeth. With her weird hand gestures and tuneless singing, this character could have been really annoying.  But Murphy makes her guileless and affecting. Watching her stare out her barred window at the tugboats in the river, your heart breaks just a little.The story is not always credible, especially the parts involving Jennifer Esposito as the detective, who is really a sideshow anyway.  We also see several New Yorkers who are surprisingly pliant when deprived of everything from cell phones to speedboats.  And the parents adhere blindly to the don't tell the cops rule, even after it is laughably impractical to do so.The thing that really makes the movie work is the setting and the way it is shot by director Gary Fleder, who made the underrated Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead.  Fleder puts us in claustophobic, oppressive places, from underground morgues to puke-green institution hallways with prison doors and disturbing graffiti, to the fog-shrouded darkness of Potter's Field, graveyard of the anonymous dead of New York City.  Even Douglas' luxury apartment seems at tight quarters, and these places are filmed in such a way to make this close to a horror movie.  The dark climax is formulaic, but give a neat twist in location.  The number, incidentally, doesn't refer to an uplink code or satellite designation or encryption key or any of the usual millenial McGuffins of late.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"8 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Contains Spoilers Don't Say A Word isn't a bad thriller, but it doesn't exactly whisk us away to unknown territory.  Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as a psychologist whose daughter is kidnapped by a group of greedy bank-robbers, who kidnap her in exchange for a mysterious number that only his disturbed patient (Brittany Murphy) knows.  Murphy is terrific in the role of a schitzo.  She's actually took on the role of a schitzo (though more low-key) in the critically-acclaimed Girl Interrupted, but this was a more brutal, difficult role for her and she succeeded with flying colors.  I was actually terrified by her in a few sequences, even when she--no pun intended--didn't say a word.  Her look alone is terrifying enough--and that's admirable for a fairly attractive girl to pull off.  Guy Torry is a good, underrated comedian, but he seemed out of place as one of the villains.  Like all comedians taking on movie roles, they try to be funny and witty--even when the scene doesn't call for it.  Torry was good in the very dramatic American History X, but here he seemed out of place and his humor didn't mesh well with the moments of suspense.The detective work is quite interesting with Jennifer Esposito (in her first role in a big Hollywood movie) as a tough-as-nails female detective. Esposito is very good and very convincing.  However, the plot goes through the same motions we've encountered in previous films of this type (i.e. Ransom).  The human drama is overshadowed by preposterous action sequences.  We have Douglas suddenly taking the role of the action hero (like all fathers in these movies), driving through a Thanksgiving parade, stealing boats, beating up security guards, etc.  So for all you daughters out there--if your boyfriend gives you crap, you know who to call. Super-Dad!  But of course, that's only if you live in the world of Hollywood cinema.  Also in this world, the little 8-year-old daughter is smart as hell.  Even smarter than the parents, in certain aspects.  Show me some 8-year-old girls like that.  They certainly don't belong to my family.  And having his wife (Famke Jaansen) as a cripple was merely a setup for a later scene in which she breaks out of her cast and uses her crutches as weapons. Wow, don't underestimate the power of a paraplegic.  The climax in the graveyard has that typical Hollywood quality to it as well.  Every time I watch these movies, I wanna scream out at the hero, Unless you shoot the villain 25 guys--HE'S NOT DEAD!!!  When I first started watching movies, I was surprised when a villain would come back for a last scare and start shooting at our hero, bloody and beaten.  Now I feel jaded.

Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as a psychologist whose daughter is kidnapped by a group of greedy bank-robbers, who kidnap her in exchange for a mysterious number that only his disturbed patient (Brittany Murphy) knows.  Murphy is terrific in the role of a schitzo.  She's actually took on the role of a schitzo (though more low-key) in the critically-acclaimed Girl Interrupted, but this was a more brutal, difficult role for her and she succeeded with flying colors.  I was actually terrified by her in a few sequences, even when she--no pun intended--didn't say a word.  Her look alone is terrifying enough--and that's admirable for a fairly attractive girl to pull off.  Guy Torry is a good, underrated comedian, but he seemed out of place as one of the villains.  Like all comedians taking on movie roles, they try to be funny and witty--even when the scene doesn't call for it.  Torry was good in the very dramatic American History X, but here he seemed out of place and his humor didn't mesh well with the moments of suspense.The detective work is quite interesting with Jennifer Esposito (in her first role in a big Hollywood movie) as a tough-as-nails female detective. Esposito is very good and very convincing.  However, the plot goes through the same motions we've encountered in previous films of this type (i.e. Ransom).  The human drama is overshadowed by preposterous action sequences.  We have Douglas suddenly taking the role of the action hero (like all fathers in these movies), driving through a Thanksgiving parade, stealing boats, beating up security guards, etc.  So for all you daughters out there--if your boyfriend gives you crap, you know who to call. Super-Dad!  But of course, that's only if you live in the world of Hollywood cinema.  Also in this world, the little 8-year-old daughter is smart as hell.  Even smarter than the parents, in certain aspects.  Show me some 8-year-old girls like that.  They certainly don't belong to my family.  And having his wife (Famke Jaansen) as a cripple was merely a setup for a later scene in which she breaks out of her cast and uses her crutches as weapons. Wow, don't underestimate the power of a paraplegic.  The climax in the graveyard has that typical Hollywood quality to it as well.  Every time I watch these movies, I wanna scream out at the hero, Unless you shoot the villain 25 guys--HE'S NOT DEAD!!!  When I first started watching movies, I was surprised when a villain would come back for a last scare and start shooting at our hero, bloody and beaten.  Now I feel jaded.
