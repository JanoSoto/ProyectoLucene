In his novel, Michael Crichton explored the unique and harrowing possibility that genetics could bring the dinosaurs back. When entrepreneurs try to turn the miracle of dinosaur cloning into a theme park attraction, chaos theory kicks in, proving that nature can't be tamed that easily.Stephen Spielberg's adaptation of Crichton's novel takes the original premise, complete with its cautionary warnings, and delivers it as a fast-moving adventure film full of color, wit, and thrills. There are moments where the film emphasizes the whimsy and wonder of creation, but when the deadliest of predators are unleashed, there are a fair amount of harrowing, suspenseful chases that follow. One of the most chilling scenes shows the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex breaking loose from its paddock and laying waste to a pair of jeeps, threatening to crush and eat everybody trapped inside. Velociraptors rush through the jungles and buildings, threatening to devour human prey. What starts off as a wondrous what if scenario eventually devolves into a struggle for survival and escape; occasional bursts of comedy keeps the film lightweight, but with groundbreaking special effects, carefully-staged action, and characters worth caring about, the film offers a grand spectacle and a perfectly-entertaining blockbuster experience.Much of the story is altered from the original book, but it's hardly an issue. On its own merits, the film tells the story it wants to and it does it well. It flips a few of the characters around so that there's a family dynamic at work. Most of the characters are likable, and the film sets them up so that we can understand and care for them when they're in danger. Some of them make very bad decisions, but even the dumbest characters are endearing, because the film shows them as being very human and prone to mistakes; these faults ultimately contribute to the plot's progression. The plot unfolds spectacularly, continuously building in tension and action. Throughout the picture, the characters speculate and dig up fascinating themes about playing God with genetics; the film's events prove that all human attempts to control nature and force a structure will never work, and life will always find a way to break free and thrive on its own. These themes carry both wonder and terror, and the film emphasizes both aspects aptly.This film is made with really good photography. Editing can be a little weak at times, but it is often punchy and good. Acting is pretty over-the-top, but it produces expressions and emotions that fit in perfectly with the film's tone. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfectly likable in their roles. Jeff Goldblum steals the show repeatedly with his character's wit and wisdom. Richard Attenborough has a great presence and personality as John Hammond. The kid characters put their best into it, and they do have some endearing moments that gives the film a more emotional punch. Bob Peck is cool, Martin Ferraro is a dude we love to hate, Wayne Knight is an even bigger dude we love to hate, Samuel L Jackson keeps it real, and everybody else is decent. This script is full of great lines, but some dialogue can be rather random, and it's all really low-key. Despite one or two shortcuts, this production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and creature effects. Special effects were fantastic for its time, and most of them still hold up to this day. John Williams' music score is catchy and emotional.Jurassic Park is easily one of the best blockbusters, not only because of all its visual effects and thrills, but also because it has heart, and it has themes worth thinking about.

This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love Jurassic Park so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.

The other actors were nothing to write home about, and the little girl was plain awful. Both the Pet Sematary and the Micmac burial ground were a lot more elaborate than I had envisioned, but I don't mind that much&#x85; who says that what I envisioned is the right way it should look? Yet I do wish that Church had looked the way he did on the novel's cover, a regular ol' tabby cat (Maine Coon, perhaps?) instead of a Russian Blue. Beautiful cat, but not the Church of the book.I re-watched it recently to remind myself of exactly what I hadn't liked about it, and I have to say that the end was a real let-down. The little boy should have looked a whole lot more damaged and that would have added to the terror. The book mentioned that his head was misshapen&#x85; well, no surprise there; he got hit by an 18-wheeler hard enough to knock him out of his shoes, but aside from being light blue and having one little faint scar on his forehead, he looked fine at the end of the film. I'm sure putting hours of special-effects makeup on a squirming 2- year-old is impossible, so I get the why here, but it still took a lot away from the ending to have a cute light-blue kid toddling around supposedly terrifying everyone. Maybe CGI the dead Gage in a future re- make?Credit where it's due one of the most subtly horrifying scenes in the book made it to the movie version and it was very effective. At Gage's funeral when Louis is fistfighting with Rachel's father and the coffin falls off the bier and hits the floor, bouncing open for just one nanosecond, giving just a momentary peek at Gage's little hand&#x85; wow. Well-done on that shot, Madame Director. It was just enough, not too much, not too little.Otherwise, a run-of-the-mill adaptation of an outstanding horror novel.

It's probably an unpopular opinion, but i preferred this movie from the Lost World Jurassic Park, Alan Grant was one of my favourite characters from the original movie and seeing him again was a huge bonus for me, I found myself caring more for these characters, and one of my biggest problems with Lost World was that a lot of the actors weren't believable, they didn't seem like they were witnessing a real dinosaur, I feel like they accomplished that here. I think Paul and Amanda Kirby's characters were poorly written, though I do like William H.

The problem with the Lost World is still very much evident here, and that's simply that they're trying too hard to be as good as the original Jurassic Park and not simply being its own movie, if it would stop making reference to the first and reminding us how much better that movie was, then the series would be going on the right track.

However, more expeditions come in as they are about to take dinosaurs off this island for another theme park attractions. Malcolm and the others need to stop them and each group of their own gets stuck on an island as they try to work together on how to get home. The main reason why no one likes this movie is because of two things First, it doesn't have the same charm as the first which is true, and second they really hated on what the characters are doing like opening cages as dinosaurs destroy their camp or bringing in a baby T-Rex into an RV. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think everyone is misjudging it. I know its not as good as the first one, but I really enjoyed how it stands out on its own where it doesn't need to be like the first one. The characters to me are just like any other movie you see as once they are into risky situations, they just argue things over and are just having a hard time trusting each other and working together. I can defend their actions if I have to write this as a long review, but don't want to go too far on that. I thought Jeff Goldblum, in my opinion, plays a very good lead as in the first one he was once a funny side character, now he is more mature and he has once had his experience on Isla Nublar as he had to risks his life again on Isla Sorna to go out and find Sarah, and then come home. The other cast all did fine. Even though, there is not much to their character, but I would love if the movie has some more characterization. The story I thought was told fine as once again not being like the first one again. The special effects, well, at times there are parts that are slightly dated, but for the most part they looked really good. John Williams' music is just as good as he did with the music in the first one. I do love the final scene, where the T- Rex attacks San Diego which I thought was a well done action scene. Like the first one, the movie doesn't bored me as it still keeps my interest. The Lost World Jurassic Park may not be a perfect movie, but I don't think its really Steven Spielberg's fault, I thought he did well enough on what he can bring to this movie that does give enough much excitements, and plenty of good dinosaur action. To me, I say give this movie another chance. If not, then no worries because everyone has an opinion and we respect it to each of our own.

So the movie started and we giggled at the cheesy characters and bad haircuts (Kurt Russell, as always, is a gem), as you do.

This movie went to such an extreme level of gory mutation and body horror that I can only really compare to the ending of The Fly. Yet, even if the extent to which the body horror is taken is some of the most extreme and in turn ridiculous I've seen in any movie of this kind so far, The Thing never loses its finesse. As horrific and disgusting as they are, you still always look forward to the next mutation scene, just to see what new thing they can think of next. The Thing is one of the absolutely most creative horror films I have ever seen.But The Thing was much more than just the gore. In this movie, John Carpenter once again proves he is the master of build-up.

It manages to always keep you on the edge of your seat.The Thing only really falls short in the boring soundtrack and the flat characters with little to no personality, except for Kurt Russell, whose character is unnecessarily crass and hard to relate to as the hero of the story.

Back then, I was fascinated by these terrible movies, which seemed to have a lot more fun in them than the good ones of the time period, some of which, however acclaimed, I do not care about. I didn't know about Wood's passions, his history, his relationships, and I could think of no better vassal than this film.Criminally ignored at the Box Office, despite the consolation of Critical Acclaim, and the first Oscar ever given to someone portraying a real life movie star, this is one of the films that runs the full kaleidoscope of human emotion, not the least of which is heart. Ed Wood lived to be a joke, and his inept films are a demonstration for that, though it is never cruel in the slightest towards him. Depp, in a performance that eats Jack Sparrow for breakfast, radiates a passion for his work that anyone who likes films can grasp instantly. He idolises his film stars, has posters in his ramshackle apartment, and talks about them all the time at worm. Added to this is Wood's battles with the studio system, wherein we now have an actual reason to root for him, whereas other movies would throw an obstacle at the protagonist without the audience given time or reason to like him. It may be cliché, but look at Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars Prequels. We don't care about him, so why should we care about his situation. Wood is the underdog, screwed over by the Hollywood system. Yet they have a point. He is fantastically terrible. And that is the main victory of the film. Despite knowing that he's crap, we still want to see the producers hand him money to make his dreams come true, despite it being a Box Office bomb in the making. Most other pictures would have had us rooting for the producers in that case, but here we root for the doomed path. His Reaganite optimism is a breath of fresh air in an industry dominated by the bottom line. You'd wish you could be friends with this guy, talking about your favourite movies together, going to the bar, and of course, the cinema.I can go no further but talk about Landau's Lugosi, which thankfully was fully rewarded with an Oscar. Lugosi is the number 2 character in the film. Once top of the world, in Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven, he's a morphine addict waiting for death. Wood is the precursor of Lugosi's arc, who gives meaning to his life, racked by debt, divorce, and addiction. While this could be the recipe for sentimentalism, we are thankfully spared that, and given a tour-de-force in comedy. Swearing is so much funnier with his Hungarian accent, especially when he gets perverted. If you want to make out with a young lady, take her to see Dracula heh heh. A recurring joke has that no one realises Lugosi is even alive, and certainly that Karloff is his superior, whom Lugosi doesn't seem at all bitter to. **** YOU!!! KARLOFF DOESN'T DESERVE TO SMELL MY ****!!! His relationship with Wood is the core of the film. Lugosi is given a reason for life in his dying days, and this gives his character meaning. It was based on Burton's own relationship with the sickly Vincent Price.Then there is the humour, which was inevitable given Wood's ineptness, and it showsA Monster Octopus has no motor, and the actors have to move the legs themselvesAn actor in a police get-up scratches his face with the business end of a revolver while his finger is on the trigger, before falling over and knocking down a wooden gravestone.Lugosi reads incomprehensible dialogue on the set of Glen or Glenda Bevare ze BIG GREEN DRAGON, who sitz on yor DOORstep.Many others follow, but the best is when Lugosi goes on live television for a skit. I won't dare spoil it.Wood made decisions that no sane man could have made, but in a Producer's-style twist, he ironically ensured that his films would be remembered forever. Some say Plan 9 is the worst film ever made. This is evidence that they've never watched many films. I could literally name 100 worse films right now. The reason? Wood had a passion that could not be tamed, and that life and energy still translates across the reel.The main message of the movie is a brilliant, but important one It doesn't matter how good you are at something. You're not wasting your time if it is what you love.

A recurring joke has that no one realises Lugosi is even alive, and certainly that Karloff is his superior, whom Lugosi doesn't seem at all bitter to. **** YOU!!!

Back then, I was fascinated by these terrible movies, which seemed to have a lot more fun in them than the good ones of the time period, some of which, however acclaimed, I do not care about. I didn't know about Wood's passions, his history, his relationships, and I could think of no better vassal than this film.Criminally ignored at the Box Office, despite the consolation of Critical Acclaim, and the first Oscar ever given to someone portraying a real life movie star, this is one of the films that runs the full kaleidoscope of human emotion, not the least of which is heart. Ed Wood lived to be a joke, and his inept films are a demonstration for that, though it is never cruel in the slightest towards him. Depp, in a performance that eats Jack Sparrow for breakfast, radiates a passion for his work that anyone who likes films can grasp instantly. He idolises his film stars, has posters in his ramshackle apartment, and talks about them all the time at worm. Added to this is Wood's battles with the studio system, wherein we now have an actual reason to root for him, whereas other movies would throw an obstacle at the protagonist without the audience given time or reason to like him. It may be cliché, but look at Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars Prequels. We don't care about him, so why should we care about his situation. Wood is the underdog, screwed over by the Hollywood system. Yet they have a point. He is fantastically terrible. And that is the main victory of the film. Despite knowing that he's crap, we still want to see the producers hand him money to make his dreams come true, despite it being a Box Office bomb in the making. Most other pictures would have had us rooting for the producers in that case, but here we root for the doomed path.

At this point, the special effects have been refined to look sharper and move smoother, and there are still some huge animatronics being employed. Thus, you get a lot of good-looking dinosaurs running loose chasing people all over the island. This includes the epic Spinosaurous, which makes its introduction by fighting and defeating a T-Rex in mortal combat. There are also raptors everywhere, which use more cunning than before to hunt down their prey. On top of that, there's also some Pteranodons in a giant bird cage (from a scene that was in the original novel but never used before). The dinosaur action is modestly satisfying and pretty fun.Unfortunately, the story leaves much to be desired. It is great to see Dr. Grant returning as the protagonist (and Dr. Sattler in a smaller role), but he winds up being surrounded by a bunch of the dumbest dorks imaginable. The whole plot revolves around an estranged and dippy couple that lost their son; they go so far as tricking and manipulating Grant and his protégé to the island. Once they all finally get there, it's just one dumb move after another, followed by lots of running and screaming. The film becomes a bit more endearing with the chase scenes, and the characters' human sides become apparent, but there are still some dumb things that happen that ruin all creditability (including watching a smartphone travel through a dinosaur's digestive system and somehow work underwater to relay an unintelligible message that somehow prompts the military to show up in the end...yeah right). Of all the faults with this film, however, the one thing that's always bothered me the most is that there's nothing new involved; it's just another island adventure with little connection to previous events, and nowhere else to go. The movie doesn't advance the arc of the series at all (though I haven't seen Jurassic World just yet, I have a feeling you can skip this one no problem), so it comes off as a mere throwaway adventure.This film has good-looking photography, including some decent POV shots. Editing is solid. Sam Neill is as fun to watch as ever. Laura Dern is barely in the movie; what little screen time she has is fine and dandy. William H. Macey and Téa Leoni are excellent at playing the dippiest characters imaginable; Trevor Morgan does a fine job in his role; all the mercenary characters are fun to watch, and everybody else is just peachy. Writing is pretty weak, and there's hardly any dialogue that stands out. This production uses decent-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects.

Following on the sweet, good natured fable that was the first Babe film, Miller delved into his creative well, pulled out all the stops and came up with a rip roaring, wondrously exciting sequel that outdoes the original in almost every way. The production design and sets alone are enough to make the film a winner, the titular city comprised of aspects of LA, New York, Sydney, Paris, Vegas and many more. It's every rural village's idea of what the cities are like, a gigantic metropolitan dream world of a creation. Miller starts, in a charming sequence, at Babe's humble beginnings on the picturesque, old world farmland and hurtles him on a madcap adventure in this city of cities, joined by some of his farmland friends (Ferdinand the duck and those adorable singing Mice, whose musical numbers here are hilarious), and sees him meet a whole host of new animals. This is where the magic of the film really takes hold, as we see hundreds of dogs, cats, multiple species of monkeys, and a hapless goldfish all come to amazingly realistic life courtesy of Miller and team. Each animal is beautifully voiced and given his or her own dignity, grace and absolutely grounded story arc to the point where this no longer just becomes a children's film, but a surrealist take on city life, moral hardships and personality and classist conflict as enacted by the national geographic channel. My favourites are the sinister German shepherd (of course voiced by a German dude), the wise old orangutan Thelonius who heartbreakingly won't leave a risky situation without putting his human clothes on, and the opera singing cats (laughed so hard). Mazda Szubenski deserves a medal for her physical comedy and tart, spry turn as the farmers wife, diligently pursuing babe and way in over her head. James Chromwell briefly reprises his wonderful Farmer Hoggett characters. Mickey Rooney, looking so old and delirious I'd be surprised if he knew what film he was working on, let alone what planet, has a demented cameo. But it's the animals show, and amongst all the cartoonish, wild goings on, there's the wonderful theme that a kind and steady heart can help you on your travels, which provides a touching, yet not preachy undercurrent.

I rate it 10\/10.This is an absolutely astonishing film in every way, a masterpiece. It doesn't miss a beat.This is clearly a very early full-fledged noir. However, it is actually more neo-noir than noir because of the depth of its themes and the breadth and intricacy of its story, touching on so many facets of the society and the people in it. I have the impression that noirs of the classic era tend to be more confined or restricted in focusing on individual persons and less on the social effects of criminality on broader numbers of people, whereas neo-noirs somewhat more frequently but certainly not always address systemic issues. That is why on this viewing of M, it seemed more modern than years of movies that followed it. Other movies like that would be Panique (1946) and Roma, Open City (1945). Lang's Fury (1936) is another example as is The Sound of Fury (1950). The Chase (1966) is an early neo-noir case.What we have here is an incredible production with direction by Fritz Lang that is off the map. Everything about this picture is meticulous, the sets, the casting of the extras and smaller parts, the use of both sound and silence, the camera shots, the buildings, the architectural lines, the smoking, the food, the everyday tasks, the intercutting of the deliberations of the officials and the criminals, the use of high shots to show the vulnerability of the little girls and again to show Lorre running like a trapped animal in the street. The whole way that the sets look convey a cleanliness and an order that are belied by the human tragedies that are occurring. There is scarcely any scene that is not a work of art one way or another. The final monologue of Peter Lorre is unbelievably well-acted and completely convincing. The script delves deeply into the various attitudes toward the child murderer, without providing a ready made answer.M carries on the mass theme from Metropolis. Mobs are a symbol of mass culture, and there are other such symbols abundantly in the movie such as mass murder itself, the pressures on both police and criminals to dispense with rule of law, the similarity of police and criminals, the fascination and fears of the crowds reading the latest news, all reading the same reports, and especially the total mobilization of the city in an effort to apprehend the killer. The Threepenny Opera also had a form of mass mobilization, and so did Emil and the Detectives (co-scripted by Billy Wilder). It's all-out war.There are also surveillance and individuals spying on one another. Anonymity and not knowing others in the city encourages this and suspicion as everyone is a stranger and possibly culpable. It encourages the formation of a mob or crowd behavior in which each person is anonymous. The formation of such a mob by the criminals at the end is very interesting as at first we are shown the varying reactions -- even sympathies -- of individuals but then they are whipped into a frenzy by the head man and converge to kill Lorre. Their individual reactions vanish and they act as one. M is prophetic for our times regarding mass control. Abundant examples exist in which leaders propagate stories and propaganda that move masses and gain acceptance for their policies, here and elsewhere.Fritz Lang's camera is somehow intensely narrative in this movie. It constantly spies and reveals, participating in the surveillance and making us into voyeurs up to a point. It's imperfect.

It constantly spies and reveals, participating in the surveillance and making us into voyeurs up to a point. It's imperfect. People escape the net of eyes and ears, which is too difficult to maintain. Ironically, a blind beggar holds the key to a whistled refrain.

Henry (Ray Liotta) was born into a working class family in Brooklyn, New York. Henry knew from an early age that he wanted more out of life than simply struggling to make ends meet. When, as a teenager, he had the opportunity to run errands for the Lucchese crime family as a means of earning money, he immediately got a taste of the life he so desperately wanted to lead. Henry dropped out of school to begin working for the Lucchese crime family full-time. After his first arrest, Henry learned the most important rule of living life as a mobster Never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut. Henry quickly made his way through the ranks of the Lucchese crime family, and became very successful in his new career. Henry eventually spends time in prison, and ends up getting involved in a side business of selling drugs, which went against the wishes of the Lucchese crime boss, Paulie (Paul Sorvino). In the end, Henry is forced to turn against his crime family, and leave the mob life that he always wanted to lead in order to save his own life. Goodfellas depicts the rise and downfall of Henry's mob career, and the demise of his way of life.The theme of Goodfellas is a focus on the character development of Henry Hill, and his desire to live life as a rich and successful gangster. The storyline is presented as a linear flashback of Henry's life, narrated by Henry himself. Henry believed that being a gangster was better than being the President of the United States. It was the only thing that he ever wanted to do. Henry believed that being a gangster would allow him to achieve the highest level of success that he valued most respect. Henry wanted desperately to be &#x85;a somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies. The desire to have the respect of those around him was Henry's motivation to become a gangster.Henry admired the mob boss, Paulie, for the respect that he garnered &#x96; the respect that Henry so desperately wanted to attain. Henry began working at the cabstand and the Pizzeria that Paulie owned, and worked through the ranks of the Mob's organization, from parking cars, to making deliveries, to carrying out important tasks. Henry liked the respect he received from others in the neighborhood due to his association with top gangsters. He stated, People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morning&#x85;the owner knew who I was, and no matter how many people were in line, I was taken care of first. Henry's motivation was the respect that he earned in being a gangster.Henry's compulsive desire for money, social status, and success led him to start a side business of drug dealing, which was something that Paulie strictly forbade, and went against his family. Eventually, Henry gets busted for dealing drugs, and the police have enough evidence of his involvement with drug dealing that he is looking at a life sentence in prison with no parole. Paulie becomes angry because Henry had lied to him and disobeyed his command to stop the drug business. Paulie tells Henry that he has to turn his back on him, meaning that his relationship with the Lucchese crime family is over. Knowing that he, Karen, and their children are marked targets, Henry saw no other choice but to break his trust with the Lucchese crime family and enter the witness protection program so he could divulge information about his dealings with the mob. If he didn't, Henry knew it would just be a matter of time before he and his family were killed. In the end, Henry lost his trust with the people he had worked with for a lifetime, and was forced to turn his back on them, and more importantly, the life he loved the most. He was forced to break the most important rule in the life of a mobster &#x96; never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.The use of cinematic techniques help to define Henry's character throughout the movie, and support the theme of the rise and fall of Henry's mob career. Director, Martin Scorsese, used unique camera angles to show the development of Henry's character, and the rise of Henry's mobster status. In the first scene that reveals an adult Henry, the camera angle is shooting Henry from the bottom, looking upward, giving Henry the appearance that he is larger than life, and has been raised to mobster status. Another cinematic technique used to further develop Henry's character is through the viewer gaining insight into Henry's internal actions. The entire film is told through Henry's perspective, and the viewer has insight into Henry's deepest thoughts about his own actions and the actions of those around him.Goodfellas is a study in how Henry's greed and desire for status and respect ultimately leads to his downfall. For Henry, even harder than breaking trust and turning against his crime family, was the loss of the way of life he had become so accustomed to, as Henry states in the final sceneThe hardest thing for me was to have to leave the life. I still love the life&#x85;And now, it's all over&#x85;.There's no action &#x96; I have to wait around like everyone else&#x85; I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.Henry lost everything he had ever wanted out of life.

Basically in Berlin, Germany, a number of child abductions and murders have been taking place, wanted posters are all over the place to find the psychopathic killer, this man lures his child victims with candy, balloons and other child-friendly items. The most substantial evidence the police, led by Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke), have collected are hand written letters from the killer himself, to be published by the press in newspapers, and also a Blind Panhandler (Georg John) who sold a man a balloon to a child remembers hearing key information to identify the killer, the man whistles Edvard Grieg's In The Hall of the Mountain King, from the 'Peer Gynt' Suite I Op. 46 while luring the children. The police are not getting anywhere fast, as members of the paranoid public are tipping them about any person seen and quickly accused of being suspicious, but also criminals are taking the case into their own hands, wanting to catch the killer themselves while the police are straining their ability of conducting criminal activities. The killer himself, Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is a self-loathing man, on the occasion the blind beggar recognised his whistling, he passes a message and gets a man to mark on Beckert's back the letter M with chalk (this stands for Mörder, meaning murderer in German), he eventually realises he is being followed, but gets caught by the criminals hiding in a building. Beckert in a criminal court room scenario is put on trial, in a passionate monologue he explains that his urges compelled him to commit murders, which he regrets, the other criminals break the law by choice, and he pleads to be handed over to the police. The enraged mob are about to kill Beckert, but the police arrive to arrest him and the other criminals, Beckert is taken to a real courtroom where five judges will pass judgement, but the sentence is not seen, instead it cuts to many crying parents to murdered children before fading to black. Also starring Gustaf Gründgens as Safecracker\/Safebreaker, Theo Lingen as Con Man, Inge Landgut as child Elsie Beckmann, Ellen Widmann as mother Frau Beckmann, Fritz Odemar as The Cheater, Theodor Loos as Inspector Groeber, Paul Kemp as Pickpocket with Six Watches, Friedrich Gnass as burglar Franz, Franz Stein as Minister and Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur as Police Chief. Lorre was best known playing sinister snivelling characters like parody, here he is genuinely rather menacing who catches and kills children, following his captures with chilling whistling. I admit the film was a little all over the place at times, especially with the concept of both police and criminals searching for the guilty man, but this being Lang's first talking picture is clever in its use of sound, from the clicking of a knife to crowd scenes, and of course the whistling, it is definitely one to be seen as a masterpiece, a great classic crime drama.

He will need help though as Clermont is thirty miles behind the German lines. The rest of his platoon are soon persuaded to join in; they are fed up of risking their lives for Uncle Sam; they want to do something for themselves for a change. They will need support though; this comes in the form of three Sherman tanks under the command of the distinctly odd 'Oddball'. It won't be easy; before they can get their hands on the gold they will have to pass through the front line, pass through thirty miles of enemy territory and finally deal with the German's in the town and their three Tiger tanks.This is a fun film; nicely combining a war movie with a heist movie to give us a really entertaining time. Clint Eastward puts in a solid performance as Kelly and Telly Savalas is equally good as his sergeant 'Big Joe' however it is Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Oddball that is the most memorable; he gives us a great character; a hippy long before there were hippies!

That isn't to say that nobody dies; a few good guys and dozens of Germans are gunned down or blown up; the ratio may be more than a bit unlikely but this was never meant to be taken that seriously. As well as action there are plenty of laughs to be had along the way. If you are a fan of any of the main stars this is a must see and I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a war movie that isn't too serious; the PG rating means it can be enjoyed by all apart from young children.

If you are a fan of any of the main stars this is a must see and I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting a war movie that isn't too serious; the PG rating means it can be enjoyed by all apart from young children.

Not the first, and certainly not the second. Just this one that I am reviewing. This came first just before I saw the first one being brought back in 2013 in 3D. With that said, the movie is about Alan Grant who is a survivor from the first one as he is still studying dinosaurs as he has been offered by a couple to be their tour guide as he brings Billy along, and things turned out to be a set up. They pretty much kidnapped him for his help to find their lost son, Eric who has been missing for eight weeks. So they go out to find their son, and try to get back home. This whole premise as you are reading really does play out like a B movie as you may have seen in any other movies that carries the same scenario. I first once did like this movie, but as time goes by it doesn't hold up really well. I don't hate it, but I don't consider this to be the absolute worst. I say it is the weakest, but not the worst of the worst. What is good and bad about this movie? The good is that it is really nice to have Sam Neill come back as he does give a good performance, and pretty much the best character in the movie. The other cast all did fine, but there was nothing much to root for. I can like two or three characters, but the others were just there. The music by Don Davis is very well scored as it does have some of that Jurassic Park feeling. The special effects are again like the second film, where they are parts that look slightly dated but for the most part they are really good. It has some neat actions, but nothing much to say about. The bad is that I don't think Joe Johnston does a good on making the movie. He did okay, but he just keeps missing on the boat. Also, the pacing is only an hour and a half long. When I first saw this movie, I was like Really? That's it? It just leaves me to wanting more, because it needed more action and excitements. The story is what it is, and never I find it original. In spite of some of the issues that I had, I can still watch it as a time waster and I can't hate it because I grew up with it. Overall, the movie was okay. I know many people can like this one over the second, but I can take the second one over this because there is so much to like while this one may have its moments but its just not that good. You can decide whether you want a Jurassic Park movie that is directed by Steven Spielberg or just go by at a quicker pace; it is all up to you. To me, I just want a good movie. So, in conclusion, Jurassic Park III is by far my least favorite, but it is indeed watchable. I give it a 6 out of 10.
