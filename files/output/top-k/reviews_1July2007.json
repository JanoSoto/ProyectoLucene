The supporting cast is very good as well, perhaps the worst performance being that of Talia Shire, who is still alright.The two storyline thing is fine. It worked, and it worked well.

I don't get tired of watching it and that says a bunch about the quality of the movie.Since so many people have written about the intriguing interplay between science and religion with its hopefulness themes, I thought I would bring up some more of the nuts and bolts aspects of this movie that were mostly great as well.Lets start with film editing and sound editing. That delicate theme song of the 9 year old Elli with were father is literally perfect, and I don't give praise easily. When the scene shifts to present day with the same notes but done in an orchestra setting to emphazise growth and maturity, it flows seamlessly. The night sounds at the Aracebo observatory are beautifully subdued but still noticeable even with the hum of computer fans droning along. More examples of great music and sound are as follows The heavy sad notes that surround the heart attack scene. They are impactful to the scene but are timed to move on to the next scene of morning in which lots of more subtle sounds are used.Rustling of leaves a quiet moment and and a final short dirge to end it. My overarching theme here is how the director and sound editor let the music be a subtle accent rather then an overpowering guide to the key action or emotional moments. Of course the pulsing violins during the big action scene at the VLA New Mexico is the creme de la creme. It activates a short burst of excitement and just flows perfectly and then cuts out all together when Elli enters the control room. This gives me a sense of believable reality in which the action is carried on by the scientific process of discovery so well acted by Elli's team. Finally the sounds of the machine are completely believable, and peak with the point where the machine reaches its maximum velocity. Then the base music sounds indicating power come in for added impact. The effect is line with which Carl Sagen would have liked, that being complete humbleness around an exponentially advanced technology.I could go into other nuts and bolts but I have to do some other things so I will say that this movie is a very watchable movie. Its just plain great entertainment that asks more intelligent questions then most movies. The action and special effects are first rate as well. Robert Zemeckis is a top talent as far as I'm concerned so I'll keep popping it in the DVD player every few months for another great ride.

It exploits fully the fantastical possibilities that film-making opens up. Right from the word go the story barrels along, keeping pace with Jack's truck, and never eases up even for a moment.Now I'm older of course and have purchased the DVD so I can revel in its delights whenever I want, I'm able to better appreciate Carpenter's intentions with the project. It's basically an experiment to see what would happen if you dropped a John Wayne archetype into a more traditional kung-fu movie. Personally I gain the most enjoyment from Burton's bluff machismo... and the fact that it doesn't seem incongruous that he should call a spirit who is hundreds of years old Dave... (also my name)Virtually everything that takes place has an ever present tongue-in-cheek slant applied to it, and that, I think, is what makes it so easy to sit back and enjoy proceedings. You know that it's only goal is to entertain you, and trust me, it does a great job in that regard.

To us, crime can even sound like fun, and so can criminals. This film is about a poor man who sells his bedsheets as a last resort to afford the bicycle he needs as a requirement for his new job. On his first day, a thief steals his bicycle, and if he doesn't get it back, he will be fired. He has an innocent, sensitive young son to take care of. He has a wife who worries constantly.The movie is not just realistic, and made to show us reality. It's about a certain part of reality that society disguises in gloss.

Director Robert Aldrich fought against that rating for years--he thought it deserved an R. It was re rated to an R in 1972. I remember it played here in Boston for months on end.

It was just as weird as it was in the 1980's. It's not my imagination.Veteran character actor Mike Kellin (the only name I recognized in the cast) concludes a lengthy career playing the director of a summer camp that's a little short of paradise. After the very strange Angela comes to camp with her cousin things start getting really nasty and the corpses start accumulating, but the camp stays open. Why? Two compelling reasons. The camp's owners want the money, and if they shut it down and sent everyone home the movie would have been twenty minutes long.This is as unpleasant a group of foulmouthed youngsters as you'll find this side of SOUTH PARK. And when the slaughter starts in earnest nobody is spared the psycho's wrath some very young children are killed. Offscreen, sure, but it was still a shock.And the ending- which I'm not going to reveal even though most people posting on this board take it for granted that everyone has seen the film- is a prize. That last shot of the killer was a shocker twenty years ago and, even knowing that it's coming, still packs a punch.What's most surprising about the film, though, is that the people who made it didn't go on to bigger things. There's a lot of raw talent at work here. Even with a small budget the movie looks and sounds professionally made.But that's how Hollywood works. Everyone involved in EVAN ALMIGHTY, which cost $175 million to make and is emptying theatres faster than a fire alarm, will go on to bigger projects because they worked on a $175 million movie. The people who made THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which cost almost nothing and made money hand over fist, go nowhere because they worked on such a small project.William Goldman said it best.

It was just as weird as it was in the 1980's. It's not my imagination.Veteran character actor Mike Kellin (the only name I recognized in the cast) concludes a lengthy career playing the director of a summer camp that's a little short of paradise. After the very strange Angela comes to camp with her cousin things start getting really nasty and the corpses start accumulating, but the camp stays open. Why? Two compelling reasons. The camp's owners want the money, and if they shut it down and sent everyone home the movie would have been twenty minutes long.This is as unpleasant a group of foulmouthed youngsters as you'll find this side of SOUTH PARK. And when the slaughter starts in earnest nobody is spared the psycho's wrath some very young children are killed. Offscreen, sure, but it was still a shock.And the ending- which I'm not going to reveal even though most people posting on this board take it for granted that everyone has seen the film- is a prize. That last shot of the killer was a shocker twenty years ago and, even knowing that it's coming, still packs a punch.What's most surprising about the film, though, is that the people who made it didn't go on to bigger things.
