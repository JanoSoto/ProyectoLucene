The most amazing scene for me involves two twins, unaware of each other's existence (both played by Saffron Burrows), who one day cross paths with each other in an airport. The set up is stunning. This scene begs the question if you met up with another version of yourself, a version with a different background & different formative events --would you even be recognizable to yourself? Would you be able to relate to that other you as a person? How much have the events in our lives formed us, and how much really is biological? The only quarrel with this film I have is a series of scenes in which Mr. Figgis employed a slow fade-in\/fade-out method. This was very eye-painful to watch, the fade is at such a rate you feel as though you are just slow-blinking before falling asleep. Thankfully, this is only done briefly in the film.

I rented in on VHS, and am now buying it (DVD for the soundtrack control). I watched the film twice over, and caught so many more things the second time than the first. The first part of the viewing you spend trying to figure out how all these characters connect to each other, and then you relax into the flow of them popping in and out of various corners of the screen. Amazing timing ...just Amazing timing for one-take. Julian Sands' entire purpose in the film seems to be to distract the other actors and see if they get lost. This makes his background-character entertaining. I found myself backing the film up several times in certain places because as I was paying attension one thing, I suddenly realized the scene was slowly changing in another corner and I was like wait a minute...what's happening over _there_..?. Over-all, the four simultanious corners of action are not that hard to follow. Mike Figgis uses sound to take you every place you need to go to figure out what is happening. I found the performances of Jeanne Tripplehorn and Saffron Burrows particulary well done. Both are on screen through most of the film and keep up character perfectly.   Not a film for people who do not like to use their mind while watching. Mike Figgis does not spoon-feed his viewers (thank you). All in all very inventive and well done !

You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce's characters' (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.In this film Lenny takes snapshots to remember who people are, where he now lives, his car, everything. As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses. The difference between this film and Wintersleepers however is that Memento is entirely from Lenny's perspective. This therefore creates an imaginative, creatively unsurpassable film. The film begins where it should end, so far so trite, but here's the beauty, we, like Guy Pearce, learn in fragments what's going on. It is therefore perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who did what, who's doing what and why. The beauty of this film though is that my interpretation could be so different from yours, and neither of us could be sure whose interpretation is the right one; if there is a right one at all. Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. Another beauty of this film is the way it is filmed and edited. Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it. It's just like holding ten different and linearly distinct Polaroids in your hand and having a short-term memory disorder. Excellent.I'm not even sure if watching it again will make things any less ambiguous, but then who cares? The ambiguity is what makes this a great film, if it wasn't so cut up, or from Lenny's perspective it would be both very short and trite; and lacking in tension, suspense and interest. But as it stands it has all three, isn't trite and says so much about humanity. Oh, and the plot? It really doesn't matter, all you need to know is that everything about this film is indicative of the subjectivity of memory, of our experiences and interpretations of all that happens to us. Nothing will seem as black and white as it did beforehand. It will make you question every memory you have, almost as much as possessing a psychology degree, as I do! So, go and see it be confused, acknowledge the frailty of all you know to be true, and then imagine the freedom of actually being Lenny, and then the horror of having nothing, nothing but the reliance of a pen and a Polaroid camera to know who you are.

Snatch does that as well.  Most of us have very different lives.  We all punch the clock, go to work, play with the dog, watch sports and whatever else it is that we do during our day.  But in Guy Ritchie's labrynthian like tail, no one is normal.  No one does things that the rest of us would do.  They are all bound by the Tarantinoesque laws of fiction.  And those laws dictate that if there is trouble to find, they find it and if there is a situation that calls for impropriety, it is here, in this film.Snatch is a lot of fun.  When you inhabit a world that shares it's space with guys like Bullet Tooth Tony, Doug The Head, One Punch Mickey, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris The Blade, Turkish, Brick Top and Cousin Avi, you can't help but to have fun.  The story is quite complicated and by the time you figure out exactly what is going on, a different angle to the story is introduced.  But in some way or another, every member of this story is involved in one way or another, with a diamond that has 84 carats to it.  Frankie Four Fingers steals it, Boris the Blade wants it, so does cousin Avi as does does Bullet Tooth Tony.  Turkish gets messed up in it somehow and then so does BrickTop, which brings in One Punch Mickey.  Confused, you ain't seen nothing yet.  What it comes down to though is that you don't really have to know exactly who fits where in the story.  I stopped keeping track of everyones importance about a third of the way through the film.  I was having too much fun.  Once again we are treated to Benetio Del Toro's mastery of accents as this time he brandishes a Turkish\/Russian\/Arabian accent.

A friend of mine once called her the sexiest woman alive, but to me she seems like a mini with a trailer hitch made for a semi truck. She's not bad looking by any means, but really, are her looks worth the one billion dollars she has insured it for? Anyway I digress. As you probably know from the deluge of trailers flooding your television, The Wedding Planner is the new romantic comedy staring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Lopez plays Mary, a Wedding Planner so good that she makes as much business for her firm as all the other wedding planners put together times five. She's also a total neat freak and organizer, a person who folds her shirts and blouses around a piece of sheet plastic to keep them flat. She might plan weddings but her own heart was broken when her fiance screwed her over. She meets Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey) when he saves her life. They then proceed to go out on a sort of date and he fails to mention that he is getting married in three months. Of course it turns out that his wedding is being planned by Mary (what a shock) and it is also the most important job of her career. Most of this is straight from the trailer, no surprises. And for the most part that is the way that the rest of the movie goes, no surprises. I find it interesting that Lopez would choose a project like this however, because while not all of her movies are all that great, most of them are interesting and challenge norms (think The Cell, Out of Sight or U-Turn not Anaconda). The unfortunate thing about The Wedding Planner is that there are a lot of good character interactions here, but they are diverted and pushed aside because the female lead has to get together with the male lead in the end. The relationship between Dr. Steve and his fiance Fran (played by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras whom you may remember as Sonya in Mortal Kombat) is portrayed quite well. Although the problems in Fran and Steve's relationship are subtle and not given enough screen time,  some of their scenes near the end of the movie work quite well. Along those same lines Massimo (played by Justin Chambers) does a good job endearing himself on the audience as the other man in Mary's life. By the end of the film you are quite ready to root for him over Dr. Steve. The romance between Steve and Mary however is quite a bit different. I never really saw the spark between the two of them. All I came away from the romantic scenes between the leads was that Steve wasn't ready to get married to Fran. The only real surprise is that, contrary to its assembly line style formula, there are quite a few funny scenes in The Wedding Planner. In fact, except for some of the labored romance scenes between Lopez and McConaughey almost every scene has some funny moments in it. Especially good in their roles as comic relief are Fran's parents played by Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough. Also Mary's friends in her Scrabble club lend a few funny moments. While I certainly wasn't busting my gut laughing, the comedy made me forget about the tepid romance through most of the movie. So should you see this movie? Well, if you're hard up for a date movie, and don't mind some gratuitously placed Lopez music, go for it. The slightly above average comedy makes the so-so romance bearable. But only go to this one as a last resort, there are plenty of good movies in the theaters right now and nine to twelve bucks is a lot to spend on slightly above average comedy.

Although the problems in Fran and Steve's relationship are subtle and not given enough screen time,  some of their scenes near the end of the movie work quite well. Along those same lines Massimo (played by Justin Chambers) does a good job endearing himself on the audience as the other man in Mary's life. By the end of the film you are quite ready to root for him over Dr. Steve. The romance between Steve and Mary however is quite a bit different. I never really saw the spark between the two of them. All I came away from the romantic scenes between the leads was that Steve wasn't ready to get married to Fran. The only real surprise is that, contrary to its assembly line style formula, there are quite a few funny scenes in The Wedding Planner. In fact, except for some of the labored romance scenes between Lopez and McConaughey almost every scene has some funny moments in it. Especially good in their roles as comic relief are Fran's parents played by Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough. Also Mary's friends in her Scrabble club lend a few funny moments. While I certainly wasn't busting my gut laughing, the comedy made me forget about the tepid romance through most of the movie. So should you see this movie? Well, if you're hard up for a date movie, and don't mind some gratuitously placed Lopez music, go for it. The slightly above average comedy makes the so-so romance bearable. But only go to this one as a last resort, there are plenty of good movies in the theaters right now and nine to twelve bucks is a lot to spend on slightly above average comedy.

A friend of mine once called her the sexiest woman alive, but to me she seems like a mini with a trailer hitch made for a semi truck. She's not bad looking by any means, but really, are her looks worth the one billion dollars she has insured it for? Anyway I digress. As you probably know from the deluge of trailers flooding your television, The Wedding Planner is the new romantic comedy staring Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey. Lopez plays Mary, a Wedding Planner so good that she makes as much business for her firm as all the other wedding planners put together times five. She's also a total neat freak and organizer, a person who folds her shirts and blouses around a piece of sheet plastic to keep them flat. She might plan weddings but her own heart was broken when her fiance screwed her over. She meets Dr. Steve Edison (McConaughey) when he saves her life. They then proceed to go out on a sort of date and he fails to mention that he is getting married in three months. Of course it turns out that his wedding is being planned by Mary (what a shock) and it is also the most important job of her career. Most of this is straight from the trailer, no surprises. And for the most part that is the way that the rest of the movie goes, no surprises. I find it interesting that Lopez would choose a project like this however, because while not all of her movies are all that great, most of them are interesting and challenge norms (think The Cell, Out of Sight or U-Turn not Anaconda). The unfortunate thing about The Wedding Planner is that there are a lot of good character interactions here, but they are diverted and pushed aside because the female lead has to get together with the male lead in the end.

After all, this was a movie so scary that you weren't actually allowed to watch it.There were always stories going round about it; when it was first released, people fainted in the cinemas, one woman had a miscarriage because she was so scared...  But the Chinese Whispers don't represent the movie at all.  The Exorcist is not the scariest movie ever made.  For a lot of it, I was trying not to laugh.The first hour or so was great, genuinely unsettling and creepy.  Noises in the attic, and candle flames rising up then going out made for a tense build-up.  But once Linda Blair's possession became more obvious the movie lost its ability to scare and became only laughable.This fault lies not so much with the movie but with me.  As an atheist it's impossible for me to be scared of the devil because I don't believe in him.  This doesn't come from small-mindedness; Luke Skywalker doesn't really live in a galaxy far, far away but I can still love the Star Wars movies, but films that deal with religion can't be seen in the same way because they believe they're telling the truth.  This isn't a fantasy, this kind of thing really happens!  People get possessed, the devil is evil, and only God can stop him.  That's laughable to me, and that is inescapable.I know Christians who are so scared by the concept of this film they don't even like to talk about it, let alone watch it.  I envy their fear, because it would have made for a great horror movie.  As it was, it was nothing.  The church is laughable and outdated to me, and so too was The Exorcist.Moments such as the possessed girl masturbating with a cross should have been shocking, but I thought they were great.  It put a smile on my face to know how many religious people would be offended and outraged.  Freedom of speech is forgotten when it comes to religion in England we still have a blasphemy law; there are no atheist programmes on Sunday mornings in amongst the Christian shows.  Atheism is always under-represented because it is seen to be offensive, so blasphemy is always refreshing when it is finally voiced.

His insults were great, coming up with the ultimate `your mother' joke.  The pea soup vomit is embarrassingly fake and the shaking bed looked like something from the Fun House at the end of Grease.  I hate saying that dated effects can ruin a movie, but they really do this one no favours at all.  Any credibility that may have remained was lost.Despite these criticisms, I can't say that The Exorcist is a bad film.  It didn't work on me, but I know why, and I understand why so many people would see this as the scariest movie ever made.  Even with its technical flaws this must be terrifying to people who believe in the Evil that takes over Linda Blair.

While the ending of the Sixth Sense completely made the entire film, and totally blew me out of the theatre, I saw the ending of Unbreakable coming from a mile away.  It tried TOO hard to be shocking and it didn't do the film justice. The rest of the movie, however, was beautifully filmed and had a very powerful underlying message.  The most moving scenes are when Willis' character realizes who he is, what his powers are and what his role in society is meant to be.  This is a very character driven movie.  For those movie watchers who thrive on eye candy and action sequences, you will be sadly disappointed.  For those movie watchers who balk at the idea of a plot that could not possibly happen in real life, you too should avoid this film.  This movie requires you to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself entirely in a fantasy world where the impossible is possible.  That being said, the film is worthy of a viewing.  It leaves you with something to think about and may give you a new outlook on the concept of a real life hero.  I'm still not 100 percent sure what I thought of this movie, but I am 99 percent sure that I thought highly enough of it to comment favourably and give it a recommendation.  A unique addition to Shyamalan's resume.

Needless to say, it was a 120 minute countdown until the final curtain was finally drawn.The symbols shown throughout the movie are bizarre, and they don't really ever show up again.  I won't go through them to spoil the actual story, but if you see something early in the movie that you may think is important to the plot, don't worry, it won't be.  You can usually completely forget the scene you just saw, because it doesn't really have any bearing on the rest of the movie.On the level of pure scifi, it was an even worse movie.  One of the great ideas behind Star Trek is the believability of the technology.  Even if we cannot build a transporter or a teleporting pad, we the audience have an idea of how they work.  This is one of the great strengths of star trek, it's accessibility.  Battlefield Earth throws out many fancy gadgets, but tells you nothing about them, or it shows many other items which have been lying around for about 1000 years, and they still have power.

It was only a couple of years ago that I sat in the theater against my better judgment and watched Nick Nolte get afflicted in his movie Affliction.  It seems to happen once every few years.  A-list actors do small pictures as a favour or as a way to try to garner some Oscar consideration.  I'm not sure which one this was, probably the first, but whatever the reason Jack took this is not a noble enough reason to make anyone sit through this film.  This story could have been told in about a half an hour.  There was not enough material in here to garner a 100 minute film.  The way it was turned into a standard length film was with a lot of fancy camera work that added at least an extra fifteen minutes to the film and the rest was just window dressing.  This is the kind of film that oozes at a snails pace and asks its audience to maintain an interest, when there is nothing there to hold that interest.  Sean Penn may be a good director, I don't know, but he certainly hasn't shown me anything with this film.Jack plays Detective Jerry Black who is retiring and is at a retirement party thrown by the department.  In a very well done scene, simultaneously, a young boy sees a scared looking Native American run out of the bushes.  The young boy wanders off to take a look.  This is the dead of winter in Nevada and the boy has to go through knee deep snow to find that of a seven year old girl that has been raped and murdered.  The police are called upon to investigate and Jerry asks if he can go along, even though he has six hours until retirement.  Jerry then has the dauntless task of informing the parents that their daughter has been killed.  Once at the parents farm he makes a promise, the Pledge that the title refers to, to the mother and to God himself that he will find the killer.  Soon thereafter, they pick up the Indian seen at the site of the murder and the police think they can get a confession out of the man in record time.  His priors reads like a grocery list so the potential is there.  The confession does come from him but he doesn't seem to lucid to what is being asked of him and then soon thereafter he kills himself.  Case closed, but Jack has second thoughts.  He does some digging and finds that in the last ten years there have been three cases that sound similar to this one and thinks that it is the same person.  But no one buys it and Jack moves off and buys a gas station where he meets a young woman who has a daughter and they seem to fall in love and then at the end..... well, read the other reviews in here.  It's the same thing.  The story sounds good but it is executed very poorly.  I didn't believe any of the characters.  I didn't buy any of them doing what they did.  The film moves too slowly and there are so many fillers that it is impossible to get any momentum going.The Pledge is one of those films that is supposed to be categorized as 'ambitious' and 'important' and 'worthy' and not a 'sell out'.  What all that really means is that it is boring, tedious and gets recognition from deteriorating film critics like Roger Ebert because it is Sean Penn.  Penn may have been one of the best actors of his generation but that does not automatically catapult him into the likes of Tartantino and Stone and Spielberg.  You have to pay your dues and every once in a while make a film that people care about.  This is not that film.1 out of 10- This is a bad film and one to avoid at all costs.

The true wisdom of the film can be discovered only by listening to the poetic lines that Yun-Fat Chow cleverly intersperses into his conversations, pearls that must be sought after. The struggle is transformed into a song which IS the movie, constructed in the same way that chinese legends had been told for ten thousand generations. The cultural gap between the west and the orient will make this task much harder to perform, but when truly deciphered, the movie takes on a completely different form.While the story itself is sung to the audience, the brilliantly coordinated fight-scenes weave it together to create a complete entity.
