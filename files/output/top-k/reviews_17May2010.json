Very few big budget Hollywood films can say they leave a lot of room for discussion after the screen goes black and the credits begin to roll. This film brings to life John Grisham's novel of the same title A Time to Kill. The film is also well done as far as imagery and performances from actors. The dialog by the characters is so well done.My personal reactions to the film are split. On the one hand, I am very sympathetic toward Carl Lee and his family. I can't say I wouldn't do the same if I had a young daughter like his that was raped by two drunken lowlifes. In many ways, I cannot say that what Carl Lee did was wrong. Those two boys that hurt his daughter deserved what they got, and the justice system in place where they committed this crime would have greatly and unfairly favored their case.At the same time, from a legal standpoint, as well as from a moral standpoint, I cannot condone Carl Lee's actions. He should have been convicted, because letting a man be acquitted of murder, no matter what the circumstances are, is very devastating to precedents in the criminal justice system. It is true that nothing ever justifies one human being killing another. I am a believer that if the criminal justice system does not hold people accountable for their actions, that God always does. On a person's Judgement Day, the day he\/she dies, he\/she is finally brought to justice and finally held accountable for his\/her failures as a human being&#x97;failures that he\/she has not repented for and felt truly sorry for.But, I digress. This film is rich in statements about society today even, as well as the criminal justice system. Society is still divided racially, and in so many different ways, now. The criminal justice system is seemingly too subject to human emotion as opposed to reason, and it has been that way for so long. Why? It is subject to human eyes, and this film very emphatically states that fact that is also a truth. The success of this film can likely be attributed to its time of release as well. It was released pretty much on the heels of the fallacy that was the verdict O.J. Simpson received in his trial for murder. (Yes, I believe very strongly O.J. was guilty.)At the same time, this film is well casted. A lot of times, big Hollywood films with big all star casts seem to be very much for the purpose of getting people into theaters to watch a movie that is otherwise mediocre. This film is very much different in that it is well casted and well acted. Matthew McConaughey is very powerful as Jake Brigance, a young charismatic lawyer looking to make his big break. Samuel L. Jackson is stellar as Carl Lee Hailey, a blue collar working father and husband that works day by day to try and support his family. Sandra Bullock is exemplary as Ellen Roark, a young woman fresh out of law school wanting to have some impact and looking to get her foot in the door as well, and make a name for herself having been somewhat in the shadow of her father, a very wealthy aristocrat. She works to help Jake in his case, despite their differing views. Kevin Spacey is excellent as the District Attorney Rufus Buckley, an adamant political figure who is not above bending regulations to win a case. Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Brenda Fricker, Oliver Platt and Charles S. Dutton are just a few more names of an extremely strong supporting cast, and they all shine brightly in this film. In the very few films such as this, I always look for somewhat of a wild card performance from a supporting actor\/actress that I know nothing about or have seen very little of. That wild card performance comes from Patrick McGoohan as the aptly-named Judge Omar Noose. Noose is very much on the side of the prosecution, and the way he is portrayed in the film is rather indiscreet from his long curly gray hair, half moon spectacles, to his very strong bias against the defense and his plantation home where he has black servants. The imagery that stood out mostly to me was a subtle one. For much of the film, the lighting along with the constant sheen of sweat that everyone seems to have on their foreheads is something that suggests the racial tension really coming to a boil. Finally, on the last day of the case, the day of summation and the delivery of the verdict, that sheen that everyone has from the thick muggy air of the Deep South is gone foreshadowing to anyone who hasn't read the book perhaps?It's an incredible film that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a good film that can both provide the drama that someone needs, or provide a point of discussion for an intellect. I give it 10\/10 stars.

Reading the reviews from the film's 1993 release, critics seemed to be ticked off mostly by the fact that the film depicted a seemingly trivial demographic in a horrific time and place. Their argument was understandable if such mass genocide and political corruption was taking place, why would we want to know about German teenagers who were obsessed with American swing music? My question is, why would we NOT want to know about them?Had Swing Kids been released some time after Steven Spielberg's epic Schindler's List, critics may not have been quick to bring up that point. However, Cabaret (1972) was also about Berlin counterculture amidst the rise of the Nazi party, and no one seemed to have a problem with that film.Swing Kids is by no means a perfect film, but it also shouldn't be dismissed specifically because it doesn't take place in a concentration camp, and no one can be seen being tortured or killed. It's a small footnote, but by no means an uninteresting story.The movie centers around Peter Muller (Robert Sean Leonard, who I couldn't help but think bore a striking resemblance to Jim Carrey in this movie), a German student barely out of his teens who, along with his friends Thomas (Christian Bale) and Arvid (Frank Whaley), love to stay out late and dance to big band swing music. They wear their hair long, own zoot suits, and are rebellious against the Nazis at first for rebellion's sake. They don't seem to be phased by the Nazi's propaganda against the Jews and other ethnicities until later in the film, although that point is not clarified well in the beginning.Peter reluctantly joins the Nazis when his mother's significant other, Herr Major Knopp (Kenneth Branagh), pulls some strings after Peter's arrest involving a stolen radio. His other option is to be sent to jail, or perhaps even a concentration camp. Thomas enlists as well just to join Peter, but they ultimately don't give up their night life of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller. However, the more Peter learns about the Nazis, the more he hates them. Thomas, on the other hand, falls into the Nazi propaganda over time.The overall story is told pretty well here. Robert Sean Leonard is good as the moral compass of the story. Nowadays, I'm used to seeing Christian Bale in either villainous roles (American Psycho (2000), The Prestige (2006)), or as heroes with a noticeable dark side (The Dark Knight (2008), Terminator Salvation (2009)). However, here Bale plays a guy who is a genuinely good friend at first, and his good acting made me forget about his later roles. At the same time, when his character becomes entrenched in the Nazi life, Bale somehow made this dramatic transition smoothly without seeming contrived.Frank Whaley is also effective as the crippled friend Arvid, who can't join the Nazi army even if he wanted to because of his condition. Arvid plays jazz guitar, and knows a lot about American jazz. He is frequently bullied and beaten by Nazi soldiers his age, but still has energy to rebel. Whereas Leonard is the moral compass here, Whaley is the heart. I can't give away what happens to Arvid in this movie, but you really do feel for him as the movie progresses.Swing Kids has a very good story, and characters good and bad that you really care about. Among the major weaknesses in this movie is the fact that it takes place entirely in Germany, yet none of the characters actually speak German. Normally that fact would not be a problem, but my issue was that the good guys here spoke with either American or British accents, whereas the villains (such as Branaugh) spoke with a heavy German accent. It's as if Hollywood hasn't gotten over the idea that German or Russian accents sound evil, even long after World War II and the Cold War ended. In this story, it goes without saying that accents shouldn't matter.This is why I think the movie would have worked better as a foreign film made by Germans, rather than an American film made by the Disney company. If everyone was speaking German, allegedly evil accents wouldn't be an issue. On the other hand, Cabaret had good guys in it that had German accents. Why couldn't this film?Also, perhaps I'm asking too much here, but the written epilogue at the end wasn't enough for me. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, not every film that takes place during World War II has to be dark and depressing, but it would have been nice to have received a glimpse of what these swing kids went through in concentration camps, how they coped, and whether they got out alive or not. Maybe such a broad subject could still be the basis for another movie, but just two written sentences before the credits broke the Golden Rule of Storytelling Show, Don't Tell.This film would have benefited from being shelved for at least a year, and perhaps being released a little while after Schindler's List made its run. Compared to concentration camps, young men in Germany who loved American music seems insignificant in comparison, but by no means does it discredit the alternative history lesson from being told. Critics could have been more open-minded to the movie, but the good thing is that the film now has a cult following. It still nags me that the film wasn't in German, though. At least it has historical accuracy on its side.

Among the major weaknesses in this movie is the fact that it takes place entirely in Germany, yet none of the characters actually speak German. Normally that fact would not be a problem, but my issue was that the good guys here spoke with either American or British accents, whereas the villains (such as Branaugh) spoke with a heavy German accent. It's as if Hollywood hasn't gotten over the idea that German or Russian accents sound evil, even long after World War II and the Cold War ended. In this story, it goes without saying that accents shouldn't matter.This is why I think the movie would have worked better as a foreign film made by Germans, rather than an American film made by the Disney company. If everyone was speaking German, allegedly evil accents wouldn't be an issue. On the other hand, Cabaret had good guys in it that had German accents. Why couldn't this film?Also, perhaps I'm asking too much here, but the written epilogue at the end wasn't enough for me. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, not every film that takes place during World War II has to be dark and depressing, but it would have been nice to have received a glimpse of what these swing kids went through in concentration camps, how they coped, and whether they got out alive or not. Maybe such a broad subject could still be the basis for another movie, but just two written sentences before the credits broke the Golden Rule of Storytelling Show, Don't Tell.This film would have benefited from being shelved for at least a year, and perhaps being released a little while after Schindler's List made its run. Compared to concentration camps, young men in Germany who loved American music seems insignificant in comparison, but by no means does it discredit the alternative history lesson from being told. Critics could have been more open-minded to the movie, but the good thing is that the film now has a cult following. It still nags me that the film wasn't in German, though. At least it has historical accuracy on its side.

This film in no small amounts is absolutely wonderful and totally unique on its own.Lets start with the plot of an ex-clergy man turned farmer Graham living through what seems to be a strange turn of events. Suddenly he finds a crop circle instantaneously appear in his crop with no obvious indication as to the culprits. But those issues are packaged with the family of two small children which he and his brother care for.Graham and his family of course feel the tension of these happenings and old wounds which never healed become salted. But the as a large impending force looms. Graham must evaluate his life. The family look to each other for strength. But still with all those mysterious goings on Graham and many others contemplate deeper matters.The carefully built suspense is artistically used to give everyone including the audience a sense of foreboding. Everyone is hearing from all over of these events that are playing out globally which no one can answer. As these claims escalate it seems a pivotal moment for both the world and such a small family. The genius is of course putting an ordinary family which tries to deal with the global events so extraordinary. It gives the film a very isolated feel especially with such a small core cast. The music is used so sparingly and it uses long pan shots for added effect. The nearby village is scarcely populated by folk so ordinary but some of them seem more clued in then the rest. The exchange of stories leave most the family uncomfortable in their denial.Most of the family members all have their little quirks which they pull of well. Merril acts much the tough guy but looks up to his brother Graham as well as holding some resentment to the road not taken. Bo is a strange girl who seems to know things strangely more accurate than what the adults can fathom. The second kid is the one who resents his father for not listening to him and for his ignorance. All the cast pulls a wonderful performance of a family broken by tragic and yet not distasteful problems like alcohol abuse.The draw towards this family is something but with these turn of events, it feels as though they are coming to a crossroad. The decision may rest on something more than just what they have come to know. Indeed facing the unknown they are fearful and unprepared.Shamalan manages to bring faith into the movie without being condescending about it. Graham puts it perfectly about how people may view such events. Simply there is the viewpoint of faith. The willingness to believe something is far greater than your own comprehension. That doesn't say atheism is wrong in any way either.For a story to tell about a compelling family, a suspenseful thriller and evaluate the intricacies of faith, this movie can only be called excellent.The detractors however question the antics of the alien forces. But the stupidity of it is judging aliens by human logic. To aliens we humans would seem to be completely illogical. Aliens would indeed act in a whole other manner and customs. People seem to hate the symbolic weakness of water and yet for reasons we don't understand perhaps there was something in the water that was effective. I could give a million reasons as to why the aliens acted in that way. To simply call them ridiculous is an ignorant claim.This movie goes for an homage to the alien invasion movies of the bi gone era. Yet like the rest of the movie nothing is as it seems. it was never an invasion but a raid. As the threat passes the world mourns is loss but the family feels safe and whole.People say this film is too similar to his other ones but i feel that is more to do with Shyamlan's style of film making.

Then, Faye Dunaway, as insurance investigator Vicki Anderson, solves the mystery of the robbery WAY too easily. She walks in, looking young and stunning in several ridiculous overly fashionable outfits, bats her eyes and more or less decides that Crown is the guilty party.

And as such or because of it, it isn't boring. Actually, these are the only positive things about this film and they might even stimulate more people to make films like this, technically.Now, for what is bad and abominable Vince, a loser in American society, comes together with two friends from college. Actually, the meeting is something that Vince seems to have been planning for ages because it's five to ten years since he seen any of his old friends. From this we can gather that there is a big trauma for him involving his two friends. As it turns out, Vince dated Amy but she wouldn't pull out and Vince broke off the relationship. His reason was obviously not because Amy was saving it for after marriage and therefore instead thought that he was unloved by Amy and so broke off a relationship that probably only served to strengthen Amy's self-esteem and nothing else.

It was released in 1957 and showcases the considerable talents of Max von Sydow as Antonius Block (the knight), Gunnar Bjornstrand as Jons (the squire), and Bengt Ekerot as death. I'm sure doctoral dissertations have been written about The Seventh Seal, but I'll see it as a movie. The movie is set sometime in the Middle Ages. Block was convinced to go to the Holy Land and fight for the Crusades by a certain Raval, apparently a monk or cleric. After ten years of battles, they return home, and Block is utterly disillusioned. Jons apparently was never illusioned, so he has neither qualms nor questions. The film is motivated by Block's questions about the existence or not of God. Arriving home in the midst of the plague, Block sees more death even than in the Crusades, where he lost his faith. During their wanderings, Jons comes upon Raval robbing the dead and preparing to rape a woman. The reason for their going on the Crusades is, it seems, a sham.We follow knight and squire on their way back to Block's wife and home; as they travel they pick up various followers, including death. Block challenges death to a game of chess, which they play desultorily in the pauses of Block's travels. The knight's goals are to find the answer to his doubts whichever way it goes (God or no God) and to do some meaningful act before he dies. Block asks hard questions as he sees the panic caused by the plague, the burning of alleged witches, the mud and muck of the best life had to offer back then. Even death offers no answers. The scene where Block confesses to the monk is excellent and telling.* But Block finds no answers. He does, however, manage to sneak in a meaningful act, saving the lives of a couple and their child.If you haven't seen this since your college years, it's more interesting now. Block's questions are very astute, and Jons's answers are funny now that you're old enough to appreciate his sarcasm and cynicism. There's a lot of humor in The Seventh Seal, but you have to have some history of life to appreciate it. Each character in the film represents some various philosophical and religious position doubt, faith, atheism; so The Seventh Seal is in some respects an allegory like The Pilgrim's Progress. Jons is a great foil for the knight. Witty, smart, and sarcastic, his scenes are equally meaningful. Instead of angst, the squire faces life with the assurance that there is no meaning. His songs are obscene and silly, just like his life. The squire is smart; maybe smarter than his knight. It was an act of genius for Bergman to make them equals in merit, so that their differences play off each other more meaningfully.In two scenes the religious overtones become most obvious. Block shares wild strawberries and milk with Jof and Mia** (parents of Michael), and the knight is clearly moved by the loving relationship of the couple and their baby. He speaks at length about what sharing the food means to him. I take this to be a discourse on what may be the true nature of the eucharist and whether the sacrament is restricted to the church and the priests. Block draws great comfort from the moment of sharing the milk, wild strawberries, and fellowship. The second scene is at the end when all the travelers have finally reached the knight's home, and his wife prepares them what is to be their last supper. Once death has appeared and announced the end of their lives, the last line of the scene is by one of the guests It is finished. The unanswered, and in this film unanswerable, question is whether life is as Block says a senseless horror.*In ancient times, before giving absolution the penitent was required to be shriven or perform his or her penance. Sometimes the penance was a pilgrimage, often a recitation of a number of prayers, but the penance was to be completed before the absolution was given. In extreme circumstances - if the penitent was dying or condemned, for example - the penitent was given short shrift, then absolution. In this scene, our knight was given no shrift, and there is no absolution.**I am confused about who Jof, Mia, and Michael are or represent. Jof is the familiar diminutive of Joseph, Mia is the diminutive of Maria, and Michael means who resembles God. I would assume they represent Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus, but Jof has a vision of the virgin Mary and the Christchild (shown as the same age as Michael). And we later see Mia and Michael in exactly the same pose (Mary holding the child as it learns to walk). Jof also sees death, the only one to do so but for Block (at least till the end when death comes to claim the group). Jof says he sees the other reality, not the reality everyone else sees; I take it he means spiritual reality in addition to physical reality. They may represent only simple human goodness, embodied in a loving family. As presented, they have no deep questions, just love and kindness. Maybe they represent the real answer - don't ask.

Disney efforts did well at the box office but received mediocre critical reception. Adult-oriented animation like the Ralph Bakshi films took off. Other films came and went. It seemed that the Disney films were losing their charm (as Don Bluth would put it) and that animation in America was doomed.The Rescuers was being worked on in the mid-1970s, when Disney's new young animators (Many of which would later leave with Don Bluth to form Don Bluth Productions, enter the Disney Vs. Bluth in the 80s) were starting to show their talent. Robin Hood and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! were only training vehicles for them, The Rescuers seemed like a good, but safe project for them to do. This was because the Disney management was play-it-safe at the time thanks to then-CEO Ron Miller. Some of that can been seen in the film.But The Rescuers is the strongest Disney animated film from the 1970s. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh felt like the 1940s package features. The Aristocats and Robin Hood were entertaining, but they lacked strong narratives. The Rescuers has a story. The film actually has emotional moments. Very surprising, since the films after The Jungle Book and before this lacked emotional moments.The Rescuers begins where the orphan Penny sends a message in a bottle out. The opening credits are very nice, as they might be concept art. But they tell a story. The Rescue Aid Society, a team of mice that rescue people, gets the message, and sends the timid Bernard and the adventurous Bianca out to find Penny.Penny is held captive by Madam Medusa, a rather outrageous villain who makes the child search a pirate's cave for a diamond called the Devil's Eye. She was a terrific villain because of how cruel she was to Penny, especially when she tells her, Who would ever want to adopt you? That's possibly one of the meanest things I've heard coming out of a Disney villain.Anyway, the adventure kicks off when Orville the albatross takes them to the Devil's Bayou. From there, The Rescuers turns into one of the more exciting pre-Renaissance Disney animated features.

The finished product however is a dismal attempt at epic storytelling.After half breed Pearl's father kills his wild and unfaithful wife and in turn is hung for it she is sent off to live with distant relatives on a Texas mega ranch of where she garners the interest of a Cain and Abel brother act. Decent brother Jesse (Joseph Cotton) is clumsy and unsure in his approach but wild Lewt (Gregory Peck) shows no hesitance and is soon bedding the hotblooded Pearl creating a familial crisis with the parents as well as she drives a wedge between the sympathetic mother (Lillian Gish) and domineering father (Lionel Barrymore).Duel in the Sun has a superb opening dance hall sequence that sets the stage for the film. Edited with energy and suspense it builds to a powerful crescendo which unfortunately never attains again for the duration of the film. Among its roster of stars only Gregory Peck as reckless Lewt acquits himself with distinction displaying an iniquitous and irresistible charm. Jenniffer Jones Pearl has a smoldering sensuality about her but is all breathy (making me wonder whether Marylyn Monroe patterned her acting style after this character) and out of her depth as she alternates wreaking havoc on the McCanless family, passionate interludes with Lewt and crying jags that she comes out of none the wiser. Joe Cotton is drab, Lionel Barrymore bullheaded and cantankerous and Lillian Gish wispy and saint like in generic roles. Butterfly McQueen is on board once again in the racially insensitive role of a moronic maid while Herbert Marshall lends nobility to the character of Pearl's father and Walter Huston as six gun toting Reverend Sinkiller owns every scene he is in.King Vidor get's the blame for the direction though half a dozen including Selznick worked at pasting something plausible together as the film was cut down to just over two hours. Dimitri Tiomkin lends his big sound to the visuals to let us know where looking at a big picture but ultimately the entire project is a faint echo of GWTW and Selznick's dream. Duel in the Sun is indeed a sprawling western but it's sprawl is more akin to a drunken cowpoke lying face down on a bar room floor.

Decent brother Jesse (Joseph Cotton) is clumsy and unsure in his approach but wild Lewt (Gregory Peck) shows no hesitance and is soon bedding the hotblooded Pearl creating a familial crisis with the parents as well as she drives a wedge between the sympathetic mother (Lillian Gish) and domineering father (Lionel Barrymore).Duel in the Sun has a superb opening dance hall sequence that sets the stage for the film. Edited with energy and suspense it builds to a powerful crescendo which unfortunately never attains again for the duration of the film. Among its roster of stars only Gregory Peck as reckless Lewt acquits himself with distinction displaying an iniquitous and irresistible charm. Jenniffer Jones Pearl has a smoldering sensuality about her but is all breathy (making me wonder whether Marylyn Monroe patterned her acting style after this character) and out of her depth as she alternates wreaking havoc on the McCanless family, passionate interludes with Lewt and crying jags that she comes out of none the wiser. Joe Cotton is drab, Lionel Barrymore bullheaded and cantankerous and Lillian Gish wispy and saint like in generic roles. Butterfly McQueen is on board once again in the racially insensitive role of a moronic maid while Herbert Marshall lends nobility to the character of Pearl's father and Walter Huston as six gun toting Reverend Sinkiller owns every scene he is in.King Vidor get's the blame for the direction though half a dozen including Selznick worked at pasting something plausible together as the film was cut down to just over two hours. Dimitri Tiomkin lends his big sound to the visuals to let us know where looking at a big picture but ultimately the entire project is a faint echo of GWTW and Selznick's dream. Duel in the Sun is indeed a sprawling western but it's sprawl is more akin to a drunken cowpoke lying face down on a bar room floor.

Case in point, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. He takes material that could, in lesser or just more hack-like hands, be a simple TV movie about a woman scorned badly getting her payback against the family that not-sorta-really did this to her. It's about what happens when a woman loses everything- this being a widow of a doctor-gynecologist who was a creep who took too much pleasure in his work and who killed himself when faced with harassment charges- including her child in a miscarriage. After the woman, Claire Bartel (Annabella Sciorra) has her baby, a new nanny comes around. With her blond hair and cold blue eyes and perfect demeanor and posture, she's practically perfect to come in and take care of her new tot and the little girl sister of the house. What could go wrong here? The plot Peyton Flanders, nay Mrs. Mott, unravels is ingenious unravel the family by focusing the bad attention on the mother, make people in the house dislike her, and at some point after getting tons of love from everyone kill her off. It helps as well that she still has her breast milk and, you know, gets the baby hooked up with that. The script by Amanda Silver could slip into cliché at any time... and in ways it actual does, sometimes rather startlingly. She even puts in a supporting character that should be blatant (or back in the 1950's could have been a racist caricature), with mentally challenged Solomon (Ernie Hudson), who knows what's really going on but can't speak up due to how he is, and certainly can't defend himself when Peyton pulls her mind-game crap against him. It should be all win for her, with this happy family.Characters are drawn out in a believable way. We don't doubt that Peyton can do all of this since she's had time to prepare, like a mastermind constructing an intricate game, pitting sides against one another, a chess-master with an ignorant opponent. And director Curtis Hanson casts his film to a fine tune; this is a group of people that take these characters seriously (Hudson most surprising, as I felt for his character if only because of his performance). We feel the vulnerability that shows little by little from Claire from Sciorra's own ability to show it so well, and De Mornay has some of her best work of her whole career here. Supporting players get their teeth to sink in too Julianne Moore pops up for a few scenes as a tough career woman but not a bad one, and for her few moments she's kind of stunning, for how little she's given to do.Oh there are some big set-pieces, and the eventual climactic showdown in the house in a kind of last-ditch effort to get what she wants. But by this point Hanson has not cheapened too much of the drama, at least for the melodrama he's after. This isn't masterpiece theater, it's a tough little thriller in the guise of a suburbia, where underneath the warm front of happy children and happy mentally challenged workers, there's some nastiness that can't be gotten rid of (albeit it can come in handy when confronting the school-yard bully as Peyton does here). Good work all around, surprising even, and something Lifetime movie-makers should watch as a benchmark of high quality, if that means much.
