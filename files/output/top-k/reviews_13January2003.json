Let's start at the least important aspect shall we? This is the story of Xander Cage and a group of extreme sports activists who think the world revolves around video games. Cage lives his life like he actually is in a video game because he hates the world and isn't afraid of death. He is the recruited by Gibbs to become a secret agent after Xander passes two tests. The first find him in a diner where two men are going to rob the place, but of course Xander sees right through that one. The second sees him in the middle of a Columbian cocaine plant when he is mistaken by the Columbian police as a drug lord. After passing the tests he is sent to Russia to find out information about a bunch or Euro-trash criminals. It would seem that every time I write about an action film I tend to say it is the missing link that action films need these days, this could be very true about XXX, and to much of the films target audience (teens) it probably is. But it is this praise that I cannot give this film. Although it has many huge stunts, massive explosions and never shies away form a good shoot-out; XXX can't be what action needs because it is what action already has. This film adds nothing new to the genre and if people pay close enough attention they will see that this is just the plot of several other popular action flicks woven together as one. If anyone can watch this film and not compare it to James Bond or La Femme Nikita I would like to meet them because they are either a visionary or an idiot. But there is a reason there are 15 James Bond films and people still enjoy them, or why La Femme Nikita was a huge French smash. It is because they have style and class. James Bond is smooth and swave, he does everything with precision and grace, he also has great charm and poise. Cage is just a rugged low life he goes across the country to battle other low lives while blowing up anything that gets in his way, then again we must remember the target audience here. But the fault of this does not lay in the hands of director Rob Cohen or star Vin Diesel. The major problem here is the script by writer Rich Wilkes, who between Airheads and the Jerky Boys Movie, has yet to write a decent script that will appeal to a wider audience than teens who get thrills from stupid people doing stupid things. But this is a minor setback and doesn't steal too much impact from the film. There are two ways to view this film; one would be to see it as it appears, the other is to see it for what it really is. If you choose the first for this kind of viewing I must again use the term target audience, who will probably fall in love with the film and praise it as one of actions finest moments. If you choose the latter you will probably be watching a huge misfire. At face value this is a high-octane, thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride that never lets up in the action department and much to the films success many people seen it this way. Now back to the second people. If you take this film for what it is it really is a very insincere film. There is nothing more here than a bunch of other action film plots loosely tied together and covered over with endless action in hopes that no one would realize. What better way is there to get people to your film then throwing in a bunch of endless action and lots of sexism to accuracy the males? Then cast a teen sex symbol, in this case Vin Diesel, as your lead to get the girls flocking to the theatre in masses as well. Someone must have put a lot of thought into this. The film was directed by Rob Cohen who also made last year's surprise summer smash, the Fast and the Furious. Cohen knows has to stage good action sequences, the action in F and F was exhilarating, but instead of trying to make another great action film he seems only to be worried about how he can make the Fast and the Furious again, except this time bigger. Instead of having a good story, unlike the Fast and Furious, Cohen seems to be more content on seeing how many things he can blow up in a two hour period and how many scantily clad women he can use as pawns before the audience starts to figure out just how weak the story actually is. It would almost seem that Cohen is more worried about making a hit than an honest action flick, due to the lack of interest in any of the characters. Now that I have totally ripped the film apart how about we move on to the good stuff? Vin Diesel has big things coming to him in action and although I prefer his more character driven action films like Pitch Black and Knockaround Guys, I still can't get enough of him in films like this. He did as much of his own stunt work as he was allowed to and what a good job he did, now if we could just give him so cheesy one-liners he will be on his way to superstardom. But it is not Diesel who out-cools everyone this time. Samuel L. Jackson has a small but unforgettable role as Gibbons (think of him as Bob from La Femme Nikita) who is still the coolest man in the room. It is also nice to see how Jackson handles being the man in charge of the action and not in the middle of it. The biggest flaw in the acting is the romance between Xander and Yelena (Asia Argento) or should I say lack thereof. The story of their love and how they come together is dumb enough but on top of it all we need two actors who have very little on-screen chemistry, like I said before it is good this thing is packed with action because the story amounts to very little. I remember a time when action was simple. You gave Arnold Schwarzenegger a gun and he would wipe out half the world before bedtime. There were no gimmicks or computer generated effects in these films, it was all Arnold, all the time. Now with films like the Matrix actions had become about technology. I guess this is where Cohen disserves the most praise. His lack of computer effect makes this films seem quite raw and true to the action title. Now don't get me wrong there are some computer effects but most of them just help add to the cheese factor of the film anyway. This film is a back-to-the-basics, blow &#145;em up, shoot 'em down actioneer with real stunts and real explosions. It throws its hero into a situation and throws logic out the window. I am still wondering how it is possible to jump a dirt bike ten feet in the air without hitting a ramp? Although XXX had just as many flaws as it did redeeming qualities and standing next to the Bourne Identity (easily the years best action flick) it seems rather second-rate. Nevertheless its simple approach and great action sequences make it possible to sit through the two hours of pointless story and bad romance. Even though it had nothing new to say or offer that hasn't been seen a million times before I am an action fan at heart and can't help but recommend this one anyway.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"13 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Let's face it, there will be no capturing of lightening in a bottle twice. The Star Wars saga as we know it is just that, the one we knew. The films we have been given the past few years in the guise of SW films are new beings entirely, so we should treat and approach them as such.  But even so, thats still no excuse George, for bad movie making. Onto the review.When you build a house, you need a blueprint to start with, thus when you contemplate making a movie your blueprint is and should be the screenplay and script.....strike one against this film, right out of the gate. The script  is ham-fisted and quite frankly seems lazy and thrown together. The dialogue is painful in many places and though it may lack the over-seriousness of other blockbuster film franchises in theaters now (cough),  it is lightyears away( HAH!) from the dry  humour and wit of the first SW saga and lacks all that saga's charm.  The script does its job in that it advances the plot and storyline, but does it in the meanest way, lacking totally in any subtletly, structure and without the great character interaction that *made* the first SW ( e.g. Luke&Darth Vader, Han & Lea, Han and Lando's friendship, the mysteriousness of Yoda, R2D2 & C-3PO hell, even the Imperial pions were more memorable than some of the more prominent SW characters) George please, I'm begging you, put step away from teh keyboard and turn off the computer b\/c you cannot write for s**t!I do feel that much of the blame for the so-so performances in many stances can be blamed on the bad script. I think when people say that 's0 and so' cant act, what they really mean to say is 'we cared about and loved the characters in the first Saga, they got us emotionally involved, they made us laugh, cry, cheer and boo'. So when people say 'so and so cant act' what they mean is 'so and so didnt make us care' which really means that 'so and so' probably wasnt given the material to do so.  So, the next time you critique Portman's  or Christensen's performance, consider the source material. However, even truly atrocious lines can be ameliorated a bit by good acting, or the right approach. In this regard I think the standouts were Ewan McGregor who seemed more comfortable and was definitely convincing as the older, and more somber Obi Wan, den mother to Anakin. I also thought that Christopher Lee, who pulls blockbuster double duty, was also great as the tongue in cheek Count Dooku ( the scene with him and Obi on geonosis is hilarious). Natalie Portman was decent enough as Padme, but I feel for her b\/c she had many of the worst lines in the film to try and deliver and make believable, which she did to an extent. I even thought she showed some real emotion in the 'confession scene' ( well, til she got to the line  I truly...deeply...OY!) And yes, if you look close enough, her character did evolve from the first film, as she is no longer queen she is also not quite as stiff and distant, though still properly dignified, being a senator and all. So, kudos to Portman who looked fabulous as well in the film. Which leaves Hayden.  Now, dont stone me but....I didnt think he was truly awful. Again, he had some truly horrible and nonsensical lines to say ( I will even stop people from dying...  Huh?!)  but still, he nailed some aspects of the future Darth Vader dead on. Simply put, the boy has great eyes, which he used to great effect to show Anakin's dark, brooding, surly and intense side.  The only problem was, he wasnotficient enough in showing some of the boyishness of Anakin- the youthful exuberance and innocence,. The perfect performance would have been to combine the darkness which he displayed well with say....some mannerisms reminiscient of a young Luke Skywalker( think A New HOpe and the first half of Empire); after all, the apple dont fall far from teh tree right?  As for the other performances in the film, again I think the actors did the best with what they had to work with, which wasnt much, so the best that can be said is that they are all professionals.I'm ambivalent about the direction. On the one hand I think it did little to nothing to help the viewer connet emotionally with the characters( then again, with that script....).  There were a few arresting shots here and there, but I think different choices would have made a bigger emotional impact on the film. For instance, I would have loved to have seen more of Anakin's rampage on the Tuskans,  and I definitely think the clone battle could have been grander.  So, once again, George gets bare marks for advancing the story. On the other hand, considering that most of the movie was filmed on bluescreen, its quite an achievment for George in combining all the elements together.  Which brings me to my last point- the CGI.

The Star Wars saga as we know it is just that, the one we knew. The films we have been given the past few years in the guise of SW films are new beings entirely, so we should treat and approach them as such.  But even so, thats still no excuse George, for bad movie making. Onto the review.When you build a house, you need a blueprint to start with, thus when you contemplate making a movie your blueprint is and should be the screenplay and script.....strike one against this film, right out of the gate. The script  is ham-fisted and quite frankly seems lazy and thrown together. The dialogue is painful in many places and though it may lack the over-seriousness of other blockbuster film franchises in theaters now (cough),  it is lightyears away( HAH!) from the dry  humour and wit of the first SW saga and lacks all that saga's charm.  The script does its job in that it advances the plot and storyline, but does it in the meanest way, lacking totally in any subtletly, structure and without the great character interaction that *made* the first SW ( e.g. Luke&Darth Vader, Han & Lea, Han and Lando's friendship, the mysteriousness of Yoda, R2D2 & C-3PO hell, even the Imperial pions were more memorable than some of the more prominent SW characters) George please, I'm begging you, put step away from teh keyboard and turn off the computer b\/c you cannot write for s**t!I do feel that much of the blame for the so-so performances in many stances can be blamed on the bad script. I think when people say that 's0 and so' cant act, what they really mean to say is 'we cared about and loved the characters in the first Saga, they got us emotionally involved, they made us laugh, cry, cheer and boo'. So when people say 'so and so cant act' what they mean is 'so and so didnt make us care' which really means that 'so and so' probably wasnt given the material to do so.  So, the next time you critique Portman's  or Christensen's performance, consider the source material. However, even truly atrocious lines can be ameliorated a bit by good acting, or the right approach. In this regard I think the standouts were Ewan McGregor who seemed more comfortable and was definitely convincing as the older, and more somber Obi Wan, den mother to Anakin. I also thought that Christopher Lee, who pulls blockbuster double duty, was also great as the tongue in cheek Count Dooku ( the scene with him and Obi on geonosis is hilarious). Natalie Portman was decent enough as Padme, but I feel for her b\/c she had many of the worst lines in the film to try and deliver and make believable, which she did to an extent. I even thought she showed some real emotion in the 'confession scene' ( well, til she got to the line  I truly...deeply...OY!) And yes, if you look close enough, her character did evolve from the first film, as she is no longer queen she is also not quite as stiff and distant, though still properly dignified, being a senator and all. So, kudos to Portman who looked fabulous as well in the film. Which leaves Hayden.  Now, dont stone me but....I didnt think he was truly awful. Again, he had some truly horrible and nonsensical lines to say ( I will even stop people from dying...  Huh?!)  but still, he nailed some aspects of the future Darth Vader dead on. Simply put, the boy has great eyes, which he used to great effect to show Anakin's dark, brooding, surly and intense side.  The only problem was, he wasnotficient enough in showing some of the boyishness of Anakin- the youthful exuberance and innocence,. The perfect performance would have been to combine the darkness which he displayed well with say....some mannerisms reminiscient of a young Luke Skywalker( think A New HOpe and the first half of Empire); after all, the apple dont fall far from teh tree right?  As for the other performances in the film, again I think the actors did the best with what they had to work with, which wasnt much, so the best that can be said is that they are all professionals.I'm ambivalent about the direction. On the one hand I think it did little to nothing to help the viewer connet emotionally with the characters( then again, with that script....).  There were a few arresting shots here and there, but I think different choices would have made a bigger emotional impact on the film. For instance, I would have loved to have seen more of Anakin's rampage on the Tuskans,  and I definitely think the clone battle could have been grander.  So, once again, George gets bare marks for advancing the story. On the other hand, considering that most of the movie was filmed on bluescreen, its quite an achievment for George in combining all the elements together.  Which brings me to my last point- the CGI.

Fragments of (almost) forgotten 60's hits (Ma Belle Amie by The Tee Set and A Taste of Honey by Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass, for example). Interesting (and beautiful) landscape shots of the Oregon wilderness, and odd freeze-frame segments that make you scratch your head. Tom Robbins doing periodic voiceovers - and he sounds just like Al Gore (and about as inspirational, too...) All this and a lot more, too.

I was intrigued enough by the film, though, that I rewound my tape and watched the thing two more times just to get more of the quirky Tom Robbinsesque lines into my head. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a great movie, but it's by no means a bad movie either. It actually is kind of clever and charming in a few spots. Weird but cute, kind of like Ozzie's daughter, eh? So get over your constipation, take a break from the war on terrorism and watch this strange but fun film. You'll love the escapism of it all.

Simply amazing gore work is featured throughout the film that is so gruesome and shocking it will have even the toughest of viewers turning their heads.With all the gore featured throughout the movie, it is amazing how Carpenter is still able to generate suspense by stressing the unseen.  He is not merely making a gore picture, he cares about scaring the audience.  Some scares come from the gore, but most of them come from the build up to that gory moment.  The long tracking shots inside the claustrophobic station are particularily effective.The icing on the cake with The Thing is Carpenter's perfect apocalyptic ending.  This is a dark film, and the ending does not cop out with some sappy rescue scene.  The ending is true to the themes and characters of the film, and is one of the best in history.  The last line of the film beats watch the skies from the original The Thing.  In fact, everything about this film upstages the original.  This is a remake like only John Carpenter can make, and it is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.  One of the best science fiction films ever made, bar none.

I really think they played their parts well.I would definitely recommend this film to you. It has a little bit of a Married With Children sort of tone to it, but the jokes are intelligent and witty.

There were too many plot holes to list, but I will try.***SPOILERS***First of all, this movie was incredibly slow for what little the ending provided as far as relief from the buildup it caused.  I could have handled it if it hadn't have had such a disappointing and pointless ending. Bo apparently has dreams of what is going to happen in the future, yet nobody seems to address this (except for her brother, who mentions it once).  She stated several time that she had a dream that all of this was going to happen but it was all largely ignored.  She said there was a monster outside her room, could she have a glass of water.  The dad takes her back into her room, but doesn't even bring up the monster.The dog thing wasn't followed up on very much.  One of the dogs freaks out and pees on the floor, then off camera apparently attacks Bo and the kid stabs him in the neck with a fork.  Where did he get the fork?  The dog thing was brought up in what it seemed as for the moment storytelling in order to explain what was about to happen, but there was no explanation *why*.  This also happens with the crops.  Later in the movie they mention that it *was* for locating areas.The issue with the preacher's wife was too drawn out, with him having partial dreams about what happened to her.  As someone else here pointed out, it is ridiculous to imply that the wife died when she did in order to give her brother in-law a hint on how to hurt the alien, and Hello, I don't know about anyone else, but if I am standing in a room up against a hostile creature, alien or human, and I have a bat, you better believe I am going to use it, without having to remember some cryptic message from a dying family member 6 months before. The son is just plain weird.  One minute he is fine, and then the next he is telling his father he hates him for letting his mother die.  What?  At this point of the movie, we don't know how his mother died, so I think this was lost on me.  The kid borrows a book from the store about alien invasion and as they are looking through it, happen upon a page with a picture of a house being set on fire by rays from a UFO, then panning out to the yard where there is an adult and 2 children dead on the ground.  The preacher says Hey that looks like our house. Even that early in the game, I would have packed my stuff and gone to the lake.  Had he have asked his daughter, she probably would have said something like I had a dream about this and they could have avoided the whole thing altogether.What happened to the sheriff?When the family comes up from the basement, they turn on the TV to hear reports of the aliens leaving, having been defeated by primitive means by some of the humans in other countries.  Then they say they have no further information.  Now.  If someone figures out how to make the aliens leave, why wouldn't they broadcast that information everywhere?  They send out emergency alerts telling people what to do in case of an emergency.  Apparently the news stations in this movie wanted people to figure it out for themselves.Why is it that only one character in the movie, and seemingly the world, had the inclination to go towards water?  He shared his theory with the preacher who decided to stay in his home, and board up the windows and doors, sentencing his family to certain death, and KNOWING it.  He saw the picture of his burning house, his dogs were acting vicious, he knew the aliens were hostile because one tried to grab him while it was locked in a pantry.  He had to chop that ones fingers off so he could get away.When in the basement, they realize that the aliens aren't really trying to get in through that door, they are just trying to distract everyone so they could come in through the coal chute.  Once the director delivers a healthy scare to the viewers, showing an alien hand coming out of the coal chute about the grab the boy, the aliens grow quiet.  Completely.  Why did the family spend more time in the basement while Morgan was having an asthma attack?  Why didn't they turn on the baby monitor right away to see if they could detect any activity in the main house?Why didn't anyone check the water for contamination?  If this girl was so neurotic that she would complain about the water since she was little, why was dad asking so many questions and acting so confused about the water glasses being all over.  They gave the impression at the beginning of the movie that this was strange behavior for the girl so I was really surprised to hear that it was common.  It would have worked had someone realized that Bo was predicting the future, because to the aliens, the water was contaminated, however, once again, nobody even said anything.  They just happened upon it by accident and paid no attention to the countless times that the preacher got a strange look on his face when he saw all the glasses all over the place.What was Ray's job in this film?  He obviously wasn't known well by the family, the son asked if that is him when they were in the restaurant.  If Ray had just killed Morgan's mother 6 months ago, wouldn't the kid know him?  And let's say he didn't know him.  How did the preacher know it was Ray calling him.  There were other people in the town and he obviously didn't have caller ID.  It could have been anyone saying father and then hanging up.  Had they have gone into this a bit more, it could have worked, but this guy was obviously not a close family friend.  Oh, and even in rural areas they have *69.  They even have it for rotary phones.The preacher who lost his way thing was really well done in From dusk till dawn  It was completely pointless in this movie.  So the guy lost his faith, big deal.  He still loved his family and it really had no effect on how he dealt with protecting them.  He gets his faith back because he realized Morgan's lungs were closed when the alien sprayed poison gas in his face? (Again, it had just been discovered that the aliens had poison gas, and nothing further was mentioned). AND Finally, why, if the aliens were going to choose a planet to take over, would they choose one that is 80% water?There were too many fly-by-night explanations and not enough curiosity by the cast.  Even the sheriff acted like she had an idea what was going on, but she seemed more intent at hinting around instead of just coming out and saying something (before disappearing).  I expect way more from Shamalan.  I think that just like in unbreakable, he is still expecting to fly by the notoriety that came with The Sixth Sense and proved, instead, to be a big disappointment.The only thing good about this movie is the comedy shared by Mel Gibson and Juaquin Phoenix.  Juaquin was hilarious and I loved the jokes he made.  I usually don't like the movies that he is in.

Always a visionary and an auteur, he has never been given the respect by critics he deserves.  His films are always effective, and his constant themes of day vs. night and good vs. evil are perhaps the most important in film.  In his first true film, Assault on Precinct 13, John Carpenter demonstrates that he is more than just a Hawks aficianado.  He has a command over the camera, the score, the dialogue, the works.

There were too many plot holes to list, but I will try.***SPOILERS***First of all, this movie was incredibly slow for what little the ending provided as far as relief from the buildup it caused.  I could have handled it if it hadn't have had such a disappointing and pointless ending. Bo apparently has dreams of what is going to happen in the future, yet nobody seems to address this (except for her brother, who mentions it once).  She stated several time that she had a dream that all of this was going to happen but it was all largely ignored.  She said there was a monster outside her room, could she have a glass of water.  The dad takes her back into her room, but doesn't even bring up the monster.The dog thing wasn't followed up on very much.  One of the dogs freaks out and pees on the floor, then off camera apparently attacks Bo and the kid stabs him in the neck with a fork.  Where did he get the fork?  The dog thing was brought up in what it seemed as for the moment storytelling in order to explain what was about to happen, but there was no explanation *why*.  This also happens with the crops.  Later in the movie they mention that it *was* for locating areas.The issue with the preacher's wife was too drawn out, with him having partial dreams about what happened to her.  As someone else here pointed out, it is ridiculous to imply that the wife died when she did in order to give her brother in-law a hint on how to hurt the alien, and Hello, I don't know about anyone else, but if I am standing in a room up against a hostile creature, alien or human, and I have a bat, you better believe I am going to use it, without having to remember some cryptic message from a dying family member 6 months before. The son is just plain weird.  One minute he is fine, and then the next he is telling his father he hates him for letting his mother die.  What?  At this point of the movie, we don't know how his mother died, so I think this was lost on me.  The kid borrows a book from the store about alien invasion and as they are looking through it, happen upon a page with a picture of a house being set on fire by rays from a UFO, then panning out to the yard where there is an adult and 2 children dead on the ground.  The preacher says Hey that looks like our house. Even that early in the game, I would have packed my stuff and gone to the lake.  Had he have asked his daughter, she probably would have said something like I had a dream about this and they could have avoided the whole thing altogether.What happened to the sheriff?When the family comes up from the basement, they turn on the TV to hear reports of the aliens leaving, having been defeated by primitive means by some of the humans in other countries.  Then they say they have no further information.  Now.  If someone figures out how to make the aliens leave, why wouldn't they broadcast that information everywhere?  They send out emergency alerts telling people what to do in case of an emergency.  Apparently the news stations in this movie wanted people to figure it out for themselves.Why is it that only one character in the movie, and seemingly the world, had the inclination to go towards water?  He shared his theory with the preacher who decided to stay in his home, and board up the windows and doors, sentencing his family to certain death, and KNOWING it.  He saw the picture of his burning house, his dogs were acting vicious, he knew the aliens were hostile because one tried to grab him while it was locked in a pantry.  He had to chop that ones fingers off so he could get away.When in the basement, they realize that the aliens aren't really trying to get in through that door, they are just trying to distract everyone so they could come in through the coal chute.  Once the director delivers a healthy scare to the viewers, showing an alien hand coming out of the coal chute about the grab the boy, the aliens grow quiet.  Completely.  Why did the family spend more time in the basement while Morgan was having an asthma attack?  Why didn't they turn on the baby monitor right away to see if they could detect any activity in the main house?Why didn't anyone check the water for contamination?  If this girl was so neurotic that she would complain about the water since she was little, why was dad asking so many questions and acting so confused about the water glasses being all over.  They gave the impression at the beginning of the movie that this was strange behavior for the girl so I was really surprised to hear that it was common.  It would have worked had someone realized that Bo was predicting the future, because to the aliens, the water was contaminated, however, once again, nobody even said anything.  They just happened upon it by accident and paid no attention to the countless times that the preacher got a strange look on his face when he saw all the glasses all over the place.What was Ray's job in this film?  He obviously wasn't known well by the family, the son asked if that is him when they were in the restaurant.  If Ray had just killed Morgan's mother 6 months ago, wouldn't the kid know him?  And let's say he didn't know him.  How did the preacher know it was Ray calling him.  There were other people in the town and he obviously didn't have caller ID.  It could have been anyone saying father and then hanging up.  Had they have gone into this a bit more, it could have worked, but this guy was obviously not a close family friend.  Oh, and even in rural areas they have *69.  They even have it for rotary phones.The preacher who lost his way thing was really well done in From dusk till dawn  It was completely pointless in this movie.  So the guy lost his faith, big deal.  He still loved his family and it really had no effect on how he dealt with protecting them.  He gets his faith back because he realized Morgan's lungs were closed when the alien sprayed poison gas in his face? (Again, it had just been discovered that the aliens had poison gas, and nothing further was mentioned).  There were too many fly-by-night explanations and not enough curiosity by the cast.  Even the sheriff acted like she had an idea what was going on, but she seemed more intent at hinting around instead of just coming out and saying something (before disappearing).  I expect way more from Shamalan.  I think that just like in unbreakable, he is still expecting to fly by the notoriety that came with The Sixth Sense and proved, instead, to be a big disappointment.The only thing good about this movie is the comedy shared by Mel Gibson and Juaquin Phoenix.  Juaquin was hilarious and I loved the jokes he made.  I usually don't like the movies that he is in.

I pretty much avoided it through most of my childhood until I got a little older and got over it. Now, I love this movie.

It takes place in Chicago and the environment created is a very grimey and seedy setting where corruption and crime rules the street. Brad Dourif plays the part of Charles Lee Ray (Chucky), the infamous Lake-shore Strangler, who after a struggle with the police, loses his life and transfers his soul into one of the popular good guy dolls.

Put two and two together, let your imagination roll, and you know what will happen. The movie is pretty freaky because you are constantly questioning everything you know. For the first hour, you don't see Chucky move or speak, so you might be suspicious that Andy is causing all this mayhem. I won't spoil the movie for you.

Pongo schemes to bring Roger and Anita together and eventually finds success.  When the two humans get married, it appears the dogs do too.  Several months later, Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil, a nasty rich woman with strange hair, comes to visit because she has heard Pongo's mate Perdita is having puppies.  It is not yet time, but Cruella insists on being informed when the time comes.  She shows off her beautiful fur coat and comments on how beautiful the dogs are.  Several weeks pass and, at last, the big moment arrives.  Nanny the quirky housekeeper comes out to announce to Roger that the puppies have arrived.  He asks how many and she replies eight.  That's a lot, but Nanny keeps coming out to announce there are more puppies.  The eventual total fifteen.  How can this family keep so many dogs?  They'll find a way.  Cruella comes just in time, offering money for the puppies, figuring the couple cannot afford to care for them all, but it is too soon to take them from their mother.  Anyway, Roger does not feel at all comfortable about making any promises to this woman.  When the puppies are older, two strange men come to the door insisting the law requires them to inspect the house's wiring.  When they leave, the puppies are gone.  We later find out Cruella knew these men, and when human attempts to find the puppies fail, Pongo and Perdita communicate with the other dogs in the city.  While all of London must put up with the excessive barking (some of which cbmes from dogs we saw earlier when Pongo rejected their owners) the message finally reaches the countryside, where a horse, a duck, and a cat join in the search.  The cat remembers hearing puppies at Cruella's rundown old mansion in the country (the name of which sounded very un-Disneylike) and goes there to investigate.  The men are there, along with 99 puppies.  The question now is how to rescue the puppies before they become fur coats?Overall, this movie was better than the live-action version, but not by that much.  I recall the villains being more cartoonish and not as well-acted.  On the other hand, I thought Glenn Close's deliciously over-the-top performance was the better one of Cruella, partly because she made Cruella more human and less of a cartoon.

All of the acting performances in this version were good, and it sounded like children doing the puppy voices, which was very effective.  Naturally, this version focused more on the animals.  The animation was quite good but maybe not as detailed as in some early Disney films.  I felt like the degree of detail came up short in at least one outdoor scene where we saw the dogs from a distance.

The film shows Kane's life from the day he was adopted by a rich man named Mr. Thatcher and continues on through the many interesting debacles and triumphs that surrounded him for the rest of his days. What can I say? The film is incredible. It has many great characters and plenty of interesting aspects that make you glad you're watching it. It moves you during every second. I was amazed by the many great scenes and moments, such as Kane's speech during his run for governor, Kane watching his wife sing at the opera in disbelief, and his tantrum when he threw objects across the room after the departure of his second wife and then discovered his snow globe, which made him realize that he longed for the simple days of his childhood.

I may not agree with most people on the statement that it's THE greatest movie of all time, but I love it anyway and it's one of my favorites.Overall rating 4 out of 5.

The classic masterpiece that launched Orson Welles into the film industry is easily one of the greatest films of all time.Citizen Kane has an intriguing beginning. Welles easily captures you with the scenes of Kane's province, first showing a No Trespassing sign that instantly let me know I was watching a great movie. The camera moves up to Charles Kane on his death bed, where he mutters the unforgettable word Rosebud and then drops his snow globe. When the News On The March part began I was charmed, and it was very creative. I'll admit I was fooled a bit, thinking that the whole film was going to be a news show. But instead it develops into a plot that revolves around a journalist searching for what Kane meant by Rosebud. The film shows Kane's life from the day he was adopted by a rich man named Mr. Thatcher and continues on through the many interesting debacles and triumphs that surrounded him for the rest of his days. What can I say? The film is incredible. It has many great characters and plenty of interesting aspects that make you glad you're watching it. It moves you during every second.
