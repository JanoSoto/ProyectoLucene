[{"date":"2 May 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Boiler Room isn't a terrific movie, but it's not a terrible one either. It's definitely entertaining, but at times feels too much like a derivative of other financial thriller films, in particular Wall Street, with some references to Glengarry Glen Ross thrown in for good measure. Because of this, it feels kind of like an pale unoriginal imitation, more than something truly original.The story centers around Seth Davis (Ribisi), a 21-year-old college dropout living in Queens. In place of school, he runs an illegal casino out of his apartment for college students. He makes a good living, but does so against the wishes of his family, in particular his strict, cold father Judge Marty Davis (Rifkin). His father doesn't want to speak to Seth until he makes a living in an honest way. One night, towards closing time, he's visited by an old friend and his colleague. They tell him about being a stockbroker and recruit Seth to join a group interview. Wanting to impress his father, he goes to the interview at J.T. Marlin. About an hour away from NYC in the suburbs, Seth is immediately attracted to the sports cars and luxury suits worn by the brokers. He gets in good with the firm, befriending some of the top brokers and going from relatively weak on the phone into a lying, swindling sales hot shot. Eventually, he realizes J.T. Marlin is nothing more than a pump and dump chop shop peddling worthless penny stocks in a bucket scheme where the customer loses money on the stock while the firm keeps the profit and the broker a $2 commission per share purchased. He also has change of conscience when he scams an innocent man out of his life savings. Seth fights to get out of the situation before everything falls apart.The movie indeed is entertaining and the story interesting, but I just can't help but compare it to Wall Street. Seth Davis is no Bud Fox. Sheen played the role of Fox with the right about of naive innocence and slimy salesmanship. Ribisi keeps the same stoic expression, never seeming to change from the beginning of the movie to the end. The other thing is they both center around father-son relationships and how the sons want to impress their fathers. In Wall Street, you sensed the bond that the two had, which could have been helped by Martin Sheen playing the father role, but in Boiler Room, there seems to be no bond and by 21, if a son doesn't get along with his father, it seems like he'd have no interest in making that connection. Towards the end they have a great scene together, but the relationship seemed awkward for most of the movie. While Wall Street focused on a legitimate brokerage house in NYC which employed Ivy League graduates, Boiler Room is out in the cheaper suburbs, hiring likely blue collared kids with no degree. Maybe that's part of the movie's message, but it's hard to go from Wall Street to the suburbs if you watched Wall Street previously. The story just doesn't have the same punch or the same twists and turns of Wall Street. Ben Affleck does his best imitation of Blake from Glengarry Glen Ross, but it pales to the real thing and again just comes off derivative of Alec Baldwin. Also, there is a lot of unbelievability and things that don't make sense that happen too much in this film.It's entertaining for sure, but I'd stick with Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross if you want cautionary tales of high risk\/high reward investment careers.
