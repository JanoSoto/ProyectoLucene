Both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster give wonderful performances, although Foster's adopted accent can be grating.  Definitely a must-see; I consider it a modern classic.  The plot isn't terribly complicated, but still engrossing, and the character portrayal is phenomenal.  Both Clarice Starling's (Foster) and Hannibal Lecter's (Hopkins) characters are very well developed, and the movie just gets better the more times you see it, as you pick up on the details.  It is a little bloody in parts, but not obscenely so.  And if you just can't enough, watch Red Dragon and Hannibal too (though they're not quite as good as Silence of the Lambs)!

A film with no A-Listed actors, no director with a treasure trove of awards and the sheer name of the films title at an office water cooler would result in blank stares and crickets scratching their hind legs in the background.  Such was the case with the 1997 Australian gem, The Castle.Directed by Rob Sitch, who went on to help another underachieving treasure with The Dish, the story is about an Australian family's struggle to keep their home in lieu of being given a compulsory notice from the government that the airport is expanding where their house presently stands.  Although I try not to be simplistic and sum up an entire plot in as little as one sentence, really, that is all you need you know to enjoy this independent comedy.The family is played by a host of unknowns.  Michael Caton, Anne Tenney, Stephen Curry, Anthony Simcoe, Sophia Lee and Wayne Hope play Darryl, Sal, Dale, Steve, Tracy and Wayne Kerrigan.  The family lives a simple life and enjoys their time together to the fullest.  They complement each other at each dinner table, they watch television as a family unit and they spend their time discussing items listed for sale in the trades papers.  Their sister just got married and other than the eldest son being in jail for a crime the family holds no grudges, things could not be better.So when the government sends notice that they must leave their house for the airport expansion, they agree not to go down without a fight and they illicit the help of other street families and a local barrister that has no business defending in Federal Court.  You might think this all sounds very serious for a comedy plot line, but it's the exact opposite.  The story begins with a long narration from the youngest son who reflects on how proud he is of his family.  He talks about how each member bring a unique talent to the unit and how the father figure is the one that is full of positive reinforcement. The narration and visuals surrounding his description are Australian humor at its best.  Whether we are laughing at the fathers adoration and praise of simple tasks like the scooping of ice cream from a tub or the wonderment of family members over an invention of a motorcycle helmet with a brake light on the back, we marvel at the sheer naivety of the family and what it deems to be important.The best way to covey this functional family unit is to describe it as a family of Woody Boyd's from Cheers or a litter of Joey characters from Friends.  They all utter words we would deem obtuse, but it is all in good fun and it comes across as simple people simply observing their surroundings and commenting on how they interact with the world.  As example, when Dale Kerrigan is speaking of the family's fame after taking the matters to court, he narrates, `Dad said it was funny how one day you're not famous, and the next day you are. Famous. And then you're not again.'  There speech is entirely primitive, but funny in the same vein.To go into more detail about the film would give away too much and this film must really be viewed and enjoyed without expectation.  You may not belly laugh at any time during the short 84 minute running time, but I doubt you won't spend time shaking your head in reaction to something a Kerrigan family member utters with a &#145;I can't believe he just said that' notion. So I recommend The Castle.  I recommend it with pause.  It is an above average comedy that was made for less money than the cost of the Matrix end credits (They used the family name Kerrigan so they could use Kerrigan trucks during the shoot), but it can teach us a lot about the family unit.  Here is a group of simpletons that love each other, respect each other and will do anything to preserve their &#145;home'.   What better lesson is there than that?

Krull was one such film to jump aboard the band-wagon. There are also elements here of Robin Hood (the costumes look like they've been borrowed from natives of Sherwood Forest, and the hero is aided by a rogue's gallery of merry men) and Perseus and Andromeda (the hero has to complete several mini-tasks before he can get on with his main quest). Prince Colwyn (Ken Marshall) has just married the beautiful Princess Lyssa (Lysette Anthony) when their city is raided and the princess is kidnapped. She is taken away to a heavily defended citadel. Colwyn sets off to rescue her, and during the course of his quest he picks up additional companions, including a bumbling magician (David Battley), a courageous cyclops (Bernard Bresslaw), and a gang of honourable bandits (which includes Alun Armstrong, Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane). Krull is highly derivative, but reasonably entertaining. The special effects are decent for the time, but probably look a little primitive to over-spoilt modern eyes. Marshall's leading performance is extraordinarily bland, but his unashamed earnestness actually becomes part of the fun once you get used to the fact that he's trying desperately to play it seriously (without a shred of success!) The supporting characters are more interesting and are fairly well-played (despite the hopelessly hokey dialogue they have to contend with). In general, Krull is a likable movie which tries to keep up its lively pace, and manages to provide a fair number of thrills for youngsters and sci-fi afficianados. If you don't expect too much from it, you'll come away satisfied.
