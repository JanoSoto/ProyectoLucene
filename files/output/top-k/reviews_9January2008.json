Chungking Express is light and frothy, featuring funny monologues about the importance of pineapple preservation and a charming, aimless usage of Mama and the Papa's California Dreaming. It's about the search for romance in a city that is dark and dingy and full of holes someone could easily fall into. But what makes it so charming, and interesting ultimately in that European art-house way, is how Wong Kar Wai keeps a rhythm to his story that doesn't follow rules, but feels right in a sense like some off-beat song on an obscure album only your hip friend down the block has. I'm not sure who, in the end, I would recommend Chungking Express. Probably film buff friends who enjoy obsessions over pineapple and girls.There's also a very good performance turned in by actress Brigitte Lin, who before this was a (enormously popular) pop star, and is slightly used as opposed to cast by Kar Wai as a figurehead, like some flashy, self-conscious symbol of a mystery in and of itself (blond wig, going about the crevices of town on some criminal mystery, the music playing in tight but sweet strings). It's also great to see Tony Leung in an early role that allows him some space for some little notes of emotion we haven't seen in future Wong Kar Wai movies where he's the super-serious or melancholy lover. Not that there aren't moments of the melancholy in Chungking Express, but they're presented like it's the most important thing to the characters, and to the audience is, well, just another piece to their puzzle as a whole character. Little by little we see that this isn't much as a crime film in focusing on these two cops and this odd woman in a blond wig. Or even Fayes character. It's a question of what makes up these characters, when romance throws caution into the wind.I've seen Chungking Express in bits and pieces over the years, and while I will eventually get down and watch it from start to finish, all the pieces together (not to draw any sort of parallel in what I described and how I view the movie) stay fresh in my mind. I love revisiting the gil dancing to her own beat to California Dreaming, as if we're in the room too. I also love how Kar Wai flashes so many techniques into his story, the flashes of colors, the combinations and segues of film speeds and a kind of impressionistic style that puts up noir into a more emotional plane.

The Man Who Wasn't There is a late-40s, black and white, noir character study of a dull barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) who is much more complex than we are led to believe. Living his day-by-day life is dull and pointless to him. He's at a job that he never wanted to have, alienates himself in his own little world of quiet vacancy while everyone around him talks at a thousand miles an hour about things that have absolutely no interest to him. When a charismatic businessman comes to town and tells him about the new craze of dry cleaning that he needs a partner to go into business with.Crane sees this as his big opportunity to escape his meaningless life and uses his wife's (Frances McDormand) affair with her boss (James Gandolfini) to exploit him for $10,000. But it's this relatively simple act that sets the entire story aflame and ends in tragedy for every single character involved. I won't spoil anything, but each character seems to have karma working against them and in the end they all get what's coming to them.

That being said they do add a lot of complexity to the character of Ed Crane; the dull barber who's so much more than he seems.

The idea of producing parallel stories depicting the rise of a young Vito Corleone (played to perfection by Robert De Niro) and the loneliness and betrayal of Michael Corleone (the subtle and frighteningly intense Al Pacino) was a brilliant one. However, this is where the majority of the film's flaws lie. In creating these two separate stories, they made one much more interesting than the other. When watching the slow turn of paranoia and danger in Michael's life, all I can manage to think about is what will happen next in Vito Corleone's rise to becoming the Godfather. Either way, these are two of the strongest and most complex characters of all time. Vito loses his father, brother and mother to the same man who he luckily escapes from. He gains a family and rises to power, murdering another Don in the process in one of the most intensely suspenseful scenes of all time, and returns to confront this now bitter and alone man.The death of Don Ciccio is one of the strongest scenes of the film, and certainly portrays how much more brilliant De Niro is when he's playing quiet strength instead of shouting at the top of his lungs. In the late Don Ciccio, we also see a parallel to the story of Michael Corleone throughout the film. A man who is simply trying to keep his family in tact, while remaining at the same level of respect and power as his late father. Instead, he falls into a world of betrayal on all fronts and the constant paranoia of being at the top of the food chain. He begins to feel as though he is the strongest man, waiting for the inevitable opportunity for another to bring him to the grave (just like what Vito had previously done many years ago). This leads to a life of utter alienation, even from his family. Three images in this film portray the most sympathetic form of isolation in cinematic history (Michael looking out the window as Fredo sails away, Michael sitting in the park bench alone at the end, and Michael sitting alone at the dinner table while everyone else joyously surprises Vito on his birthday). We see the loneliness and rejection of a man who lives his life for his family, but eventually loses them all. The final dinner scene has so much complexity it left me stunned well after the credits rolled. Definitely a film that has earned it's iconic status, featuring two performances that rightfully lit the fuel for the two most acclaimed careers the film industry has ever seen.

Okay, works well enough. For some reason, the ship barely has enough working life-tubes to protect the entire crew from a hyperspace jump (which begs the question, how would they ever get patients back to where they are going.) After killing their captain, played by veteran actor Robert Forster, the recovering drug addict pilot played by James Spader takes over. After some needless sex scenes between Spader and a perpetually angry looking Angela Bassett, and even more needless sex scenes between Robin Tunny and Lou Diamond Philips, they rescue the lone survivor of a team that was scavenging the moon. Yes, this ship has zero gravity rooms on the sides that seem to provide no other function than giving characters a place to have sex in zero gravity. We discover that this survivor has found an alien artifact that looks like a giant sex toy, and is apparently the casing for a ninth-dimensional matter designed to destroy our universe. Meanwhile, it grants super powers to the survivor, who proceeds to go into Jason Vorhees mode and kill the rest of the crew.Now, if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, you can see that the writer\/director had a very different film in mind. Probably a director's cut would make a little more sense, but not much. It has a lot of science fiction conventions (like the life tubes and a huge ship with a small crew) that make little or no sense.

For some reason, the ship barely has enough working life-tubes to protect the entire crew from a hyperspace jump (which begs the question, how would they ever get patients back to where they are going.) After killing their captain, played by veteran actor Robert Forster, the recovering drug addict pilot played by James Spader takes over. After some needless sex scenes between Spader and a perpetually angry looking Angela Bassett, and even more needless sex scenes between Robin Tunny and Lou Diamond Philips, they rescue the lone survivor of a team that was scavenging the moon. Yes, this ship has zero gravity rooms on the sides that seem to provide no other function than giving characters a place to have sex in zero gravity. We discover that this survivor has found an alien artifact that looks like a giant sex toy, and is apparently the casing for a ninth-dimensional matter designed to destroy our universe. Meanwhile, it grants super powers to the survivor, who proceeds to go into Jason Vorhees mode and kill the rest of the crew.Now, if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD, you can see that the writer\/director had a very different film in mind. Probably a director's cut would make a little more sense, but not much. It has a lot of science fiction conventions (like the life tubes and a huge ship with a small crew) that make little or no sense. It also contains clichés like a malfunctioning android and a computer with a quirky personality, which are more annoying than helpful. The worst, of course, is the acting. One can only conclude that the actors realized fairly early on that this was going to be crap, and started phoning it in. Bassett is the worst of the lot, and I've seen her put in better performances in much cheaper movies.Even the trailer is instructive, as it tried to almost portray the movie as a light comedy which it clearly wasn't, scoring it with music that didn't belong in the film...Perhaps when they do the director's cut, they will explain how bad they screwed it up...

Like with all of Minghella's work, every single character is so layered and complex. He takes time and devotion to give each character a sufficient amount of intricacy that we truly feel like we know these people and when one of them feels pain, we do as well. When one of them is joyous (the rain scene, for instance) our faces light up with glee.There's Hana, the caring nurse who is too afraid of love to let anyone near her since right from the start the two closest people to her are destroyed by the war. Slowly her friendship with Almasy becomes stronger and stronger and it gives her the courage and determination to pursue a sexual relationship with Kip, who is also a very complex character. On the surface we see him as a kind man, who is very spiritual and loving. But near the end he realizes how isolated he is and the fact that he barely even knew his best friend whom he worked side by side with for years sends him into a complete breakdown. This leads to a very emotional scene, where Binoche really shines. Next up there is David Caravaggio, a spy who eventually gets captured and loses his thumbs while being tortured for information. He sets out on a vengeance to murder everyone connected to his capture, which leads him to Almasy, his final target. But being around Almasy and realizing the pain and suffering that he has been through leads him to look deep inside himself and realize that he doesn't need his revenge. He relieves himself of all this pain and anguish and in the end we see him with a bright grin, just happy to be alive, thumbs or not.Katharine Clifton is a character very similar to those in the past, but she has an extra spark that makes her very unique. As her husband spends less and less attention to her, she becomes involved in a tumultuous love affair with Almasy which leads to some of the most beautifully romantic scenes ever brought to cinema. Minghella easily could have made her another whiny, confused housewife who just passed in and out of the film with no real connection the audience but he bestowed her with a certain grace and dignity which made us want her to have a happy ending and made us adore seeing her and Almasy enjoying each other's company. Even Geoffrey Clifton becomes a layered character when we learn that he isn't venturing off to do photographs, but is instead helping the army explore territory. So while he could have just been another ignorant husband to an adulterous wife, Minghella adds intricacy to him. And of course the entire story all revolves around Almasy, the man who would do anything, even sell out his country to the enemy, just to be with the woman he loved. A truly romantic and beautiful tale.What I found very interesting, though, was how Minghella subtly displays the horrors and terrible effects that war has on the people that aren't even physically fighting it. Through Hana we see a woman who is permanently destroyed and almost unable to love due to the fact that this awful war took away everyone who became close to her. In Kip we see a man who is so blinded by his job and duty to his country that he never even takes the time to appreciate the man he considers his best friend. Caravaggio takes abuse after abuse, with unimaginable pain being inflicted on him as a result of the war. The Cliftons are a loving couple, who have no troubles whatsoever until the war starts and Geoffrey is off helping his country while Katharine becomes involved in an affair. But the most horrific effect of war is shown constantly through Almasy's story. All he wanted was love and companionship, but the war wouldn't allow him that. He only gets his love because of the war, and due to it's changing seriousness his love is ripped away from him and he falls into complete heartache. Then we see him reclaim this love, and he does whatever he can to save her life. But, as Binoche mentions early on the film, when war times come even your name means a great deal. We see this terribly through Almasy who is beaten, dragged away and arrested merely due to his name when all he was trying to do was save the woman he loved. Of course we see the effect of war physically through Almasy in the horrific burning of his entire body. This film shows no huge war scenes and terrible travesties that blow off limbs and open chest cavities, but it manages to send an anti-war message stronger than I've ever seen before. No physical battle is shown, whatsoever, yet it makes me absolutely detest war due to the effect that it has on those who aren't even directly involved.As always for a Minghella work, the performances are absolutely brilliant. Fiennes, Binoche, Thomas and Dafoe deliver some of the best work of the decade. Simply through their eyes we can see all of the pain and emotion searing through them. The right actors were definitely cast in this one. We never hear them shout or break down into a ten minute fit of crying and throwing objects across the room, but we see all of their anguish and torture simply through their eyes and facial expressions. It's a beautifully subtle way of showing emotion and really helped make the film the brilliant masterpiece that it is. I highly doubt that any other cast could have pulled it off so seamlessly.

No, not this film; this one, like so few others, stays with you at least a few days after the viewing for all the right reasons. I would say this is similar in a broad sense that it is large and epic in its power and punch; similar to Apocalypse Now, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Forrest Gump as well as rather a few others from what I've seen in the sense it his you where you don't expect it and stays with you for a while afterwards.Rain Man, I suppose, is essentially a buddy movie that takes place on the road. Planes, Trains and Automobiles as well as the Lethal Weapon films and Midnight Run were enjoying success round about the time but where this is in no way a cop thriller or an out and out comedy, it is arguably the best of the bunch in its chosen genre; the road movie. What I like most about Rain Man is that it is sad without being too tragic; it is driven emotionally without the need for nasty deaths that may await its characters around the corner, nor does it rely on tragedies such as loosing loved ones or befalling a certain terrible event. Rain Man is pure emotion put across through brilliant acting as well as the certain situations that Charlie (Cruise) must adapt to in order to solve the problem that his brother Raymond (Hoffman) has got himself into.Rain Man is extremely simple in its set up yet deadly clinical in its execution. The upbeat 80s song playing over a really cool looking car seemingly gliding through the air as it's unloaded off a boat sets the scene perfectly for its character introduction of Charlie. We see the space he inhabits it is a large and open warehouse which has some things inside of it but rather empty on the whole. Two colleagues; one of which is Susana (Golino) who is the girlfriend, rapidly try to keep in check with people on the phone as brand new sports cars idly wait by the side. This sums Cruise's character up perfectly a big and active but perhaps empty in places life that is chaotic; yet he still has friends to back him up when he needs it &#150; the cars signify the 'coolness' Charlie possesses where as the empty space that is the rest of the warehouse perhaps signifies his lack of a real family. Raymond on the other hand inhabits a smaller and more concentrated space at the hospital; an almost childlike room that screams of innocence.But to call Raymond a child is incorrect. There is a seemingly pointless scene in the middle of the film where Raymond gets distressed over the fact he may miss a TV programme so they have to stop at a random house to find a TV. The kids in the house want to watch cartoons but Raymond isn't excited by the prospect at all; he watches his programme and the rest of the children seem bored by it suggesting Raymond has at some level, an area that isn't of an infantile nature. This in itself creates a new argument. It is apparent Raymond is autistic but through deeper knowledge, he suffers from a severe form of Asperger's Syndrome which means any break from formation or routine results in high anxiety. This is where the film challenges you to laugh. Do we find Raymond and his misadventures funny? The scene where they have to stop to watch a television doesn't advance the plot at all; it merely highlights the problem he has but is it played for laughs? Another example is the scene in which Raymond quotes the waitresses address and phone number because he can remember what he reads (last night he read the phone book A-G). Rather than laugh out loud at this, we may chuckle if we're familiar with Asperger's Syndrome but would others laugh at the absurdity of being able to recall her exact information? Similar scenes are when Raymond counts the toothpicks; repeats the radio jingle and is interested in the sexual noises coming from Charlie's hotel room. Again, is it funny that this happens or is it just a scene highlighting the symptoms of the illness. Director and Screenwriter alike are putting across humour and information that we may laugh at, cry at or learn from genius.But rather than be a documentary of any sort, the films would have its characters go through a journey. What's tragic is that we don't know whether or not Raymond realises he has done so. Charlie, I feel, changes from his old yuppie self and develops a nicer side. He learns what it means to have a family. He says so himself that his mother died when he was two; a father he hated and ran away from at 16 and a brother he only discovered the other day. As well as this, he realises that love interests aren't something to be toyed with since Susana leaves him when she sniffs evidence of Charlie using Raymond to get his inheritance. Charlie learns what it means to behave correctly when it comes to love and family ties and both characters share epiphanies at various points. To have the two heroes start the 'road movie' as one type of individual and have them finish it someone completely internally different is a difficult yet powerful thing to achieve but Rain Man absolutely nails it dead centre. With few real bad things to say about the film, it is no wonder I loved it so much.

Raymond on the other hand inhabits a smaller and more concentrated space at the hospital; an almost childlike room that screams of innocence.But to call Raymond a child is incorrect. There is a seemingly pointless scene in the middle of the film where Raymond gets distressed over the fact he may miss a TV programme so they have to stop at a random house to find a TV. The kids in the house want to watch cartoons but Raymond isn't excited by the prospect at all; he watches his programme and the rest of the children seem bored by it suggesting Raymond has at some level, an area that isn't of an infantile nature. This in itself creates a new argument. It is apparent Raymond is autistic but through deeper knowledge, he suffers from a severe form of Asperger's Syndrome which means any break from formation or routine results in high anxiety. This is where the film challenges you to laugh. Do we find Raymond and his misadventures funny? The scene where they have to stop to watch a television doesn't advance the plot at all; it merely highlights the problem he has but is it played for laughs? Another example is the scene in which Raymond quotes the waitresses address and phone number because he can remember what he reads (last night he read the phone book A-G). Rather than laugh out loud at this, we may chuckle if we're familiar with Asperger's Syndrome but would others laugh at the absurdity of being able to recall her exact information? Similar scenes are when Raymond counts the toothpicks; repeats the radio jingle and is interested in the sexual noises coming from Charlie's hotel room. Again, is it funny that this happens or is it just a scene highlighting the symptoms of the illness. Director and Screenwriter alike are putting across humour and information that we may laugh at, cry at or learn from genius.But rather than be a documentary of any sort, the films would have its characters go through a journey. What's tragic is that we don't know whether or not Raymond realises he has done so. Charlie, I feel, changes from his old yuppie self and develops a nicer side. He learns what it means to have a family. He says so himself that his mother died when he was two; a father he hated and ran away from at 16 and a brother he only discovered the other day. As well as this, he realises that love interests aren't something to be toyed with since Susana leaves him when she sniffs evidence of Charlie using Raymond to get his inheritance. Charlie learns what it means to behave correctly when it comes to love and family ties and both characters share epiphanies at various points. To have the two heroes start the 'road movie' as one type of individual and have them finish it someone completely internally different is a difficult yet powerful thing to achieve but Rain Man absolutely nails it dead centre. With few real bad things to say about the film, it is no wonder I loved it so much.

Box-office poison actress Joan Crawford was cast in the title role, and won an Oscar for her performance. The film is easily Crawford's best- never a great actress, she was instead a great star, and MILDRED PIERCE is probably the best example of this.Curtiz's direction is admirable in this well-made Cain adaptation, and the great black-and-white cinematography, full of shadows suggesting ambiguity, is a real plus for this film noir. The film, while nowhere near perfect, is nevertheless quite compelling, with Mildred, a housewife turned career woman, sacrificing everything for the love of her spoiled, vain and pretty much venomous daughter Veda (Ann Blyth, Oscar-nominated and absolutely infuriating). For her troubles (clothes, music lessons, money) Veda pays her back by sleeping with Mildred's rat of a second husband. Yes, she's one little bitch, that's for sure.The film, pure melodrama with a noirish bite, is well-cast with a number of solid supporting players. Jack Carsob, Eve Arden, Zachary Scott and Bruce Bennett all add considerable class (or with Scott's slimy second husband, none whatsoever)to the Warners production. This noir is unusual in that it is a female-driven narrative, with Crawford providing the voice-over narration (the film is told in flashback after a particularly exciting opening), and the two women, mother and daughter, having most of the available screen time.Overall, it's a pretty good film, not great (it slides into melodrama quite often and seems to take a little too long driving it's point home), but definitely worthwhile.

Whether it's good or bad tends to get lost under its iconic, pseudo-hip status. Fans quote its quirky dialogue, delight in the overt violence and sexuality and marvel over its philosophical message-making, but if that were all there was to it Clockwork Orange would be a pretty poor film.Clockwork Orange is perhaps the most extreme example of the Kubrick technical style &#150; a kind of formal method which instantly distinguishes his films. And bizarrely, it's all based around the game of chess. While he had by now dropped all the actual references to the game which peppered his earliest films, Kubrick had begun directing as if he were playing chess. Look at the camera movements. With a few exceptions, the camera only moves as if it was a chess piece &#150; forwards, backwards, left and right. The actors also move like opposing chess pieces, more often than not directly towards the camera or across the shot.Kubrick was always meticulous and extravagant in conveying an idea and an atmosphere not just through performances but through set and costume design, sound, music and lighting. In the first part of Clockwork Orange (the first half-hour or so, up until Alex is arrested) every aspect of every shot expresses the collision between formal sophistication and crude roughness. So we have violent youngsters wearing bowler hats, the mural with penises grafittied onto it, classical music played on synthesisers and so on. It's a world full of images we recognise, but is at the same time as deliberately outlandish as possible. Compare this to the next section of the film, in the prison, where everything becomes realistic and contemporary, although the atmosphere is equally unnerving.Clockwork Orange also represents the peak of the growing musical dimension of Kubrick's films. It is what the director Michael Powell referred to as a composed film &#150; one where the images play out like a piece of music. As I've hinted at above it's structured in contrasting movements which reference and counterpoint each other, like a classical symphony. However there's also the musical element to individual scenes.

It's not quite the classic it's reputed to be, and the statement it makes about free will isn't really all that profound.

To some people, it's pure garbage, but anyone who can see it for what I perceive it as- pure satire- will love it.Starship Troopers is loosely based off a Robert Heinlein novel. I haven't read the novel, but the way I see it, the makers of Starship Troopers completely changed the entire tone of the book, adding loads of sarcasm and references to fascism.The driving force behind Starship Troopers seems to be a fascist ideal; the main character, Johnny Rico, feels pressured to join the military by the government's giving special treatment to people who enlist (such as the privilege to vote) and society and the media's glorification of military life. His parents are strongly against it, but he enlists; after all, as he puts it, he doesn't need his parents when the Federation (a governing body that seems to control the entire planet) can take care of his every need. After the obligatory but always fun boot camp scene, the rest is pure action as the Earth goes to war with a deceptively intelligent race of bugs from the other side of the universe.If you don't get the fascist references and the very sarcastic and satirical humor, Starship Troopers will seem like across as the worst film ever made. It definitely comes across as a bad film sometimes, but it's all purposefully done in mockery of old sci-fi shows (there's definitely some pokes at Star Trek), and in particular, war films. Starship Troopers contains many a stirring speech about patriotism that could've been lifted right out of a John Wayne film. The acting- virtually all of it, every performance- is up to 50's standards, and thus perfect for the film. While there are a lot of serious situations, a lot of the situations are still comic, in a way... it's hard to describe.Besides all the fascist mumbo jumbo, Starship Troopers gives the viewer a good time, which is what really matters. The action scenes and computer graphics are incredible, good enough for an Oscar nomination, and I'm sure it would have won the Oscar if it had been more of an Academy-type movie because I don't think better computer graphics had been achieved up to the time Starship Troopers came out. The film has a good story, but especially a good way of telling the story one of its unique features is three or four short propaganda films for the Federation. They're not only hilarious and entertaining, but they're an extremely clever way of filling in background information and moving the story along.A few years ago, it seemed like there was a lot of badmouthing about Starship Troopers, how unbelievably awful it was and stuff like that. Now I guess more people get it; I'd say that it's considered a classic by the public. Some people aren't fans of sarcasm or jaw-dropping action, and those people probably can't stand this film. But I can't understand how anyone can dislike sarcasm or action, so I can't understand how anyone could not love Starship Troopers.

The acting- virtually all of it, every performance- is up to 50's standards, and thus perfect for the film. While there are a lot of serious situations, a lot of the situations are still comic, in a way... it's hard to describe.Besides all the fascist mumbo jumbo, Starship Troopers gives the viewer a good time, which is what really matters. The action scenes and computer graphics are incredible, good enough for an Oscar nomination, and I'm sure it would have won the Oscar if it had been more of an Academy-type movie because I don't think better computer graphics had been achieved up to the time Starship Troopers came out. The film has a good story, but especially a good way of telling the story one of its unique features is three or four short propaganda films for the Federation. They're not only hilarious and entertaining, but they're an extremely clever way of filling in background information and moving the story along.A few years ago, it seemed like there was a lot of badmouthing about Starship Troopers, how unbelievably awful it was and stuff like that. Now I guess more people get it; I'd say that it's considered a classic by the public. Some people aren't fans of sarcasm or jaw-dropping action, and those people probably can't stand this film. But I can't understand how anyone can dislike sarcasm or action, so I can't understand how anyone could not love Starship Troopers. ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"9 January 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Full of tongue-in-cheek clichés, dark humor, and ridiculous action, Starship Troopers is a sassy and bold film, and one that's often misunderstood. To some people, it's pure garbage, but anyone who can see it for what I perceive it as- pure satire- will love it.Starship Troopers is loosely based off a Robert Heinlein novel. I haven't read the novel, but the way I see it, the makers of Starship Troopers completely changed the entire tone of the book, adding loads of sarcasm and references to fascism.The driving force behind Starship Troopers seems to be a fascist ideal; the main character, Johnny Rico, feels pressured to join the military by the government's giving special treatment to people who enlist (such as the privilege to vote) and society and the media's glorification of military life. His parents are strongly against it, but he enlists; after all, as he puts it, he doesn't need his parents when the Federation (a governing body that seems to control the entire planet) can take care of his every need. After the obligatory but always fun boot camp scene, the rest is pure action as the Earth goes to war with a deceptively intelligent race of bugs from the other side of the universe.If you don't get the fascist references and the very sarcastic and satirical humor, Starship Troopers will seem like across as the worst film ever made. It definitely comes across as a bad film sometimes, but it's all purposefully done in mockery of old sci-fi shows (there's definitely some pokes at Star Trek), and in particular, war films.

The film is a noirish triller yet it is also a perfectly crafted character study. As with most of Minghella's work, the bulk of the film lies in contrasts between characters. First there is the contrast between Ripley and Dickie. Ripley is a poor man who has lived his entire life in isolation, and dreams of having a life like Dickie's. Dickie, though, takes his wonderful life for granted. On the surface he is a joyous man who basks in the magnificence of his life, and Ripley loves this. He does whatever he can to become best friends with Dickie.But slowly, Ripley realizes that Dickie isn't the perfect man he originally thought him to be. He takes everything for granted, and this is mainly displayed through Marge. She is the perfect woman in Ripley's eyes, and he is jealous that Dickie can be with such a flawless creation. However, he sees that Dickie doesn't care about her at all. He sleeps with other women, and doesn't appreciate Marge for the glorious woman she truly is. This begins Ripley's turn towards Dickie.The arrival of Freddie is a catalyst for the complete shift of Ripley and Dickie's relationship. The contrast of Freddie and Ripley is also a very interesting one. Ripley is a relatively dull man who takes everything in and appreciates what he has. Freddie, on the other hand, is extremely charismatic yet, much like Dickie, takes his luxuries and good fortune for granted. He is an immature, disrespectful man and Ripley sees this from the start. But Dickie becomes more drawn to Freddie's charisma, as a result of being so close to Ripley's dullness for so long. This makes Ripley even more angry, and it also leads Dickie to the realization that his friendship with Ripley has really played itself out and he has nothing left to gain from it. So, when Dickie decides to end their friendship, all of the bottled up anger and thoughts between the two of them come out and it ultimately leads to Dickie's death.Instead of being overwhelmed with guilt and pain, Ripley sees this as an opportunity to live the life that Dickie took for granted. He takes over his life and lives it to it's fullest. In this fake life that he has created for himself, he even finds his own Marge in the form of Meredith. The similarities between the two of them are overwhelming, through appearance, personality, even the fact that their first names start with an M. But living his life as Dickie becomes more and more difficult for Ripley. Marge becomes increasingly suspicious when she runs into Ripley at the opera and his stories become more and more unbelievable, especially to the whereabouts of Dickie.This all comes to another climax when Freddie comes back into the picture and realizes that Ripley is leading a fake life as Dickie. This leads to another necessary death in order for Ripley to keep his perfect life alive. But with another death comes more complications, and as Marge continues to be suspicious, the police start to close in on the truth. Ripley takes an opportunity to pick up and leave, leaving behind a suicide note as Dickie which claims that he also killed Freddie. However, Dickie's father hires a private investigator to investigate these curious deaths.Eventually, everything sorts itself out perfectly for Ripley as Dickie's past comes to haunt him and everything becomes cleaned up with everyone believing that Dickie committed suicide and was responsible for the murder of Freddie. Marge, however knows the truth and all of her initial thoughts on Ripley are completely shifted into sheer hatred. Ripley ignores this though, and starts a new life with Marge's friend Peter. But living a life of lies still haunts him as Meredith finds him, believing him to be Dickie, on a yacht vacation with Peter.So, once again another murder must be committed to keep himself free from prosecution. This one proves to be the most emotionally painful for him yet because, since Meredith is with people who have already seen Ripley there, he has to kill the new love of his life Peter who has done absolutely nothing wrong. The abrupt ending is certainly one of my favorites. It shows that Ripley's life of pain and isolation will never end due to his greed and life of deceit. The mistakes of his past ensure that he will never find complete happiness and the final image is one of pain and absolute isolation.I didn't even talk about the performances, which are all amazing seeing as it's one of the greatest casts of all time. From Damon all the way down to Philip Baker Hall, everyone knocks their part out of the park. Jude Law's charismatic, seductive portrayal is surely the highlight as we delve further and further into his ultimately dark and selfish character. Damon, Paltrow and Philip Seymour Hoffman also deliver very praise-worthy performances. Definitely one of my favorite films.

Experiencing it for the first time, I was shocked, bewildered, and entertained by Stan's search for confidence, Kyle's moral compass, Eric's obnoxious personality, and Kenny's death. The Terrance and Philip movie has swept through South Park. It is so profanity laden, the kids of South Park are imitating the art. This provokes a violent reaction by the parents, it eventually leads to the capture of Terrance and Philip. Since they are Canadian, our neighbor to the north decides to declare war on the U.S. Meanwhile, Satan plans to use the war, particularly the execution of Terrance and Philip to usher in his new reign on the Earth. I will first get a few gripes out of the way. While The Simpsons uses subtle irony and satire to provoke thought, South Park hits the audience over the head with a shovel. There is no subtlety. In fact, sometimes the spirit is downright mean and vicious. In fact, sometimes it slaps fundamentalist puritanical culture with the same hatred it dishes out. This is the predominant weakness of South Park. Parker and Stone work so hard to shock and offend, they often sacrifice that for the message they try to get across. Also, the lovers spat between Saddam Hussein and the Devil was really drawn out too long, making the movie about 20 minutes too long. But there are some things that work. The best part is the humor that rests in both irony and unpredictable dialog and situations. One of my favorite parts was having Cartman rigged up to a V-chip that gives him a shock every time he utters a curse word. Another good scene involves the rescue of Terrance and Philip amidst a very strange USO show featuring Big Gay Al. Another involves the U.S. military strategists shooting Bill Gates for making Windows 98 too hard to handle. What really got me to like this movie, though, was its overbearing satire. Despite the shock factor, most people will get what Parker and Stone are trying to say. At one point, Kyle tries to dissuade his Mom from her vendetta against Terrance and Philip. However, she is so wrapped up in stopping their filth, she forgets to pay attention to her son. Also, one musical number stands out Blame Canada. Apparently, the parents of South Park were so outraged at Terrance and Phlip, they break into song. Their battle cry is to blame Canada before someone thinks of blaming us! South Park does push the limit of good taste ... but that is what makes it fun. You could enjoy it ... if you are not too easily offended.

Trailer trash Connie (Molly Hagan) is married to good for nothing Rusty (Michael Dudikoff). He's sleeping with her and her daughter Angel (Jaime Pressly) who is his step daughter. Also Angel is dating Willie who Connie seduces! Another story involves Demond (Michael Jai White) who's sleeping with someone and her best friend. They all get on the show and things go out of control.I'm no fan of Jerry Springer's show. I find it sickening--these poor people and their problems are paraded in front of an audience who judges them. I find the scenes where the audience cheers and applauds when people are physically fighting very disturbing. I saw this movie out of pure curiosity. In some ways I found it terrible--in others, quite interesting.The characters and situations here are fictional and that makes it easier to take. Also the acting here is actually pretty good--even Dudikoff (who I never liked) gives a good performance. Only White is bad. His character is a complete jerk but he plays it so badly I didn't know how to take it. However he's a very attractive man with a great body and is introduced almost completely nude! I THINK this was supposed to be a comedy but I found the final confrontation on the show more harrowing than funny. The nonstop swearing and fighting was just hard to watch. As for Springer--he's hardly in it. That's a good thing because I hated him. They show him hosting the show and, after the people are attacking each other and swearing, he stands there with a sad look on his face and nodding his head. On one hand he's saying isn't this sad--on the other he's rubbing our face in it. I just find that kind of behavior revolting. So--as a drama this movie works. It's pretty well written with good acting. As a comedy it's just too sick to be funny. It's not the disaster I was expecting. I give it a 6.

Trailer trash Connie (Molly Hagan) is married to good for nothing Rusty (Michael Dudikoff). He's sleeping with her and her daughter Angel (Jaime Pressly) who is his step daughter. Also Angel is dating Willie who Connie seduces! Another story involves Demond (Michael Jai White) who's sleeping with someone and her best friend. They all get on the show and things go out of control.I'm no fan of Jerry Springer's show. I find it sickening--these poor people and their problems are paraded in front of an audience who judges them. I find the scenes where the audience cheers and applauds when people are physically fighting very disturbing. I saw this movie out of pure curiosity. In some ways I found it terrible--in others, quite interesting.The characters and situations here are fictional and that makes it easier to take. Also the acting here is actually pretty good--even Dudikoff (who I never liked) gives a good performance. Only White is bad. His character is a complete jerk but he plays it so badly I didn't know how to take it. However he's a very attractive man with a great body and is introduced almost completely nude!

I usually predict somethings about the films i'm about to see based on pure preconceptions, somethings i got from previews viewings of films from the producers\/actors\/directors i'm about to watch, the title of the film (it usually suggests a lot to me just to know the title) or pure intuition. This was this last case.What we have here is a noir made in the beginning of a decade of interesting aspects for American cinema it was not experimental as the 30' (which were exploring the possibilities of a renewed medium, which had gained the possibilities of synchronized sound\/image) nor as established in a genre and a sense of style as the 40'. So, in a way, it was rather undefined. But films like this one tell me that it was no longer a period for noir as the 40' (and to that matter, John Huston) defined it. The Maltese falcon changed (or maybe summarized) some conventions and introduced new possibilities in film narrative devices, and that legacy went on to be developed and still has new steps being taken today. But that style, the very appreciated hats, detectives, shadow\/light which were the more visible face (and to many viewers incorrectly regarded as the essence of noir) don't work here anymore. I'm still trying to find a film noir post Sunset Boulevard that really works. This is not it.Start with Macao. It was in theory a good city to place a story of this kind. Even if the reality described in the introduction of the film is probably a tremendous exaggeration (and invention) over what really happened in Macao those days, that is an exaggeration one is willing to accept, for cinematic richness. A side complaint is the portrayal of the Portuguese policeman. The fat moustache corrupt guy is a preconception i suppose many Europeans had (some may still have it today) regarding the Portuguese. I don't know the ideas American had on this, but this stylizations upsets today, but probably in 20 years from now there preconceptions we see on today's films that will be noted. Anyway, i get in many many American films with more than 30 years a lot of situations like this (the Japanese from Breakfast at Tiffany's comes to my mind right now). Anyway Macao starts as a promise in the voice off, but ends as a dull slightly oriental slightly generic studio set, with no great interest beyond what was described of it.Behind this there was the controlling and charismatic (rich) H.Hughes. He was probably very controlling regarding his productions (he was himself someone who had got into the delicate work of directing). He places two of his fetishes here Mitchum and Russell. So, we had Hughes, wanting to create a classic noir picture. In order to do that he calls a competent (more than competent) director, who precisely been able to bring out some very competent work in placing stories in strange exotic sceneries; Hughes, knowing that, searches a typical noir scenario, not fresh, not interesting (or at least not interestingly explored). The plot is not even near anything interesting from the previous decade. Is there any doubt somewhere in the plot? What don't we know? Don't we know who is controlling the story? Is there any ambiguity regarding any character? Grahame was the woman in the story who might have brought some ambiguity regarding the god in the story, the puppeteer controlling actions on the viewers back, but is totally misused. The scene with Mitchum and Russell in the boat too much near the beginning throws away any ambiguity or game there might occur between both. Mitchum is just about walking around in white suit, portraying his americanhood. Russell might have been seductive and mysterious to Hughes eyes, but here she was an ordinary woman, fully out passed by Grahame in the much less scenes where she performed. Russell had better moments in films. So this is nostalgic, i had interesting in watching it, but it didn't live up to my expectations.My opinion 2\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This time my intuition failed.
