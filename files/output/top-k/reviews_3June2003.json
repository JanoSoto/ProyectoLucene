On his recommendation I read Farley Mowat's Never Cry Wolf and finagled my theater-phobic parents into taking me to see the film shortly thereafter.Its impact on me, partially because of my love for the subject matter, has been lifelong.Although the film does not always capture the humor of Mowat's narrative, it does a brilliant job of portraying, with patience that may grate on the nerves of blockbuster-seasoned moviegoers, the experience of its protagonist.  Complaints that the film does not focus enough on the wolves are understandable, but the book and the movie are about one man's journey to understanding the wolf's place in a natural ecosystem.  He must learn to be like them, understand their behavior (which mirrors humans' in so many ways), and ultimately choose a loyalty to one or the other species.It is advisable that the viewer adopt expectations similar to those for a National Geographic documentary, although the story is only loosely based in fact.  Sometimes things happen slowly in the arctic. Sometimes they don't happen at all, or the things that happen are not what you'd want out of the plot.  Cinematography and the environment are stunning.  Charles Martin Smith's Tyler is a regular guy, without spectacular heroics (but brave enough to tackle activities Fear Factor contestants won't touch for a pile of money).Because it was filmed entirely on location and without pretense of special effects, its visuals stand up very well in comparison to the films of today. Its pace is the sticking point that will make it unpalatable to some viewers, but I give it a rarely-awarded 9 rating for its beauty, social conscience and thorough enjoyability, taking away 1 point only for its somewhat heavy-handed finale that is less palatable than Mowat's original message.

No comment is necessary here on the story of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--we all know it and admire it by now. Occasionally, a film comes along which makes it into the 'top ten', e.g Saving Private Ryan, Dave, Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful etc. However The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is, was and I reckon always will be my numero uno. I enjoy the film as much today as when I first saw it in 1967. In 1968 I WALKED eleven miles to a local town to see it and walked home again! Some thirty five years ago! No Videos, or DVD's in those days! I also, when I got my first car, drove to whichever local cinema the GBU was showing on the night. When I eventually got a video version I thought all my birthdays had arrived at once. What's more, I was lucky enough to get the version which I had never seen before and is seldom seen since on TV, where the captions to each character appear in English, i.e THE GOOD, THE BAD, and THE UGLY, instead of IL BUONO, IL BRUTTO, IL CATTIVO, and a version which contain extra unseen (at that time)footage, eg. when Angel eyes gives Maria (Bill Carson's girl)a bigger hiding than we usually saw on the cinema version and when Wallace gives Tuco the severe beating in the POW camp, it goes on much longer than I had seen in other versions. Only recently I obtained the DVD, showing some scenes which were shot in Italian, but never in English and never incorporated in the final English spoken version. (They were in a Director's Cut version on a German channel some time back, but I suppose it was easy to incorporate them in a German version, which was dubbed anyway into German). I look forward to some method of digitally adding them to the English speaking version. These scenes were and would be still important to the continuity and understanding of the scenes. One is were Lee van Cleef, during his quest for Bill Carson, visits a military hospital. He sees the absolute horror of war and this is the only time that his character becomes almost human. He shakes his head in disbelief at the futility of the war. (Eastwood echos this belief in the futility of the war in a later scene at the bridge.) Another scene shows more of the torture that Tuco put's Eastwood's character through in the desert. A quite funny scene too! and two scenes, one before the arrival at the monastry and one after leaving, which helps the viewer to understand the whole Pablo Ramirez and Monastry scenes better. However the DVD did not show one scene which I saw on the German version. One typical Eastwood scene, where he outdraws and shoots three of van Cleef's henchmen. It is also my all time favourite soundtrack. Favourite scene- Blondie and Tuco carrying the stretcher through the wounded and dead soldiers, two soldiers pass by, Blondie and Tuco lift an arm and a leg of a body, the two soldiers pass on, Blondie and Tuco drop the limbs like two lumps of meat. Favourite script - Tuco-(while reading paper message) It's for you, iidd, idii, ii-- Blondie- (reaching for paper) idiot ! Tuco-  (Glancing up)  Huh? Blondie-(handing him the paper) It's for you !.

Ernst brings to the silver screen a sequel of sorts to the Nineteen-forty animation masterpiece, Fantasia. This time around there is a whole new variety of musical sequences, with a a vast array of new characters, including The Steadfast Soldier and the colossal Firebird, as well as the return of everyone's favorite mouse, Mickey, in his unforgettable role as the bumbling Sorcerer's Apprentice. All sequences are accompanied by a beautiful score, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and conducted by musical genius James Levine. So for an unforgettable visual and musical journey, that will appeal to generations new and old, Disney invites you to visit Fantasia 2000.Fantasia 2000's segments are presented by Disney animated favorites such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Featured in the presentations is a star-studded live action cast, including Steve Martin, James Earl Jones of Disney's Academy award winning The Lion King, Bette Middler, and the extremely talented Angela Lansbury, who supplied the voice for Mrs.Potts in Disney's hugely popular feature Beauty and the Beast. The list goes on with the impressive names that show up in this film, but again the spotlight is really on the film's animated stars.Fantasia 2000 is certainly a commendable and worthwhile sequel but by no means is it near as impressive as its predecessor. The animation for the film is really something to behold, especially in the film's book-ending sequences Symphony #5, in which a group of stunning whales travel through a beautiful icy ocean, and Firebird, in which the title character spreads a wave of fire throughout the land destroying anything it touches. It also utilizes a unique blend of old and new style animation throughout, but its just seemed to lack the ingenuity and amazement of the first. I realize that in the film they brought back the Sorcerer's Apprentice for fans of the first, but I saw it as nothing more a lack of originality and a time-filler in a film that really could have used a bit more length, especially for the Pomp and Circumstance sequence. My apologies to those who may take offense, but if I wanted to watch Mickey mess up the Sorcerer's palace again I would just go out and rent the original. Yet I must admit the musical pieces donated by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are spectacular, and do help to elevate this film a few notches.All in all, Fantasia 2000 is a good film, especially so I'm sure for those who caught a viewing of its Eyemax theatrical release. As I have before mentioned it is not as intelligent and original as the first film, and while it should be pointed out that sixty years later it is much harder to be original, I still find Disney could have displayed a bit more creativity and imagination with this effort, but they certainly could have done worse.

Yet I must admit the musical pieces donated by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are spectacular, and do help to elevate this film a few notches.All in all, Fantasia 2000 is a good film, especially so I'm sure for those who caught a viewing of its Eyemax theatrical release. As I have before mentioned it is not as intelligent and original as the first film, and while it should be pointed out that sixty years later it is much harder to be original, I still find Disney could have displayed a bit more creativity and imagination with this effort, but they certainly could have done worse. Now if your family is only capable of traveling to a different world for an hour and half then I would suggest a visit to Fantasia yet if you have an additional hour and a half then venture onward to Fantasia 2000.Overall Rating 7 out of 10  ","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"3 June 2003","score":"","review":"  I recently rented this film and noted that some of the first few scenes seem to be taken right out of Heaven Can Wait.

After being abducted by Michael Myers and a band of evil druids, Jamie Lloyd makes a desperate attempt to escape their clutches. Along with Michael's child, Jaimie returns to the once quiet town of Haddonfield but is quickly pursued by Michael, who needs the child back to set a most unholy plan into motion. Jamie's only hope of keeping the child from Michael lies in Tommy Doyle, the boy who years earlier was traumatized by Michael while he was being cared for by Laurie Strode, as well as Dr. Sam Loomis, Michael's former psychiatrist turned arch-nemesis. Michael's plan becomes more sinister than they first anticipate as Michael involves Kara Strode and her adopted parents who now reside in the old Myer house. Stopping Michael was never an easy task before, but now, hell bent on carrying out his mission of death, and being helped along by the cunning and wicked druids, even slowing him down will be next to impossible. The sixth installment of the Halloween series once again casts Hollywood legend Donald Pleasence in the role of Michael's arch-enemy Dr. Sam Loomis.Alongside Pleasence are Marianne Hagan as the film's heroine, Kara Strode, and Mitch Ryan as Pleasence long time friend, Dr. Wynn. Pleasence turns a much better performance in this film than he did in the last, as he gives his character more than one dimension and emotion. Although this was sadly Pleasence's last film, it did happen to be in, what is my opinion, the best and most intelligent of the series. The other main stars, including Hagan and Strode, help to comprise a more than formidable cast for a slasher film, as they actually act instead of not. For example instead of just screaming for the effect of fright, Hagan actually acts like she's frightened. Curse director Joe Chappelle does a much better job than the series' previous directors, even series starter John Carpenter, in building up the film's intensity with emotion and suspense, as per example the scene in which Michael chases Jamie around an abandoned bus station. It seems the other directors just thought talking and theme music would do the same trick and, although Carpenter's score is not bad, it hardly makes a ninety minute film terrifying. There is also a good amount of gore especially for the fans, but some of the scenes could have used a bit less gore and a bit more depth. Don't get me wrong, I like exploding body parts as much as the next person, but sometimes sharp dialogue and a little character development doesn't hurt either. Which actually brings me to what may be the film's strong point, writer Daniel Farrands' story. Instead of just having a film about a group of every day teens talking about everyday things until their terrorized at the end of the movie, this film actually has its characters terrorized from beginning to end. He also adds a nice dash of flavour into his story by furthering Michael's association with the druids and having a more extensive plan than just walking around waiting to kill a couple of teens. Even with its typically overwritten and overdirected ending, Curse does have some great shocks and is entertaining if nothing else. I shall put it like this, if getting a bad horror film is like acquiring a bad plague, then at least the Curse of Michael Myers would be a slightly more appealing ailment.Overall Rating 7 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2003","score":"","review":"  Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers Six years after he and his niece Jamie disappeared, Michael Myers has returned to his home town of Haddonfield to settle some unfinished business and to continue his rampage of the small American town, but this time he brought help.

The film opens with her being carried in a covered sedan chair to the consummation of her wedding by a rowdy crew from the sorghum winery. It is the 1930s or a little before. They joust her about according to tradition and sing a most scary song about how horrible her life is going to be married to the leprous old man. Through a break in the sedan's enclosure as she sits alone in fear and dread she catches sight of Jiang Wen, a burly, naturalistic man with a piercing countenance. A little later after a bit of unsuccessful highway robbery during which she is released from her confinement, they exchange meaningful glances. The young man doing the voice-over identifies them as his Grandmother and Grandfather. (Obviously the leprous old man is going to miss out!)Zhang Yimou's technique here, as in all of his films that I have seen, is to tell a story as simply as possible from a strong moral viewpoint with as little dialogue as possible and to rely on sumptuous sets, intense, highly focused camera work, veracious acting by a carefully directed cast, and of course to feature the great beauty of his star, the incomparable and mesmerizing Gong Li. If you haven't seen her, Red Sorghum is a good place to start. Jiang Wen is also very good and brings both a comedic quality to the screen as well as an invigorating vitality. His courageous and sometimes boorish behavior seems exactly right.I should warn the viewer that this film contains striking violence and would be rated R in the United States for that and for showing a little boy always naked and for the watering of the wine by Jiang Wen and the boy. Indeed the film is a little crude at times and represents a view of pre-communist China and its culture that the present rulers find agreeable. The depiction of the barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese soldiers is accurate from what I know, but I must say that this film would never have seen the light of day had communist soldiers been depicted in such a manner.Nonetheless the treatment is appropriate since Red Sorghum is a masculine, lusty film suggesting the influence of Akira Kurosawa with perhaps a bit of Clint Eastwood blended in. There are bandits and tests of manhood. The men get drunk and behave badly. Masculine sexual energy is glorified, especially in the scene where Jiang Wen carries Gong Li off to bed, holding her like a barrel under his arm, feet forward, after having watered her wine as though to mark his territory. The camera trailing them shows her reach up and put her arms around his neck and shoulder as much in sexual embrace as in balance.Obviously this is Zhang Yimou before he became completely enamored of the feminist viewpoint; yet somehow, although Gong Li is allowed to fall in love with her rapist (something not possible in contemporary American cinema), Zhang Yimou manages to depict her in a light that celebrates her strength as a woman. One can see here the germination of the full blown feminism that Zhang Yimou would later develop in the aforementioned Raise the Red Lantern, Ju Dou and Qiu Ju. As usual in Zhang Yimou's films not only are the sets gorgeous but the accompanying accouterments--the pottery, the costumes, the lush verdure of the sorghum fields, even the walls and interiors of the meat house restaurant\/bar and Gong Li's bedroom--are feasts for the eyes, somehow looming before cinematographer Gu Changwei's camera more vividly than reality. There are some indications here however that Zhang Yimou had not yet completely mastered his art, and indeed was working under the constraint of a limited budget. For example there was no opening in the sedan through which Gong Li could see Jiang Wen, and there shouldn't have been one (a peephole maybe). The pouring of the wine (into presumably empty bowls that obviously already contained wine) by Jiang Wen needed more practice. In his later films Zhang Yimou would reshoot such scenes to make them consistent with the audience's perception. Additionally, Gong Li's character was not sufficiently developed early on for us to appreciate her confident governance of the winery she had inherited. Uncle Luohan's apparently jealous departure from the winery and his implied relationship with and loyalty to Gong Li were also underdeveloped.However these are minor points in what really matters in film making--telling a story and engaging the audience in the significance and the experience of the tale--in these things Zhang Yimou not only excelled, but gave promise of his extraordinary talent that would be realized in the films to come.

When you use these terms, there should be at least a storyline or a decent plot, which is obviously not the case here.

Dr. Evil remains very funny...maybe that's my opinion because I'm from Belgium. Then there's the story. I can be very short on that.

Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in just a little over twenty-eight days. Then Donnie returns to his normal life&#133;But the question is, is Donnie Darko little more than another David Lynch wannabe or is it something more profound? Well, initial impressions of the film suggest that this is no more than gimmicky, philosophical posturing (something many people accuse the Matrix movies of being). However if you did deeper as a viewer, bountiful rewards await as Donnie Darko (like the character itself) has more to it than meets the eye. After the slightly detached opening sequence, the first thing that strikes you about the film is Jake Gylenhaal. Even at the film's most conventional (i.e. the dinner table scene near the beginning of the film) he practically leaps off the screen and envelopes you whole with his movie star cred. Forget Colin Farrell (well, maybe) but Jake is the real deal. He brings an arrogance and a vulnerability to Donnie which is never short of touching. He has good support too. Patrick Swayze is the epitome of superficiality as the self-help guru while Drew Barrymore pulls a superior version of her usual doe-eyed performance. Also, something else interesting to note about the film is the use of music. The opening uses music quite efficiently in encapsulating Donnie's character but it's the penultimate scene in the film with the Tears for Fears song `Mad World' that surprises you the most. That scene rates amongst the most heartbreaking of any modern film.

Her father Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter) is making it increasingly difficult for everyone without even realising it and all Muriel wants is a bit of normality, a nice family, some real friends and a dream wedding.  Sat up in her room day by day, listening to Abba music, she gets more and more fed up and decides to take off to Sydney to find her dream.  Things don't turn out exactly the way she planned and she is soon faced with the reality that is life.Muriel's Wedding is described as a comedy but I found it more like a drama with a few comical bits in it.  The film itself has got quite a simple plot to it really.  It's just about a girl who's been driven mad by her family and has decided to run off to Sydney to find her dream man and have a marvellous wedding that will be remembered by everyone around her for the rest of her life. If she could do this it would be a real dream come true&#133;But at what expense?Muriel's life is pretty unfortunate.  She is pretty much an outcast back at home and her so called friends don't want to know her because they say she embarrasses them all the time.  She finally meets her one true friend, an old school buddy called Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) and the two of them get through life as best they can..It's not a very funny situation that Muriel is in and the things that happen in this movie aren't exactly funny either. But it is what is known as Black Comedy and if it's not taken the wrong way, it can be quite entertaining. I find it very hard to write a review of the characters in this movie without sounding insensitive or insulting to the kind of people these actors and actresses portray.  The truth is each person has a problem, whether it is mental or physical.  It is very difficult to play a character that is mentally challenged or disabled and the people in this movie have done a wonderful job.  The character that probably stands out the most is Rhonda who is played by Rachel Griffiths and she is fantastic in her role.  Understanding the mental and physical problems of somebody in her character's position is not something that can be done easily but Rachel has managed to portray a very convincing and sincere character. She deserved her AFI award in every way for this role.Toni Collette is amazing as Muriel.  It takes a great actor \/ actress to pull off this kind of role and reduce themselves to such a low, unappealing outcast. I think she did a marvellous job and was yet another actress from this movie to rightfully earn an AFI award. Jeanie Drynan is good as Muriel's mother Betty and the supporting cast are also very good.We've had some pretty bad movies in the past about people getting married.  I mean let's face it; it's not exactly the most extraordinary event of the century. People do it every day.  But this team of people have managed to take this every day situation and turn it into a lovely story with lots of ups and downs.Overall, this movie is quite funny, quite sensitive and very entertaining.  The soundtrack, full of Abba classics, is very good and will have you walking away humming the likes of `Dancing Queen' and `Fernando' to yourself for ages.

I honestly feel that a lot of the reason some people are so critical of it is as a backlash to people's obsessiveness over it after it came out.  There is a reason people obsessed over it though - never since have I seen a film that has moved me more emotionally.I think the acting is quite good, especially by Kate Winslet and Bill Paxton, somewhat less so by Leonardo DiCaprio and Billy Zane.  The main things I think lacking are a really deep or philosophical message and real artistry to the filmmaking, but then again, it shouldn't have those - it's an emotional movie, not an art film.

There is a brilliant script, and a terrific cast to deliver it. I did not think much of John Travolta as an actor before I saw this movie. He is just perfect as the intelligent, slick and yet amiable presidential candidate Jack Stanton. A multi layered personality who, so it is convincingly shown, actually likes sitting together with plain folk and talk about their everyday lives. Who would have been better than Adrian Lester to play a kind of a sorcerer's apprentice coming of age while being with the candidate? His frank, open face reminds you of a bernardine &#150; a very intelligent one, mind you. Let's make it clear You are among intelligent people in the candidate's entourage. They know Machiavelli is not a dish of pasta, and they want to get their man elected, no matter what dirty business they will have to engage in. In this team you encounter some of the most gifted screen actors of today, like Emma Thompson and Billy Bob Thornton, who are given ample possibilities to make use of their talents. All this is topped with Kathy Bates&#145; stellar performance as the girl for the punches below the belt line, the only one who appears having moral principles and wanting to uphold them &#150; the tragic loser in the game.Maybe technically Primary Colors is not a contemporary cinematic masterpiece, in my opinion the script more than compensates for this. I am confident that the movie will outlive any Oliver Stone picture. It is well worth listening carefully to what the characters say. Jack Stanton's speeches are always aimed directly at the heart of his listeners and usually don't miss their target. They are absolutely noncommital! Just sweet emptyness! Although his character, Former Gov. Picker stepping in for a sick candidate, is a highly unlikely one, Larry Hagman has a few very good lines that sum up nicely the content of a presidential campaign It's like professional wrestling.Primary Colors feels as if there is some real inside information in the story. It is an honest film that does not avoid difficult ethical questions. The morally principled young sorcerer's apprentice is at the end of the movie disgusted with the whole business. Amiable Jack Stanton as a talented professional politician knows how to deal with that end asks the obvious question his disciple can not avoid If not Jack Stanton, what then?

If the filmmakers claim they set it in a strip club for any other reason than to get some T&A up on the screen, they are lying. There is NO other reason to set a film in a strip club other than for some T&A. As an earlier reviewer noted, they could have set this film in a hospital or restaurant and kept the same characters and storylines. Not that that would be a good thing. Blue Iguana features the standard stripper characters as a dozen other strip club movies; the only difference is that they are being portrayed by B-list semi-stars as opposed to C-list nobodys.As MLDinTN notes, we got the dumb stripper, the tough\/sensitive stripper, the wild stripper, and the young\/naive stripper. That's pretty accurate. Then there's the stock stripper movie plot elements there's the abusive boyfriend(s), the strung-out stripper(s), the gold-digging stripper hoping to meet the Knight-in-White-Armor that will carry her away from all the madness, and the owner who cares far more about making a profit than about the dancers who make the profit for him. Not that all of these characters don't exist in real life, it's just that we've seen them so many times before. MLDinTN also notes, And none of them do much. I agree so wholeheartedly with that statement that I won't even bother attempting to sum up the plot any differently. I've seen at least three different documentaries on strippers that have a hundred times more going on in their lives than the characters in this film. They should have just made another one instead of this weak take on a seedy industry.Sandra Oh was good as the intellectual stripper. Robert Wisdom was good in his small role as the Blue Iguana's owner. All the other actors are amateurish at best. Jennifer Tilly and Daryl Hannah seemed to be doing impersonations of a manic-depressive Anna Nicole Smith, with Tilly being the manic half and Hannah being the depressive half. Both were ditzy druggies with whiny voices and a total lack of the powers of higher reasoning. None of the other dancers stood out. Finally, I've been to strip clubs before and I must say that the atmosphere in the Blue Iguana is far too downbeat and moody. Slow music and depressing, lethargic dancers do not mix well. None of the dancers would make more than $10 a night, and the Blue Iguana would be out of business in two weeks.

The movie is about Toula(Nia Vardalos), a 30-year-old woman who seemingly can't get a boyfriend.  Her family has all given up hope on her of ever getting a significant other.  She works at the family's restaurant (Dancing Zorbas) as a waitress, because she has no purpose in life but to do such things.  In walks Ian Miller(John Corbett), a guy who Toula gets an instant sense of love at first sight feelings in her.The story focuses on the fact that Toula loves this new guy in her life and the fact that her dad has expectations of the Greek guy that she should marry.  There is some kind of warmth in this movie which you feel when you watch it.  The jokes are always fresh, though some are recycled and thrown at you later on in the film.As the title of the movie says it, this movie involves enormous feasts, wedding receptions, and families.  What makes this movie a success is the fact that there is tension not on the lover's part, but on the part of both sides of the two families.
