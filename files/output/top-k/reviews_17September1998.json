Derivative, but Snipes is brilliantly funny, Stallone is in good form, Sandra Bullock has her best role here, and the excellent supporting cast includes Rob Schneider, Denis Leary, Glenn Shadix (Beetlejuice), Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Ventura (wrestling), Nigel Hawthorne, Troy Evans (Ace Ventura), Bill Cobbs, and Bob Gunton (The Public Eye).

But, it is an earnest adaptation of the hit animated series and toy line from the 80s.  Don't take this film seriously, because if you will, you'll only be disappointed.  It is based on a cartoon and an extensive array of action figures, and that is how it is portrayed on screen. The movie is a great time, full of escapist, Star Wars-esque adventure.  Lundgren is physically capable in his role as He-Man (without his Prince Adam alter ego), but look for Frank Langella as the sinister Skeletor to steal the show.  Langella rules the screen every time his excellently made up skull-like face is depicted.  You can really tell Langella had a terrific time making this movie, and he serves to help save the film.  While I would have preferred the film to be set more on Eternia's surreal landscape, the Earth as a battlezone motif was a departure from the cartoonish roots.  No, Masters of the Universe is not a well-made or even a good movie, but is great fun, and that's just the only way to look at it.
