It is a very intelligent spoof of horror flicks like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween, even The Blair Witch Project. Not even The Sixth Sense or The Matrix get off easy! To quote Keenan Ivory Wayans, the director, These movies have been going on for almost 50 years, and they just keep getting dumber and dumber. And he's right. I mean, FINALLY, a movie like Scary Movie has come out!Getting to my summary, which you're probably wondering about, almost every comment I've seen on IMDb says Oh, it should've been rated NC-17. There's too much graphic sexual content. It's definitely not for young kids. It's really disgusting. Don't see it. I've seen less nudity in X-rated movies.All I have to say to you people is...........SHUT UP!!!! Okay, I agree with you people who say it's not for young children. I mean, honestly, why would you take an 8-year-old, or younger, to see an R-rated movie? It's rated R for a reason! But I think it was okay for an R-rating. All that people seemed to be paying any attention to was the vulgar sexual content. I think if it had more than it did, it could've been rated NC-17.And also, there wasn't that much nudity. There was the I Know thing, the scene in the stall at the movie theatre, and the the.....ugh.....gym teacher, but those were the only strong nudity scenes. Even the pretty graphic sex scene (with Bobby and Cindy) didn't have a lot of nudity.To sum up, Scary Movie was definitely worth the six bucks I paid. I laughed my ass off! If you haven't seen it yet, go see it NOW! Oh, I also forgot to say that the WHAZZUP? commercial parody was pretty funny too. I give it **** out of *****.

I didn't find it too sappy (definitely not nearly as the better rated Frequency) and there were far less historical inaccuracies in this than in other recent films - notably Gladiator and U-571.The story was well done and the cast was extremely strong - there were good performances all throughout this movie.  It was also an interesting tale set against the backdrop of the American Revolution.  The film had a lot to do with revenge but in the end if you pay attention the cause is what comes through.  One of the many things I liked about the film was that the main character was definitely a flawed hero - he could be as cruel as his enemies and he was weak enough to exact his vengeance.  To me, that showed he was human.  Mel Gibson portrays his hero with great depth and makes him real - this was definitely his film.The film touches on a lot of real issues in the Revolutionary war.  One of which is that there were a number of Loyalists among the colonists and that there was a great deal of in-fighting amongst them and the patriots.  There was cruelty - on both sides.  However, it is not inaccurate to show one mad British officer conducting acts of brutality. This did not reflect on the entire British army or the British people - it just reflected one sick individual. I don't blame the British for being genuinely annoyed at such inaccuracies in U-571 where their accomplishments were ignored and history was distorted.  But I don't think they should have as much issue with the Patriot if you look at the history of this war and yes, it is told from the American point of view.  The issue of slavery was not touched upon much here but then again the revolutionary war was not primarily about this issue.  African Americans were never granted their freedom by Brits and in many cases inhumanely treated. The film does show some of this cruelty and prejudice on both sides.  An infamous example is that the British often infected them with small pox that would then spread among the colonists.  This is a real, historical fact - The Brits would be REALLY up in arms if that had been portrayed.This film is worthwhile to see if you enjoy good epic stories with excellent acting.

I didn't find it too sappy (definitely not nearly as the better rated Frequency) and there were far less historical inaccuracies in this than in other recent films - notably Gladiator and U-571.The story was well done and the cast was extremely strong - there were good performances all throughout this movie.  It was also an interesting tale set against the backdrop of the American Revolution.  The film had a lot to do with revenge but in the end if you pay attention the cause is what comes through.  One of the many things I liked about the film was that the main character was definitely a flawed hero - he could be as cruel as his enemies and he was weak enough to exact his vengeance.  To me, that showed he was human.  Mel Gibson portrays his hero with great depth and makes him real - this was definitely his film.The film touches on a lot of real issues in the Revolutionary war.  One of which is that there were a number of Loyalists among the colonists and that there was a great deal of in-fighting amongst them and the patriots.  There was cruelty - on both sides.

Saw it mentioned that this movie 'Bombed' or disappeared fast when it came out.Wrong! Check out the box office info on the side there. It's domestic rentals(half the actual gross, more or less) were 25M, a gross of about 50M. In 1980, this would have been Big, it wound up in the top 10-12 for the year. Yeah you heard me right. You have to stop thinking in terms of 2000 bucks and go back 20 years. This one made probably about 120M(more or less) in today's $$$. That sound like a bomb or film that came and went real quick?

Hate either film all ya wanna, but don't go calling them busts financially. There were not then and are not now.As for the actual movie, well...its a victim of high, hype driven expectations and therefore gets hurt by them.

It was slow, sure, Tony Perkins and Robert Forster slept walked through their roles, the robots were too cartoony,(paging Jar Jar...), and yeah, the ending sux.

I think that Disney made a decent movie, but needed a tighter, more involving script and a better idea of who to target it too-was it for kids, teenagers or adults? They wound up being all over the board and as such, provided a watered down product.Gotta like Maximillian, by the way, had that Gort thing going on. Still works pretty good though its obviously just a big plastic rig on wires to these semi-jaded 34 year old eyes...no biggie.I give it a **1\/2 rating, damning with faint praise--but its worth yer time, give it a shot.

Of course, its still the same I'm a leader in a war even even though I didnt choose to be kind of story, but it pulls you in and keeps pulling the tears from your eyes with every time a loveable character meets their horrible, brutal demise. (Which, as a film-maker myself, loved.)Second, Roland Emmerich's direction. I kind of expected to see flat performances and some-what boring photography, which were trademarks of Independence Day and Godzilla, but it was instead very much the opposite. Beautiful lighting was this film's trademark as well as Gibson's great performance, like he always does.This film should definitely garner the oscar nominations this year. And if they don't, well thats because the Academy will once again shun the best of the competition like they always do. I hope that this isn't shut out like a another certain picture from the same producers and writer (you know what it is), because it definitely shouldn't.

I had seen previous Amy Heckerling movies (Clueless, Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and enjoyed them greatly, and appreciated the teenage characters and situations. However, I was greatly disappointed when I realized that this was far from American Pie or Clueless and more along the lines of a less funny She's All That.  The comedy is really a romantic comedy focusing on Loser Paul (Jason Biggs) who falls for a classmate Dora (Mena Suvari) who is head-over-heels in love with their professor (Greg Kinner) who is not very nice to her or many other people.  It moves along very slowly and the plot is more or less not there.  To me it did not flow together at all and was too drawn out.  Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs had the on-screen chemistry and both were great in their roles, but the lack of plot, needless to say, made me lose my interest in the movie.  Loser has the right idea and casting, but just couldn't put it together like Amy Heckerling's previous works.  The few chuckles here and there and great young stars didn't make up for the lack of plot.  When comedy these days is humping apple pies (which I do find quite hilarious), Loser becomes a loser of a movie (excuse the pun) with a bit of heart in it.  I would have much rather watched the Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari in American Pie again.

However, it is one of the better 'strange' films I have ever seen.  John Cusack is excellent in this film, as is John Malkovich himself.  After all, nobody but Malkovich could pull this film off to begin with.  Cameron Diaz is all but unrecognizable in her portrayal of Lotte Schwartz, but her performance here is only ho-hum.  I have learned not to expect much from her in anything but a comedy film anyways, especially after seeing Something About Mary.I recommend this film to those who want to see something fresh, and who enjoy movies that call for some thought.  I don't believe a story such as this has ever been tried before, and that makes the film more appealing.  I passed by it for a few weeks at the video store before committing to it, and now I'm glad I watched it.The premise is pretty simple.  While at work one day on the 7 1\/2 floor, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), who is a puppeteer, finds a small door which allows him to enter the mind of John Malkovich and see through his eyes for a short period of time, and then be dumped out beside the New Jersey turnpike.  As word of this spreads, various hijinks and interpersonal relations are played out amongst the characters in the film.  Craig Schwartz finds his ultimate puppet, but at what cost?By the way, I loved the film in which John Malkovich played a jewel thief.  ;)My Rating  9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  To say this film is weird is an understatement.

Five years after Braveheart, a nearly-three-hour-long movie about the atrocities the English exacted on the Scots, Gibson now stars in The Patriot, a nearly-three-hour-long movie about the atrocities exacted on the Americans.Granted the English were not exactly a pack of UN Peacekeepers during the American War of Independence. But it would have been nice if Gibson, along with director Roland Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat, took a bit more time to sit down with the history books and get more of a feel for context and how things unfolded.I know, I know. You're saying it's only a movie. And yes, if there is a choice between historical accuracy and spine-tingling drama, Hollywood will consistently side with impact over education.That's what I kept telling myself as The Patriot progressed. But by the time the English army locked the townsfolk inside the church and burned it down, I could buy into this charade no more. Maybe something like this did happen. Maybe the English army had waged a covert campaign of terrorism that has never made the history books. But Emmerich has reportedly admitted that the scene was based on what the Nazis did to some French villagers during the Second World War and had nothing to do with the goings on back in 1776.What's really amazing is that Black Americans are not at least as vocal as the English -- because the treatment of slavery at that time borders on Disneyesque fantasy. Certainly, a small number won their freedom by fighting for either side. But the scene in which de happy and emancipated Black folk play de xylophones as de attractive young white couple get married on de idyllic South Carolina beach was beyond even the most remote credibility.The Patriot does get points for a compelling central character. Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a hero of the French-and-Indian War turned family man and plantation owner. At first Martin is reluctant to wade into the fray, in part because he has a family and in part because he knows better than most what war is all about. But when a psychotic English officer, Col. William Tavington (a steely-eyed Jason Isaacs) not only threatens to hang Martin's oldest son, but shoots his second oldest and burns down the family mansion, it gets personal.Rather than using this as an opportunity to get inside the head of a reluctant warrior, this bit of `motivation,' to use the movie-making vernacular, becomes the pretense for a whirlwind of blood, guts, and splatter. Who needs character development when you can have a puerile gorefest?Ultimately, any commitment to historical accuracy is limited to a short narrative near the end.  Never mind the English. Never mind Black Americans. The Patriot is an insult to anyone with even a slight idea of the real sacrifices that were made to win America's independence.
