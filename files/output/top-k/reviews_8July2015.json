This isn't a good point, or a bad point (it goes both ways), but it's the most clear observation I could make out when I watched this film again recently. Another realization I came to was that, despite not really liking it on first viewing, this is actually a very good movie - one more deeply creepy, violent, and sad.The plot lies more or less on the same level as the previous film. Hannibal is now free, Starling is disgraced after a scandal with the FBI, and an old victim of Hannibal's contacts her with a proposal to trap him once and for all. Things go awry, chaos ensues. The performances are just as brilliant as the original, and that goes a long way to helping the (slightly over-the-top) story stick together. The thing is, it's a completely different movie, which is probably why I and many others didn't like it upon release. Gone is the tension of the first movie, replaced instead by a much more potent sense of paranoia and dread - mostly down to Hannibal's new found freedom. Also new to this movie is the blood and gore that it's so infamous for. It did feature in the original, but not like this. This is an exceptionally violent movie, and features one of the sickest, nastiest scenes in the history of mainstream cinema (you know which one I'm talking about).Unlike other movies, though, the violence means a lot here. Sure, it's gross and icky and what have you, but more than anything, the nastiness reveals a lot about its characters that the original film didn't touch on. Unlike the original, this isn't a film that particularly likes Hannibal - here, he's not the endearingly-creepy movie-monster, but he's an utter psychopath. This is bound to put some people off, but it feels like the natural thing for this film to do. Does it go too far? Possibly. Some things never need to be shown, but it's all integral to the film's vision so it gets a free pass... just about. As for the film being a drama played like a thriller, that does mean it loses the probing character-based drama of the original. Starling's story in the original is so raw on screen that it practically bleeds - this film deals with similarly prickly affairs, but never really addresses them. The knock-on effect is that it ends up being a less involving film, but a more exciting one. Again, this isn't really a good point or a bad point, but it's more just a point of comparison. Don't come into Hannibal expecting the virtuosic drama of the original.What ultimately saves Hannibal (the reason I've given it an 8) is the grand, darkly romantic vision it commits to. It's a sweeping, perfectly orchestrated film that feels as if it's what could have been made if film existed at the height of the romantic era. The sets are some of the most lavish to ever grace the crime-thriller genre (most of it is set in Florence), the music exists solely in the realms of opera and classical, and the plot, flawed as its logic sometimes is, hits every note with an intensity lacking in most crime movies. It's all fantastically realized.In the end, it's not the perfect sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Some may find it too gory (yours truly included), and that's a fair comment. The plot enters a territory that will probably aggravate some, and that's also a fair criticism. If you can come into it realizing it's a different film to the first, however, you may ultimately end up finding a lot to like.

Then consider the fact that the narrators of this are all veterans of the original company of Saturday Night Live with STV's John Candy thrown in for good measure. In order to understand the cult following of such deliciously bad science fiction movies as It Conquered the World and Plan Nine From Outer Space, you also need to be able to compare it to The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds. Great time and artistic effort was put into creating those masterpieces which stand the test of time, while the others stand the test of time because they are so delightfully silly you can't help but turn them into comedy classics that just happen to involve outer space creatures.Then, there's killer trees, wobbling rocks that manage to crush their victims even though they stroll around on turtle time while human beings can certainly outrun them (if they would only stop wasting their time trying to shoot them!), white furred apes, creatures from the sea that look like they are trying to break the Coney Island record for eating hot dogs and various other inhuman beings that can't remotely compare with the artistic talents which went into making The Creature From the Black Lagoon. Giant turkeys, leeches, lizards, insects and even vegetables pounced up on our drive-in movie theater screens, making the giant ants of Them! and tarantulas seem like classics, much like the original Dracula and Frankenstein were 25-30 years before most of these movies were made.The funny thing about these bad movies is the fact that once you get past the idiotic subplots, you really find yourself enjoying them. They are extremely clever in their own inept way, maybe unintentionally, but some filmmakers must have known that their subject matter and monsters were ripe for ridicule. Some of these films make Ed Wood's notoriously bad turkeys step up a notch. I guess you could say that there's an art to making bad movies. Some of the narration here truly is bad, but it will be the film clips that you'll want to experience here, not the dumb quips from the original not ready for prime time players.Two specialty segments cover teens gone wild and the bad musicals of the golden age of Hollywood. Certainly, the teens gone wild segment is truly funny, totally reminding me of the Lois Bromfield spoof, Sorority Girls From Hell, but it is the musical sequence narrated by Gilda Radner which struck my interest. Main-stream movies such as Sunny Side Up and Wonder Bar get included with two truly campy production numbers. The Sunny Side Up number, Turn on the heat!, shows dancing girls making bananas grow on the vine just by wiggling their chests at them, while Goin' to Heaven on a Mule strikes controversy today with its depiction of blacks in a small section of heaven (the white section is three times as large) eating pork chops right off the tree, plucking chickens and frying them, and most tastelessly, a giant watermelon which opens and has a tap-dancing Hal LeRoy in black face popping out. Other musical segments aren't really from musicals; One of them is actually from an MGM Technicolor short from the mid 1930's, and the rest are silly brief song interludes from some of the worst Z grade adventures ever filmed. So the film is a mixed bag of clips, but there is something here for everybody to enjoy and it might inspire future filmmakers to go out and research these films to try new ideas of their own.

However, Frankenheimer would make up for this movie just two years later, as he would direct this awesome Ronin, and he also had previously directed classics like The Train, Black Sunday, and The Manchurian Candidate. So while this could have been worse, it is still not a good movie, and unless you have some time to spare, then you are probably better off watching a movie that's much better.4\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"8 July 2015","score":"","review":" I watched this film late one night on Bravo.

Little did he know, that the script copy he had been sent had the original ending that New Line didn't want, so he had to fight to keep it in the film. Either way, the film was released in September of 1995 and instantly had rave reviews, and managed to make even Roger Ebert proclaim it as dark, twisted and a great movie. So, let's see if all of these critics are whackjobs, or if this film truly is as good as they say.Se7en follows two detectives - one set to retire by the end of the week, and a rookie set to take over his position, as they slowly realize that several seemingly unconnected murders are actually the work of a serial killer basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.This film is one I had been fascinated by for a long time. Many people referred to it as a basis for the dark and twisted films to come, such as the Saw franchise, so I wanted to finally see why people were constantly comparing the two. So, what did I think? Well, let's get into it.The acting was phenomenal. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both do terrific jobs as the two detectives investigating this twisted case, and both really play off of each other very well. One of the best examples of this comes from the opening scene, where Pitt meets up with Freeman and they have a chat. Quite intriguing. Kevin Spacey... I feel like I shouldn't spoil who he is because of the plot, but believe me when I say, he'll send shivers down your spine. Gwyneth Paltrow does a stellar job as well as Pitt's wife, and manages to emote more than in any other performance. Ha, I'm only joking. And R. Lee Ermey does a good job as the police captain.The music in this film, by Howard Shore, of all people, was stellar. One of the most effective scenes in the film, which is surprisingly the opening credits, had a remixed version of a Nine Inch Nails song paired with Shore's score, and it works very well. Hell, the score works very well throughout the entire film. The lighting and just overall tone of the film is very dark, which helps compliment the subject matter very well. I just love some of the shots, like when they first come upon the Gluttony crime scene and are using their flashlights all around, that scene looks so dark and mysterious, you can't help but be intrigued.Of course, Fincher's direction is brilliant so we don't even need to have a long discussion about that. The screenplay, as a whole, works very well. It's very good at keeping us contained to these murders and the people surrounding them and being affected by them. I can see why Fincher really wanted to make this screenplay. The editing in this film is definitely something to note, as scenes such as the opening credits and the overlays of the days look very well done, and it's obviously that either Fincher or the editor had very good ideas on how that was supposed to work.Overall, Se7en is a very solid flick. It boasts some talented performances, some great tone, music, direction and a solid screenplay and some very bold, but fantastic, editing choices. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and go see it because it's very dark, and the twist ending will leave you reeling, I'm sure.10\/10.

I know many consider it to be a classic in the horror genre and some have even regarded this as the scariest movie of all time, but I simply can't find the appeal. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that it hasn't aged well or that countless horror films since have imitated it, but I found it rather predictable and silly at times. The movie does begin by setting up the characters in an interesting way (this is where Spielberg's influence as a producer is felt), but once the horror elements begin to take center stage I felt disengaged. I can imagine those final fifteen minutes must have haunted audiences during the 80's, but I just found it a bit convoluted and silly. I wanted to check out the original before I decided to see the remake, but considering I wasn't such a huge fan of this film now I probably won't even get near it (the only appeal right now for me is getting to see Sam Rockwell who is always brilliant). Poltergeist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are Tobe Hooper's most revered horror films, but at least the first doesn't seem to have aged well. I was disappointed and when compared to other horror classics like Halloween, Psycho, Alien, and The Shining, I don't think Poltergeist deserves to be considered among that group. Steve (Craig T. Nelson) and Diane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) seem to be enjoying their peaceful lives in the suburbs along with their three children Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). That is until strange events begin taking place their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, begins sleepwalking and having conversations with the TV set, the house begins to shake but only they seem to experience it, bent dinner forks are found at the table, the chairs are placed in bizarre positions, and finally a terrible thunderstorm destroys the house and mysteriously makes one of the trees come to life and snatch Robbie from his room. It is evident that the house is haunted by some strange presence, but while everyone is distracted by trying to save Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked into the closet and disappears. However the family can hear her voice through the static TV screen and that is when they fully understand that they are dealing with supernatural forces so they hire a parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), to help them find and save their daughter. The film is at its best when it's setting the atmosphere and introducing us to the family members. I did enjoy the first part of the film, but once the strange events begin taking place the film lost most of its appeal. I didn't find it scary, but it wasn't disturbing either. I know that the premise has been imitated hundreds of times now so perhaps that hurt my overall enjoyment of this film. I wish I could've experienced it back in the 80's to see if it would've had a different effect on me, but I can't simply give it a pass for it because I've seen many other classic films that are older than this but have aged much better.

Even least was known about life for Soviet women. There were very few movies at the time, that capture how Russian women were treated. Most films from that era, were highly narrow formula propaganda stories of socialist realism. It wasn't until Brezhnev Era, that cinema got expand its boundaries, and begin work on a wider range of entertaining and artistic films. It was here, that filmmakers started to developed stories that intense focus on Soviet personal life. One of those films, was 1979's Moscow does not believe in tears. Director by Vladimir Menshov and written by Valentin Chernykh, the movie tells the 20 years story of three Russian women who come to Moscow from smaller towns Katerina Tikhomirova (Vera Alentova), Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova), and Antonina (Raisa Ryazanova) in search for better life. Only to find that the search is more complex, than they thought. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say that the first half of the film, set in the 1959s, during Khrushchev Thaw, was really dull and boring. It's really a shame, because it would be, nice to see, more on these women's reaction, to the change in reform in their country since De-Stalinization. It would have been better, if the movie set the events during the 1963's Cuban Mission Crisis. It would be, nice to see, how the average soviet citizen was thinking of the event. Sadly, film content like that, would more likely be heavily circumscribed and subject to censorship and bureaucratic state control. Instead, the film doesn't get good, until the movie took a 20 year leap forward in time, to 1979. It's here, that one of the women's stories really outshine the others. In my opinion, the movie should have been all about Katerina's struggles. Not only, is the actress, the better of the three women, but her character has the most complex and entertaining story-line. Even, with a huge time jump, you see her character, transform from a weak factory worker in the beginning of the film into a strong-will single mother, factory director, by the end. It just sucks that the movie gloss over, how she became so mature. It would been interesting to see, the years that she had to go, through the double burden of a job and family-raising responsibilities. It really surprise me; that they didn't focus on that, because it was very common, for Soviet women at the time. Still, I like how they shown a working woman, was able to reach the executive level, in a male-driven field. It's very rare to see a film, like this, both in the Soviet Union and the United States at the time. I just wish, they show, how she rose the ranks to become the woman that she was, toward the end of the film. The movie could have been, easily just be about that, but the movie didn't want to seem, too extreme in its Feminism outlook. So, the movie focus more on, her trying to fall back in love, after a previous man have left her, to rise a child on her own. It's here, where the audience is introduce to Gosha (Aleksey Batalov), a tool-and-die maker. He's one of the better characters in the film. He is a very complex fella, that's mostly entertaining. The only complain that I have, about his character is the weak conflict. Despite that, the movie still shows that he's a good man. Aleksey Batalov plays him, very well. One of the bigger faults, about watching this movie, today, is how dated, it is. Not only does, this movie have some really questionable old-school beliefs about relationships and gender roles. It's somewhat offensive, when you think about it. Still, I can understand that it's a product of the times. One of the funnier moments in the film, is when Rudolph\/Rodion (Yuri Vasilyev) makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater, movies, and books. I guess, he didn't count on, the internet, being made. The true value of the film is its reflection of the Russian culture and traditions. Anyone interested in better understanding the Russian way of life should see this film. It's nice to see, that not everything in the Soviet Union wasn't so gloomy. Even, US President Ronald Reagan watched the film several times prior to his meetings with the President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in order to gain a better understanding of the Russian people. So it's clear, that this movie does work, but it's still questionable to me, if this movie should have deserve the 1981 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1980. I mean, it's alright, but it's no way beats 1980's Kagemusha. After all, if you take away, the fact that it was made in Soviet Union, it feels like a generic soap opera or chick flick. There wasn't much, substance. While, the movie was shot, pretty well. There were hardly anything great with them. The only one, worth noticing is the park scene, with the long panning shot. In my opinion, it was just alright, but it's pretty eerily, how close, this version is, with the shot in 1979's Kramer vs Kramer. Another problem with the film is the DVD quality. I have, not yet, seen a good version of this film. Most of the audio kinda sucks. I can barely hear what's going on. The English subtitles are bit questionable. I really doubt the Russian language have a word for Hillbilly or Hicks. I would rather, take the Russian slang, than it trying to be go all the way, with the English language. It was a bit jarring. Overall This is not your typical Bolshevist movie. It's very unique. A must-watch for anybody, trying to understand Russian culture. If, that's your cup of borscht, more power to you! Check it out!

Mildred is the good character who suffers the tortures of the damned to try and help Veda. Being a waitress, later owning a chain of restaurants all to provide that snotty, little poster girl for birth control the lifestyle that her role model, the fop Monte, thinks is so indicative of existential worth. The other test is the use of shadows Film Noir means black film; it is an existential metaphor. But notice, at the beginning at the beach house, where Mildred attempts to frame the loathsome Wally for Veda's killing of Monte, see the shadows everywhere? If you are watching an old black and white film and the director does not use shadows prominently in the frames, as you see here, you are not watching Noir. Black film because of the misanthropy the shadows represent; the shadow inside all of us. It is a reference to Jung who was quite popular when these films were made. Everyone except Mildred, including Burt, is a louse here. Yes, the youngest sweet daughter is good, but Curtiz kills her off quickly. All the main characters prey upon Mildred in one way or another. Please, stop with she spoils Veda so that means she cannot be a Noir protagonist. She tries to go to the electric chair for her; I say, that might qualify her as a moral heroine.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"8 July 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The quintessential sequel, the quintessential sci-fi actioner & one of the greatest films ever made, James Cameron's follow-up story to his breakthrough classic is such a huge upgrade over its predecessor that it ends up decimating the 1984 original in all filmmaking departments with effortless ease, and remains one of the most influential, entertaining & breathtaking action extravaganzas to grace the silver screen.A highly irresistible, pulse-pounding, high-octane, full-throttled & top- gear action spectacle that's filled with some of the most dangerous, daring & heart-stopping stunts ever captured on the film celluloid, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is the perfect definition of a worthy sequel that presents its renowned director at the peak of his gifted talents, is the finest work of his illustrious career, and its influence on its genre, visual effects & pop culture surpasses even the reach of its predecessor.The story of Terminator 2 Judgment Day follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in The Terminator and continues the journey of Sarah Connor & her 10-year old son, John Connor; the future leader of human resistance in the war against the machines. After failing to eliminate Sarah during its first attempt, Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator back in time to kill John when he's still a child while another saviour from the future arrives whose only mission is to protect John & ensure his survival at all costs.Written, produced & directed by James Cameron, the improvements present in this sequel are evident from the film's opening moments with more enhanced visuals, larger-than-life action & one mind-blowing sequence after another. I've always admired Cameron because he's one of the very few filmmakers who understands what great action is all about, knows how to expand upon the original instead of rehashing the same events & has the talent to accomplish not just his own artistic ambitions but also the expectations of the mainstream audience without compromising with the quality.Also, in my opinion, a sequel has no reason to exist unless it can improve upon the original and it's usually why I'm skeptical about most of them. Cameron seems to know this better than anyone for he has proved it not once but twice already; first with Aliens; the action-packed follow-up to Ridley Scott's Alien & then with this second chapter to the film that launched his career. And despite the major upgrades in action & other technical aspects, the story retains the high-quality content of the original, exhibits extensive character depth & is brilliantly paced from start to finish.From a technical standpoint, Terminator 2 is a marvel of genre filmmaking in every sense of the word.

After failing to eliminate Sarah during its first attempt, Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator back in time to kill John when he's still a child while another saviour from the future arrives whose only mission is to protect John & ensure his survival at all costs.Written, produced & directed by James Cameron, the improvements present in this sequel are evident from the film's opening moments with more enhanced visuals, larger-than-life action & one mind-blowing sequence after another. I've always admired Cameron because he's one of the very few filmmakers who understands what great action is all about, knows how to expand upon the original instead of rehashing the same events & has the talent to accomplish not just his own artistic ambitions but also the expectations of the mainstream audience without compromising with the quality.Also, in my opinion, a sequel has no reason to exist unless it can improve upon the original and it's usually why I'm skeptical about most of them. Cameron seems to know this better than anyone for he has proved it not once but twice already; first with Aliens; the action-packed follow-up to Ridley Scott's Alien & then with this second chapter to the film that launched his career. And despite the major upgrades in action & other technical aspects, the story retains the high-quality content of the original, exhibits extensive character depth & is brilliantly paced from start to finish.From a technical standpoint, Terminator 2 is a marvel of genre filmmaking in every sense of the word.

Definitely the more entertaining of the two asteroid films released in '98 (the other being the more intelligent, but rather stodgy DEEP IMPACT), this kicks off with an effects-laden opening which shows a shower of meteorites hitting New York and demolishing\/blowing up just about everything in sight.Of course, it has to go downhill from there, and some characterisation mixed with lame comedy filler follow for a short while. Thankfully things soon pick up with the exciting space mission and the two and a half hour running time literally flies by. There are lots of dollops of sickly sentimentalising thrown into the mix too, for good measure, but these aren't dwelt on, thankfully enough. Thankfully the producers realised that they were catering for a primarily male audience and made the film a macho testosterone-pounder instead. And it's a good one!This film's style is to have loads and loads of quick exciting scenes edited together really fast so the action keeps cutting from place to place. While this is fine occasionally, for two and a half hours it becomes a bit overdone and tiring but thankfully I didn't notice too much. A lavish score adds to the pace and for once the special effects aren't the star of the show; I think this is why this film was a success, because it's about people more than it is about the latest in CGI technology. Sure, there are lots and lots of (good) computer effects but these only serve as a backdrop to the characters in the story.A good cast also help to smooth over any cracks in the film and it becomes easy to forgive. A baldy Bruce Willis is the hard-bitten hero who predictably enough gets to save the planet, I liked his performance but he showed he was capable of much more than the one-dimensional hero in THE SIXTH SENSE. Billy Bob Thornton (so good as Jacob in A SIMPLE PLAN) gets to emote and look extremely stressed as the poor guy stuck on the ground while Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler supply the sentimental dross which I could have done without. An ever-amusing Steve Buscemi lends the comic angle as the astronaut suffering from space dementia while familiar faces like Owen Wilson (THE HAUNTING), William Fichter (imagine a young Christopher Walken), Michael Clarke Duncan (THE GREEN MILE), Jason Isaacs (EVENT HORIZON) and Keith David (THE THING) fill out the welcome supporting cast. Even Peter Stormare (the thug from FARGO) appears as an overacting Russian! Extra fun comes from guessing who dies next and the action doesn't disappoint either with plenty of tense moments. Armageddon is not exactly intelligent entertainment but it's a fun, easy to view film with the budget all on screen and with plenty of laughs and thrills along the way.
