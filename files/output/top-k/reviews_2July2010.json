Matter of fact, he can be an outright a-hole, or a blowhard depending on his mood. Allie loves to hear himself talk and expound about how the world has gone to hell, and that America will be (or probably already has) been engulfed by nuclear devastation. He's also a (kind-of) genius, an inventor who has made a machine that with a lot of fire and other things can make ice. Allie is a dick, but he somehow can impress people - his family most of all.This character was Harrison Ford's personal favorite. After the film ended, and while it was going on even, I could visage why. He gets to play against his usual 'type' if he has one, which is the straight-up hero, and it's a type he's had throughout his career (albeit with the occasional 'wrong-man' character like The Fugitive). He gets to play a jerk, but one who is smart and resourceful and cares for his family, and just has a kind of default in his character when it comes to caring for them, actually truly caring for what they want, when the time comes. Allie is a complex being, tragic in scope since he can't see a way to live normally once he's left home with his family. And yet they still love him, in spite of himself.It's a smart movie, smart about how to create characters we care about (and some we don't but like seeing anyway like the Reverend played by Andre Gregory), and smart about how to film it in a mostly straightforward style. Weir sometimes allows himself some stylistic flourishes, notably a tracking shot following along Allie's face as he keeps expounding on this and that while he's leading along the building of his town that he owns. Or, of course, the big explosion scene, which is shot for a moment like a kinetic action movie with its explosion growing and spreading larger. But mostly he just lets the bizarre situation, and how it sometimes seems so not-bizarre, like this is the most natural thing imaginable, play itself out.One may find something recognizable in this story, if only in other movies I'm reminded of the jungle-quest pictures with Herzog and Kinski where they go off into the jungle for some mad quest or obsession to accomplish something (be it a boat over a mountain for opera or the glory of introducing natives to ice in this one); and Boyle's The Beach, which had a group of people leaving their lands not as a vacation but as a destination. But at the same time something feels raw and truthful in the material. I can't say how close it is to the book, though Paul Schrader's screenplay feels true to itself, how a family who had been living with such a man would react at first to leaving everything for a life in the jungle, then accept and kind of love having everything to themselves... and then seeing the true nature of a desperate man's wit's end at control. It's another in a long-line of men in Schrader's films that can't get what they want, despite not being 'bad'. It's a gray area deal, which works great when it comes time in the story for the inventor to face off against the typical hear me Natives! Reverend.It's not entirely a great film. Sometimes a scene will kind of fall flat, or Ford, only once or twice, goes into being over the top instead of just believably ego-maniacal. But Weir steers this story, and this fantastic cast (River Phoenix and Helen Mirren get little masterpieces of scenes here and there), into some captivating waters. I was never quite sure what would happen, except that it would ultimately lead to run for this family - and I wanted to keep watching it, not as a train wreck but as a simple story of love and control gone awry.

While the title has cache as a brand name and clout by association, originating from the pen of one Stephen King, this 1989 creep show is a strong candidate for re-incarnation. Let me just say that I completely understand the rose coloured glasses with which we sometimes remember films first seen in our youth. Even the best examples of horror, (Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St. and alike) can often look dated, crappy and lame to eyes witnessing them for the first time, many, many years after their release. Sometimes these judgements can be unfair, not considering the time when the film was first relevant. Other times it can give clarity to a film's short coming and missed opportunities. Now, with my self-justifying out of the way, let's turn our attention back to Pet Semetary. Adapted from King's popular novel of the same name, box-office wise this film is probably his most successful page to screen horror adaptation, King even wrote the script. This alone is reason for a remake. It appears as though King may have been too close to the project, as the pace is slow, taking way too much to time to get to the inevitable and the subplots seem pointless. King seemingly didn't have the objectivity to self edit. The Shining and Carrie, while based on King's books were written for the screen by other writers, namely filmmakers, who could cut away the fat and get to the guts of the story all the while keeping a visual language in mind. From the very beginning of Pet Semetary we know the cat will die, the kid will die and everything will go horribly wrong for this generic family. It just takes so long to get there. A remake could pace it up, get to the kid dying quicker, which is the real drama of the story, and maybe spend more time with this evil re-incarnated baby. Another thing a remake could address is the numerous subplots. The whole thing about the wife's complex with death and her strange back story involving a hideously disabled sister can go or be made relevant in some way to the main plot. There's also the seemingly unnecessary feuding between the father and the wife's family which comes to a ridiculously over the top head at the baby's funeral. And what about the freaky house keeper who commits suicide? What was the point of her? Was she some sort of red herring? Perhaps this is all explained and relevant in King's book, but on screen it really doesn't work. I also thought that the resurrecting should have taken place in the actual pet cemetery instead of miles away in the sacred Navajo site. Despite rendering the title pointless, it is hard to believe the father could be convinced to trek all the way to this site not being told where he is going and what will happen there, let alone dragging a body with him. Maybe all this could have been made more palatable had the actors been better. While Fred Gwynne (of The Munsters) is probably the best of a bad bunch, the rest are terrible, especially the mother (Denise Crosby of Star Trek the Next Gen.) and who ever the little girl was who played the whining brat of a daughter, she should have been the one hit by the truck! At the heart of it all I really think there is a good story, creepy, dramatic and full of the kind of conundrums that make an audience think Would I do the same? it just deserves to be presented in a more considered and cinematic way.

Everybody wants to be a cat was so terribly out of context- the strobe-lights, drum kits, scatting, drug references and occasionally raunchy (for Disney) lyrics were jarring and unpleasant on the palette. We cannot even get away from cloying child characters, though thankfully, we respect the human- animal interaction boundaries this time. I have to say the only things remotely charming in this film were the odious comic relief in the form of the country dogs and, to a lesser extent, the British geese. Two things that had absolutely nothing to do with the story, but were obvious fillers since the producers saw what was essential could in no way stand on its own.If you can't have interesting leads or music or a good plot, the least you can do is offer up an entertaining foe. However, Edgar is undeniably the worst villain in the Disney canon- not remotely clever enough to be a believable menace. Seriously- his math and reasoning aren't even junior high level, he decides to kill the cats before the benefactor even dies (therefore not only not speeding up his inheritance a minute, but also allowing her the opportunity to adopt even younger cats) and he drugs them when they would have trusted him enough to let him stuff him in a sack (as he actually DID in the last act). To top it off, he's not a serious physical threat or, especially condemning, remotely funny. Even Robin Hood managed to scrape up a villain who could do one of those!Not to say that there are no redeeming qualities. Though Everybody Wants to Be a Cat bugs me in context, it is not entirely offensive to the ears and is quite catchy. Eva Gabor and Phil Harris are great, though they were both better in other Disney roles- him as Baloo and her as Miss Bianca. Maurice Chevallier coats the opening with his characteristic lovable frenchiness- the one place that takes advantage of the Parisian setting. Speaking of settings, though the character animation was quite hideous, the backgrounds were lovely- especially at times where they became almost soggy and washed out. It is, after all, still Disney.Everybody, even manic Disneylovers, has a certain film they unleash all their scorn and frustration on. Aristocats is mine, partly because its ugly and lackluster in the long line of progressively uglier and lacklust(ier) films, but mostly because by this point it seemed like they just didn't care. Previous efforts has been misguided and faltered in some way or another, but never had there been such an obvious abandonment before, though I'll reserve my judgement on the after a while yet.Quote of the film Uncle Waldo- Prime Country Goose A la Provencale, stuffed with chestnuts...?

This film made history as being the first Australian (tons of emphasis on that proper noun) film made with a widescreen anamorphic lens. The films also became the best Australian film......since ever, only for the simple reason of (you guessed it) it having no true blue crap. Last, but most importantly, it made Mel Gibson became an international star and this was the starting point of a journey, a very complicated and criticized journey in fact, that would rocket off a successful career in acting and directing, as well. Mad Max is a very fun to watch, especially at the end, because who doesn't love watching heroes kicking the baddies ass*s by breaking bones, crushing them, shooting at them, and getting revenge through many painful and torturous ways. If you are feeling sympathy for the baddies don't because what they did to innocent Max was uncalled for and unforgivable. They killed his wife that put a hole in his heart and killed his baby son which tore his heart out. He will make them pay for what they did because he is MAD MAX!!!! The whole plot sounds pretty stereotypical and it kind of is but the desolate scenery and the different Australia makes up for the plot. The atmosphere is very dark and gloomy making it the best one-of-a-kind atmosphere for this film. The film was made with very little money and George Miller, the director of Mad Max Trilogy, actually had to work as an Emergency Room Doctor. The stunts look very cool, not stylish, and with the amount of money it was made with, you have to marvel and wonder on how on earth could they have made it? The film's first half is slow and the dialog is pretty lame to the bone. I didn't like the first half because it had no adrenaline like it did for the second half. The first chasing scene had to be the worst of the film and everyone shouting Night Rider! really made it look lame. The story paces up in the second half and makes you forget about the crap you had to endure for the first half. As I finished the film, Mad Max impacted me and my brain was telling me to give this film a perfect ten but after remembering about the first half, I finally decided to give it a six. One thing that I don't think was necessary was the classification for the film in Australia. It got an R18+ up here and in the United States it was the same thing. This film has less violence that Running Scared and that was rated MA15+.In a dystopic future Australia, a vicious violent biker gang murder nicknamed the Nightrider, a cop's family and make his fight with them personal. He escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. Max pursues the Nightrider in a high-speed chase, which results in the Nightrider's death by fiery explosion. Following the dangerous chase, which resulted in injuries for a number of officers, the police chief warns Max who thinks nothing of it at the time that now the bandits are out for him because of the death of the Nightrider. The biker gang, which is led by the Toecutter plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers. Toecutter's young protegé, the biker Johnny the Boy, sets a trap for Max's close friend and fellow officer, Jim Goose. When Goose's vehicle is flipped over, the bikers burn him alive in retaliation for the Nightrider's death.The action scenes are truly remarkable for the way it is portrayed on screen. It has a touch of both reality and unreality, and with that, the action scenes are more enjoyable. The Aussie accent is still there and more annoying than ever but the film's fun-ness will make you forget about that. The film was before I got it an unknown to me and I shunned it because it looked so boring but I urge you guys out there to forget about that and watch the film. I lowly recommend this to any Aussie and someone who loves watching their typical revenge film. My two favorite scenes had to be when 1 - When Max's wife is running through the woods with the bikers' after her because that scene had a sense of horror and thriller stuck to it making it memorable. 2 - Max's reaction to his wife and daughters death because that part of the film made you hate the bikies as much as Max and for the way it was presented on screen.

As a dedicated Beatles fan I was appalled by what I was watching. First of all the script is clearly flawed, there are a lot of historical inaccuracies, among one of the things that enraged me was that they basically made Paul McCartney out to be the villain of the story when in fact that was the farthest thing from the truth. In fact John wasn't actually that upset when Stu told him he wanted to leave the band he was more upset with the fact that Stu was staying in Germany and not returning with them to Liverpool. Another thing that didn't anger me, but annoyed the hell out of me was Stephen Dorff's awful Liverpudlian accent. It was just really annoying and it took me completely out of the story. No matter how much Dorff resembles Sutcliffe he is the worst choice to play this role. I don't believe that at the time he was an experienced actor that was prepared for a role as demanding as this one. The dialogue was pretty shoddy, apart from the stuff being uttered by Hart, Bakewell and O'Neill. Honestly every time Sheryl Lee and Stephen Dorff opened their mouths I wanted to puke. The love scenes were cheesy and dated. Also in real life Miss Kirchherr didn't even know a word of English and had to communicate with Stu and the rest of the lads with a dictionary. Wouldn't it had been easier for them to have hired an actual German actress who spoke English to play the role of Astrid rather than an American with a crappy German accent. Also the music being played is very punk rock, a genre and a style that didn't even exist back then. The producer of the film said this was done to better convey the way the music came across to the audience, at the time, well as wonderful as an idea as that is, what it does is to confuse and annoy the audience especially real Beatle fans like myself that have seen footage of the real Beatles performing classics like Long Tall Sally which was by the way massacred in this film. Another thing, the whole movie sells it self as the story of Stu Sutcliffe, the Beatle that could have been. Honestly who cares? What people want to see going in to this film is John Lennon, or Paul McCartney or even George Harrison, or poor Ringo, who doesn't even have lines in this movie he's in it for less than a minute and he's lying on a bed sleeping for the entire two seconds he's on the screen. Could it have hurt the producers to give the poor guy a line or two if merely for the fans' sake, also Ringo was one of their closest friends in Hamburg and even played a few gigs with the Beatles themselves when Pete Best didn't show up to some gigs, which was actually quite often. So it wasn't like they were going to stretch the truth if they gave the actor playing Ringo a bigger role. But no instead they write more crappy love scenes between Dorff and Lee who barely have any chemistry. Poor Astrid Kirchherr, she is portrayed in this movie as a lovesick, slutty harpy who tore Stu and John apart. She was actually very close to all the Beatles even Paul, who had his differences with Stu.It would have been more interesting (and better) if the film focused not only on Stu, but on all the Beatles and presented the growing problems with the band, like Pete Best's absence and his lack of interest, or the songwriting partnership between John and Paul and the fight for leadership, or George's frustration as the youngest member of the band, or their growing friendship with Ringo. But not all is bad, there are some good things though not many. Ian Hart is absolutely fabulous as John Lennon, if there is one person who can completely embody the icon it's him. He delivers the lines so well that it feels like he's improvising some of the stuff, and who knows maybe he did. Gary Bakewell looks and acts like a young cocky Paul McCartney and does what he can with what is given to him. He's written like a villain, even though for most of the film we actually agree with him but that's also due to the fact that the writers in trying to make Sutcliffe interesting and sympathetic due the exact opposite, he's just an annoyance and as soon as he's on the screen you want him to go away. Scot Williams and Chris O'Neill also do a pretty good job with the little they're given. Lee's accent is atrocious as is Dorff's and that pretty much messes their whole performances. Jennifer Ehle is passable as Cynthia No wonder the real Cynthia Lennon was upset when this film came out, she's portrayed as a pathetic melodramatic woman. It's not Ehle's fault though it's more the writers and director's fault. I don't even know what kind of pathetic research Ian Softley did when he wrote the script and made this movie, but obviously he should of done more. The ending is sappy and melodramatic, but what do you expect from such a cheesy and historically inaccurate biopic.

She was actually very close to all the Beatles even Paul, who had his differences with Stu.It would have been more interesting (and better) if the film focused not only on Stu, but on all the Beatles and presented the growing problems with the band, like Pete Best's absence and his lack of interest, or the songwriting partnership between John and Paul and the fight for leadership, or George's frustration as the youngest member of the band, or their growing friendship with Ringo. But not all is bad, there are some good things though not many. Ian Hart is absolutely fabulous as John Lennon, if there is one person who can completely embody the icon it's him. He delivers the lines so well that it feels like he's improvising some of the stuff, and who knows maybe he did. Gary Bakewell looks and acts like a young cocky Paul McCartney and does what he can with what is given to him. He's written like a villain, even though for most of the film we actually agree with him but that's also due to the fact that the writers in trying to make Sutcliffe interesting and sympathetic due the exact opposite, he's just an annoyance and as soon as he's on the screen you want him to go away. Scot Williams and Chris O'Neill also do a pretty good job with the little they're given. Lee's accent is atrocious as is Dorff's and that pretty much messes their whole performances. Jennifer Ehle is passable as Cynthia No wonder the real Cynthia Lennon was upset when this film came out, she's portrayed as a pathetic melodramatic woman. It's not Ehle's fault though it's more the writers and director's fault. I don't even know what kind of pathetic research Ian Softley did when he wrote the script and made this movie, but obviously he should of done more. The ending is sappy and melodramatic, but what do you expect from such a cheesy and historically inaccurate biopic.

As a dedicated Beatles fan I was appalled by what I was watching. First of all the script is clearly flawed, there are a lot of historical inaccuracies, among one of the things that enraged me was that they basically made Paul McCartney out to be the villain of the story when in fact that was the farthest thing from the truth. In fact John wasn't actually that upset when Stu told him he wanted to leave the band he was more upset with the fact that Stu was staying in Germany and not returning with them to Liverpool. Another thing that didn't anger me, but annoyed the hell out of me was Stephen Dorff's awful Liverpudlian accent. It was just really annoying and it took me completely out of the story. No matter how much Dorff resembles Sutcliffe he is the worst choice to play this role. I don't believe that at the time he was an experienced actor that was prepared for a role as demanding as this one. The dialogue was pretty shoddy, apart from the stuff being uttered by Hart, Bakewell and O'Neill. Honestly every time Sheryl Lee and Stephen Dorff opened their mouths I wanted to puke. The love scenes were cheesy and dated. Also in real life Miss Kirchherr didn't even know a word of English and had to communicate with Stu and the rest of the lads with a dictionary. Wouldn't it had been easier for them to have hired an actual German actress who spoke English to play the role of Astrid rather than an American with a crappy German accent. Also the music being played is very punk rock, a genre and a style that didn't even exist back then. The producer of the film said this was done to better convey the way the music came across to the audience, at the time, well as wonderful as an idea as that is, what it does is to confuse and annoy the audience especially real Beatle fans like myself that have seen footage of the real Beatles performing classics like Long Tall Sally which was by the way massacred in this film. Another thing, the whole movie sells it self as the story of Stu Sutcliffe, the Beatle that could have been. Honestly who cares? What people want to see going in to this film is John Lennon, or Paul McCartney or even George Harrison, or poor Ringo, who doesn't even have lines in this movie he's in it for less than a minute and he's lying on a bed sleeping for the entire two seconds he's on the screen. Could it have hurt the producers to give the poor guy a line or two if merely for the fans' sake, also Ringo was one of their closest friends in Hamburg and even played a few gigs with the Beatles themselves when Pete Best didn't show up to some gigs, which was actually quite often. So it wasn't like they were going to stretch the truth if they gave the actor playing Ringo a bigger role. But no instead they write more crappy love scenes between Dorff and Lee who barely have any chemistry.

Each has ideals but to follow those ideals is rather tricky.For Altman, politics remain in the background in Nashville while the music takes front stage. And what a cast of characters to follow around! Never in another film have I seen such a diverse group of the same people; wanna-be singers combined with reporters, groupies, fans, family and others. To simply highlight the incredible cast, I must mention Lily Tomlin as a struggling housewife, Geraldine Chaplin as a British reporter who ultimately misses the big story due to her inane ability to ramble on about the unimportant details, Ronee Blakely as a star on the fall Barbara Jean, Henry Gibson as the glib and arrogant legend Haven Hamilton and Keith Carradine as a womanizing, self-absorbed musician who reveals his own insecurities and problems with one magical song in one magical moment.Perhaps the best part of Nashville, aside from Altman's ever-important deft touch, is the music. I am not personally a big fan of country music but much of it here (written by the actors themselves) feels more authentic and genuine than the conventional trash made today. There is real feeling and warmth in each performance, particularly in what I think is the best song of them all, I'm Easy by Carradine. Some will criticize the ending or the accuracy of the film's portrayal of country music but I think Altman was more focused on being accurate in portraying the human experience.

He's suave in this movie in a way that he wasn't before...especially compared to the debut of this franchise (Dr.No). Never before has he been this likable...you just want to be with him...or better yet, be him! (hmmm...that's if you are a bloke).There are times in this movie when his attempts at bon mots or interaction with women aren't his high points, but they are buried under the rest of his charismatic performance.When I first saw this movie a month or so back, I was looking at scoring it around 8\/10. Having watched it again the other day, I have to say how pleasurable it still was...the lovely chemistry between Connery and Honor Blackman, and just the winning persona of Connery as Bond in this movie. The first two Bond movie don't really have that 'repeat' viewing quality. For me, this is ultimate Connery as Bond movie. The plot is simple and Goldfinger's personal assistant is one of the most memorable henchman in the franchise...more memorable than some of the principle villains in the past or future movies.The settingThe U.S.A. (Miami, Kentucky); Geneva.The plot Seemingly legit businessman Auric Goldfinger is suspected by Bond's organisation (MI5) of being a gold smuggler, so James is assigned to find out how Goldfinger is managing to smuggle gold undetected. Just by the by, you do get a nice snapshot of the business of gold early on in the movie...the world's changed since then...the British currency no longer is supported by the value of Britain's gold reserves. As for Goldfinger's actual scheme...it's wonderfully ambivalent...initially I just found it totally absurd, yet it does have its own diabolical logic which makes it insanely sensible! Looking at the end credits, it seems that the scenes supposedly shot in the US were done at Pinewood studios, in England...the studio made famous by the Bond movies. With this bit of information, it sort of makes sense now why the Americans didn't really sound convincing to me...but maybe they are real American actors, and not British impersonators.This is the first Bond movie to 'tick all the boxes' as far as the franchise formula is concerned Pre-title sequence Yes. You get the iconic gun barrel graphic, theme music and gunshot. Then the pre-theme sequence which now appears for the 2nd time, after the first movie did not feature it.Movie title theme Yes. The first Bond movie where the theme song is at the start. And this is the first classic too...by Shirley Bassey, of course. Surely the greatest exponent of this formula. The lyrics pretty much give you the back story to Auric Goldfinger! Sexism Yes. Bond comes off as patronising a couple of times in his dealings with women...by what he says (Man talk) or a slap on the bum. This is a minor quibble, as he does come across as cooler other times, even when he isn't being the perfect gentlemen to some of the female characters.Silly female character names Yes. You get the impression that Dink is a rather lame attempt at this formula, but gosh, you ain't seen nothing yet! One of the male characters has a rather odd name...literally. Both of these names gets 'satirised' in one of the Austin Powers movies.Wine snobbery Yes. Thank God that even M has gotten sick of this trait by now!

The sequence here where Jill arrives at the train station and takes a carriage through town, and then Monument Valley (while a ravishing piece of Morricone scoring plays) is astonishing.But... I've never loved an entire Leone movie. He's too self-indulgent. Here, long stretches of silence are his only idea. When they work, the results are sublime. But here that's only three times out of twelve. There's so many of them they're quickly exposed as a gimmick\/crutch, BUT alternately, when he gives lines to his actors the quality instantly plummets. We never become interested in a single character's arc. As soon as Claudia Cardinale talks, you go oh, that mysterious, vivid creature we've been looking at, is just a common two-dimensional female lead... meh... Her Doonesbury mascara is a bit much. This movie plays like an unrelated series of scenes Leone wanted to shoot.It still might have been a decent effort... but then Jason Robards shows up, and destroys the movie. In the history of film, has there ever been a less interesting actor than Jason Robards? At his best he's average, at his worst, he's an energy vampire, sucking the life out of projects. Over his entire career no viewer has ever said I've just got to see that new Jason Robards movie this weekend. If you ever thought actors were interchangeable and all you needed was a competent one who could read his lines, watch Robards here. What was Leone thinking? You cannot hang an entire movie on Jason Robards. His heavy is feeble, not intimidating. He wanders around hoping to look competent; clueless about where to place the emphasis in his lines, or what to do with his arms. And when he tries to flash an intimidating look, he focuses too close to his face and just looks cross-eyed and silly. He molds nothing about his presence or his role. It actually seems like he's thinking 'I'm all wrong for this. I hope no one notices.' He brings nothing to the table. He' s completely out of his depth. Nothing resembling chemistry forms between him and Cardinale. Charles Bronson's harmonica theme is excruciating. It's Morricone's worst motif.

Basically New York city art gallery assistant and recently divorced Elizabeth McGraw (Razzie nominated Kim Basinger) one day meets and is slowly seduced by mysterious Wall Street stock market worker John Grey (Mickey Rourke). He seems friendly and playful at first, but behind closed doors he shows his true lust for her by playing sexual games, starting with blindfolding and rubbing ice down her body. This continues with him asking her to crawl on floors, feeding her loads of food from the fridge with her eyes closed, and (in a scene I never saw apart from on TV) sex in the rain on a flight of stairs. Elizabeth can't help but be sexually lusting for John, to the point where she is almost reliant on him to do things, e.g. being fed, bathing her, but she knows the relationship is dodgy when a Spanish whore gets involved. She finally decides to leave him after nine and a half weeks, even when he says he will tell her everything about himself and not be a stranger anymore, but it's too late. Also starring Margaret Whitton as Molly, David Margulies as Harvey, Christine Baranski as Thea, Karen Young as Sue, William De Acutis as Ted, Dwight Weist as Mathew Farnsworth and The Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood as Rock Star Party Guest. The three most memorable scenes of the film are Basinger having ice rubbed on her, being fed all sorts of food from the fridge and with honey on her, and her striptease to the song You Can Leave Your Hat On (the Joe Cocker version). I'm afraid to say that, apart from these scenes, Rourke being cool, and Basinger looking gorgeous with and without clothes, it is a terrible film with no real point and makes you feel weird, it's really only worth seeing the once. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Original Song for I Do What I Do (Nine 1\/2 Weeks theme) and Worst Screenplay.
