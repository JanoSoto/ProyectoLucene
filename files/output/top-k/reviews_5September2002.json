When I accessed the Rules and Clues feature on the DVD, that confirmed my theories and exposed a few details that I didn't even notice on the second viewing. The acting is good all-around.  Bruce Willis gives, probably, his most low-key performance up-to-date.  He is both compelling and convincing, not getting in the audience's face with a showy dramatic performance.  Haley Joel Osment was the perfect choice for Cole, and I don't think the phrase, I see dead people, would be the same coming out of any other child actor's mouth.  A good child actor is hard to find, and Haley Joel is one of the few who I can actually say measures up to a good deal of adult actors.  He's not good for a little kid; he's just a good actor period.  His Oscar nomination was well-deserved.  His acting is very subtle, not broad in any way.  Toni Collette also deserved her Oscar nomination.  I don't live in Philadelphia, so I can't technically judge whether or not her accent was on target, but I know for sure that she pulled off a flawless American accent. And she went the extra mile by taking on a dialect.  Just like Osment, her acting is very subtle and you sense the pain and anguish she feels as a single mother of this estranged kid without her having to continuously sob and burst into tears.  Actors should know that you don't need to cry to express sadness.  9 times out of 10, people try their best to hold back the tears--at least when they're in public or in front of other people.

I agreed and since I picked the last movie- Black Hawk Down- I asked her what she wanted to see (I know, what a guy). The suggestion was The Royall Tenenbaums. She is no longer allowed to suggest movies. Ever. I have never had trouble keeping my eyes open during a movie until the excrutiating hour and a half I spent suffering through Tenenbaum. I have never wished that I was at the dentist or proctologist until Tenenbaum. I have never thought that there could be an activity more boring than watching a snail sleep before Tenenbaum. Heck, prison is a more enticing option than sitting through Tenenbaum. Even watching your nose hairs grow is more enticing. What was so bad about the movie? In my mind, a movie has to have one of the following to be worthy of viewing Action, drama, comedy, sex, a good story, and any of a million other things. Tenenbaum meets none of the criteria. For crying out loud, even the chick...who is by the way not even a hot babe with huge natural breast...she don't even deserve to be in a film, (Gwyneth Paltrow) does not look good in this movie. There is more action in plant growing contests, more sex in Mary Poppin's movies, and drama (!) well I cannot even think of something that would result in a facetious comment. Oh, and the good story part; lets just say that most Wrestlemania shows, late night Cinemax, and Springer episodes involve more of a story line.Furthermore, the movie leads you to believe that there is a star studded cast. Well, there is. I do have to wonder if the stars (Hackman, Paltrow, and Stiller) even read the script before signing on. Paltrow (One reason to put up with up a chic flick- she is pleasing to the eye and other parts) spends the entire movie in a catatonic state. She is the brooding daughter who is chronically depressed and spends every minute wearing too much dark makeup and showing less acting ability than most dead squirrels. Stiller, well, for the three minutes he appears in the movie he is about as humorous as a bottle of Aquafina water. Even worse, the film does not even try to make use of his humorous abilities. Heck, anyone could have played his part and done as well as he did. About all he did was wear a funny jump\/sweat suit and play the part of the tough love son. As for Paltrow and Stiller, think of an athlete who knows he is past his time, but would like to collect a final paycheck- worthless and showing zero talent, but collecting big bucks. Gene Hackman plays the lead role and was about as funny as, well, as uh, Rosanne is sexy. Yes, just like seeing Rosanne naked, I found Hackman to be as endearing as, well as seeing Rosanne naked. In other words, there are about 97.7 million things I would rather suffer through. Hackman plays the role of devious father who has been estranged from his family for years- 20 to be exact. He is desperately trying to win back the affection of his family and goes to extremes- which we are supposed to think are humorous- to do so. The oh- so- humorous extremes involve faking illness and secret meetings with the kids of Stiller in order to win affection. At the same time he is trying to win his way back into the heart of his wife (divorced him- sort of- after he lost his millions) and we are supposed to find this funny. Again, I would get more of a chuckle out of staring at a wall.The plot basically focuses on Hackman as an estranged father figure who has lost millions. He wants to earn back the love of his family and goes to the not so funny extremes I mentioned before. In the interim, you have the wacky daughter (Paltrow) and her numerous loves, the loony son and his friend (the dorky perfect guy from Meet the Parents) trying to fall in love with Paltrow, and Stiller playing the oddball father to two kids who really do resemble what he most likely looked like at a younger age. Hackman pretends to have cancer and is set to die shortly. He wants to right all of his wrongs with the family and get back into their good blessings before passing on. The movie ends when he finally does pass with the tough love son- Stiller- beside his bed. Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is that it was impossbile to follow. The story was not developed well and there were too many characters attempting to be developed in the opening three minutes.I thought that the premise posed some moments that could be humorous. The last time I was that wrong was when I invited my parents to see Debbie Does Dallas with me and a girlfriend. In all honesty, I told my girlfriend that Tenenbaum was the worst movie I had ever seen and this was five minutes into the movie. My opinion only got worse. The one saving grace- as is often the case for a guy when seeing a chic movie- would have been Paltrow. However, unlike many chic flicks, the female lead was not attractive. Had Paltrow looked remotely sexy\/hot\/not butt I may have been able to keep my eyes open for the entire movie. I would liken Tenenbaum to a dark Woody Allen movie. Hey, if you like that stuff, more power to you. Personally, I prefer going to Dr. Urbuttisingoodshape (the proctologist) versus a Woody Allen production. Especially one that is a poor offering. In case you are wondering, my girlfriend is still my girlfriend. However, she is NEVER allowed to pick another movie unless I am really, really hungover and in need of a nap. Believe it or not, I even told her I would rather be watching What Women Want. Avoid Tenenbaum.

As for Paltrow and Stiller, think of an athlete who knows he is past his time, but would like to collect a final paycheck- worthless and showing zero talent, but collecting big bucks. Gene Hackman plays the lead role and was about as funny as, well, as uh, Rosanne is sexy. Yes, just like seeing Rosanne naked, I found Hackman to be as endearing as, well as seeing Rosanne naked. In other words, there are about 97.7 million things I would rather suffer through. Hackman plays the role of devious father who has been estranged from his family for years- 20 to be exact. He is desperately trying to win back the affection of his family and goes to extremes- which we are supposed to think are humorous- to do so. The oh- so- humorous extremes involve faking illness and secret meetings with the kids of Stiller in order to win affection. At the same time he is trying to win his way back into the heart of his wife (divorced him- sort of- after he lost his millions) and we are supposed to find this funny. Again, I would get more of a chuckle out of staring at a wall.The plot basically focuses on Hackman as an estranged father figure who has lost millions. He wants to earn back the love of his family and goes to the not so funny extremes I mentioned before. In the interim, you have the wacky daughter (Paltrow) and her numerous loves, the loony son and his friend (the dorky perfect guy from Meet the Parents) trying to fall in love with Paltrow, and Stiller playing the oddball father to two kids who really do resemble what he most likely looked like at a younger age. Hackman pretends to have cancer and is set to die shortly. He wants to right all of his wrongs with the family and get back into their good blessings before passing on. The movie ends when he finally does pass with the tough love son- Stiller- beside his bed. Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is that it was impossbile to follow. The story was not developed well and there were too many characters attempting to be developed in the opening three minutes.I thought that the premise posed some moments that could be humorous. The last time I was that wrong was when I invited my parents to see Debbie Does Dallas with me and a girlfriend. In all honesty, I told my girlfriend that Tenenbaum was the worst movie I had ever seen and this was five minutes into the movie. My opinion only got worse. The one saving grace- as is often the case for a guy when seeing a chic movie- would have been Paltrow. However, unlike many chic flicks, the female lead was not attractive. Had Paltrow looked remotely sexy\/hot\/not butt I may have been able to keep my eyes open for the entire movie. I would liken Tenenbaum to a dark Woody Allen movie. Hey, if you like that stuff, more power to you. Personally, I prefer going to Dr. Urbuttisingoodshape (the proctologist) versus a Woody Allen production. Especially one that is a poor offering. In case you are wondering, my girlfriend is still my girlfriend. However, she is NEVER allowed to pick another movie unless I am really, really hungover and in need of a nap.

I agreed and since I picked the last movie- Black Hawk Down- I asked her what she wanted to see (I know, what a guy). The suggestion was The Royall Tenenbaums. She is no longer allowed to suggest movies. Ever. I have never had trouble keeping my eyes open during a movie until the excrutiating hour and a half I spent suffering through Tenenbaum. I have never wished that I was at the dentist or proctologist until Tenenbaum. I have never thought that there could be an activity more boring than watching a snail sleep before Tenenbaum. Heck, prison is a more enticing option than sitting through Tenenbaum. Even watching your nose hairs grow is more enticing. What was so bad about the movie? In my mind, a movie has to have one of the following to be worthy of viewing Action, drama, comedy, sex, a good story, and any of a million other things. Tenenbaum meets none of the criteria. For crying out loud, even the chick...who is by the way not even a hot babe with huge natural breast...she don't even deserve to be in a film, (Gwyneth Paltrow) does not look good in this movie. There is more action in plant growing contests, more sex in Mary Poppin's movies, and drama (!) well I cannot even think of something that would result in a facetious comment. Oh, and the good story part; lets just say that most Wrestlemania shows, late night Cinemax, and Springer episodes involve more of a story line.Furthermore, the movie leads you to believe that there is a star studded cast. Well, there is. I do have to wonder if the stars (Hackman, Paltrow, and Stiller) even read the script before signing on. Paltrow (One reason to put up with up a chic flick- she is pleasing to the eye and other parts) spends the entire movie in a catatonic state. She is the brooding daughter who is chronically depressed and spends every minute wearing too much dark makeup and showing less acting ability than most dead squirrels. Stiller, well, for the three minutes he appears in the movie he is about as humorous as a bottle of Aquafina water. Even worse, the film does not even try to make use of his humorous abilities.

This movie does the first. By pitting two of the world's major female fighters in the same kick-ass movie they break the mould of a majorly male lead industry.Whilst this is comendable and indeed fantastic, the result is of kick-ass action female heros shows even females can kick ass and look damn good doing it.Unfortuently although this film is fun, it isn't up to scratch on the plot, writing or characters. It still plays like the old cliched action movies of the past. It still has one-dimensional people, over the top bad guys and a story that doesn't make sense the more it is explained.You shouldn't concern yourself with the plot in this movie, although it really does pull this movie down slowly but surely. Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock team up to track down the murderer of a British Diplomat. Rothrock is from Scotland Yard and immediatley makes an impression with her almost upskirt camera angles and her long skirt waving about on screen as she kicks and beats an escaping convict.But Rothrock's character is muddled. Why is she constantly beating up prisoners? Why is she angry all the time? Was the diplomat Rothrock's father? Nope. Does Scotland Yard's way of questioning come from a POW camp? Who knows. Fortuently her character is muted along the film so we don't have to think about it. Rothrock's fiery character is played against the sure and measured response of the beautiful Michelle Yeoh.The film is rather dated. The film quality isn't all that good. The one dimensional characters do not make it feel as good as it could have been.  Dick Wei in his usual bad guy routine plays a damn good bodyguard to the drug dealing bad guy but during the end sequences he is left as the only man to stop these two girls. Their two on one fight is very, very short...It should have been five times as long.Also I have a problem with the character of Mad Dog. Who is he? Why is he there? What's wrong with his 'tache? Why has he got a US army uniform on?  His character is perhaps the worst of the one dimensional characters in the film, and that's not even including the ravenousily cackling drugs baron bad guy. I kept shouting stop laughing for goodness sake.The end fight sequence is amazing as Rothrock and Yeoh gatecrash the drugs baron's mansion - and the ending is pretty good with the bad guy getting away with his crimes *well, almost*. But it isn't as good as the DVD seems to think it is.The DVD version has no audio commentary, the interview has no questions just answers and when questioned the interviewees don't even talk about the movie, which seems strange considering this is what I paid for.As police action movies goes Yes Madam or Police Assassins is a dated but still fun attempt to break the mould of action movies. And whilst it does do this, it doesn't do it in the same way as say Jackie Chan's prolific and far superior Police Story. I'd buy that instead.

You never got that in not even 1 comic book issue. In realife if a person had hair growing out of his fingers people would hate him every time he walked around. 2) The Mary-Jane character sucked totally.

If I was in charge of the cast I would replace Kirsten with Paula Gerces( the actress from the movie Clockstoppers). Paula Gerces would play a hell of lot better Mary-Jane character. 3) I say the Green Goblin was changed too much. His mask in the movie didn't move when he spoke and they waste money on a heavy armour suit which made him look more like a robot and he moved his arms in slow motion like if he was the Freakin TERMINATOR. The exploding grenades looked more like oranges which made it more suited for a child. In the comics they were exploding jack-0-lanterns. The green Goblin in the comics and the TV show had greenn and purple and his soft mask moved when he spoke. In the movie like The GREEN GOBLIN looked like a stiff character that had been plaigerized from the GREEN HORNET. 4) It had too much love in that movie and it is supposed to have ACTION in that movie.I liked the X-men movie better because at least the characters where only changed just a little. The only changes the X-men characters had was there clothing which is what you get in comic books too. Nothing less it wasn't too bad a film.

I thought his hit La Femme Nikita was over-rated.  But after watching the opening scene of The Professional, I gained a new respect for Besson. The movie's central character is Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a hit-man who runs his professional and personal life with little - if any - emotion. He lives a paranoid existence - he shuffles desperately through crowds in an attempt to remain unnoticed and has his gun nearby when he sleeps, which he does while sitting down.Leon's world changes when he decides to help Mathilda, the 12-year-old girl (Natalie Portman, in her film debut) who lives in the apartment next to him. While out picking up groceries, Mathilda's family is murdered by corrupt DEA agents paying retribution to her drug-dealing father. When she returns, a lookout man is watching the door to her family's apartment but she still manages to see the dead bodies inside.  Pretending to be the neighbour, she walks by the carnage and proceeds to knock on Leon's door and, in one of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie, he decides to let her in.   Initially, Leon provides little support to the orphan Mathilda but she informs him that since he saved her, she is now his responsibility.  When she discovers that he is a cleaner, she takes this as a sign that she must become his student and will use her newly taught skills to kill Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), the man behind her family's murder. It turns out to be a mutual apprenticeship - he teaches her how to kill and how to be a lady and she teaches him how to read and how to have fun - and they develop a father-daughter-like bond. The Professional combines a fantastic story-line with incredible action scenes, no mean feat for this particular genre.  Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are so natural together they make the premise of a hit-man training a twelve year-old believable.  My one problem with the movie is Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery so much with his villain role that he almost turns it into a cartoon character.  However, the film is strong enough to overcome Oldman's antics. It's apparent that Besson somewhere other than Hollywood because he doesn't sell out with a perfect ending.  It's gutsy, yet touching.

I'm a big fan of horror movies eventhough I usually get dissapointed in them as most horror movies are, in fact, bad. I have forgotten most of the movies I've seen at this early age, but this one stuck to my memory. When I saw it again in the mid-nineties it was even better. Most people don't know about this film and a girl that watched this movie with me at that point recently said to me do you remember that movie The Changeling? It still haunts me. Believe me - the title is difficult to remember for Norwegians and she still remembered it.

Wow, some people just completely missed the boat on this one. SLC Punk is one of the most accurate and unflinching documentary style films to come along in years. It's a film about the lives of anarchist punks, who most people don't know anything about beyond the freaky way that they dress. Stevo, played perfectly by Matthew Lillard, speaks directly to the camera and to the audience, and with spectacular effect. The film knows very well that it deals with the lives of hardcore punks, a kind of blocked off group because they don't want much to do with other people, and most people want little to do with them, but are fascinated with them nonetheless, whether out of sheer morbid curiosity or genuine interest. This is a film that deals with a difficult group of people but still manages to be so real and so straightforward that it can be enjoyed by younger people because of the sheer entertainment value as well as the accuracy with which they capture the lifestyle of the punks (I've been there), and it can also be enjoyed by adults as a learning experience, if nothing else. SLC Punk is a remarkably versatile film, it knows its subject matter very well and is therefore able to communicate it clearly even to someone who has never had any experience with the kinds of people that it depicts.Some of the scenes are exaggerated, such as the job hunt scene, but this is a documentary style film that not only delivers a strong presentation on the subject matter that it deals with, but also contains some highly skilled cinematography. The scene where Stevo is on acid with his friend, for example, is one of the most effective drug sequences I've ever seen.SLC Punk is such an accurate film and delivers such a gigantic amount of information about the lives of the people that it focuses on that it's obvious that it was written and directed by someone with a lot of personal experience in that sort of lifestyle. In fact, click on James Merendino's name on the IMDb title page for SLC Punk, and you'll see exactly the kind of freaky picture that you would expect to see of someone who comes up with something like this. SLC Punk is an informative and hugely entertaining film, it provides plenty of opportunities for the cast to deliver some excellent comic relief (especially through Stevo, Matthew Lillard's character), and it presents a fun and enjoyable tour through the lives of hardcore punks, specifically those who live in an environment that completely alienates them &#150; the Mormon atmosphere of Salt Lake City.(spoilers) One of the things that makes this film so effective is that it presents the destructive things that these punks do as learning experiences rather than just a complete and reckless waste of life. Stevo, at least, is the one punk who seems to have his head on at least partially straight, growing up to ultimately become exactly what he always hated but knowing all the while that it's a better life than the one he had been living. It seems that the most significant message that's delivered in this film is that it's fun to screw around when you're young, but you can't live your whole life like that. So to Christian Sarnes, who wrote the review that's on the IMDb's title page, if you think that other than a 'very few situational laughs there's not much to speak about,' you have obviously missed quite a bit.
