It's an epic but with -real- people. The characters, even the heroes or peaceful farmers, all have their moments of weakness. Moments where they are vulnerable, despicable or ugly. This is something which I have failed to see in mainstream cinema ever since the 1980's. Somehow, cinema has become a schizophrenic art. Superheroes and super villains on one side and the arty films about weeping losers and the stench of humanity on the other. Wouldn't it be better if we could combine both sides of the story? Who seriously believes a 110% altruistic hero saving the day? Is that a good way to inspire the movie-goers, or is it just offering an escape, nothing more? And who believes narcissistic nobodies ever getting past the stages of teenage angst and actually making their lives interesting enough to put on film? The thing about Seven Samurai is, most of the characters have their weaknesses. But they face them, rise above them and make the world a better place. Of course, that would fit the Star Wars trilogy as well. However, Star Wars chose to replace the background of every day human life with midgets in suits. The same thing goes for the strategy portrayed in the film. It goes beyond the action movie hit em where it hurts type plan and is actually more complex than the ones portrayed in most war movies.The things that actually inspired Hollywood were the characters of the heroes. Tough but funny at the same time. However, the victims in Hollywood productions never reach this degree of realism. The farmers seem like a peaceful bunch, but actually are so scared and full of prejudice that they'd stab a soldier in the back, given the opportunity.Added to this the fact that where most films of the time were just filmed inside studios and here we had spectacular outdoor battle scenes, makes this film a classic not to be missed. It's just incredibly hard to find a mainstream film with this level of coherence, innovation and eye for detail. I must say that the dramatic acting of the time seems a bit laughable now but that never spoiled things for me.

I may even go further to say that the movie is better than the book, an aberration in Hollywood.And why not? When a top action director like John McTiernan of Die Hard fame is thrown together with samurai actors like Sean Connery, a young Alec Baldwin, James Earl Jones, Scott Glen, Joss Ackland, Stellar Skarsgard, Tim Curry, Jeffrey Jones, Sam Neil, to make a movie based on a top selling novel, the film has to deliver.And boy, does it deliver! Right from the opening scenes of Sean Connery's world weary eyes as he gazes over the Soviet Navy dock to the film's climatic underwater battle scenes, this movie will hold your attention and captivate you completely. Not that the film is action packed. Far from it. The film is an endless cycles of plots and counter plots, meetings, etc. But still the entire film reverberates with tension and doom that can only emanate in a world where a few men literally hold the key to dooms day in their hands.Sean Connery plays the brilliant and maverick Soviet sub Captain Marko Ramius who has been placed in command of the latest submarine called the Red October. The Red October is equipped with a hydro propulsion system that can effectively make the submarine run soundlessly. The result? The submarine is capable of evading sonar or satellite detection. As US Naval analyst Skip Tyler played by Jeffrey Jones chillingly puts it this (submarine) could park a coupla hundred warheads off Washington and New York and no one would know anything about it till it was all over Such a device could easily counter balance, if not end, US military supremacy of the seas. Naturally, the Americans consider it a serious threat to their naval superiority and want to know more about the submarine. However, there is a major problem. The submarine has gone dark, embarking on its own solo mission and deviating from the course authorized by the Soviet Navy.All hell breaks loose as both US and Soviet Governments, run around frantically, in blind panic, as they try to fathom the motives behind Ramius's action. But there is one known fact to both countries. The submarine carries several nuclear warheads and the captain Ramius is a famous Soviet hero, a strong party leader who has just been cast in a wave of turbulent emotions because of the death of his wife. The most likely scenario is that Ramius' grief has led him to seek the ultimate act of misdirected vengeance by bombing the US and thus provoking World War III.Enter CIA analyst Jack Ryan who propagates a different but outlandish theory for the Soviet Captain's aberrant behaviour. His theory is rejected as incredible and insane by the Americans and in any case they cannot risk such a ridiculous theory against the possible outcome of nuclear holocaust. It is better to prepare for war.Jack Ryan is then saddled with the unenviable responsibility to prove his theory. What follows is a cat and mouse hunt between Soviet and US navies as each has different motives to want to blow Red October out of the water. Aided by skeptical sea captains, Ryan effectively played by Alec Baldwin, has to contact Ramius in time. Otherwise what could happen is the destruction of Red October or nuclear holocaust or even both.This movie showed that John McTiernan is a master in bringing unbearable tension to the movie. Despite the fact that the film was made immediately after the cold war, it is still a cliff hanger movie which all the James Bond and Jason Bourne movies put together cannot equal.The main stars, Connery and Baldwin, also put in excellent performances. Why Connery did not win an Oscar for his electrifying performance as the world weary but exceptional sea strategist in sub warfare is a mystery to me. Baldwin too was a treasure to watch. The uncertainty on his face as he goes on a mission for which he has no training for, his fear when inadvertently put in a hunt and kill situation, and his metamorphosis into a cold blooded executioner, were simply first class. It was a shame he did not reprise the Jack Ryan role in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger (The Sum of All Fears does not count).

Clancy adopted a more realistic approach in the portrayal of Captain Ramius as a brilliant captain who is still limited by the submarine's capabilities and the natural forces of the sea, and is worried about the unpredictable dangers he is facing. McTiernan on the other created an extraordinary seaman, almost supernatural in his approach and mildly contemptuous of the forces, both technological and natural, arrayed against him and his submarine.

Not only was acting poor, and special effects laughable, but overall, film was pretty atrocious. The universal concept that our dreams can haunt (and in Nancy's case, harm) us itself is fantastic. However, the delivery is less than acceptable.The first fifteen minutes were the scariest, simply due to chaos, confusion, and the setting. After that, it becomes more comedic than anything else. I will admit that while the movie itself was less than frightening, its after-taste is simply creepy. I mean, the fact is that this girl was being hunted out of revenge, and her every move is stalked by this shadow of a man.I have plenty of qualms with the movie, but the following is definitely number one. I've yet to see the remake, the prequel, or the sequel, so I'm just wondering who Freddy is. I don't think that it's enough to say; Oh, Fred Krueger was a child murderer so we 'offed' him. No. There are plenty of scumbags in every neighborhood who deserve death time and time again, but we, ordinary citizens almost never intervene. Did Freddy commit an atrocity that hit close to home? It also wasn't very clear when Freddy was actually murdered. Yes, Nancy's mother was involved in the killing along with some other renegades, but how much time has passed? Were they themselves children, or was this some sort of PTA rally? Either way, it's these crucial details that make the story actually come to life.

While none of them were realistic by any means, they were this surreal kind of creepy that I thought was done very well. I'm actually curious about the geyser of blood. How did they create such an optical illusion? I mean, maybe they had a blender-esque machine forcibly shooting the gunk into the air, but I just don't know.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"20 June 2011","score":"","review":" I've always had mixed feelings about Dogma, and I feel that the best way to sum it up is as follows As a comedy, the movie is hysterical! It has some incredibly funny dialog, mostly delivered by Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, and Jason Mewes's characters. As an adventure movie, it has a very creative plot and keeps you hooked throughout its journey to its epic and apocalyptic conclusion.Where the movie fails and fails miserably is at being any sort of actual commentary on religion. Despite the many conversations about religion and dogmas held throughout the film...nothing all that deep is ever really said. The movie ultimately has a shallow message of God is cool. Just have a sense of humor and an open mind. And this is a shame because Kevin Smith is clearly a bright guy who knows a lot about church history; he even claims in the closing credits that the film represents his lifetime's worth of religious reflection. You'd think he'd have said something a little more sophisticated.In fact, despite being somewhat controversial when it came out, the movie never really is all that shocking. Yes, I realize there are religious zealots out there who get offended by even the slightest things (Angels and prophets using curse words! Jesus having a 13th apostle! Jesus being black! God being a woman!). But with all due respect, none of those things are REALLY controversial. I would have liked the movie to have been deeper and delved into greater issues like the possibility of God not existing, or Jesus having been an invented character, or exposing the corruption of the Catholic Church, or what about the role of Judaism and Islam? That would have given the film a lot more weight in my opinion.Fortunately, as I said, the movie is a lot of fun, and so I am able to sit back and laugh at what it offers. Rickman, Lee, and Salma Hayek all give the best performances. I do feel Linda Fiorentino is somewhat underwhelming; despite being the lead character, she frequently seems like the dullest thing in the film. I have heard that she and Smith did not get along, and maybe that affected why there seems to be so little to Bethany.Dogma is a very fun and entertaining movie, but alas, it's not very deep, despite what the director seemed to think of it. Listening to Kevin Smith on the DVD commentary track is almost sad; he talks about how he was disappointed the movie didn't get Oscar nominations.

The theme park, called Jurassic Park, is like a zoo of dinosaurs which were created through genetic engineering. Before the park is able to be opened to the public, Dr. Hammond must get approval from an array of people, including scientists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), stating that the park is safe for the public. The dinosaurs end up breaking out of their electric cages due to a power outage and wreak havoc on the entire island and the people on the island. I believe the important lesson to learn from this movie is that technology is great to a point, but technology cannot be completely relied on; the human mind and variables are crucial in many applications. In the film Jurassic Park, Dr. Hammond and his team used technology to create an island full of deadly genetically engineered dinosaurs. Technology was also used to contain these animals; the entire island relied on a computer system. As we all know, most computer systems fail at one point or another, which is what caused the destruction of the island in this film. The writer of the novel and the screenplay Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton, also directed a film with a similar theme. The film Runaway (1984) focuses on what happens when a machine goes bad; again, technology can be helpful, but it can also be hurtful if not used in the correct way. The special effects used in this film were amazing, especially for their time. The dinosaurs in the film seemed like they were actually real thanks to special effects. This goes to show that technology can be extremely useful; but when taken too far, it can also be devastating. There is a fine line between the helpful use of technology and the destructive use of technology. Also, the sound effects were excellent. The sounds of the dinosaurs made you feel like you were actually a part of the film. When a dinosaur would roar, it made me feel scared for the characters of the movie; especially when you could not see where the dinosaur was, you could only hear it. The sound effects used added to the film to make it seem more realistic. The sound effects also instilled emotions, such as fear and anxiety, in me as I was watching the film. I thought that they were implemented very well into the plot and the theme of the movie. All-in-all I thought this was a great film. The theme is timeless because we will always be dealing with the ups and downs of technology; especially nowadays when everything seems to be turning to technology because of the preciseness and the cost-savings. I saw the film when I was a young kid, and to this day, I still love to watch it over and over again.

And I bet that there are some people who hate the film they will say that the only reason people love the film is because they're looking at it through nostalgia goggles. That they only like it because they liked it when they were younger. Well I loved it, or at least really enjoyed it, and I didn't see it when I was younger. I didn't watch it until I was eighteen years old, and I liked it a lot. Maybe it's because I'm a Spielberg fan-boy? Well I wasn't that big a fan of Amistad, Minority Report, Catch me if You Can, and I will fully admit that 1941 sucked.Now this movie wasn't perfect, there are quite a few plot holes, like how Peter keeps growing up despite being in Neverland, the place where you're never supposed to age. I don't really like the beginning, I just find it so mean spirited that I hate watching it. Some may not like that Tinkerbell can talk, I didn't mind this. And some also feel that it get's way too smaultsy. Personally I think it has a nice balance, but at some points, yeah, it can be trying a little too hard.Robin Williams and the lost boys are all funny and likable, but by far the best parts of the movie are the ones with Captain Hook and Smee, Dustin Hoffman and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely hilarious, and their plan to steal Peter's children away from him is a great villainous scheme. I heard that Spielberg was on autopilot with this one, which I can't agree with.

It was the highlight of an obscenity trial in Britain, as it was deemed pornographic trash, and was almost banned. Told in an unconventionally way of writing, the novel is divided into different segments with connecting stories and characters - we have a gang of violent young thugs, a prostitute, a factory worker leading a brutal strike who realises that he is homosexual, a transvestite, and finally, the novel's coda takes place over a 24 hour period in a tenement building. German director Uli Edel brings Selby's masterpiece of the dark side of the human psyche to life in all it's brutal and devastating glory.1952, Brooklyn. America is at war in Korea, and the dark, grim streets of night-time Brooklyn are crawling with soldiers from the Brooklyn Army base. Three soldiers have the misfortune one night to wander onto the scene of a quarrel between Tralala, a prostitute, and Vinnie, a young violent man just released from prison who's the leader of a gang of switch-blade wielding sociopaths. The soldiers jeer Vinnie and Tralala, and end up getting the hell beaten out of them when Sal, Al, Freddy and the rest of the gang come to Vinnie's aid. Watching all of this in a run-down office is Harry Black, the leader of the gruelling strike against the factory that employs most of the men in the neighbourhood. The bitter strike has been going on for six months now. Harry neglects his wife and baby son and stays in the office drinking, and he invites Vinnie's gang over to join him most nights. Harry is fighting inner-demons. He is a closet homosexual, and becomes attracted to a gang of transvestites which include Georgette, who is in love with Vinnie. Tralala hangs around with Vinnie's gang and works with them - she lures customers into alley ways and car parks where Vinnie, Sal and Freddy beat and mug the customers. Tralala later begins to show affection towards a young officer who is falling in love with her. But with the war, their time is short. Also, one of the factory workers organises a 'shot-gun' wedding when one of the young men in the neighbourhood impregnates his teenage daughter.These souls, twisted and evil you could say, wander the streets in what resembles a hell on earth if ever there was one. Uli Edel does an amazing job in capturing the brutality, atmosphere and dialogue of Selby's novel and putting it on screen. The assembled cast was wonderful; they all play each character really well and some of them even demand our sympathy and get it - Harry, probably the most heartbreaking character in the film, as well as the tragic Tralala and Georgette, the 'fairy'. Like the novel, the film is very violent and disturbing. The harsh, depressing atmosphere never lets up, and there's never any light at the end of the tunnel, except for the final scene which is a change from the novel. The tenement building segment at the end of the novel was left out here, which is understandable, although I would have liked to have seen the black man Abraham brought to life from that segment. Overall, it's a very faithful adaptation down to the point that most of the lines are directly from the book.Stephen Lang is amazing as Harry Black. Next to Jennifer Jason Leigh, I'd say his performance is the greatest in the whole film. Leigh is superb as Tralala, and these performances are backed equally great performances by Burt Young as Big Joe, Peter Dobson as Vinnie, and Stephen Baldwin in a sleazy and hard role as Vinnie's right-hand, switch-blade wielding man Sal. Also amongst the cast is Jerry Orbach as the union president, Sam Rockwell as Al, John Costelloe as Tommy and Ricki Lake as Donna.The make-up and cinematography are excellent and really serve to create a very realistic 1950's Brooklyn - which from this looks more to be the American Nightmare than the American Dream. Despite how gruesome and cruel many of the characters are in this, we can't help but generate sympathy for them. A lot of them, after all, are not much different than us. Selby's characters have been crushed by their surroundings and the poverty and violence that exists all around them. Many of them reach terrible ends before they can realise the bad road they are travelling on. A very disturbing but humane film.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"20 June 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Hubet Selby Jr's debut novel Last Exit to Brooklyn caused major controversy when it was first released in the 1960s. It was the highlight of an obscenity trial in Britain, as it was deemed pornographic trash, and was almost banned. Told in an unconventionally way of writing, the novel is divided into different segments with connecting stories and characters - we have a gang of violent young thugs, a prostitute, a factory worker leading a brutal strike who realises that he is homosexual, a transvestite, and finally, the novel's coda takes place over a 24 hour period in a tenement building. German director Uli Edel brings Selby's masterpiece of the dark side of the human psyche to life in all it's brutal and devastating glory.1952, Brooklyn. America is at war in Korea, and the dark, grim streets of night-time Brooklyn are crawling with soldiers from the Brooklyn Army base. Three soldiers have the misfortune one night to wander onto the scene of a quarrel between Tralala, a prostitute, and Vinnie, a young violent man just released from prison who's the leader of a gang of switch-blade wielding sociopaths. The soldiers jeer Vinnie and Tralala, and end up getting the hell beaten out of them when Sal, Al, Freddy and the rest of the gang come to Vinnie's aid. Watching all of this in a run-down office is Harry Black, the leader of the gruelling strike against the factory that employs most of the men in the neighbourhood. The bitter strike has been going on for six months now. Harry neglects his wife and baby son and stays in the office drinking, and he invites Vinnie's gang over to join him most nights. Harry is fighting inner-demons. He is a closet homosexual, and becomes attracted to a gang of transvestites which include Georgette, who is in love with Vinnie. Tralala hangs around with Vinnie's gang and works with them - she lures customers into alley ways and car parks where Vinnie, Sal and Freddy beat and mug the customers. Tralala later begins to show affection towards a young officer who is falling in love with her. But with the war, their time is short. Also, one of the factory workers organises a 'shot-gun' wedding when one of the young men in the neighbourhood impregnates his teenage daughter.These souls, twisted and evil you could say, wander the streets in what resembles a hell on earth if ever there was one. Uli Edel does an amazing job in capturing the brutality, atmosphere and dialogue of Selby's novel and putting it on screen. The assembled cast was wonderful; they all play each character really well and some of them even demand our sympathy and get it - Harry, probably the most heartbreaking character in the film, as well as the tragic Tralala and Georgette, the 'fairy'. Like the novel, the film is very violent and disturbing. The harsh, depressing atmosphere never lets up, and there's never any light at the end of the tunnel, except for the final scene which is a change from the novel. The tenement building segment at the end of the novel was left out here, which is understandable, although I would have liked to have seen the black man Abraham brought to life from that segment. Overall, it's a very faithful adaptation down to the point that most of the lines are directly from the book.Stephen Lang is amazing as Harry Black. Next to Jennifer Jason Leigh, I'd say his performance is the greatest in the whole film. Leigh is superb as Tralala, and these performances are backed equally great performances by Burt Young as Big Joe, Peter Dobson as Vinnie, and Stephen Baldwin in a sleazy and hard role as Vinnie's right-hand, switch-blade wielding man Sal. Also amongst the cast is Jerry Orbach as the union president, Sam Rockwell as Al, John Costelloe as Tommy and Ricki Lake as Donna.The make-up and cinematography are excellent and really serve to create a very realistic 1950's Brooklyn - which from this looks more to be the American Nightmare than the American Dream. Despite how gruesome and cruel many of the characters are in this, we can't help but generate sympathy for them. A lot of them, after all, are not much different than us. Selby's characters have been crushed by their surroundings and the poverty and violence that exists all around them. Many of them reach terrible ends before they can realise the bad road they are travelling on. A very disturbing but humane film.

I t established that there was no real market for high class, mainstream erotica in American film, and also helped spawn and define a cottage industry of lesser quality, niche erotica that continues to this very day, primarily on cable TV. When you add in the fact that Nine ½ Weeks is pretty entertaining as well, you end up with an impressive motion picture.Here's the plot. A divorced New Yorker named Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) falls under the sexual spell of a mysteriously cool man named John (Mickey Rourke). They have a lot of sex of varying physical and emotional quality. Elizabeth eventually tires of their unhealthy union and leaves. The end. That's not an awful lot to sink your teeth into, but that's sort of the point. This was an attempt to make a legitimate movie about the sexual relationship between two people without delving into the realms of softcore porn. It basically uses their sexual encounters to tell us who these people are why they bond.Elizabeth is lonely and stuck inside the degenerate artifice of the New York City art crowd. If John had thinning hair and a beer gut, he'd be an obsessive, controlling pervert. Since he looks like what Mickey Rourke looked like in the mid 80s, he's like a fantasy figure come to life to liberate Elizabeth from her inhibitions. His need to command her and her sexuality at first lets her enjoy parts of herself she would never admit to. Eventually, his need to control expresses itself in more and more deviant behavior and Elizabeth finally rebels in order to hold onto the very awareness that John helped stir in her.Director Adrian Lyne did a very nice job her, though much of the look and all of the music of the film is about as dated as you can get. There's never any doubt what decade Nine ½ Weeks was made in. The scenes of foreplay and sex here are so stylish and powerful that they've been imitated in the sex scenes of countless movies made after this one. And Lyne effectively compensates for the paucity of plot by immersing the viewer into the rhythm of New York City street life and the adolescent culture of the New York City art world.Basinger and Rourke are stunningly attractive but neither becomes lost in their respective beauty. Basinger's silkily conveys Elizabeth's journey of self-discovery and Rourke is magnetically quiet and calm. What's best about their work here is that each always lets you see that their character is thinking about the games they're playing with each other and choosing to go forward with them.Stylish direction powerful performances and a good bit of media sensation weren't enough to make this film a hit. I t became a film in the 80s that a lot of people heard about but not that many saw and there's been very little in the way of high class, mainstream erotica out of Hollywood ever since. What did happen is that co-producer and co-writer Zalman King went out to make a few more erotic films, all dumber and much closer to softcore porn, then made his way into cable TV with Red Shoe Diaries. That was an anthology series that did a more prurient and less sophisticated version of this movie over and over again. It proved their was an audience of middle brow erotica, just not one that would go to the cinema.I quite liked Nine ½ Weeks. I also liked that Basinger got naked but it spared me any sight of Rourke's ass. If you're looking for a smart and graceful movie about two people getting it on, this is it.

Julianne receives a call\/voice mail out of the blue&#x85;coincidently enough, close to the birthday of said age&#x85;from Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him.While thrust into the wedding arrangements and best man's role, she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing be honest with him and let the happy couple marry.The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does &#x96; again, I'm proof.Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we acted upon it multiple times &#x96; and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love.

Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years.Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU.

The film is a crime movie directed by Quentin Tarantino in 1992, and is his premier as a movie director. The films plot centers around the formation of a group of criminals that are tasked with stealing diamonds from a vault within a diamond distribution center. Joe Cabot is the head of the group and carefully selects the members of the criminal gang consisting of the above individuals, as well as plans the heist. After planning the heist and carefully preparing the gang, Mr. Cabot activates the plan. Although, careful planning had taken place the heist quickly becomes derailed. Police officers are near the diamond distribution with a plan of their own to bring down Mr. Cabot's crime syndicate. Unbeknownst to the gang, their group contains an informant who has tipped off law enforcement to the plan. As the botched attempt takes place violence ensues with a few police officers and a couple criminals losing their lives. Following the botched robbery attempt the gang returns to an old burial casket storage facility which they had designated as the rendezvous point following the heist. As the members slowly start to arrive the plot takes a couple different turns which catches the viewer of guard. It is revealed who the informant amongst the group is, and other members of the group are killed. The films theme contains a combination of Moral Implications and A Moral or Philosophical Riddle. The implication that The Love of money is the root of all evil is not lost on the viewer. This film is not void of the motifs that have come to define future Tarantino films. There is a plethora of scenes that dramatically display the use of profanity, violence, action, and references to pop culture of the era. The dramatic structure of the film is a classic representation of nonlinear structuring which has become a staple of Mr. Tarantino's film. The sequencing of scenes out of chronological order keeps the viewer guessing and yearning for what led to the current events. This type of structuring can also be seen in another film directed by Mr. Tarantino titled Pulp Fiction. The film, Reservoir Dogs is definitely not a movie for children. The violence is hard to watch and the profanity may cause your grandma's ears to bleed, but the film is realistic to the situation. Neither the violence nor the profanity is the focus of the film. The films storyline is the primary focus, with the violence and profanity being a necessary evil.

Like his father, Honore (Maurice Chevalier), he has shunned marriage in favor of having a succession of beautiful women. His present love, Lianne (Eva Gabor) is certainly pretty. But, as Gaston relates in song, he is truly bored with his lofty position in society, with women, and with parties. The only place he feels comfortable is at the home of an old friend (and former flame of Honore's), Mamita (Hermione Gingold). Odd it is, because the dear lady is rather poor and lives in an unfashionable neighborhood with her opera singing daughter AND her vivacious granddaughter, Gigi (Leslie Caron). Although she is in her middle teen years, Gigi is still treated by Gaston and her grandmama as a little girl and, in truth, she still acts as one, being very innocent and wide-eyed. Gaston loves eating Mamita's great cooking and playing cards with Gigi, away from the social scene. Unhappily, the sugar king soon finds that his lady love has been unfaithful and he makes a very publicized break with Lianne. To boost his spirits and pay off a card game debt to Gigi, Gaston, Mamita, and Gigi all go to the seashore for a vacation. They have a great time. But, Mamita's sister, also a former courtesan, wishes to change things when the trio returns to Paris. She sees that Gigi is really a young woman and, perhaps, they have a chance to offer her up as Gaston's next courtesan? She'd be well taken care of that's for certain. The only problem is that Gigi may not want to become the kind of woman who gets passed around but, rather, might want to be married and have children. What will the next season bring? Gee willikers is Gigi a pleasure to watch, as I and my sisters have done since our sixties' childhood. A musical, it nevertheless has enough non-musical action to satisfy those who don't particularly care for the genre. However, the songs are lovely and integral to the plot. Then, the acting is great, with Caron, Jordan, Chevalier, Ginggold and all of the others being near perfect in their respective roles. Also, the Paris setting, the terrific costumes, the lovely photography, and the superb direction by Vincente Minelli all contribute to the movie's enjoyment. It was awarded an Academy Award as best picture in 1958 and deservedly so. With that fact in mind, why not seek out Gigi ASAP?

It was awarded an Academy Award as best picture in 1958 and deservedly so. With that fact in mind, why not seek out Gigi ASAP? ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"20 June 2011","score":"","review":" This movie is unfunny, but it's unfunny in a weird way. It's not like it's one failed gag after the other, it's just that most of the time they don't even seem to be going for one. A lot of scenes in this movie seem very straight-forward with no comic intent whatsoever, so the thing looks more like a fluffy crime thriller than a hilarious comedy. With that said though it's still a really terrible fluffy crime thriller. Everything is horrendously clichéd, right down to the eccentric untouchable foreign villain. None of this stuff is new, everything has been done so many times before. The only difference here is that Robert de Niro is now on board, which somehow makes things even worse, especially since he has no chemistry whatsoever with Eddie Murphy. This was kind of a chore to watch really, don't know why I bothered since you know the ending just by reading the plot summary. Oh well, at least the William Shatner cameo was good.
