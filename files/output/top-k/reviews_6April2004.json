There is a great subtext the story is about a filmmaker who travels to overseas locations, such as jungles, to film his movies - he cares nothing for the cultures he may be violating, all he cares is capturing the spectacle on film. If he is unable to capture it on film, he tells us early on in the picture, he'll destroy it without a second thought. This is a film about the emptiness and recklessness of Hollywood, yet the satire is not bitter, but tongue-in-cheek in a way that follows James Whale's advice for putting subtexts in genre films, ie, not spoiling it for those viewers who don't get the joke. So Kong can be enjoyed as a pure genre picture. The performances have false moments, but as an adventure picture it develops well, taking us gradually further towards the mystery of the legend of Kong, then follows Kong as the whole drama of his attempted capture plays out. The music also, is great, and along with mist and good cinematography helps create a mysterious atmosphere. The beginning is fairly talky, but it picks up. And the lovely Fay Wray offers reason enough to watch this on her own. If I was Kong, i know i'd beat the hell out of any dinosaur there was in order to protect her!Luckily, King Kong came in the period between 1930 and 1934 when there was no production code in Hollywood, so content was not censored. A couple years later we wouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing Fay Wray clad in a torn to shreds jungle jane costume, and especially not then falling in the water wearing said outfit! And probably not the degree of violence we have here in one particular fight Kong has with T-rex he breaks the dinosaur's head by pulling its jaws so far open!The vintage special effects are great. They're so fun for quaintness value, but in places they're actually really good. The wrestling match with the T-rex, when Kong cracks a giant snake's back, and especially when he shakes the men off the log - all these sequences in particular were very well done. When I think about it, these effects aren't as quaint next to today's as you might initially think. How would we do a convincing giant ape onscreen (how will Peter Jackson do it in 2005)? By computer? Most of our completely computerised creatures at this writing are ridiculously fake looking. Try the ridiculous creature in Hulk? Everyone commented on how fake it looked. I'll go for the much more fun stop-motion Hickenlooper Kong over Hulk anyday.And the famous climax in New York City, which ends on the Empire State Building with Kong swatting at planes, is marvellous.

It's lovely to hear Hepburn in Just You Wait, as it comes as something of a surprise if you had thought all of her singing was dubbed, as I once had. The dubbing and acting do seem to come to a perfect luminous moment at least once at the end of I Could Have Danced All Night it seems as if Audrey Hepburn is really singing it and gives the impression that possibly no one else ever had. It is possible that the best result might have been to let some of the other simpler songs, like Wouldn't It Be Loverly be done by Hepburn, and leave those obviously requiring a more technically accomplished singer to Nixon. It is interesting that Hepburn's Moon River is not included on the old soundtrack of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. Similarly, I went to her memorial service at the 5th Avenue Presbyterian Church here in New York in 1993, and, uncannily, the entire program was listed EXCEPT that... all of a sudden they played her Moon River and the whole church became very emotionally charged. I think we were grateful that this let us experience our grief directly by forcing something immediate (but not cruel) on us like that.I have always been glad anyway that Hepburn did the part and it is certainly the only real reason the film still has life--the controversy about her getting the part may have as much to do with that life as anything  it would be a mere artifact, a duplicate of the stage production had Julie Andrews been chosen. Andrews still seems primarily a stage star despite all the movies she made. Most of them are mediocre,a few of them quite good even if I haven't found them interesting myself she is perfect in THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but the phenomenal appeal of this film is based on something considerably less sharp than what made the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpieces great-- even when they weren't quite as lavishly produced. Clearly, for example, the score of SOUTH PACIFIC is light-years beyond that of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Admittedly, Andrews's singing of the score is better than Mary Martin's was. And the voice you can still hear on the Broadway and London cast recordings of MY FAIR LADY is far more complex and rare than Nixon's is. Still, she wouldn't have made the film unique while it may or may not be a great film, it has managed to retain a one-of-a-kind quality, and is kept from being a mere facsimile. It is certainly true that Ms. Nixon should have been credited for her  work, whatever our other reservations are. I nevertheless think that some of the lighter opera voices of the time--maybe Anna Moffo or Mirella Freni--would have been better (I don't think Ms. Nixon was too fine, but rather not quite as good here as she once had been.) Dubbing doesn't have to match all that perfectly; of course, certain examples--like Giorgio Tozzi for Rossano Brazzi as Emile de Becque do seem perfect. And if the case of MEETING VENUS is somewhat different, no one ever would dream of worrying about Kiri TeKanawa's voice not matching Glenn Close (Ms.Close unfortunately let us hear her real one doing Wagner on Entertainment Tonight when plugging the film--a harsh and strident moment...)This is one of quite a number of cases in which the original star was controversially replaced. The strangest may be the rejection of Ethel Merman for GYPSY, although Rosalind Russell was excellent. The smartest may have been Barbra Streisand for Carol Channing for HELLO, DOLLY! She was high-voltage enough for the gargantuan production and her trumpet-like singing was magnificent--a number of us think this is her best film--and it ages fantastically. And, while it is not a matter of replacing a role originated by someone else, Hepburn herself was loudly denounced for BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S by Truman Capote; we think of the role as her indelible mark (and surely it is in some ways), but his preference for Marilyn Monroe could have unquestionably led to something extraordinary also--and maybe that idiotic ending that is so hard to overlook would have been replaced by the much more subtle and meaningful one Capote wrote.It really is Audrey Hepburn who makes MY FAIR LADY continue to do its work.

The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie based on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, witchcraft meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship an'-it-harm-none approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's The Golden Bough, if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant her to be a blonde.

The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie based on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but it's historical BUNK.

Actually, now that I think about it there wasn't really much of a substantial a story to follow. Just inane characters wandering around with `no clue' plastered all over their faces and a few minor events toward the end to get us up to date chronologically.

Fieldman shines as Mouth.My only problem with the film is that it was not made with the intention of ageing well - its cleary an eighties film - which is no bad thing if you are a buff of the era, but may be hard to stomach if you're new to the film.A bit of a sleeper hit, and a modern classic. 7\/10  Highly recommend it.*For imdb users in Africa and India this may not apply.

Why does Shreck talk like that?

Dafoe's cartoonish, two-dimensional portrayal is much like BB Thornton's cartoonish, two-dimensional performance in Sling Blade; it takes almost no acting skill to stick out one's chin, squint, and speak without moving your jaw.  In his effort to show Shreck as an ancient, damaged wreck, he goes to far to portray him as just another old man.

I remember oddly enough I really quite enjoyed the film so I went out and bought myself a copy of it. I never wrote a review for it when I went to see it back in 2000 so I figure I will watch the film again tonight, which I just did, and now I want to write a review for the film.Almost Famous is about 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a huge music fan in 1973 in San Diego, thanks to the collection of albums his older sister, Anita (Zooey Deschanel), left him when she suddenly left home several years earlier to be a stewardess. A budding music journalist, William eventually meets Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a legendary critic who warns William about the death of rock and roll and the lengths to which bands and promoters will go to in making sure that critics and reporters are happy so that they'll write positive stories about them and their music.  Although reluctant, Lester likes William's enthusiasm and thus assigns him to do a story on Black Sabbath. William's mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand), a college professor and restrictive parent, isn't crazy about the idea, but drops him off at the concert, making him promise that he won't do drugs.  Once there, William meets several groupies, including Sapphire (Fairuza Balk), Polexia (Anna Paquin) and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), the latter of whom he's instantly smitten with. He also meets the up and coming band, Stillwater, consisting of lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), bass player Larry Fellows (Mark Kozelek), drummer Ed Vallencourt (John Fedevich) and their manager Dick Roswell (Noah Taylor). As they're opening for Sabbath, they manage to get him backstage for their performance. Although they consider him the enemy since they play for the fans and not the critics, the members of Stillwater like William's style and thus invite him along on their tour. With his mother reluctantly letting him go, and then getting a freelance assignment to write a story for Rolling Stone magazine, William travels across America with the band and witnesses the varied dynamics and dramatic conflict of the rock and roll lifestyle while on the road. Patrick Fugit is an actor who grows on you. I liked Patrick Fugit from his earlier work in movies like Stray Dog. I though he was just doomed to made for TV movies. Then all of a sudden began to grow on me again. In this movie, I liked his character William. He was a hopeless, sweet, and caring. You really felt for his character. You wanted him to find his happiness again. So I am starting to like Mr. Fugit again thanks to his role in this film and his roles in such movies as White Oleander and the upcoming movie Saved! with actress\/singer Mandy Moore and one of my favorite actresses Jena Malone. The film's other great characters include the entire band in which William has to interview and makes friends with them. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the famous critic role all so perfectly. He seemed like the above average critic that we don't read that much of today in real life. The three groupies Sapphire (Fairuza Balk), Estrella (Bijou Phillips) and Polexia (Anna Paquin) where also very enjoyable in their roles. Fairuza Balk's character was very enjoyable, she was very amusing and I think she is also very beautiful and alluring. The rest of the supporting cast included Zooey Deschanel as William's beautiful, unique and rebellious teen sister and the members of the band, all of which were very amusing to watch on the screen.Kate Hudson gives a lovely and convincing performance as Penny.She is sweet and occasionally touching in the role. I was also impressed with the way Crowe convincingly arranged the attraction between William and Penny, layering on the sweet with an uncommon grace not found in this type of cinema, and giving the audience a peek into why Penny is so touched by William's attentions. The drama\/comedy comes quickly and the story rolls forward.Cameron Crowe who I think did a great job on the script for what type of film it is. I have to admit the story is very original. A 15 year old wins an assignment for a famous magazine in which he gets to go on a national tour with a rock band. That's original anyway you look at it. The dialog at times was very clever and catchy like as I mentioned earlier I think the groupies were the best parts and some of the jokes contained in the film. There are of course some jokes that didn't work like the two small gay jokes but it's a musical\/drama\/comedy and almost all movies have their hits and misses. The thing about the film, which I liked most were how the characters were written, you really like them. You felt for them and wanted them to be happy and everything to work out for them. I have to say very good job on the script Cameron Crowe.Almost Famous isn't the typical type of film I would normally go see in the theater. I am usually not the one to see many rock band movies but something about the trailer really interested me to see this film. Was it the fact that Kate Hudson was in it and this was her first movie in a few years that didn't look like it was totally going to suck? Was it the awesome song playing in the background during the trailer? Or was it just the fact that it seemed like a very interesting film to me. Well, I think it was all of the above. So continue on to read my review for Almost Famous.I got to see Almost Famous a few years ago at a special sneak preview. I was really looking forward to the film as being the highlight of the week. I walked into the theater, which was very packed and had to sit up in the top row because there were no seats in the theater besides on the floor. So I sat there with a group of loud obnoxious college kids and watched Almost Famous.The movie stars Patrick Fugit in possibly the best role of his rather short career as William Miller, loosely based on Cameron Crowe himself. He is a huge music fan and dreams of interviewing a famous rock band. Well William gets his wish and gets an opportunity of a lifetime, to get paid a hell of a lot of money to get to interview the famous rock band Sabbath. A lot of strong performances, great performing scenes, and excitement lie ahead...The movies' acting was terrific. I used to like Kate Hudson but after this role she went to be the queen of romantic comedies. Her last decent film before this was Desert Blue in 1998. I think honestly though her role as Penny Lane in the film was outstanding. What a performance. Bravo Ms. Hudson a.k.a Mrs. Robinson I applaud your excellent work. Patrick Fugit who is starting to be seen as an actor also did a good job in the film as William Miller. I see him becoming a big star I mean he has three good movies now under her belt, Saved!, Dead Birds and White Oleander. As for the entire band in the film, well there are way to many to name but all did a great job. The performances in the film were really something great.The director and writer Cameron Crowe has made a film he can be proud of for many years to come. This guy did one hell of a job capturing the true feelings and inspiration of William and the band. And what about those awesome camera angles capturing the excitement. I almost felt I was right there when the movie was playing. I am sure with this very powerful and inspirational script will Cameron Crowe get many more jobs in the near future. The man wrote a very touching, inspirational, and exciting script. Some people never achieve to write something as good as this film is so he should be proud.Cameron Crowe also directed the film. Crowe hasn't had to many hits but is better known for writing successful movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and my friend Rosy's favorite 80s' movie Say Anything. His film credits include the great movie Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise and the mildly enjoyable Singles with Bridget Fonda. So up until this point I don't think Cameron Crowe has had much success with film in the 90s'. But I did enjoy him directing and writing Almost Famous. I loved his view of the typical rock band. It made me want to be William now. As for the characters, he really caught their emotions and made you feel for them. Cameron Crow sure did pick a great location to shoot the film; it felt like a great scenario. Good work on this film Cameron Crowe.So my final thoughts on Almost Famous are the following, it's a very enjoyable and original.  It's just a watch if you want to have a good time. I bought the DVD because I think the movie is amusing and I seen it three times now and I still enjoy it. The bonus features make the DVD more worth while. So if you haven't seen it dish out the $4 measly dollars at the local video store and rent it. I am sure you will at least get a few chuckles out of it even if this kind of film isn't your typical Hollywood schlock.So to conclude my review, I really enjoyed Almost Famous. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I wasn't sitting in front of a bunch of rude college kids who did nothing but laugh for the first twenty minutes but luckily they quieted down and I got to really enjoy this film. It showcased a very powerhouse performance by Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup and the entire cast who played the band and everything to do with it. I was very interested in the story. I think this could quite possibly be the best movie made about rock bands ever. It's sure as hell the best rock band movie I ever seen. I would probably give Almost Famous a 8.5\/10. It was a really great film and might be one of the years best. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 April 2004","score":"","review":"  I remember back in the late summer of 2000 I watched this.

Then all of a sudden began to grow on me again. In this movie, I liked his character William. He was a hopeless, sweet, and caring. You really felt for his character. You wanted him to find his happiness again. So I am starting to like Mr. Fugit again thanks to his role in this film and his roles in such movies as White Oleander and the upcoming movie Saved! with actress\/singer Mandy Moore and one of my favorite actresses Jena Malone. The film's other great characters include the entire band in which William has to interview and makes friends with them. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the famous critic role all so perfectly. He seemed like the above average critic that we don't read that much of today in real life. The three groupies Sapphire (Fairuza Balk), Estrella (Bijou Phillips) and Polexia (Anna Paquin) where also very enjoyable in their roles. Fairuza Balk's character was very enjoyable, she was very amusing and I think she is also very beautiful and alluring. The rest of the supporting cast included Zooey Deschanel as William's beautiful, unique and rebellious teen sister and the members of the band, all of which were very amusing to watch on the screen.Kate Hudson gives a lovely and convincing performance as Penny.She is sweet and occasionally touching in the role. I was also impressed with the way Crowe convincingly arranged the attraction between William and Penny, layering on the sweet with an uncommon grace not found in this type of cinema, and giving the audience a peek into why Penny is so touched by William's attentions. The drama\/comedy comes quickly and the story rolls forward.Cameron Crowe who I think did a great job on the script for what type of film it is. I have to admit the story is very original. A 15 year old wins an assignment for a famous magazine in which he gets to go on a national tour with a rock band. That's original anyway you look at it. The dialog at times was very clever and catchy like as I mentioned earlier I think the groupies were the best parts and some of the jokes contained in the film. There are of course some jokes that didn't work like the two small gay jokes but it's a musical\/drama\/comedy and almost all movies have their hits and misses. The thing about the film, which I liked most were how the characters were written, you really like them. You felt for them and wanted them to be happy and everything to work out for them. I have to say very good job on the script Cameron Crowe.Almost Famous isn't the typical type of film I would normally go see in the theater. I am usually not the one to see many rock band movies but something about the trailer really interested me to see this film. Was it the fact that Kate Hudson was in it and this was her first movie in a few years that didn't look like it was totally going to suck? Was it the awesome song playing in the background during the trailer? Or was it just the fact that it seemed like a very interesting film to me. Well, I think it was all of the above. So continue on to read my review for Almost Famous.I got to see Almost Famous a few years ago at a special sneak preview. I was really looking forward to the film as being the highlight of the week. I walked into the theater, which was very packed and had to sit up in the top row because there were no seats in the theater besides on the floor. So I sat there with a group of loud obnoxious college kids and watched Almost Famous.The movie stars Patrick Fugit in possibly the best role of his rather short career as William Miller, loosely based on Cameron Crowe himself. He is a huge music fan and dreams of interviewing a famous rock band. Well William gets his wish and gets an opportunity of a lifetime, to get paid a hell of a lot of money to get to interview the famous rock band Sabbath. A lot of strong performances, great performing scenes, and excitement lie ahead...The movies' acting was terrific. I used to like Kate Hudson but after this role she went to be the queen of romantic comedies. Her last decent film before this was Desert Blue in 1998. I think honestly though her role as Penny Lane in the film was outstanding. What a performance. Bravo Ms. Hudson a.k.a Mrs. Robinson I applaud your excellent work. Patrick Fugit who is starting to be seen as an actor also did a good job in the film as William Miller. I see him becoming a big star I mean he has three good movies now under her belt, Saved!, Dead Birds and White Oleander. As for the entire band in the film, well there are way to many to name but all did a great job. The performances in the film were really something great.The director and writer Cameron Crowe has made a film he can be proud of for many years to come. This guy did one hell of a job capturing the true feelings and inspiration of William and the band. And what about those awesome camera angles capturing the excitement. I almost felt I was right there when the movie was playing. I am sure with this very powerful and inspirational script will Cameron Crowe get many more jobs in the near future. The man wrote a very touching, inspirational, and exciting script. Some people never achieve to write something as good as this film is so he should be proud.Cameron Crowe also directed the film. Crowe hasn't had to many hits but is better known for writing successful movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and my friend Rosy's favorite 80s' movie Say Anything. His film credits include the great movie Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise and the mildly enjoyable Singles with Bridget Fonda. So up until this point I don't think Cameron Crowe has had much success with film in the 90s'. But I did enjoy him directing and writing Almost Famous. I loved his view of the typical rock band. It made me want to be William now. As for the characters, he really caught their emotions and made you feel for them. Cameron Crow sure did pick a great location to shoot the film; it felt like a great scenario. Good work on this film Cameron Crowe.So my final thoughts on Almost Famous are the following, it's a very enjoyable and original.  It's just a watch if you want to have a good time. I bought the DVD because I think the movie is amusing and I seen it three times now and I still enjoy it. The bonus features make the DVD more worth while. So if you haven't seen it dish out the $4 measly dollars at the local video store and rent it. I am sure you will at least get a few chuckles out of it even if this kind of film isn't your typical Hollywood schlock.So to conclude my review, I really enjoyed Almost Famous. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I wasn't sitting in front of a bunch of rude college kids who did nothing but laugh for the first twenty minutes but luckily they quieted down and I got to really enjoy this film. It showcased a very powerhouse performance by Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup and the entire cast who played the band and everything to do with it. I was very interested in the story. I think this could quite possibly be the best movie made about rock bands ever. It's sure as hell the best rock band movie I ever seen. I would probably give Almost Famous a 8.5\/10. It was a really great film and might be one of the years best.

The huge gaping holes in the plot where plain to see and the true spirit of the Alien franchise that had so characterised the first two instalments was lost or at least heavily diluted.Thankfully sense has prevailed and the new Special Edition puts the film as near as possible back the way it should have been.  Don't get me wrong, its still not as good as the all out Directors Edition of Aliens and it still drags a little in places but it is still a darn sight better and well worth the investment.  Once seen, you will never want to see the now dreadful original version ever again.Its just a pity that this treatment did not manage the same kind of transformation on Alien Resurrection!
