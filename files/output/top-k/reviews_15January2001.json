The story is well written, and it's entertaining throughout.  No lagging in the story, pace is really good, and there aren't a lot of parts you sit thru waiting for something more exciting.  The film would lie somewhere in the action genre, but there's comedy, and a deeper story underlying everything, in that he loves the family he once had, and probably wishes he hadn't screwed up and lost it.

I figured I should finally see it, and we watched it on PPV. Now I guess I know more about my co-worker's husband.We rated Gladiator a 7, and that is due to the terrific visual settings that convey an epic scope to the film. Without those settings, it would have been a 5. Gladiator revolves around the beliefs and actions of its main character, a man who seems to be stuck in the past and unable to see much around him for what it is. When his luck turns bad after a succession at the top, you feel sorry for the guy but also wonder why such a great leader of men didn't wake up sooner.Honor, loyalty and the good of Rome is at the heart of Gladiator. If you don't buy into those concepts, then you have a hard time caring much about Maximus or his journey. In this case, I had a hard time with several things, including- Maximus is portrayed as a successful leader who wants Rome to return to rule by the people through the Senate. Setting aside questions about whether the Senators actually represent the people well, the film makes absolutely no effort to show you anything about Rome that is worth preserving. Its citizens are described several times as a mob. It's leadership spent years on a crusade in Germania that even the emporer said solved nothing. There are no scenes showing citizens who hope for anything better, be it democracy or real leadership or a vision. So what is it, exactly, Maximus wants to save by supporting the Senate? Even Maximus lives so far outside Rome on his nice spread that people call him The Spaniard. He had never even *been* to Rome! Why should the viewer care who rules Rome?- Maximus is never set up properly as a fighter who could be an amazing gladiator. In the film's initial battle, he rides on a horse against basically a horde of undisciplined neo-Vikings on foot, and attacks from the rear, no less. He manages to survive, but we never see that he has any special skill in battle other than as a leader. From there we suddenly must believe that he can defeat five or more gladiators in a 5 vs. 1 scenario where his opponents have armor and better weapons! How did that happen? There must have been some great training going on in the gladiator school.- The film also never does enough to show Maximum's anger and motivation to meet the new emporer after Maximum's family is slaughtered (no big spoiler; by now you should know his motivation). Is he mourning? Yes. Is he mad? I guess. But he is never seething, or furious, or even apparently taking out his anger on his opponents. He simply kills mechanically, then moves on.- At one point a big deal is made of the fact that to survive in the Roman games, Maximus must win the crowd. He promptly goes out into the colisseum with his school's fighters and they win, but not with any flair. Yet suddenly the crowd loves Maximus. Should't we have seen some effort on his part to win them over? This scene was especially disappointing because it is Maximus' first face-to-face with the emporer. Yet we see no emotion, no feeling. Just resignation. It was anti-climactic and a letdown.I'm not sure why some people loved this film. Maybe they buy into the honor, loyalty, old soldier thing. I do, too, when I feel it is warranted. In this case, Maximus reminded me of most Kevin Costner characters He is there, but wooden, and not very sympathetic. Russell Crowe may have played Maximus as too deadened by grief and not motivated enough by life or revenge. Ultimately, I was mostly uninterested.

It has strong acting performances, especially from Sean Connery. And it doesn't rely on CGI effects or big explosions to keep things interesting.That being said, it was about 15 minutes too long, and bogged down from time to time. It also was probably too easy on some sticky questions, such as why Jamal's friends from the hood were, while not supportive, also not angrily fighting the change in Jamal's life and the choices he made that no longer included them (especially considering the fact that the movie made a point of Jamal's effort to do just enough to not be singled out as smart in his public school; he must have been hiding that for a reason). In fact, Jamal's family and friends (old and new) were all pretty much ideal people in their reactions. Even the one guy who had issues with Jamal, a rich kid on the basketball team, never actually caused any problem other than some pushing and shoving in practice. It would be great if everyone were as understanding as the people Jamal knew. I have a feeling that is rare.But to me the biggest, most annoying failure of the movie was the climactic scene where an essay is being read by Forrester. The essay is supposed to be so great, so touching, that Jamal is finally recognized for the talent he is. But the movie chooses to drown out the essay's words with sappy, rising music, and then lowers the music to bring in the last sentence. How in the world can a movie about writing, for pete's sake, refuse to tell the audience what was written that was THE key to the film's plot?!! I know movies are about visuals and emotions, but if you're going to have the guts to do a good movie about writing and people, at least share with us the focal point!Still, Finding Forrester was a gem.

It has strong acting performances, especially from Sean Connery. And it doesn't rely on CGI effects or big explosions to keep things interesting.That being said, it was about 15 minutes too long, and bogged down from time to time. It also was probably too easy on some sticky questions, such as why Jamal's friends from the hood were, while not supportive, also not angrily fighting the change in Jamal's life and the choices he made that no longer included them (especially considering the fact that the movie made a point of Jamal's effort to do just enough to not be singled out as smart in his public school; he must have been hiding that for a reason). In fact, Jamal's family and friends (old and new) were all pretty much ideal people in their reactions. Even the one guy who had issues with Jamal, a rich kid on the basketball team, never actually caused any problem other than some pushing and shoving in practice. It would be great if everyone were as understanding as the people Jamal knew. I have a feeling that is rare.But to me the biggest, most annoying failure of the movie was the climactic scene where an essay is being read by Forrester. The essay is supposed to be so great, so touching, that Jamal is finally recognized for the talent he is. But the movie chooses to drown out the essay's words with sappy, rising music, and then lowers the music to bring in the last sentence.

The violence and language is not for the tender. The brutality of the body and spirit is necessary for the story line. The movie would lose its gut impact without it. Gut impact is a good word for the feeling this movie renders.This film is not center staging violence nor does it take the easy road with quick glimpses of passionate sex. The star is an emotion. It has survived since the beginning of time. Sometimes it appears to be the only thing that lasts. This emotion is hatred. We watch as a family unravels before our eyes because of hatred then tries to mend itself by changing course.The movie does a real good job of showing both sides of the tracks. It covers some real tough social and economic problems that are too often and incorrectly tagged to a certain group. Derek, the skinhead, does have some real true issues and is a hurting being, like many other humans in this world. He is a section of society that feels left out and left behind and becomes angry about it.  He makes some good points and some obnoxious points. He falls into a pit that all bigots descend into by concluding that society's problems would be eliminated with certain groups being exterminated and or severely controlled. The story is not totally one sided as many times it's simply survival of the strong. It's kind of like living on the grasslands of Africa where there are predators and prey. In this case blacks and whites prey on each other as well as being a cannibalistic beast so to speak. Sometimes they are living in fear and are just trying to survive. When you deal with hatred one can't dance with the devil without getting a little stain on one's dress. In the case of Derek's family the stain runs deep. We all may be quick to judge one of these groups, but we never know what our reactions would be unless we have been in their shoes and had to survive.Edward Norton plays Derek perfectly. I have never seen an actor look like a mean and nasty neo-nazi skinhead one-minute and then a pencil pushing office room geek the next. The change was due to Derek's epiphany he had in prison and the help of a good-natured high school teacher. While in prison, Derek learned what brutality is and that skin color or a matching tattoo does not guarantee loyalty and sincerity. He found that skin color is only a difference and should not be a  guidance system to hate. He realizes the bigger picture and then discovers guilt. He learns life is too short. He must carry his guilt that only becomes a bigger burden once freedom rings.This movie is a very good movie and portrays hatred as purely evil and rightly so. In this movie it's not all whitey or blackie's fault. I applaud the movie for that. Sometimes a movie similar to this makes blacks look all bad or that all whites hate everyone different from themselves. In this movie both groups are brutalized and each ones actions, while being a horrible injustice, may be more understandable if we lived in their world. There would have been a few things I would have done differently in this movie as a director, but not much. My score of 8 is a score that I do not give out very often. I would not recommend this movie to everyone and especially young kids who are easily impressionable. I know many feel this movie reveals only  the evil side but a person, that relates to one of these groups, might concentrate or only feel the raw power in the violence and find it mesmerizing.

I really enjoyed the scenes where he was in bed with Elektra and talking to her so tenderly.  He also seemed very upset when he learned some things about her and in their last encounter.  In the last scene, by the way, Bond said, Call him off, I won't ask again but then he did ask again, twice.  I liked this movie better than TND because there were slow scenes.  In TND, even in the non-action scenes, Bond was in a moving car or a noisy airport or a noisy party.  There was still too much water and fire in this movie, though.  I don't really think people look good wet.  I also thought the action scenes at the bomb factory and the caviar factory looked alike--dark places with machinery.  I don't think that Renard was a good Bond villain.  Most of them are gleefully maniacal, but Renard was positively depressed.  I've read that Denise Richards was very bad, but frankly I found it hard to tell, since she didn't have more than two lines in any scene.  She was definitely too young looking to play a nuclear scientist, but I don't think she was terrible in the role.  I think it was strange that Dr. Christmas Jones told Bond right away not to make jokes about her name.  Why did the writers give her such an unusual name if they didn't want other characters making jokes about it?  I thought it was odd that when the title song was sung, they left out the line There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.

Fathers and sons, mothers and sons, and an odd-sort of male-bonding all take place during the course of this film. I was already a fan of Alexie's writing -- and had met him and talked with him for quite a while at a book-signing party in Berkeley, a year or two before the film (only loosely based on the book, as other people have commented). People are quick to categorize films, especially as to the ethnic group or religious group featured, what country it was filmed in, etc -- what about simply judging on the characters, how engaging they are? This film should be seen by all people, not just Native Americans. It was very funny, but also had its bitter, angry, and sad moments, as well as a little poetry -- and lots of visual beauty. My only problem, a big one, with this film is the poster used to promote it. Irene Bedard does wonderful work in the film (she's most famous, at this moment in time, for being the figure-model for Disney's Pocahontas -- and also doing the voice of Pocahontas in the film). But on the movie poster, Bedard looks like a ten-year old girl. So it's my guess that most Americans looked at the poster -- immediately registered the phrase kid's movie in their heads and weren't interested in seeing it. Since so many movie-goers are teenagers or people in their early twenties -- the poster must have done a lot to destroy what could have been a huge box-office for this film. It could have been, and deserves to be a monster hit. When you see Bedard's character in the film, it's immediately clear she's a woman; she carries herself with the grace and maturity of a woman in her mid-twenties to mid-thirties. She's clearly more mature, if not in actual age, then in her self-possession and wisdom than the two young men who've come to visit her. She'll probably look 15 or 20 years old when she's 70; here's hoping she does! But what a disaster to give the impression on the movie posters, and video box art, which makes her look like the much younger sister to the main characters. It's not a love story, so it wouldn't be appropriate to have her posed in some sort of romantic embrace with one of the figures. But maybe she could have been shown in some photograph with the father, kissing or embracing him -- some way which would convey that she's a lovely lady, worthy of great romantic interest and intellectual respect. This is a movie for teenagers and adults. Yes, kids will enjoy the film too -- and the child stand-ins for the adult characters during flashback scenes do very professional work. But a film breaking new ground like this needs all the help it can get to be well-received; most reviewers I looked at in newspapers and elsewhere loved the film and couldn't say enough nice things about it. But I saw the poster before going into the theater (and I'd also seen it in newspaper ads), I already knew what to expect from having met and read Alexie's work, so seeing Bedard's face on the poster just made me curious who the kid sister might be. Then when Bedard's character shows up 2\/3rds to 3\/4ths of the way through, I did a double-take -- a little like Tim Meadows' Ladies Man of SNL -- Whoa, it's a lady!  Not a girl at all. (She may be about 5 feet tall, if that, but all the more a lady.) Alexie's next novel or movie project should be about who falls in love with her, now that the father's gone.

Very often the conventions of narrative Hollywood cinema require adjusting the facts to fit into traditional genres and structures, often at the cost of historical fact. At worst you end up with a ragged mess like The Hurricane, a film which refused to be content with a fabulously compelling story and had to tamper with the truth to create easily delineated heroes, villians, and plot points. At best you get All The President's Men, a complex journalistic thriller that you just can't imagine them making today. But getting near that level is Thirteen Days, written by David Self and directed by Roger Donaldson. Based on the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Thirteen Days knows that its story is enough and with the exception of a few moments of saggy sentimentality, the film holds together as a wonderful version of history (though, of course, not a history lesson).Thirteen Days is probably best appreciated by people who know the whole story, but have forgotten it. It may actually be a little too complicated for the entirely unversed to pick up on everything, while scholars may be more prone to pick the facts apart. For people who lived through the Crisis, of students who have adequately studied it, the plot contains dozens of Oh Geez, I'd forgotten *that* happened moments.Thirteen Days begins with a U2 plane flying over Cuba taking pictures, only to discover that the pictures show Soviet offensive nuclear weapons. For the next two weeks, the world was on the brink of nuclear war as President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp), and for purposes of cinema presidential advisor Ken O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) try to balance politics and history to save the world. Naturally this is a reductive summary. But for the most part what's on screen is what happened, or at least something like what happened.Several critics of the film have complained that it places far too much emphasis on Kenny O'Donnell's role in the Crisis. Since the actor playing O'Donnell is Kevin Costner (easily the film's largest star) and O'Donnell's son Kevin is one of the men behind Beacon Pictures (which produced the film) a lot seems suspect. Historians have argued that O'Donnell is rarely heard on the actual tapes on which the film is based. I can only urge these people to actually watch the movie. O'Donnell is at the center of the piece, but his role is clear that of fly-on-the-wall. He sits in on the important meetings and rarely speaks. Kennedy certainly asks O'Donnell for advice, but it's always in private and it never feels as if O'Donnell has the final word on anything. His part in the affair is probably slightly amplified, but I don't see the harm.Additionally, fans of the military may feel good cause to complain about the film's portrayal of the Joint Chiefs and generals as warmongers who want to bomb Cuba back to the stone age regardless of the consequences. Nothing, I suspect, was quite that black and white. However, with the military still reeling from the Bay of Pigs, I have no doubt that much of what the film depicts is true. It isn't like they invented characters to be bad guys like, say, The Hurricane.David Self's script is mostly wonderfully structured. He was working from a good story, but the film is set up to give nearly every character their moment of triumph, almost like a play. Occasionally there are moments where things become overly cutesy (the generals marching from the oval office muttering, Those Kennedys... seems pointlessly melodramatic) and sentimental (Costner's moments with his family), but those parts are easy to forgive.In the military and political scenes Roger Donaldson's film craft is generally quite wonderful. The grainy look of the Cuba preparations and the US mobilisation are a great touch (the film is shot by Andrzej Bartkowiak the best cinematographer never to be nominated for an Oscar). Donaldson allows the tension to be undermined in the aforementioned sappy scenes, but he makes sure they don't last very long before rushing back to the war rooms offices.When thinking of performances it must first be admitted that Kevin Costner's Boston accent is horrible and that it takes twenty or thirty minutes to fully ignore it. Once you get beyond that, it's a very good performance and Costner holds the film together with his gravitas.The two men playing the Kennedys, Culp and Greenwood, give effective performances of different types. Culp looks and sounds exactly like Bobby. It's a little scary at times, to be honest. He has the voice and mannerisms perfectly. Greenwood, on the other hand, looks very little like JFK. However, much like Anthony Hopkins's performance as Nixon, Greenwood's work is so super that by the end, you forget what the real Kennedy looked and sounded like and just accept the man on the screen as the real thing. Greenwood (whose performances in Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were both Oscar worthy) will be a revelation to American audiences who only know him as a hammy bad guy in films like Disturbing Behaviour, Double Jeopardy, and Rules of Engagement. He's far better than that and this film is proof.The rest of the supporting cast is equally wonderfully. Donaldson wisely went against the Oliver Stone routine of casting familiar actors in every role no matter how small. With the possible exception of Dylan Baker, most people won't recognise anybody and thus they won't be distracted.Thirteen Days probably shouldn't be confused with actual historical fact.

I remains to this day one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and have wanted to see over and over again.  And if you are in college and have never seen it, expect strange looks from your inability to quote lines from the movie (a little cheat for you, if it comes up in discussion and you want to add something in, just say, Ni! pronounced nee).

First of all, there is too much going on, yet nothing really happens.  I actually had a hard time following the Benicio del Toro plotline--not sure if it was because of the subtitles or what, but my mind kept wandering.  Del Toro's performance is awesome, though.  (Salma Hayek's cameo is great, though--she's much better in Spanish than in English!) The plotline involving Michael Douglas's daughter was laughable.  They show her getting high with her friends a few times and then she's all of a sudden a strung out drug addict selling her body?  Sorry, I don't buy it.  That should have been explored a little more.  Also, the portrayal of the 'inner city' drug zone seemed extremely racist, as if they were really trying to drill home the differences between Michael Douglas's world and the world of drugs.  Yeah, we get the idea.    The Catherine Zeta Jones storyline was also quite unbelievable.  Her about turnaround to take over her husband's empire was ridiculous.  Some foreshadowing there would've been nice.  First she's mad at him in prison, and then she starts doing the same thing he did?  I don't buy it. Also, how many times do I need to be preached to about the world of drugs?  I know that's what the movie is about, but it was too much.  It doesn't end with a bang, either.  It just ends.
