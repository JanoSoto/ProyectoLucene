[{"date":"4 November 2014","score":"","review":" I really loved this movie, and I don't get the hate for it. If you want to look up sequels which are just expansive enough to round out the brand, but not over-the-top enough to ruin it, then Scream 3 is an great example. Probably the strongest reason I love this film is the story, and how well I think it's told. Sure, it involved some light retconning, but nothing that HONESTLY changed what the previous films stood for. That may be the case if we're dealing with an eternal killer (ala Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers), but Scream has had disposable killers behind Ghostface each time. Just as Scream 2 connects to the first one, Scream 3 connects to them all. And it does it beautifully. Are people upset that it changed the way they viewed the first film? Sure, but at the same time, it's the dynamic of a disposable killer, vs. an eternal one (read How Michael Myers mystique was destroyed in the Halloween remake).Scream 3 didn't make the mistake of going so big that you just wished it would go home. Yes, it expanded the Scream universe. Yes, it got bigger in virtually every way. But it did it SENSIBLY. Aside from a lot of action and suspense, Scream 3 did a GREAT job of telling a story. With that, it did a great job of developing the chief players. A key theme of the entire Scream story are the sins of the past, and Scream 3 gave up a great plot which lined up all of the ducks in a row. Aside from a solid script, this film really shines for its mystery and suspense aspects. I loved the cat-and-mouse game between the protagonists and antagonists more than the previous films, because the script had REALLY put me in the position of feeling that this plan was even more masterfully constructed than those. Despite Neve Campbell's decreased participation in this film (due to wanting to avoid typecasting), her scenes are still prominent and memorable. Especially the psychological torment of her life experiences so far, heightened by the killer's own torment. With that, the typical support characters get an even bigger chance to shine, and I feel that this really shifted the entire dynamic of the film to match its larger atmosphere, and rounded it all out as a whole.Maybe I just loved the confrontation between protagonists and antagonists, and loved the motive. That scene really did it for me. But I guess many fans didn't dig the whole perceived Scooby And the Gang go to Hollywood vibe that they felt. Which I don't get. Perhaps if they made it campy and humorous, like later Nightmare films. But it's the same old cat-and-mouse that we've come to know and love, just on a bigger (and better scale). Admittedly, they couldn't stretch the premise much further, which is why I also felt there never should have been a Scream 4.Scream 3 is a lesson on how to finish off a trilogy. It's a lesson on how to expand your universe, how to build a great story which will complement, but not destroy your previous works. After this film, I said to myself It all ends perfectly, please no more. Unfortunately, no one listened. Why do people hate it? I guess it's too Scooby Doo. Which is ironic, as I despise Scooby Doo, and love this film. I thought it honored its franchise far more than most horror sequels do.

It's simply an incredibly chilling, engaging, and SCARY movie. Even King himself admits that the book scared him (although that's probably partly due to the real-life circumstances which inspired him to write it).As of this writing, Pet Sematary is 25 years old, yet it doesn't feel dated by Hollywood standards of horror. Take a film like Psycho. A masterpiece of it's time, yet it simply doesn't scare people anymore. But Pet Sematary? If it doesn't freak you out, YOU might be dead. It can hold a candle to any film released today in regards to overall scariness.I've heard people complain about some of the acting, but I can't even hear those complaints-The rest of the film by far overshadows it. The screenplay was magnificently adapted from the novel, the direction, pacing and cinematography are all outstanding. This film is hard to stop watching because the build-up, execution, and climax are all well-done, and quite scary. It keeps you involved, wondering what comes next, it's not lagged or bogged down. It's not over-the-top or cartoonish, considering the themes.Provided, the source material for the film was excellent. However, we all know all-too-well what can happen when short-sighted directors and sloppy screenwriters get a hold of a good product. As Stephen King wrote the screenplay as well, that fear is eliminated. And Mary Lambert did an outstanding job of putting it all together. You would have to think that King (being greatly connected to the film adaptation) wouldn't allow her to butcher it even if she could have! The film is gory, but not ridiculous oh here we go types of gore. Rather, it's appropriate for it's form, and well-placed when and where it's needed to top off the darkest scenes of the film. This way, it actually COMPLEMENTS the film, instead of dragging it down and making you roll your eyes in disgust.Pet Sematary isn't just about the horrifying supernatural, rather, the darkness of man (a theme in many King works) is ever-present as well. What drives the film in the direction that it goes is how far a man (Louis) would go to cope with his grief, and to spare his family the same. When he oversteps a sacred boundary between life and death, it becomes visible that he's opened Pandora's Box. Yet, his grief STILL drives him back to that same solution.On either side of Louis are the living and the dead trying to influence his decisions. Both with the same message, but one (admittedly, you must be familiar with the book to have picked up on it) seemingly controlled by the evil forces attempting to control Louis in the first place. Like giving a child candy and telling them not to eat it, just so you can punish them once they do.And that leads right in to part of what makes it so horrifying That this movie is also very sad. There's no happy ending, no resolve for the good guys. It's self-destruction at it's finest, leaving no stone unturned. There's no bright spots in this film, because everything came crashing down in the worst way in both the living and the supernatural. It makes it a film which one can find scary for more than one reason.If you want to see a film that will TRULY give you chills, you must watch Pet Sematary. Truth be told, I put it above my beloved slasher flicks. Because I think that while those films have their merits in style and story, Pet Sematary succeeds far more at being a truly terrifying experience. I might sooner let a young child watch Nightmare on Elm Street than Pet Sematary, and that's saying a lot!

But watching it again later in life, I've knocked it down a few pegs. The thing is, it's almost a great horror-thriller film. It has an interesting plot which I think is cohesive, well-paced, and exciting, UP TO A POINT. And that point is The Climax.The climax of The Devil's Advocate successfully manages to halt a speeding train dead in its tracks in order to allow the deer to cross its path. Let's use deer as a metaphor for motive. Everything that this film built up to seems to be discarded as it awkwardly stumbles through a slow-moving, disengaging climax which serves to explain motive, but doesn't serve the rest of the film at all. It's the few bottle rockets after the grand finale of 4th of July fireworks. This is somewhat repaired towards the end of the climax, as the film DOES indeed finish out nicely. But only after having pushed the audience away emotionally. There's too much uninteresting and useless dialog contained (again, as an attempt to build motive), and it gets straight goofy at a point where the antagonist turns from menacing evil to let's have a party supervillain. All-in-all, it totally muddles it, and leaves you waiting for it to become interesting again.It's a shame, as I could rate this movie a couple of points higher had they simply managed to handle the climax better. Re-write it, shorten it, what have you. But it killed the thrill and suspense that it spent the previous 130 minutes or so building up to.Another flaw in this film is that you see that Keanu Reeves isn't a very good actor. He's OKAY to mediocre in this film. I would have hoped that a main character dealing with such volatile circumstance could have been portrayed by someone with better emotional range. Be it Reeves or someone else. He's not even consistent, really. One scene, he does well in showing anger and frustration. Then another comes along, and it's clear he's trying too hard NOT to be wooden.The film has some saving graces, so that's not to say that it isn't worth a viewing. Al Pacino is a class act, and could carry this film all on his own. As I mentioned previously, I still think that the rest of the movie is well-done in regards to storyline, pacing, and execution. It builds up the characters well, especially Reeves character, of which we're given a glowing indication of his priorities. It's not really unpredictable, as this is a film where the twist is heavily implied in the advertising as it is. But you don't only watch a film to keep guessing, you watch it for HOW the story is made in to cinema. The Devil's Advocate ALMOST got to where it should have been going.I give the film a 7, and perhaps that's being generous. I do have to admit that I enjoyed it, for the most part.

But only after having pushed the audience away emotionally. There's too much uninteresting and useless dialog contained (again, as an attempt to build motive), and it gets straight goofy at a point where the antagonist turns from menacing evil to let's have a party supervillain. All-in-all, it totally muddles it, and leaves you waiting for it to become interesting again.It's a shame, as I could rate this movie a couple of points higher had they simply managed to handle the climax better. Re-write it, shorten it, what have you. But it killed the thrill and suspense that it spent the previous 130 minutes or so building up to.Another flaw in this film is that you see that Keanu Reeves isn't a very good actor. He's OKAY to mediocre in this film. I would have hoped that a main character dealing with such volatile circumstance could have been portrayed by someone with better emotional range. Be it Reeves or someone else. He's not even consistent, really. One scene, he does well in showing anger and frustration. Then another comes along, and it's clear he's trying too hard NOT to be wooden.The film has some saving graces, so that's not to say that it isn't worth a viewing. Al Pacino is a class act, and could carry this film all on his own. As I mentioned previously, I still think that the rest of the movie is well-done in regards to storyline, pacing, and execution. It builds up the characters well, especially Reeves character, of which we're given a glowing indication of his priorities. It's not really unpredictable, as this is a film where the twist is heavily implied in the advertising as it is. But you don't only watch a film to keep guessing, you watch it for HOW the story is made in to cinema. The Devil's Advocate ALMOST got to where it should have been going.I give the film a 7, and perhaps that's being generous. I do have to admit that I enjoyed it, for the most part.

Now if you haven't seen This movie I'll tell you right now...Its confusing. Like really confusing. I usually pride myself in seeing what a film is trying to say and catching all the little things that happen. But I was pretty much completely lost. It follows Donnie Darko a young kid that is I guess, stalked by a 6 foot tall bunny. That is about as far as can say since I'm avoiding any kind of spoilers. So uh lets just go into the GOOD STUFF!Good stuff Like I said Donnie Darko features Jake Gyllenhall In one of his first roles. And He was fantastic. And it's not just him either. The entire cast is perfect and are all excellent. One thing that this film offers that not many movies do these days rewatchabilty or something. Now You can re watch any movie you want. But donnie darko is one film that the more times you watch it the more you understand. It's a lot like Inception in that regard. But unlike Inception Donnie Darko is kinda slowly paced. The movie does move quick and you really can't look away for a second or you'll miss something. But it feels slow while you are watching. There are Lots of things that feel like they don't matter at the time but when you hit the end and realize you blinked at a certain part you'll be hitting yourself for it.The Bad Stuff Donnie Darko is very confusing. And hard to follow on your first watch. Which is quite a turn off for lots of people. For me not so much but I recommend this movie to a few people and more or less they came back saying they didn't like it because they simply didn't get it. Verdict Donnie Darko is Jake Gyllenhalls first major film role and hes never really looked back. He delivers one of many astounding performances as does the rest of the cast.

The film begins with Mildred taken in for questioning after her husband is murdered in their beachfront home. The events of the film play out as a long sequence of flashbacks that Mildred tells in her version of what happened to police.Mildred Pierce is a fine film. If I could describe it with one word, I think the best I could come up with would be sturdy. It's well acted, with Joan Crawford giving an excellent performance as a leading lady in a genre filled mainly with leading men, and the technical aspects of the film are good (although certainly not striking or memorable at any point) but none of this can really make up for the film's overall inability to be thrilling, or even compelling for that matter.After seeing Mildred Pierce for the first time I don't think it even affected me enough for me to feel the need to form an opinion on it. I had seen it, and it was a movie, and if I didn't need to I think that would have been the last I ever thought of the film. I asked my friend Claire what she thought of it and her response was as fitting as one I could ever imagine; It 'meandered'- and that is exactly what it did. This was a film about a murder, and the main conflict in the film was the murder, so why did it need to put so much effort and detail into so much of Mildred's life that really had no impact or weight on this conflict? It worked to build Mildred into a very three dimensional, developed character, but it just went overboard. About halfway into the film they had done so much of this it was already experiencing a lot of diminishing returns, and viewing it turned into a chore.All of this may seem very critical, and I may not have enjoyed the film, but I do stand by my earlier description- It was sturdy. The film functioned well enough for me to acknowledge that it was a well-made film with merits to admire. It may not have been the most exciting film, or exciting at all, but it was a film that focused primarily on one character, and that character was done very well. For that, Mildred Pierce is a solid film, and it makes sense that this would be the area where the film excelled, I mean the film is named for her after all.

James Stewart stars as John Ferguson, a San Francisco detective forced to retire after witnessing the tragic death of his partner. The incident causes him to develop a debilitating fear of heights and the toll it takes on his mental health becomes the focus of the beginning of the film. He is forced to bring an end to his brief retirement when a friend from college contacts him to solve the mystery of his wife's peculiar behavior, and Ferguson's fragile mental state is exacerbated by the unbelievable nature of the situation. One of, if not the best aspect of this film is James Stewart's outstanding performance. I was hugely impressed by his unique and exceptional presence. Everything about Stewart is leading man material. His voice and appearance and the way he presents his character are all so amusingly Scottish and he makes John Ferguson such a compelling character. The entire film relies on his ability to feel genuine. he needs to be convincing and real for Hitchcock's story to succeed, and he does not disappoint. He becomes progressively less stable as the story unfolds, and he gives this an undeniably authentic feel. I was deeply affected by what he had become by the end of the film, I actually worried for Ferguson as a character, and that made him unforgettable.The most important part of making a great mystery is a story that can remain intriguing throughout. It needs to be puzzling enough for the film's success to ride entirely on the conclusion, and it needs to deliver in a way that leaves the viewer effected by the mystery itself. With a good mystery, you're left pondering the implications of everything that had transpired. One of the things I really loved about the film was how uncompromising it was in it's originality. Vertigo felt like Vertigo, it felt like its own entity free from comparison. There aren't many other stories so captivating. Vertigo refused to underwhelm.Vertigo is surrounded by a daunting amount of hype, to the point where you can't really expect it to live up to everything it's made out to be. Instead of simply surpassing my expectations, which it did, it also proved itself to have a real, admirable complexity to it.

Terms of Endearment is one of the greatest films of all time. It gives us easily one of the best acted movies we have ever had. Shirley MacLaiine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, and John Lithgow give us classic performances in one of the more emotional movies I have seen.It's about a mother and daughter relationship that has had many ups and downs but when push comes to shove they realize how much they mean to each other. What I appreciated most was the realism this film displayed. They take situations and problems that families deal with on a day to day basis and brought them to film without throwing in any movie clichés. It's told over a several year span and not once during the movie do you stop and think oh well it's just a movie. It truly speaks to life and how things actually are. However hard it is to appreciate the people and things you have now, you have to, because you don't know how long you have with them.MacLaine is the major standout and has a number of memorable scenes, particularly with Winger. They make their relationship an unforgettable experience to see on screen. I think Jeff Daniels was a bit miscast and played the same one note character he did in The Purple Rose of Cairo. I have yet to really see the world class actor in Daniels what everyone else sees. There are also a few times where I had hoped to see more about the family at a certain time in their lives.

It had the feel of the movie Casablanca soft, dark, bright and smooth. I loved how when a character would walk in one direction and the camera would follow. And also in one scene there was a angle the camera person was and it stood in front of the characters but it backed up as the character walked away. We see some of the characters focused on but the surroundings are blurred out. The lightening is soft on the Mildred's face and as well as the other female actresses. The transitions from scene to scene are nice, it all flows. There also was this one scene when there was a spot light on the house\/ at the beach.

Never judge a book by its cover because I had this movie pegged as a slasher flick and was totally wrong.While it does have elements of a slasher movie, Candyman works on an entirely different spectrum, the psyche. If you had to find a somewhat similar villain to the Candyman, you would be safe comparing him to Freddy Krueger; Both operate on a thin line between the physical and the ethereal realms. The Candyman isn't merely there to say boo and scare you, he haunts you, he ruins your life, and he causes you to go insane! Helen, the woman we follow throughout the film pulls a classic horror movie faux pas and continues to stick her beak into some seriously spooky stuff. She ventures into the hood, breaks into the Candyman's slaughter house, and worst of all...says Candyman five times...Instead of killing her on the spot, the Candyman takes a particular liking to her (he imagines her as a past girlfriend), in an odd case of love he starts to kill everyone she cares about and because he is a phantom, an urban legend, Helen is blamed for the murders. Long story short, it doesn't take Helen that long to go insane and be institutionalized... I won't spoil the ending, but it's pretty spooky. Tony Todd is INCREDIBLY creepy as Candyman. His deep voice and menacing grin will haunt you the night you watch the movie, if not longer. He doesn't appear too often, but when he does, he leaves a lasting impression. The setting in this film is superb. The urban setting provides a stark contrast from the ivy league college where the movie starts. Almost more haunting than the Candyman are the graffiti laden and abandoned projects he inhabits. Excellent cinematography help bring out the best of the setting. Definitely an artistic achievement!The reason I couldn't rate this movie higher is because it suffers from 90's cheesiness. Some scenes that seemed gruesome or disturbing at the time just look over-done, laughably bad, or just seem irrelevant with all the different stuff that's been done over the years. This movie would be a GREAT candidate in my opinion for a remake, and I would pay full admission price to see it. Loved the original, but I think it would GREATLY benefit from a makeover, so to speak... So I dare you...after you watch the movie, look in the mirror and say, Candyman 5 times!

Gone are those days; indeed fifteen years after that in 1997 audiences got just a quick scene of opera being blared in the jungle - this comes after Ice Cube's hippity hop has played, which actually isn't that bad - while Jon Voight hijacks a small boat of documentary filmmakers (through stealth) to hunt after giant snakes.

I probably recognized then it was trash, but it was highly watchable trash, with convincing performances (for what they're asked to do) and some high-grade cheesy lines and mannerisms. Seeing it again today, it holds up as a B-movie blow-out, and is dated mostly by its bad CGI of snakes and has one too many climaxes for comfort. It's one thing when Fatal Attraction does it, but this...It's highly mockable (i.e. Rifftrax took it on live this year), but perhaps the filmmakers knew it? The actors don't seem to, certainly not hapless Owen Wilson - or maybe Voight does, and in his way it's one of the few times, albeit in a total cartoonish performance where he has practically the same grimacing facial expression with Paraguaian accent from start to finish - and maybe that helps elevate it. It's still watchable... which is about the best to say about it, with some competent direction helping along the way - along with some befuddling choices like a Snake-POV camera.Maybe it's best today as a party movie turn it on, have some brews, and laugh at how that snake just seems to keep coming back and back again (and if it's more than one giant snake, why is it such a big deal?)

I was lucky enough to see it on a big screen last week and was mesmerised by it. Hollywood is the famous American film city but this film is German and that has to be borne in mind at all times. The reason for my title is simple. The film is the greatest silent film I have ever seen and is silent films at their zenith. However, as it was released on 10 January 1927, silent films were coming to their end and when The Jazz Singer was released on 6 October of that year they were soon rendered obsolete.This film however will never be obsolete because it deals with universal human themes. I don't see it as supporting either Nazism or Communism. Hitler admired it but Fritz Lang made it at the height of the Weimar Republic and some of that republic's famous partying can be seen in the film. I don't think it was Communist either, but rather a plea for simple common human decency in the face of inhumanity.What struck me the most was the Biblical allusions. There was a Tower of Babel, a Great Flood and a not quite human woman being referred to as The Whore of Babylon. That was relevant to me as my own church is studying the book of Revelation right now!! Since the Bible is so little studied in our own time, I wonder how much of those themes would actually be recognised by younger viewers. They might be more likely to see the film's link with Star Wars and other famous science fiction films much more quickly. I would call Metropolis more a work of prophecy than of science fiction. It still has a relevance in its call for people to be treated as more than just labouring machines. It may be 87 years old but its message is as true today as it was on the day of its premiere.

In this children's story by Frances Hodgson Burnett, author of The Secret Garden, little Shirley is in a private school when she is told that her father has been killed in the war and leaving his estate penniless. Due to the conditions, Shirley is unable to continue her studies as she had been, but she is kept on by the hard schoolmistress, only for appearance's sake, but Shirley is forced to keep quarters in a stuffy attic and having to work for what schooling she is getting. Anita Louise plays a kind teacher and Richard Greene is her young suitor and horse riding teacher to the girls. But the film belongs to Ms. Shirley and Mary Nash as the cold headmistress. I had started to watch Shirley Temple movies at the beginning of the year and thought I would review most of them. But oddly enough I reviewed a couple and then stopped, maybe because most of them seemed very similar and I must not have been particularly inspired with anything to say, but I had to comment on this film. In most of the early films, young Shirley with her curly locks tugs at your heart and manages to mend fences between bickering family members and winning the heart of crotchety old men in the process. But here, she is using more of her emotions and inner will in her scenes and therefore investing more of herself; in short, she's really acting here and really getting into the moment. The highlight of the film, at least to me, is when she talks back to Mary Nash in one particular scene up in the attic. Everyone keeps insisting that her father is dead, but she still feels in her heart that he isn't and no one can tell her otherwise. She is insistent on visiting the hospital for the incoming injured. Child actors Sybil Jason and Marcia Mae Jones costar and are really good (I really liked Sybil Jason a lot,) but the film showcases Shirley Temple at her best. By the end, you feel so uplifted and so happy for her when lo and behold..... And, Mary Nash is exceedingly chilling as the detestable headmistress. But, if you want to see only but the very best of her films, then see Shirley Temple as The Little Princess, which is a heartwarming tale with America's Favorite Little Girl.

It's a film that sets out to be enjoyable and fun, and it does this so well it achieves a level of quality normally reserved for serious, austere films. It has a very jubilant nature that focuses on being entertaining, and I really admire its devotion to making its audience happy.Singin' in the Rain is a lighthearted musical comedy about a studio and it's actors dealing with a difficult transition to sound. The co-director Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a multi-talented actor struggling with growing doubts over his acting ability. After his first attempt at a drama with sound is an embarrassing failure, he and the character that is essentially his sidekick despite being more likable and talented than him, Cosmo Brown, along with love interest Kathy Seldon are able to salvage the film and inexplicably fly a convertible into the sky in the middle of a carnival. I had a hard time connecting with a musical. Not to say I didn't like it, it's just not my genre of choice.Here's the thing, I feel like I just don't know enough about musicals to articulate my feelings about the film. I know it was good, and I know the actors were some seriously talented dancers, but I know nothing about dance. All I'm really sure of is that the movie was fun. I had a good time watching it. It was genuinely funny and Donald O'Conner was outstandingly charismatic and impressive in being able to stand out as the most skilled dancer and funniest character. Hopefully I can write something better for West Side Story.

Such a real experience. This is totally how people would react in the real world. Even though there are cares deep within us, we must have some outlet, release, fun from time to time.Ending = Unexpected. Yet, very very very powerful!!! The main role (Ricci) , he made this movie what it is. This movie really is very good. Why not rate it higher.. well, I don't know, probably just not spectacular enough for my picky taste.Still! It deserves to be a classic. And I also like to see Italian culture , people in that time. It does show how Italians act in a way.

When people say this movie is terrible, I agree but they never acknowledge the redeeming qualities, which are what make this movie bad. Doesn't make much sense? Arnold delivers cheesy puns and one-liners galore, they do suck but are hilarious at the same time. George Clooney does such a bad job, you can't help laughing. Everybody is so over-the-top and cheesy, you have to laugh. That may be why Chris O'Donnell's and Silverstone's careers were pretty much ruined after this gets recognized for Scent of a Woman; breaks out in Batman Forever; then gets screwed in this. Silverstone does some music videos, breaks out in Clueless, then gets screwed by this. All other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted. The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting. I did say the acting is funny, but after a while it gets to be too much. It starts off fun, but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters. It just keeps going until you have enough. I know that two hours isn't very long for a movie, but in this case, it was. Just take twenty minutes away and it would have been better.
