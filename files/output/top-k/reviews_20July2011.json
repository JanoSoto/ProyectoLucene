Even though it is the first of the three Sergio-Eastwood movies, it certainly is not on the same level as the other two.Let me start by saying that the main actor, Eastwood, was perfect. As always, The Man With No Name(ironically actually has a name, Joe) is one mysterious visitor, and tends to stir up his surroundings. I enjoyed the birth of the character, by watching him actually undergo a change, that would not only change his view towards others, but also change the view towards him. Also, the actors playing the bar-guy and the coffin guy both deserve some kudos. The coffin guy, Piripero, actually made you believe he was a bit strange in the head(maybe something to do with his age) but still very loyal, while Salvanito was generally likable. This could not be said about the other players in town, as Ramon was too much of a rough man, while Baxter was a man who thought too much of himself. That being said, I like to point out that both leaders of the two opposing factions were played extremely well. However, their minions and their prisoners(I only mean the Rojos prisoner) were acted out very poorly, and were very obviously evil.While the acting was solid most of the time, the audio itself was amazing. Not only was the soundtrack extremely epic, but also the voice-acting. Clint spoke with a soft, but fearing voice, while Salvanito had a humorous thing to his speech. I loved the timing of the songs, which were played during those 'HELL YES' moments, and could also increase the tension by a lot.The story itself was kinda strange at the beginning, but became more clear during the middle to end part. While the motives of many characters were kinda questionable, I enjoyed the friendship that was formed between Joe and Salvanito. I loved the kinda sweet moments between Piripero and Joe. But mostly of all, I was actually touched during the moment where two family members were reunited for only a second, but was taken away. These small things made the movie nice to watch, but couldn't fix the main problem this movie was suffering from; the main plot just wasn't interesting enough. Sure, watching Eastwood play two factions against each other was enjoyable, but after a while, it sorta started to drag on. Only near the end, it happens that the movie becomes somewhat epic, and opens the door for the next two installments.So here are the pros-Great acting by the good guys.-Audio was great. -The interaction between the good guys was nice to watch. -Some very heart-wrecking moments.-Atmosphere was very believing.Cons -Not so great acting by the bad guys.-Story could drag on.-Death scenes were extremely fake.With all this in consideration, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

The special effects are dated, but they can still tell a gripping story.Director Robert Wise does an excellent work. The action flows easily, the camera is everywhere and the tiny spaces are used to maximum effect. He is also the one who insisted his actors be trained by real submariners and it shows. Every man has a place and every man has a job to do. The intricate chain of command aboard a submarine makes perfect sense and I never felt like there was something out of place, redundant or awkward. On the other hand, it is true that the limits of what we can believe are stretched here and there, but that does not take anything away from the story.The script is very good at providing tension, action and drama. The main plot is very powerful, the tension builds steadily and it is highly engaging. Many of the scenes in this movie were copied in later submarine movies, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term. Maybe they are part of the tradition.

You might want to prove that this is the film that established Humphrey Bogart's stardom as the new anti-heroic figure of American Cinema, or as everyone knows, paved the way for the noir genre, at a crucial time when people matured enough by World War II could assimilate the cynical and dark undertones that governed the hearts of the characters, in a shadowy black-and-white cinematography. You might as well praise the merits of John Huston's directorial debut and his powerful writing transcended by Bogie's unique nasal delivery. Anyway, say what you want about The Maltese Falcon, its reputation is untouchable, but it's one of these films that need an extremely strong attention and mind-dedication, or in the best case, a second viewing, to appreciate its greatness.It's almost impossible to summarize the plot while discussing or reviewing the film, everything goes so fast, the plot is amazingly intricate, you'd probably be called a genius if you got everything at the end on one viewing, but the movie is not about the plot, it's a movie of style and characters. Take the villains' team, The Maltese Falcon is supported by a trio of supporting characters as eccentric as unscrupulous Peter Lorre, the sinister looking but delicate and suave Joel Cairo, Elisha Cook Jr., the constantly bullied character actor as Wilmer Cook, and towering them, there's Sidney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the refined mastermind in a deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. Look at them three, you might never have seen The Maltese Falcon, but you did see these archetypal characters in a cartoon, or a film, the overweight, hypocritically friendly crime boss, the refined effeminate psycho and the young thug, and it's a delight to watch them as everyone has at least one shining moment.The mission of these villains is to get a precious statuette, by any means and at any price, the 'Maltese Falcon', a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels offered by the Maltese Templar Knights to the King of Spain, before being stolen by pirates, and whoever owned the Falcon rarely died of natural causes. Many recurrent 'Hustonian' themes are foreshadowed in this masterful debut  the alienating power of greed to make one sell his soul, a cynical and detached view of life made of murder and deception, the eternal theme of failure highlighted by the realization that the bird is fake, letting all the protagonists in an equal position of losers. But a loser, Sam Spade certainly isn't, as the movie ultimately consecrates the triumph of noble and virile principles over manipulative feelings.This is probably the highlight of the film, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Mary Astor as the deceitful femme-fatale who asked for Spade's protection, revealed herself to be a calculating monster under that gracious mask of femininity, and eventually the murderess of Sam Spade's partner, Archie Miles. Sam didn't like Miles, he hardly blinked an eye when he learned about his death; he apparently had an affair with his wife, which quite doesn't paint a sympathetic portrait of the character, and makes him suspect number one in the police's book; but when Spade realized that Brigid, who played so well the part of the poor victim, inspiring his famous You're good. You're very good comment, killed his partner, he knew he could never have lived with himself if he covered her. The unforgettable line I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck is the perfect illustration of Spade's cynical predisposition to accept the fate of a person he genuinely loves, to accept the possibility of never seeing her again, as a man of principles. People were tougher in these times, and needed a model, someone they could identify with on the big screen, the final minute is simply the revelation of a character, of an actor, of a new star.Humphrey Bogart is one of these actors who achieved stardom the hard way, the long way but when he did, he never left it, and after The Maltese Falcon, he never was a second-billed actor. Only for that, Huston's film deserves all the praise. Indeed the 'Falcon' helped to widen the range of characters Bogie could play, he who got his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the ruthless villain in The Petrified Forest gave such an electrifying performance, he had a short career, being the bad guy that makes the other bad guy look good (James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson) until Huston wrote him another leading bad-guy role for High Sierra. But before becoming Bogart the apathetic and romantic lead that would pair up with the torrid Lauren Bacall, he needed a transition role, Sam Spade, the winning card of a brilliant career, where Bogart became the quintessential tough guy, at a time where male stars had to look like Clark Gable or Tyrone Power. Bogart looked like an ordinary man with an everyday look, but a man with an attitude, a heart, and a character. It's interesting how the statuette and scene stealer Gutman, always mentions what a character Sam Spade is. Spade inspired the respect of his own enemies and that was Bogie, the kind of man, you could love or hate, but never disrespect, before another defining role in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.I think this characteristic mirrors what I think of The Maltese Falcon' you might not like it, finding it too talkative, too slow, too boring, but never deny its greatness and significance in cinema's history. There would be a before and after 'Falcon', at least for Bogart, but we're talking about the greatest American star.

Take this warning for what it's worth.On a pure entertainment level, Moulin Rouge provides some shiny sparkly fun diversion. It's the story of a singer\/dancer\/courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman), who is the star attraction at the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris during the belle epoque, which was about the late 1880's through to the start of the first World War.This is the Paris of Comte Henri de Tolouse-Lautrec, who is played in the movie by Jim Broadbent, and it is a decadent period where cynicism and grasping materialism collide head-on with the dreams, now possible, of upward mobility through the burgeoning entertainment\/arts industry. A singer, a dancer, a writer, an artist (or artiste), an impresario could become a major player in society. All that was required was talent and the will to make the grab for the brass ring when the merry-go-round spun you into its path.The bare bones of the plot involves the romance of Satine with a penniless writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), while Satine tries to seduce a rich rich rich nobleman, known only as the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) so he'll finance a show for her at the Moulin Rouge cabaret. The Duke wants to possess Satine; Christian wants to love her; and Satine, who has tuberculosis and is doomed, waivers between going for the love (Christian) and going for the undying fame and fortune (the Duke and the starring role in the show he'll finance for her).Where the movie goes wrong for me is in setting all of the plot and action to a contemporary soundtrack, featuring songs like Lady Marmalade sung by Christina Aguilera, Diamond Dogs by Beck, Nature Boy by David Bowie, and Kidman and McGregor covering songs like Sparkling Diamonds and Our Song.It's not that McGregor and Kidman do a bad job of singing, or that the songs chosen are themselves inappropriate or badly done. And it's not that the action and dancing that accompanies the songs is wrong or badly done. It's just that the use of the contemporary songs that are well-known and hits in their own right gives a sense of being a bunch of music videos cobbled together to make a movie. For me it just didn't feel right it didn't feel original. It felt commercial, and it made me feel betrayed, as if by ponying up my dollars for admission I was just buying a slick packaged product, not viewing an original work of art.And that's where I have the problem with this movie. But setting aside my personal feelings, I'm not going to tell you that this movie is a waste of time, far from it. While the plot of the doomed courtesan having to choose between true love and commercial success is an old story, it's very well told in this movie, in an entertaining way, with some very talented people doing a good job. As pure entertainment it can work very well.I hate to use the term chick flick, but I do believe that this is a movie that will appeal to women far more than to men, although guys should take note that this would be a really great date movie. But the costumes, the dancing and the plot will not appeal to those who are looking for an action movie towards the testosterone end of the spectrum.I'm not going to tell people looking for a fun movie to watch to avoid Moulin Rouge, because it is a fun movie to watch. But for people who wonder why I rated this movie relatively low, I'll just say this watch a really original musical movie like Oliver!, or one of the older classics like West Side Story or South Pacific, and see if that makes you wonder what Moulin Rouge might have been if someone with talent and vision had tried to make a really original musical, instead of grabbing a bunch of contemporary hit songs and building a musical around them.

This lady and this boy, so different in personalities and ages, have a troubled relationship at first and during much of the movie. They have a really hard time to get along. But later they do and well. And yet, just when things are getting fine for them, circumstances force them to separate from each other, although they find ways to remember each other.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"20 July 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When this movie came out, we were just 5 years past Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq, and the 9\/11\/01 attack on the World Trade Center was 5 years in the future. I think that's important to remember when watching this movie, because it does refer to events in Iraq and things are very different now than they were then.Anyway the plot of the movie is very simple. The pilot of a medic-evac helicopter that flew into a combat area to rescue the crew of another helicopter, one that had been downed by enemy fire, is killed during the rescue effort after also being downed by enemy fire.Because the pilot's actions saved the crews of both helicopters from attack by Iraqis until a rescue mission could be mounted, the pilot is being considered for posthumous award of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award given by the military services for valorous action under combat conditions.The twist in this movie the pilot being considered for the award is a woman, Captain Karen Walden (played by Meg Ryan), which would make her the first female combat veteran so honored.Denzel Washington plays the role of Lt. Colonel Nat Serling, himself a Desert Storm veteran, who has been tasked by his commanding officer, General Hershberg (Michael Moriarity) with investigation of the circumstances surrounding Captain Walden's death to determine whether her actions qualify her for the honor of receiving the Medal of Honor.Much is made of the fact that it would be a wonderful public-relations thing if Captain Walden receives the award. The pressure is on Serling to complete his investigation quickly and to affirm the circumstances of Walden's heroism so the President can make the award to Walden's family (she has a little daughter, who is raised by her parents, the father of her child evidently being some sort of deadbeat who bailed on his wife and child very early).Serling is fighting his own demons relating to something that happened under his command in Iraq, something we are shown bit by bit in a series of flashbacks. As played by Washington, we get the impression of a man who is barely hanging on as he represses anger and self-loathing. He's withdrawing emotionally from his wife and kids and self-medicating with alcohol to the point where General Hershberg is ready to come down hard on him if Serling doesn't get this investigation done quickly and without causing problems.And therein lies the kick Serling very quickly discovers that there are inconsistencies in the statements of the men who were in the helicopter with Captain Walden when it went down. It also becomes very quickly evident that there is something about what happened after the helicopter went down that the men do not want to talk about.And that sets up the rest of the action in this movie. Serling has to dig out the problem while coming to terms with his own issues and trying to do justice to the memories of those killed in Iraq-- and that doesn't just mean the lady helicopter pilot.Washington is superb in this role, and this movie is much more about him than it is about Meg Ryan's character. In fact, I think people who watch this movie thinking that it's going to be about Meg Ryan's character are probably going to be disappointed. While she's good when she's on screen, her performance isn't a standout. Washington's is.Two other performances really need to be mentioned Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays Staff Sergeant John Monfriez, and Matt Damon, who plays Medical Specialist Ilario. Both were on Captain Walden's helicopter when it went down. Monfriez went as the door gunner, and it quickly becomes clear that he did not like Captain Walden and that he wants to discourage Serling from asking questions about what happened after the helicopter went down. Ilario likewise doesn't want to talk to Serling; but where Monfriez becomes menacing when Serling confronts him, Ilario goes AWOL.Damon and Phillips are absolutely key in making this plot work, and they both deliver the goods powerfully and believably.In the end, the problems of the investigation and Serling's personal demons are both put to an end, and not necessarily in the way that the powers-that-be would like to have seen things turn out. Let's just say that the search for truth is successful.This is a must-see movie for Denzel Washington fans and works as a psychological whodunnit. It's also rewarding for people who admire the work of Matt Damon and Lou Diamond Phillips. The ending is upbeat enough to make most people happy. This is a very watchable movie as a character study, too. It isn't light entertainment, but if you want an interesting and thoughtful movie in the war is hell genre with a stellar performance from Washington and superb supporting performances from Damon and Phillips, this is it.

The pilot of a medic-evac helicopter that flew into a combat area to rescue the crew of another helicopter, one that had been downed by enemy fire, is killed during the rescue effort after also being downed by enemy fire.Because the pilot's actions saved the crews of both helicopters from attack by Iraqis until a rescue mission could be mounted, the pilot is being considered for posthumous award of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award given by the military services for valorous action under combat conditions.The twist in this movie the pilot being considered for the award is a woman, Captain Karen Walden (played by Meg Ryan), which would make her the first female combat veteran so honored.Denzel Washington plays the role of Lt. Colonel Nat Serling, himself a Desert Storm veteran, who has been tasked by his commanding officer, General Hershberg (Michael Moriarity) with investigation of the circumstances surrounding Captain Walden's death to determine whether her actions qualify her for the honor of receiving the Medal of Honor.Much is made of the fact that it would be a wonderful public-relations thing if Captain Walden receives the award. The pressure is on Serling to complete his investigation quickly and to affirm the circumstances of Walden's heroism so the President can make the award to Walden's family (she has a little daughter, who is raised by her parents, the father of her child evidently being some sort of deadbeat who bailed on his wife and child very early).Serling is fighting his own demons relating to something that happened under his command in Iraq, something we are shown bit by bit in a series of flashbacks. As played by Washington, we get the impression of a man who is barely hanging on as he represses anger and self-loathing. He's withdrawing emotionally from his wife and kids and self-medicating with alcohol to the point where General Hershberg is ready to come down hard on him if Serling doesn't get this investigation done quickly and without causing problems.And therein lies the kick Serling very quickly discovers that there are inconsistencies in the statements of the men who were in the helicopter with Captain Walden when it went down. It also becomes very quickly evident that there is something about what happened after the helicopter went down that the men do not want to talk about.And that sets up the rest of the action in this movie. Serling has to dig out the problem while coming to terms with his own issues and trying to do justice to the memories of those killed in Iraq-- and that doesn't just mean the lady helicopter pilot.Washington is superb in this role, and this movie is much more about him than it is about Meg Ryan's character. In fact, I think people who watch this movie thinking that it's going to be about Meg Ryan's character are probably going to be disappointed. While she's good when she's on screen, her performance isn't a standout. Washington's is.Two other performances really need to be mentioned Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays Staff Sergeant John Monfriez, and Matt Damon, who plays Medical Specialist Ilario. Both were on Captain Walden's helicopter when it went down. Monfriez went as the door gunner, and it quickly becomes clear that he did not like Captain Walden and that he wants to discourage Serling from asking questions about what happened after the helicopter went down. Ilario likewise doesn't want to talk to Serling; but where Monfriez becomes menacing when Serling confronts him, Ilario goes AWOL.Damon and Phillips are absolutely key in making this plot work, and they both deliver the goods powerfully and believably.In the end, the problems of the investigation and Serling's personal demons are both put to an end, and not necessarily in the way that the powers-that-be would like to have seen things turn out. Let's just say that the search for truth is successful.This is a must-see movie for Denzel Washington fans and works as a psychological whodunnit. It's also rewarding for people who admire the work of Matt Damon and Lou Diamond Phillips. The ending is upbeat enough to make most people happy. This is a very watchable movie as a character study, too. It isn't light entertainment, but if you want an interesting and thoughtful movie in the war is hell genre with a stellar performance from Washington and superb supporting performances from Damon and Phillips, this is it.

A couple of the tapes had songs from the feature film Song of the South, these songs were catchy and so charming. I re-watched my tapes recently just to feel some good ol' nostalgia, but came to my surprise that I am a self proclaimed Disney addict, yet I never saw Song of the South. I found out the reason being is due to the fact that this film never had a proper release in the US, VHS copies were hard to get and there is no DVD copy in the US. Supposedly it's due to the supposed racism, but I was wondering if Tom and Jerry had a warning in the beginning just stating that this was the time and that's the way people spoke, why not do the same with this movie? But anyways, I digress, my boyfriend's uncle who is a bigger Disney addict than I am burned copies from his VHS tape and gave me the DVD and I finally after all these years got to experience the wonderful film that is Song of the South.Seven-year-old Johnny is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, John and Sally. When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart for a while and he is to live in the country with his mother and grandmother while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship in the city's newspaper. Johnny, distraught because his father has never left him or his mother before, leaves that night under cover of darkness and sets off for Atlanta with only a bundle. As Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he is attracted by the voice of Uncle Remus, telling tales in his old-timey way of a character named Br'er Rabbit and his wacky pals.Is the film racist? In my opinion, no. There are some edgy moments here and there, some could argue that the ideal relationship between master and slave was a little much which I can understand, but it's a child's film, cut it some slack. The songs are lovely and so is the animation. At the time where films had very good morals for the families, it's a distant memory now where the story lines were innocent and not every family film was silly slap stick with some gross jokes. Uncle Remis is so wonderful and seems like the brightest light in the room, he was so full of life and was lost too soon after this film's release. His stories could easily get anyone hooked into Song of the South. I don't think the film is perfect by any means, the story with the mother could be a little dull at times, it's Uncle Remis who truly steals the show with his animated tales of a crazy rabbit being chased by whacky villains who don't know wither to eat him or knock him on the head.
