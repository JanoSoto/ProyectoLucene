And while it may share similar themes, the one thing Shrek is not is The Lord of the Rings. What it is, however, is a highly entertaining animated movie crammed with enough to satisfy the kids as well as cynical adults (that's you and me, dear reader).The film tells the story of a reclusive ogre called Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) living in a faraway kingdom, populated by brave knights and fire-breathing dragons. However, not everything goes to script. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is conducting a witch-hunt of all fairy-tale creatures such as the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio and a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy). Soon, our heroes set off on a quest to rescue the fair maiden Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who, like Shrek himself, isn't all that she seems.This was, arguably, the film that woke Disney up. It broke the company's monopoly on animated feature films and although it wasn't the first, nothing as commercially successful as Shrek had ever been seen before. It even goes so far as to mock Disney's rose-tinted view of the world, Lord Farquaad's castle bearing a striking resemblance to Disney's theme-parks. If Shrek hadn't been able to back up the talk then it would be for nought. But it does and it does it very well. It's witty without being patronising, wonderful to look at without being overly cute and entertaining for people for all ages - something Disney hadn't been able to do until it began partnering with Pixar.Credit must go to the voice cast who do a fantastic job with the characters. And although it sticks in my throat to admit it, I didn't mind Eddie Murphy as he was considerably less annoying than he has been in the latter stages of his career. You could say that Donkey has the best lines and although he does go on quite a bit, you don't mind so much because he's funny. Unlike, say, Daddy Day Care. What I find interesting is that Disney don't have a response to the challenge. With Antz, they realise A Bug's Life. With Finding Nemo, Dreamworks SKG counter with A Shark's Tale. With Shrek, Disney has no answer and that is a sign that a film is truly unique and special. I would recommend most people to watch Shrek at least once. If you think it's a kid's film then you'd be right. But at the end of the day, aren't we all kids at heart?

means to come to the aid of civilization.I certainly as a viewer and even as a reviewer were slow to respond to the impression that this story told of on the silver screen.This recommendation is done because there is territory that is covered, that involves not only the truth but the welfare of civilization.It is a film that unlike some films when they open,you are immediately struck by the moment.Perhaps like Saving Private Ryan with the landings that were to occur in minutes on the beaches of Normandy,France.Saving Private Ryan though looks back through the eyes of Ryan.A son who because of the efforts made on his behalf through Captain Millers company was able to earn thisand indeed our introduction to the story of Saving Private Ryan is a powerful testament to the sacrifice offered in exchange for the life saved.Even now though not the reason for this review the powerful underpinning to Saving Private Ryan makes it a very memorable film,one which equates with great,A truly exemplary motion picture.However we have here a film that is about an event that took place in 1993 and it concerned the peoples of Somalia.This film opens on a subtle,almost eerie note with dark gray colors with music that won an academy award.The dramatic event begins ever so slowly almost to draw you in,perhaps even as a curiosity.To be certain we are looking at the dead and how the mass deaths were part of the picture of whatever life there was left.It invites an almost shocking perception as to the scale that this story tells off.We are told through the sayings of Plato that only the dead see the end to war and we watch how mass starvation due to the wars of clans and the like have provided the grounds for a loss of life that is described as Biblical in proportion.The numbers offered are said to exceed 300,000 dead due to starvation and counting.So dire were the needs of the Somalis that the World Community got wind of the disaster and in response to a terribly inhumane state, the UN with the full cooperation of our nation(USA)sent in front line U.S.Marines,some twenty thousand strong to restore order and re-establish a food line to assist in an attempt to save a future here too.We come to expect great things from our greatest and we got what we wanted as historically it will indicate that order was restored and food as well as supplies were finding there way to the population.However,the front line force was to be replaced soon and very capable units involving US Army Rangers as well as Delta Force commandos were on the ground in Somalia with designs to sever the head of the serpent by denying it some of its functioning pieces.Gun dealers,political as well military personnel are rounded up in an attempt to limit the effect of Aideeds faction.The claim as to the state of affairs that provided for the calls for help were an illustration of a failure of a governing body to be responsible and responsive to the many that they had authority over.This failure was and is a very present circumstance that cannot endure permanently and society or civilization will die as a result.However,this film does not as a rule look at the film as a political film it does though attempt to establish some methods as to how to deal with the events that we were watching unfold.The UN position was to do all we could without getting ourselves involved in what was considered somewhat of a civil war.We watch aid-ides militia shoot unarmed civilians and as the film takes us into Mogadishu,we learn that this is one of the most dangerous cities in all the world.The streets have vendors selling guns,which are AK47s with so many different small arms that you would probably equate its place likened to selling umbrellas,Belts,or neck ties.It is that pervasive and indeed that eerie feeling felt at the start of the film does not go away.This is a very dangerous community and not at all shy about it.The political position has an effect on just how capable a presence we wish to provide when there are final plans drawn up under the code nameIrene to move into the heart of what is considered very unfriendly territory and kidnap or capture these important pieces in Aideeds organization.The political climate suggested a low profile would be more fitting our place in the eyes of the world,so that a request for some of our special weaponry was disallowed.It may have contributed to the fact that we had to engage the enemy at all,however that withstanding our combat loses were to be nearly 19 dead and 71 wounded with the enemy having lost some 1,000.00 dead and wounded.The battle scenes don't end and there is a continuous involvement of the fight until the nighttime when though the militia may of thought it was there time when in fact they were dealt a blow through our helicopter gunships that by day light things were a-bit more peaceful.This is a very warrior type of picture,where our men in uniform provided outstanding commitment to peace and a unequivocal ability to gain that objective.In a final note this is a excellent film worth seeing more than once plus its not winning more academy awards than just two may have had something to do with timing more than anything else because this film is that good.The two categories in which it won were Best Film Editing and Best Sound.This film is worth the Soundtrack by its

So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth.

Only Hollywood would think that log cabins would make sense in a vast scrubby area with almost no trees, water or land you can actually make a living on. This is what popped into my mind when I saw the 1st scene. Its a fantastic photogenic country, but it ain't Texas. Fortunately you can learn to live with the substitution after a while.John Wayne made plenty of standard gung-ho movies and even a few comedies, The movie is full of stereotypes.

When Wayne's character starts firing madly at the buffalo herd, when he shoots people in the back or determines to kill the girl that The'Searchers' have been looking for because she's 'been living with a buck', you have to make the leap that he's playing an unlikeable bigoted murderous man by intent, and that this isn't a standard John Wayne role. His experience in the Civil War, warfare with Commanche and seeing his womenfolk raped and murdered has made its mark. John Ford telegraphs the message over and over again in dialog and scenes that a lot of bad things are happening, and even though some of the characters don't seem to know it and act like dumb bumpkins, the killing-that-begat-more-killing also gives the Commanche plenty of reasons to want to murder white settlers. Only near the end does Wayne soften a bit, apparently finally moved by the undying loyalty of the other 'Searcher' had for finding and protecting his 'sister', regardless of the life that was imposed on her or that she really wasn't his sister. This is difficult material in the PC days we now live in and except for some revisionist tripe it doesn't get touched with a 10 foot pole. Jeffrey Hunter plays the other Searcher.

With very few exceptions, the almost inevitable result is a film with major script problems. Children of the Corn has such major script problems. A young couple driving on their way to a new home accidentally hit a child standing in the middle of the road amidst corn fields on all sides. The couple stops and sees what they can do, realize the child is dead, and look for help. Eventually they realize the nearby town is completely void of any adult population. Strange corn crucifixes and husks of corn are all over the place. Then things get ugly... I liked the concept behind the film of the kids having taken control, but I had major problems with its execution. The hokey explanation at the end just does not satisfy me. Why was Issac the way he was? By the way the kid with the adult-like face playing Issac was indeed creepy. The kid playing Malachai was more annoyingly inept rather than creepy. How did the kid with the suitcase in the beginning, after having his throat sliced, manage to walk and STAND in the middle of the highway just as the car was careening down the road? I have many other like questions. This film for its time has some violent scenes. Perhaps the most violent is the first scene in the flashback of what happened three years ago at the very beginning of the film. In that scene an adult helps the children with their mission...what happens to her later? The empty streets of Gatlin, Nebraska are effective in creating much of the mood in this film. Actors Peter Horton and lovely Linda Hamilton as the couple do a competent job, and Robby Kiger as a good kid named Job excels, but the plot for this film is just too ridiculous. We see the sky inexplicably darken and wind manifest itself. We get no explanation really for anything. I am amazed that something so superficially bald in storyline has fostered at least two theatrically released sequels and at least four video sequels. (Now, that is AMAZING!)

There is the class that finds Armageddon and the theatrical How the Green Dog (I mean Grinch) Stole Christmas as the definition of a good film.

I enjoy good Summer movies, but acknowledge them like great tasting junk-food. I also enjoy the deeper, more intelligent, artistic films that draws flocks of critical praise.

Personally, I don't care too much about the source material... of course, that's probably due to my distinct dislike of Stephen King. But a good story is a good story, no matter who or where it came from. And the better part of the good story here may have come from Kubrick, and it may have come from King. I don't really care. I will admit that the film does fail in some areas, though, as a horror film. The scares are not as constant as they feel they should be, and the film only really works on the atmospheric level. The atmosphere and mood is great. No doubt about that. The film has a nice mysterious feel to it, nothing is explained in too much detail. The story is pretty good, as well as thoroughly interesting and involving. I saw this film once before, years ago... and even though I didn't understand too much of it, I liked it a lot. Particularly because of the story and the atmosphere. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. The pacing is quite good, there are only a few scenes where you're somewhat bored. I believe this is mainly because Kubrick wasn't too used to horror movies... or maybe his approach to the genre just wasn't the best. Through his career, Kubrick went through just about every single movie genre, often only making a single movie in each genre. That might be the reason some of his movies(this one and Full Metal Jacket, mainly) aren't as good as his better movies(A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove). The acting is good, though it can be argued that the two leads, Nicholson and Duvall, overplay and underplay, respectively, at times. The characters are well-written and credible, though it can be argued that some of them are a little thin. The special effects are great, and still hold up today.

I missed having the two characters together and their camaraderie. I thought their partnership was key in the book.THey (film) made a mockery of the exhibit chase in the dark... which in the book i found the most intense part. They did not do justice to the swat team involvement... instead they just made the creature the size of the entire museum hall (which had skinny hallways leading to it---apparently it does some sort of star Trekky beaming to get from room to room -- otherwise the physics are impossible). The final sewer chase was laughable because of the assumption the creature had shrunk yet again to conveniently fit in that small space. I didn't like the ending either ... since i felt the entire book...as i said above... came from a hunters mind ... i felt the ending in the book kept to this but the movie went for THE CHEESIEST LINE EVER!!! and fireworks which weren't even decent.I have been hoping the Porduction company does not own open rights to the book but payed royalties to use it . That would keep new adaptations possible. Id prefer the writers staying true to their vision next time and showing some integrity.

They cut out some of the best scenes and Da GOsta was cut from the movie --- his name is used in the movie but the character is in fact Pendergasts and not the fat sarcastic buffoon who wanted to pi**ss on all authority a-holes. I missed having the two characters together and their camaraderie. I thought their partnership was key in the book.THey (film) made a mockery of the exhibit chase in the dark... which in the book i found the most intense part. They did not do justice to the swat team involvement... instead they just made the creature the size of the entire museum hall (which had skinny hallways leading to it---apparently it does some sort of star Trekky beaming to get from room to room -- otherwise the physics are impossible). The final sewer chase was laughable because of the assumption the creature had shrunk yet again to conveniently fit in that small space. I didn't like the ending either ... since i felt the entire book...as i said above... came from a hunters mind ... i felt the ending in the book kept to this but the movie went for THE CHEESIEST LINE EVER!!! and fireworks which weren't even decent.I have been hoping the Porduction company does not own open rights to the book but payed royalties to use it . That would keep new adaptations possible. Id prefer the writers staying true to their vision next time and showing some integrity. They could have made a classic if they had had some balls and kept to it.To those who thought dumbing it up and selling out to the cheese puffs i repeat the cheesiest line ever GO TO HE** ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 December 2004","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a movie that really sold out to brainless audiences. I read this book when it first came out and had seen the original posters at me nearby theater more than A YEAR before it actually came out. When it did come out the old posters ( a Gothic type museum exterior in dark blue\/green\/ and with red blood down the entrance with the black shades seemingly making an unrecognizable ape like face) had been terminated and the new advertisements (the red and black guy screaming posters) had replaced it.That sums it up right there. During the making of the film apparently the Producers felt the original creature from the book was too damn small. Of course it didn't occur to them that the 2 story tall beast they created couldn't fit in a public washroom where apparently it gets most of it's joy. Vaseline perhaps included? must be able to shrink.One of the reasons i liked the book was that it used a hunters mind from all points and perspectives. The creature from the book was built to kill and destroy. It was built efficiently with no dead weight. Something living on a small amount of brain tissue ...well you think about it... what do junkies look like? I felt the book was very realistic. the animal is a junkie, it doesn't eat whales.

So I bought it without even having seen it and was not disappointed.When you see film reviews about foreign films and hear the words sumptuous and beautiful cinematography you tend to think Well it's probably rubbish and that's the only good thing the critics can say about it, but this is not the case here. The story may be a little far-fetched but it seems to work, the action (though there is not really enough to satisfy a die-hard martial arts fan) is well done and complements the plot, and the acting is good.But what really makes this film for me is the richness and quality of the visuals and the overall look of the production. It all comes together to make a beautiful film that has action and romance. If you want to see plenty of ridiculous over-the-top martial arts then you might do well to avoid this, but if you like a story that includes some action (and don't mind dubbed\/subtitled films - unless your French is fluent) the buy this now.

We had used a dance number from it for a musical I was in and we watched the film at out cast party. I had heard my friends talk about this film before but had never watched it. I love the story and everything about this film! The songs are so catchy, my personal favourites are Carrying The Banner, King of New York, and Seize the Day. My favourite characters are Mush, Jack, Les, Crutchy and David. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes musicals and good songs. Alan Menkin wrote most of the music and he was the one who wrote the music for The Little Mermaid so you know it has to be good! After watching this movie for the first time, I asked for it as a Christmas present. I also bought the soundtrack so that I could listen to the songs wherever I went. I love this musical and it will always be in my top 10 movies list. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie. I've never met anyone who hasn't liked it yet. Kind of like the same thing with the Princess Bride. I don't a single person who doesn't like this movie! I give it 10 stars!!!

Then after trying to scare it off the roof they find out its not a human at all. So after about 15 minutes through the movie strange things start happening like crop circles in their field and their dog starts freakin out so the boy stabs it with a fork (Ouch a ba ba ba). Then the Mel Gibson character goes into the field at night and finds an alien stalking him. Then on the news there's sightings of these strange beings around the world. Then the dad goes to some guy's house and there's an alien in the guy's pantry (wtf?) turns out they don't know how to open doors so he trapped it (but somehow they know how to break into houses with boarded windows) Soon after when the dad returns home, aliens start trying to break into their house and they have to hide in the creepy basement. Bla Bla Bla an alien tries to kill the little boy so the uncle smacks the alien with a base ball bat and a glass of water spills on it. The End. About 3\/4 of this movie is actually somewhat scary, up until you see what the aliens actually look like then you realise they're just skinny tall green guys. It turns out the aliens can't stand water so if you had an army of little kids with super soakers you could take out the entire race of these stupid aliens. I gave this movie a 5 simply because the endings so hoky poky.
