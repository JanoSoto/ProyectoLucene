[{"date":"5 September 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is the type of movie that actors\/actresses do as favors for the director or someone associated with the movie.  Matthew Broderick, fresh of the success of Godzilla, plays Jim McAllister.  Jim is a high school teacher who seems to be a little scared of the world around him.  Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick, is a senior at the same high school and running for student council president.  Tracy is the type of person that will do anything, and anyone, to get ahead.What this movie lacks in plot, acting, and directing, is also absent in EVERY other aspect of the film.  The only good thing that I can, and will, say about Election is that the director most certainly introduces us to each and every character thoroughly, which allows us to form our opinion of them almost instantaneously.  We learn that Tracy is a conniving little b*tch who like to kiss ass and then backstab to get her way.  We also feel sorry for Jim having to live his atrocious life of not being able to impregnate his wife, and eventually loosing his mind because of Tracy.I especially don't see the point, or maybe I am just missing it, for the bee sting to Jim.  It is completely irrelevant to the story, and completely unnecessary.  Not at any point in this movie could you hear my laughter.  I don't know what the director (Alexander Payne) was trying to do with the film, but I certainly didn't get anything from it.  Unless you are a diehard Matthew Broderick or Reese Witherspoon fan, Election should be voted off your list of movies to see.
