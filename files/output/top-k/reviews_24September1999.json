Those who prefer Bergman more for the light & easy 'Smiles of a Summer Night' instead of the depressing reality of 'Cries & Whispers' will adore this one. Fanny & Alexander Ekdahl are 2 young children of a sprawling well-to-do Swedish family. The late grandpapa ran a theatre company & grandmama was the leading lady. Their sons have moved out of the 'craft', except one. He is Fanny & Alexander's father & the matriarch grandmama's favourite. Alexander has inherited a love for moving pictures from him (he loves watching moving pictures thru a magic lantern in the nursery) & armed with a hyperactive imagination, he goes on to become Ingmar Bergman the film director.Alexander's young days, as portrayed by the director, gives a good indication of 2 of his future obsessions - religion & woman. He is deeply attached to his mother who gets widowed early on in the movie. His Father dies while rehearsing as Hamlet's dead father for their forthcoming production. After that his sister Fanny & he move to a grim, forbidding & frugal quarter by the ocean to live with her & their new step father, who is a Bishop, at a grim, forbidding & frugal quarter by the ocean. Like the place, the Bishop is a cruel, stiff, heartless man. He wants the children to follow his strict regime & when they resist, tension builds up moving the narrative to its horrific climax. A scene with the Bishop terrorising the young Alexander to confess a guilt, under the guise of freeing himself from hell & damnation, is chilling. With the Bishop's spinster sister & harridan mother sitting on either side of him, one of them knitting away, the place could easily have been at Mme Defarge's next to the guillotine in France or Torqemada's court in Spain. I cannot remember a more frightening scene than that of using religion to serve petty personal gains.The whole movie is filled up with such brilliant, stirring, epochal moments. Never do you look at your watch to check how much of the 3 hour long movie is still left. The scenes float, dance & shine. Being an adaptation from a TV miniseries (& that to about a 3 generation family), the film is somewhat episodic & some interesting characters like Uncle Carl & his German wife disappear after an early flourish. But each cameo holds up beautifully & seen through the eyes of a fantasy-filled boy, it is a wholesome entertainment. Some of Bergman's old ensemble - Harriet Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Erland Josephson appear in the movie, as does Lena Olin in a small role as the maid Rosa. Also brilliant, as always, is Sven Nykvist's photography.The best thing about 'F & A' is that it doesn't matter whether you have heard of Bergman, or seen any of his earlier movies.

Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! ) This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens. Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it. Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, Parting is such a sweet sorrow from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.I especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, And Charlie don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for. and Charlie asks, What happened? and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, He lived happily ever after.  *sigh* ...

The movie revolves around him, the other characters are merely his foils.  His performance was spellbinding and because of it I want to like this film. But I can't... well, not entirely.Sam Mendes and Alan Ball seek after perversity and controversy too methodically. It is the difference shock art and art that arouses controversy. The underlying force was attracting attention rather than showing us a personal vision. Perhaps that is why Spacey's performance is the core of this film. It is in a sense the vision of the film. Another actor might have destroyed the film by simply acting the material for an Oscar nomination. Spacey is the film.Only Spacey and Wes Bentley seem to care about their characters. The other actors and the direction feels exploitive. I was especially disturbed by the Col. Fitts character. He was too much an intentional counter-stereotype and not enough a real person. He resembled a one-dimensional villian from typical Hollywood fare, scripted only for plot development. First, he behaves in a completely stereotypical manner, even grunting at a paper the world's going to hell. Then his character's reality is sacrificed by the film for shock-value. In other words, first he only does what we expect, then he only does what we do not expect. Rather than a character he is a convenient cipher who can be sacrificed with out arousing politically correct controversy. I am disappointed that a film that in other respects was so innovative had to resort to cheap tricks for plot development. The gay neighbors too, are only stereotypes. They are caring, genteel, urbane and completely manufactured. The film's strange finale approaches the spellbinding level of the best films of all time. It combines the strengths of the movie and turns a sickening tragedy into a strangely poignant and hauntingly uplifting conclusion. Just for that American Beauty is worth seeing even if it falls short of its true potential.

Few performances have moved or puzzled me more. His character is sympathetic and sickening, hillarious and terrifing. The movie revolves around him, the other characters are merely his foils.  His performance was spellbinding and because of it I want to like this film. But I can't... well, not entirely.Sam Mendes and Alan Ball seek after perversity and controversy too methodically. It is the difference shock art and art that arouses controversy. The underlying force was attracting attention rather than showing us a personal vision. Perhaps that is why Spacey's performance is the core of this film. It is in a sense the vision of the film. Another actor might have destroyed the film by simply acting the material for an Oscar nomination. Spacey is the film.Only Spacey and Wes Bentley seem to care about their characters. The other actors and the direction feels exploitive. I was especially disturbed by the Col. Fitts character. He was too much an intentional counter-stereotype and not enough a real person. He resembled a one-dimensional villian from typical Hollywood fare, scripted only for plot development. First, he behaves in a completely stereotypical manner, even grunting at a paper the world's going to hell. Then his character's reality is sacrificed by the film for shock-value. In other words, first he only does what we expect, then he only does what we do not expect. Rather than a character he is a convenient cipher who can be sacrificed with out arousing politically correct controversy. I am disappointed that a film that in other respects was so innovative had to resort to cheap tricks for plot development. The gay neighbors too, are only stereotypes. They are caring, genteel, urbane and completely manufactured. The film's strange finale approaches the spellbinding level of the best films of all time. It combines the strengths of the movie and turns a sickening tragedy into a strangely poignant and hauntingly uplifting conclusion. Just for that American Beauty is worth seeing even if it falls short of its true potential.

Which poses this question, why would they waste their time on us?  Surely a race of beings who have conquered interstellar travel, would not see us as a legitimate threat.  But then again, maybe they don't think as clearly as perhaps they once used to.In the opening shot of the film, we are blessed with one of the great curtain-opening shots in film history.  A remarkable pullback that starts at Earth, pulls back through the outer reaches of our universe, and gradually changes into the eye of our main character Ellie Arroway.  This shot is a great summation of how movies can have a size as immense as the universe, and still be heartfelt and intimate at the same time.Ellie played by Jodie Foster is a scientist who spends her time listening to radio waves from deep space.  One night as she is listening to these, a clear signal comes through.  It turns out that after all this time that we have been sending out information across the galaxy, someone has heard us and responded.  As it turns out the message from space comes with instructions to build a machine.  But what does the machine do?  Is it a security risk to build it?  Eventually it is believed that the machine is possibly a transport to another world, but the catch is, only one person may go.  And this begins a debate between science and religion.  Did the message in fact come from God?  Should our first ambassador be a man of God, or a man of science?  The film deals with these questions, and gives honest answers on both sides of the argument, and it does so with an intelligence that is rarely seen in the movies these days.I won't spoil the ending, for it simply has to be seen to be believed. But I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved with the making of this film.  From Robert Zemeckis' incredible direction, to Alan Silvestri's breathtaking score, to the wonderful performances of Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, and David Morse.

O'Keefe plays a great bitch, though one-dimensional, Lillard capitalizes on his screwball sense of humor to elicit yet another entertaining scene-stealing turn, and Walker is a gorgeous piece of eye candy who's suitably jockish and egotistical.

Hogan even has to remind us of this every so often, since it's impossible not to like her - even before she reveals herself to be physically very beautiful.  And, of course, Muriel ends up learning from some of her mistakes.  As the film ends she's much the same doofus she's always been, but it's obvious that she's changed just enough for her life to be on a steady course.  I must class myself among her admirers.  She's one of the most intriguing and lovable characters I've ever encountered in a cinema.Apart from Muriel the characters are cartoons, but they're only JUST cartoons - and moreover, like Hogarth's drawings, they're serious cartoons.  I defy anyone to put a finger on any one detail and call it inaccurate.  (Porpoise Spit, for instance, although probably meant to be in New South Wales, is the scarcely at all exaggerated image of a hideous, corrupt, Queensland coastal shire.  The very name is just right.  It sounds like the kind of name a Queensland tourist trap might have, but examine the words closely and one gets the image of a dolphin being roasted over a fire.)Like most people under the age of thirty I have no exposure to any Australian film made before the date of my birth, so if I were to say that `Muriel's Wedding' represents Australian cinema's finest hour, my claim would ring hollow.  But it's not a ridiculous claim.  I was surprised at how well the film held up, revisited a few years later after all the fuss had died down.  It has already acquired indefinable magic halo, and it's becoming apparent that no-one at the time of its release - not critics, not audiences, and least of all the people who created it - realised just how good it was.

However, what raises Patton above something like the dismal, cliched film Battle of the Bulge is the incredible performance by George C. Scott as General George Patton and the fantastic insight into Patton's personality of screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North.A stroke of genius by director Franklin J. Schaffner, Coppola and North-using the sequence of George C. Scott as Patton in full U.S. Army regalia explaining his thoughts about the war, Germans, and how he expects his troops to conduct themselves against the backround of a huge American flag to establish Patton's character prior to the opening credits.  We watch mesmerized by Scott's performance and the commanding personality of Patton he brings forth.  By the time the sequence ends, we would be willing to go into battle for this man.  The tone of the film is set.As the film progresses, we begin to understand how complex Patton really was.  He was a man who was literally intoxicated by the thought of serving in the military and almost enjoyed  battle, yet his heart was heavy for every soldier in his command who became wounded or killed.  He might have even believed in reincarnation, that he was the spiritual rebirth of ancient soldiers who served under the likes of Hannibal.

From the lead characters to the chemistry between them, to the bad guys, I don't believe there could be a more perfect group.
