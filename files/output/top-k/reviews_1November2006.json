I am obsessed with the genre and find something good in almost all horror. I prefer slashers and zombie films above all and admire the writing style of Dardano Sacchetti, Stephen King,and Dario Argento.As far as directors go so many stand out as being faves. Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, Sergio Leoni, Lamberto Bava, Clive Barker and Sam Raimi are just a few of the ones I admire most.John Carpenter has always stood out to me and remained very high on my list as well. Many of his movies are favorites, but I think the majority of the people will agree that Halloween is definitely his masterpiece.I love slashers and as a kid was forbidden to watch horror and when I first got my taste of slashers in the form of Jason Vorhees I became obsessed with him and still to this day I think he is the greatest.As I got older and started trying to get a hold of every horror I could it didn't take me long to stumble across Michael Myers. Part 4 and 5 were the first ones I watched and I absolutely loved them, bloody and lots of killings and just your average slasher - which to me is a recipe that will never taste bad.I finally got to see part 1 and I liked it a whole lot less than 4 and 5 , but I was young and I wanted a killer and I wanted blood and part 1 was not anything like that. I have never been scared by slasher movies, its the psychological aspect that would get me, but Halloween even left much to be desired there for me.As I got older I gained a lot of respect for the movie and see it in a different light now that I am 30 years old and tonight is Halloween 2006 and I just finished watching it for Im guessing about the 15th time and I wanted to express my opinion about it.I have to say several things about it and the bottom line of it all will result in me basically saying I do in fact love the movie. I understand how so many people praise it for being the first of many, but I disagree by saying it wasn't the first slasher. It wasn't the first movie about a man in a mask. It wasn't the first movie about a babysitter being stalked. It wasn't the first movie that had teenage sluts getting killed. It wasn't the first movie involving a kid being a killer. It wasn't the first movie that had a mental patient escape and seek revenge. It wasn't the first movie about killings on Halloween, it wasn't even the first horror movie called Halloween.It Was the first however to combine all of those things and make the world take notice in an overwhelming way. The one thing all other movies lacked was personality. Halloween has John Carpenter and no one else had that. The direction was amazing, the editing was great the lighting was PERFECT and the technical things that make a movie work all seemed to be as real and in your face as the characters themselves.The great Donald Pleasence in my opinion was what sold the movie, he was the only one famous or with any credit really when the movie was being promoted. Moustapha Akkad was not known yet, John Carpenter had done a few things but nothing that had gained him much attention at all and all the other actors were either newbies or nobodies. Pleasence was a legend by the time Halloween was offered to him and I am glad he kept doing the sequels until he died.I do not like Jamie Lee Curtis and I think the role could've been so much better with someone else playing it, she still to this day acts as if she is responsible for the fame of the series but she is way off.Michael Myers - wow, what can one say about him? The mask, the stare, the knife, the determination, the shape, the shadow - the Boogey Man! He will be part of our movie legends guild forever. I really think 100 years from now that he will still be remembered and that this series will still be on cable or computer chips in out brain or whatever technology has in store for us in the future, that is if the series isn't still being continued in Halloween part 74.This movie made a lot of people want to see these types of movies, many movies were made to copy it and it spawned several sequels. The first of the movie with its image of a child killer all the way to the mysterious rantings of Dr. Loomis about a kid who is pure evil with the blackest of eyes, all the way to the last shot of a man shot 6 times only to disappear and let us know the boogeyman is still there - the fear is not over - you can't stop being scared or locking your doors at night, cause evil has came to your little town.Watch this movie and keep horror alive - real horror!

I didn't really care to think why.Watching this movie as a grown up (especially as a grown up trying to think about anything BUT work) made me ponder several things about human behavior. For instance, what makes one person lead and another follow? Why is there almost always just 2 prominent sides to a situation, even though there are people involved whose opinions may be of varying shades of gray? Isn't it strange that once you commit an act of taboo, that it just makes it so much easier to do the next time? Why is an act that is morally reprehensible to perform individually, become so much easier when it is done in group? Where does one's individualism go when mob rule prevails ? I think the movie did a good job of bringing out the beast, but it didn't surpass my initial impression from reading the book. The acting was commendable, given the age and experience of the actors, and the classic novel they were trying to portray. Ralph was just superb, trying to lead with reason, but watching his leadership ebb to a much more terrifying alter ego. The relentlessness and inevitability of his fate was captured in all its horror when he is told They're going to hurt you, Ralph.Its hard to write a review about just the movie, when the story itself (as told in the book) is what makes the biggest impression. The movie is rich in metaphors - innocence lost, war, society in general, right and wrong, etc. In closing, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for fear, but not of the sensational variety that 'horror movies' are generally associated with.

There are movies which you think are bad, and forget about them. There are movies where you see they are great and you never forget them. And there are movies which you think they haven't impressed you at all, but after some time you still think about them and you keep remembering them whether you like it or not. And eventually you find that they were quite good just the way they was. And so is this movie. What it wants to tell you is not the story it tells - a story which you may find uninteresting, longish, alien, of no matter to you. This film wants to give you an impression of the Gypsy way of life. And after seeing it and thinking about it, you feel like understanding the Gypsies somewhat more.

One of the things that impressed me the most about GATTACA is its ability to keep the level of tension high - there are enough little twists and turns to keep the audience involved. Ethan Hawke (Vincent) does perfect work, proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his high charisma level. Jude Law (Jerome) has a star-making presence, and it's his scenes with Hawke that give the movie its emotional core. Uma Thurman (Irene) is slightly underdeveloped, but the story isn't about her. However, she gives a lot of depth to the flat, cold character. In my opinion, things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax, when Vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view. The big dramatic culmination is a swim race, which is a bit silly or just too easy. Other things just seemed too simple within the futuristic setting. If they can do that, why can't they do this? Unlike most recent science-fiction, Gattaca actually gives you something to talk about on the way home, and you're certain to think of it again the next time you clip your fingernails and buff away some dry skin. It's successful sci-fi without showy special effects, it's a thriller with character-driven thrills, a futuristic fable without blood. Although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim, Gattaca serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film (like Equilibrium with Christian Bale).

But aside from that I have further complaints about this classic. On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy it either.What the story has going for it are some fairly interesting characters, some acted very well, and a nice mystery plot. More interesting are the relationships between some of the primary characters and the expected turn-about in character direction.

When he brings up to another worker that he has created the perfect worker, a robot who will never get tired, hungry, or have to go home to a family. But soon the worker has a fantasy, or as I'd say a very horrific nightmare, that the robots will turn against these humans and take over the world! Yeah, silent films have always been overacted and very cheesy to look at, but it's amazing to me to see what the times were like and what the mood was. The reason why Metropolis is so well loved and respected is not only because of the mood it captured, but how amazingly psychic it was, I think since the time that electricity was discovered, we've all feared how far we could go with technology, and Metropolis is a haunting picture that captures it so well.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I love silent films and remember seeing a clip of Metropolis in my film appreciation class, I was so excited to pick a five dollar copy of this film from Best Buy and I was just amazed at how disturbing this movie was for not only it's time, but today.

Not too original, but if compared to some other preceding movies, there are a lot of differences.Friends, Blue Lagoon, Spielen wir Liebe, Paradise... all of them come from 70's. Marie baie des anges is two decades late. Maybe this makes it so unlike its ancestors.How do teenagers appear in those places? In Blue Lagoon they grow up on desert island, in Friends run away from adults, in Paradise from danger, in Maladolescenza they look for secret place but keeping contact with other world. Feelings? Fearing adults, loving each other in Friends, exploring and (self)discovery in Blue Lagoon, bullying and violence in Maladolescenza. Ending? Tragic in Blue Lagoon (acciental) and Maladolescenza (violent), reintegrating in Paradise and Friends.And Marie offers a new combination. Main characters run away rejected by peers (Orso also running from law), feelings are superficial and ending is tragic in the most pointless way.One of the rare binding motifs is teenage sexuality. In Blue Lagoon it is innocent and has to be discovered from nothing, in Paradise it exists and develops, in Friends it is careful because of abuse and slowly grows to real love, while in Maladolescenza appears and increases as one of the bully patterns. In Maria, however, nothing has to be discovered sex has already been their way of life before they met and sailed into isolation.So, the only movie that shows that teenagers don't need special circumstances to be involved in sex, and admit it is a big part of their life, has been made recently, when it became fashionable to close our eyes and say that teenage sexuality doesn't exist because we don't want to see it. The consequence? Number of teenage pregnancies and STD is a lot bigger now than it was in 70's when movies were more free to show reality (and today most of them are found controversial, on black lists and usually can't be found at all). Of course, it was not a merit of movies that situation was better before, it is a matter of the society.There is one thing that shows Marie was made recently among these movies it is the only one without nudity (at least teenage characters). Sometimes it is advantage, sometimes limitation. It is hard to believe that two teenagers, obviously practicing sex a lot and living alone on the island, would be fully clothed all the time in the middle of summer. But today it's not easy to show things that were allowed in 70's. On the other hand, great scene of Maria's dance was extremely erotic (and was meant to be) just because of her dress. It could be compared to Dawn Dunlap's dance in Hamilton's Laura, but she was seducing only a camera in her mother's hand so her (very beautifully filmed) dance looked more like gym exercise, while Marie was openly seducing male, older fishermen on the beach. Laura was nude, Marie erotic.Photography is something that all of the mentioned movies rely on. And it doesn't fail. Landscape in Friends is not so attractive, but used very well, and unlike the rest of these movies it has great carefully made indoor scenes. Island in Marie can't be compared to Blue Lagoon, but there is a perfect match between the actors and the surrounding nature. Only Maladolescenza doesn't take place at the sea, and the beautiful landscape emphasizes the dark side of the story. Nature is not perfect enough to change people. Violence and evil from inside destroy the beauty. Both Fabrizio and Orso want to keep everything under their control, but aren't able to do it. Orso maybe thinks he loves Marie while Fabrizio seems to be almost split between childish friendship and violent domination, incapable to share love. However, after causing a tragedy we feel there is a hope for Fabrizio to learn and change in future, while Marie's death becomes a trigger of Orso's final insanity and sinking into crime and madness.

After all, the opening scene shows a tuxedoed spy getting shot to bits &#150; the symbolism is hardly subtle. But what has he been replaced with? Well, the hard-drinking, murdering, womanising superspy has been replaced by somebody who's, er, totally 'off the chain'. Somebody who's down with the kids. Somebody who's in tune with modern society. Yeah, our new hero doesn't smoke and he doesn't drink to excess, but he does play videogames and he does have lots of tattoos. He also hangs around with skateboarders and other 'extreme' sports enthusiasts. In other words, our hero is a loser.And worse than that, our hero is also excruciatingly self-righteous. At the beginning he steals the car of some senator who wants to ban rap music and videogames. I'm sorry, but I'm with Poindexter &#150; if banning rap music and videogames helps gets the X Games off my TV screen then I'm all for it.Normally at this point, in light of the film having such a loathsome hero, I'd express my admiration for the bad guys, but if there's one thing I hate more than tattoo-clad tosspots who play videogames and listen to rap music, it's Goths. And if there's one thing I hate more than regular Goths, it's European Goths. They're Goths with an accent.The opening scenes where the Bond imitation gets killed are almost impossible to watch. You see, the bloke wanders into a death metal gig. And so instead of having to listen to rap and some guy telling you how big his genitals are, you have to listen to dirty Eurotrash shout incompressible gibberish about rotting corpses. Can't someone just slaughter both sides? But making the scene even more risible is the fact that one of the band members in this Goth club has a flamethrower attached to his face. Wow, that is so&#133;stupid.Of course, the bad guys lap this all up. But then again, we are talking about a bunch of Russian idiots who call themselves 'Anarchy 99'. I mean, come on, that's a bit limp, isn't it? Anarchy 99? Ooh, we sound like a 14-year old sadsack writing in his tearstained journal. But although the film gives us a token explanation for the bad guys wanting 'anarchy' &#150; they were soldiers and they no longer want people dying for politicians &#150; it smacks of a zit-faced loser whining in his mother's basement. Ooh, the world treated us badly. Ooh, the system is wrong. Ooh, I'm angry. Ah, grow up.But what's amazing is that Cage (Vin Diesel) doesn't genuinely hook up with these Goth cretins. I mean, they both hate The Man and they're both self-righteous morons, so they should be the best of pals. But instead it's Cage's job to bring them down. And why does he do this? Because he has principles? Because he's perceptive? Because he thinks that no heterosexual man should hang out in a club with candelabra in it? No, he does it because he has no balls. He wants to avoid prison. So yet again Generation X proves itself to be a massive sell out.But of course, despite the hero being a total eunuch, the film desperately wants to convince us it's edgy. So as well as tattoos and bad music, you also have to witness the flaccid attempts at injecting sex into the film. I think the moment that made me laugh the most was when some woman does a pole dance on a four-poster bed. Yeah, rad. But although the film thinks this is incredibly 'hawt', it is, being a conformist piece of rubbish, a PG-13, so we don't get nudity. Boo. And on top of that we have to witness the horror that is Vin Diesel kissing.The action doesn't fare much better, either. One of the worst bits has to be when Cage, while flying in mid-air riding a dirt bike, kicks a sentry in the head. Pur-lease. And then there's the way that when riding his dirt bike helicopters can't shoot him. They can shoot to the left and right of him, but they can't make a direct hit. And on a smaller scale of awfulness, there's a scene where Cage slides down a rail on a metal tray like Legolas Greenleaf.But probably the worst thing in the film (even worse than the 'crazy' Q imitation and the fruity little guns that everyone sports with a million gizmos attached to them) is the Submarine O' Death. Yep, the bad guys, in time honoured fashion, want to bring about anarchy by gassing everyone via a gay little submarine\/boat-type thingy. Really, it's the stupidest piece of crap you've ever seen. It looks about as awesome and threatening as a two-inch penis. And then you have to watch Cage wrestle with this thing to save humanity. And on top of that, to highlight what's at stake, we get shots of babies and couples kissing. Bond never got this gooey. Plus Bond knew how to fire a gun, didn't kill the bad guy entirely through luck and had sex with lots of women along the way. Oh, but Cage is the one that's edgy. Remember, he has tats!

And on top of that, to highlight what's at stake, we get shots of babies and couples kissing. Bond never got this gooey. Plus Bond knew how to fire a gun, didn't kill the bad guy entirely through luck and had sex with lots of women along the way. Oh, but Cage is the one that's edgy. Remember, he has tats!

After all, the opening scene shows a tuxedoed spy getting shot to bits &#150; the symbolism is hardly subtle. But what has he been replaced with? Well, the hard-drinking, murdering, womanising superspy has been replaced by somebody who's, er, totally 'off the chain'. Somebody who's down with the kids. Somebody who's in tune with modern society. Yeah, our new hero doesn't smoke and he doesn't drink to excess, but he does play videogames and he does have lots of tattoos. He also hangs around with skateboarders and other 'extreme' sports enthusiasts. In other words, our hero is a loser.And worse than that, our hero is also excruciatingly self-righteous. At the beginning he steals the car of some senator who wants to ban rap music and videogames. I'm sorry, but I'm with Poindexter &#150; if banning rap music and videogames helps gets the X Games off my TV screen then I'm all for it.Normally at this point, in light of the film having such a loathsome hero, I'd express my admiration for the bad guys, but if there's one thing I hate more than tattoo-clad tosspots who play videogames and listen to rap music, it's Goths. And if there's one thing I hate more than regular Goths, it's European Goths. They're Goths with an accent.The opening scenes where the Bond imitation gets killed are almost impossible to watch. You see, the bloke wanders into a death metal gig. And so instead of having to listen to rap and some guy telling you how big his genitals are, you have to listen to dirty Eurotrash shout incompressible gibberish about rotting corpses. Can't someone just slaughter both sides? But making the scene even more risible is the fact that one of the band members in this Goth club has a flamethrower attached to his face. Wow, that is so&#133;stupid.Of course, the bad guys lap this all up. But then again, we are talking about a bunch of Russian idiots who call themselves 'Anarchy 99'. I mean, come on, that's a bit limp, isn't it? Anarchy 99? Ooh, we sound like a 14-year old sadsack writing in his tearstained journal. But although the film gives us a token explanation for the bad guys wanting 'anarchy' &#150; they were soldiers and they no longer want people dying for politicians &#150; it smacks of a zit-faced loser whining in his mother's basement. Ooh, the world treated us badly. Ooh, the system is wrong. Ooh, I'm angry. Ah, grow up.But what's amazing is that Cage (Vin Diesel) doesn't genuinely hook up with these Goth cretins. I mean, they both hate The Man and they're both self-righteous morons, so they should be the best of pals. But instead it's Cage's job to bring them down. And why does he do this? Because he has principles? Because he's perceptive? Because he thinks that no heterosexual man should hang out in a club with candelabra in it? No, he does it because he has no balls. He wants to avoid prison. So yet again Generation X proves itself to be a massive sell out.But of course, despite the hero being a total eunuch, the film desperately wants to convince us it's edgy. So as well as tattoos and bad music, you also have to witness the flaccid attempts at injecting sex into the film. I think the moment that made me laugh the most was when some woman does a pole dance on a four-poster bed. Yeah, rad. But although the film thinks this is incredibly 'hawt', it is, being a conformist piece of rubbish, a PG-13, so we don't get nudity. Boo. And on top of that we have to witness the horror that is Vin Diesel kissing.The action doesn't fare much better, either. One of the worst bits has to be when Cage, while flying in mid-air riding a dirt bike, kicks a sentry in the head. Pur-lease. And then there's the way that when riding his dirt bike helicopters can't shoot him. They can shoot to the left and right of him, but they can't make a direct hit. And on a smaller scale of awfulness, there's a scene where Cage slides down a rail on a metal tray like Legolas Greenleaf.But probably the worst thing in the film (even worse than the 'crazy' Q imitation and the fruity little guns that everyone sports with a million gizmos attached to them) is the Submarine O' Death. Yep, the bad guys, in time honoured fashion, want to bring about anarchy by gassing everyone via a gay little submarine\/boat-type thingy. Really, it's the stupidest piece of crap you've ever seen. It looks about as awesome and threatening as a two-inch penis. And then you have to watch Cage wrestle with this thing to save humanity.

It is a concert film depicting The Band's farewell concert on Thanksgiving, 1976 at the Winterland. Thanks to Netflix, I finally was able to watch THE LAST WALTZ. Among such other concert films as CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH and STOP MAKING SENSE, it is a wonderful period piece, capturing its era. The musical performances in this film are very solid. The Staple Singers join in for part of THE WEIGHT, Van Morrison makes a curious stage exit before his song is even done, and Neil Diamond reminds us of the gifted songwriter he could be.BUT....I really wish the film had just stayed with the musical performances. Unfortunately, we also get numerous backstage interviews. These mar and slow down the pacing of the film and as such, these segments have not aged well. Most of The Band, speak in monotones and (no disrespect intended) but Rick Danko and Richard Manuel seem so drugged-out in these segments, it's no wonder they have since died.I could give this movie a 10 were it not for the interview segments. Still, don't let that detract you. Hit the fast-forward button and enjoy some wonderful music performances.As for what happened to the performers since then Levon Helm did get into some acting, most notably in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER. Robbie Robertson had something of a solo comeback in the late 1980s. Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and Van Morrison have continued to write compelling new music. And Eric Clapton of course has had the most successful career since then.

The idea of a less than average guy, that does not appear to have any particular quality but who instead is the mind behind the whole story. Story in which he seems to be just a walk on part. This said, I find the plot (the story Verbal makes up) though not bad, to be pretty ordinary, and as a viewer I am barely entertained by it throughout 2 hours. And an ending, no matter how surprising, won't change that (leave alone that surprise might not be the sole quality one expect from a movie, except for those who consider the Twilight Zone episodes to be masterpieces). Characters don't have any depth, since everything is sacrificed on the attempt to conceal the ending (consider for instance the scene in which Kobayashy gives the 5 men their personal files we are shown everyone's reaction, except Kint's). Unlike many great thrillers, a second view of The Usual Suspects is pointless, unless you want to speculate endlessly on trifles, as if they really matter. Because there is no way a verbal (or Verbal) reconstruction of the events can contain as many details as we see on the movie, details which are told us by Bryan Singer, and not by 'Verbal' Kint. This discrepancy doesn't alter the experience of watching the movie, nor it turns it into a rip-off (if there's a place where I don't mind being cheated that's the cinema) but it makes any attempt to reorganize the facts in a coherent way to be a futile task.The old fascinating idea I mentioned above is not exploited at all. In fact Verbal is not even a cripple. He has a Limo waiting for him around the corner. What a disappointment!
