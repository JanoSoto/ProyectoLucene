This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath. The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from Disappointed!, Don't call me stupid, You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works, You British think you are so superior, What was the part in the middle?, Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet. When you say friendly, what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What? There are many more.A Fish Called Wanda is a real treasure, and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. ) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does. I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with. John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script\/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the key to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to meet with an accident, even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces as her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto. You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more. I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment. I envy such death. And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the Marriage of Figaro.

You can write the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more. I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment. I envy such death. And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the Marriage of Figaro. (Translation is mine)I just would add - or watch again A Fish Called Wanda.

The film takes place in 1912 on the famous Titanic.We all know the story of the great ship the Titanic and how it was the biggest ship ever built and then of course it sadly sank to the bottom of the ocean. But we do not all know the stories of the passengers of the Titanic and what it was like to be there as the Titanic was making it's voyage to the endless depths of the massive ocean. There wasn't enough lifeboats for everyone, only enough for the women and children. This film centers around a family on the ship, the Sturges family, and the battle in the family between the mother, Julia (Stanwyck), and the father, Richard (Webb). The family is extremely well to do and Richard wants their children to live a life like royalty while Julia wants them to be kind, humble people. Well they do not know yet that those problems will sink to the bottom of the list after they spend a few days on their trip to America.The screenplay for this film was decent but it would have been much better with more characterization. By the time the film ended I really did not know who the characters were at all, and that could have been improved if the film was lengthened in order for more dialogue and plot could happen. I do like it when films have a small plot within a much larger plot, I always find that interesting. Other films that do the same type of thing is In Old Chicago with the great Chicago fire and Apocalypto with the Europeans discovering the Americas. The main flaw with the screenplay was the fact that all the characters weren't well developed and also the ending should have had much more drama to it.The direction of this film was poor and this film could have been much better if it wasn't so. This is a majorly dramatic event and yet the film never makes it feel like it is. Negulesco never does any camera movements to make me feel like a ship in sinking and many people will die. She films it the same exact way she films the beginning of the film which is much more lighthearted. It could have been monumentally better but unfortunately not.Even though Negulesco wasn't the greatest behind the camera at least she was able to get decent performances from the actors in their single dimensional roles. Clifton Webb played the part of a gentleman fine and he really did not need to do much more than that because even as the boat was sinking he was still a gentleman. Barbara Stanwyck is one of the great actresses but this film is not the reason why even though she also did a good job, just nothing extraordinary due to the limitation of her character by the writing. She did everything in her role very well though. The same is to be said about Audrey Dalton and all the other actors in this film, most of it centered on Webb and Stanwyck's characters though.Now I would like to compare this film to James Cameron's Titanic which is far superior. The reason why the more recent Titanic is so much better is because it is a three hour film instead of only an hour and a half. For the first two hours we learn about Jack and Rose and grow to know them while we are not able to do it in this film. Then for the final hour is all the drama of the ship sinking, instead of a mere twenty minutes. I felt for Jack and Rose while I did not really at all care for anyone in the family in this film. Sometimes it is better for a film to be longer so the audience can grow into it.Overall I give this film a 6\/10 because even though I've said mainly negative things about the film it isn't bad. I would recommend James Cameron's Titanic to you much sooner than this though. It is very interesting to see an older film do something of such large proportions though and I would recommend it to anyone who likes classic films and also drama about true events.

(1986) *** 1\/2 (out of 4) Based on David Mamet's play, the film tells the story of Danny (Rob Lowe) and Debbie (Demi Moore) who have a one night stand and then try to build a relationship from it even though both have friends (James Belushi, Elizabeth Perkins) warning them against it. You can find hundreds of love stories from the 80s but in my opinion this one here is without question one of the best even though when viewing it today there are a few problems with it. I think the positives are so strong that you can't help but view them as a contemporary classic. For starters, I think Mamet's play is an incredibly strong one that translates to the screen without any trouble and this is due in large part to the terrific screenplay that has some wonderful dialogue. While watching the film there's no question it deserves its R-rating but the dialogue seems incredibly fresh and like something you would actually hear between friends. The raunchy talk between Lowe and Belushi as well as the other side of things done in more adult manner between Moore and Perkins. The screenplay gets everything down so right that you can't help but feel you're watching a real relationship over the course of a year and when you see the ups and downs you feel as if this movie is giving it to you pretty straight. Another major plus are the performances and while the actors themselves might disagree, I'd say this is the best work any of them have done. Lowe and Moore make for the perfect couple and both of them make their characters smart, funny and of course at times dramatic. They are wonderful together during the sexual scenes and they really shine once the relationship gets started and of course begins to sour. Belushi is downright hilarious here and you can't help but wish you had a friend like him. Perkins is also very good in her role. The screenplay is all about relationships both sexually and more emotionally and I think the movie does a very good job at handling both of them. You can tell from the way the film was built that it's based on a play but this never hurts the film. Director Zwick does a very good job at handling the romance and mixing it in with the raunchy comedy and more dramatic moments. I think the film does run a bit too long and there's a bit too much music in it but ABOUT LAST NIGHT... is still one of the more memorable love stories of the decade. With the strong screenplay and performances, it still remains rather fresh after all these years.

It must have been the perfect film for me at that time, because I loved it when I watched it 20 odd years or so ago and I love it now, even though I know almost every line well before they are said.The plot for what it is worth. 2 garbagemen come across a dead body in their daily pick up. They incorrectly assume that they are somehow involved (not really a long story but not important here), and spend the rest of the film dealing with the consequences and trying to avoid the attention of those really responsible.James (Emilio Estevez) and Carl (Charlie Sheen) are the two Working Men, they aresurfin', drinkin', loafin' dudes with dreams of owning a surf shop and no everyday aspirations greater than minimising work and pissing off the other garbos and local cops.Into their lackadaisical existence comes Louis (Keith David), an combat vet assigned to make sure Carl and James are good boys on the job, much to their disgust. Keith David steals the movie for mine, his bizarre rants and resentment of all authority causes him to act in generally insane ways and to jump to random conclusion with no basis in logic, he even gets away with an early Weekend at Bernie's moment and makes it funny.As the movie rolls along a love interest and the pizzaman get involved, the real killers close in and the boys discover the full scope of what faces them. Being a lightweight comedy the characters coincidentally and conveniently keep running into each other, kinda like Crash a few years ago but with laughs and less clumsiness. (I still hate Crash.) This is at times cheesy, always likable and totally unassuming fare that was definitely not made with awards consideration in mind. To explain the jokes without transcribing them is pointless, but I find that more than most hit the mark and I would rather watch this 27 more times than have to put up with another cookie cutter Will Ferrell or Rob Schneider yawnfest.And it'll cost you a buck to rent for a week if you are lucky enough to find it.

Some , such as Stage Fright or Frenzy, were actually shot in Britain, whereas others such as Rebecca or Dial M for Murder were filmed in America despite an ostensible British setting. Dial M for Murder started life as a stage play, and remains very stagey even in its cinema version. Apart from one scene in a gentleman's club and a few views of the street , the whole film takes place in one location, the living-room of a London flat. This is one of the few films in which Hitchcock does not appear in person. As in Lifeboat, his cameo appearance comes in the form of a photograph. Tony Wendice is a retired professional tennis player living in London with his beautiful younger wife Margot. (Guy Haines, the hero of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train , was also a successful tennis star, although in his case an amateur). The marriage is not a happy one, and Margot has been having an affair with the American crime novelist Mark Halliday. Tony has devised a plan to have Margot murdered, although his motivation is not sexual jealousy; he displays no malice towards Halliday and the two men even appear to be friends. He is rather motivated by financial greed; Margot is independently wealthy and Tony is the sole beneficiary of her will. Tony gets in touch with Charles Swann, an disreputable acquaintance with a criminal record, and persuades him to agree to kill Margot using a mixture of bribery and blackmail. The film's title derives from the telephone call which Tony will make to his flat and will be the signal for Swann to carry out the murder. The plan, however, goes wrong. Swann enters the flat as arranged, but while he is attempting to strangle Margot, she manages to reach a pair of scissors and stabs him to death. Tony's scheme appears to have misfired, but he is quick-thinking enough to improvise another plan, planting evidence suggesting that Swann was blackmailing Margot over her affair. The police do not believe Margot's story that she killed Swann in self-defence and she is arrested, tried and sentenced to death for murder. Numerous Hitchcock films include a character wrongly accused of a crime, but normally that character is male and plays an active role in establishing his innocence and bringing the real perpetrator to justice. (Examples include Derrick de Marney's character in Young and Innocent or Cary Grant's in North by North-West). Margot is virtually the only female character in a Hitchcock film to find herself in this plight, and after her conviction disappears from the action until the end of the film. The lead in establishing her innocence and Tony's guilt is taken by a detective, Chief Inspector Hubbard. Although most of Hitchcock's films deal with crime, individual police officers rarely play an important role; Dial M for Murder, like Stage Fright, is one of the few exceptions. To judge from its high rating on this board, Dial M for Murder still has many admirers, but I have always regarded it as one of Hitchcock's weaker efforts. Although he made other films with claustrophobic settings, notably Lifeboat, and Rear Window, few of his films are adapted from stage plays (Rope being another example), and I feel that this one would have benefited from being opened up to a greater extent. The acting is far from distinguished. Grace Kelly looks gorgeous, as she normally did, but this is by far the weakest of the three performances she gave for Hitchcock. (The others were Rear Window, also made in1954, and To Catch a Thief from the following year). Ray Milland is bland and wooden as Tony. It might have been more interesting if the role had gone to Cary Grant, a frequent Hitchcock collaborator, who wanted it, but apparently the studio were afraid that audiences would not accept him as a villain. There is, in fact, no really sympathetic character with whom the audience can identify. Tony is an obvious villain. Mark is a selfish playboy, and even though he is a crime writer he seems ignorant when it comes to real-life crime. Margot is weak and passive, and as an adulteress does not attract much audience sympathy. (Fifties audiences probably worried more about such things than modern ones would do). Although Hubbard is instrumental in finding the crucial evidence which clears Margot, we are also aware that it was originally his mistakes which led to her being wrongly arrested and convicted, and his change of heart about her guilt is never really explained. The film's greatest weakness, however, is that it lacks that essential Hitchcock ingredient, tension. It is probably the most talky of all his films, with little physical action except for the scene where Margot stabs Swann. There is no heart-stopping set-piece comparable to, say, the cornfield scene in North by North-West or the shower scene in Psycho. The denouement is a prosaic affair, involving lots of talk about the location of various keys. In a bizarre twist, Margot is released from jail and returned to her flat to assist Hubbard with his investigations, even though she is supposed to be under sentence of death. (I really cannot imagine the authorities ever sanctioning such an arrangement). The fifties are often regarded as the decade when Hitchcock was working at the height of his powers, and he certainly produced some of his greatest films during this period. (Strangers on a Train, I Confess, Vertigo, North by North-West). With the possible exception of Stage Fright, however, Dial M for Murder must count as his weakest from this decade. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2010","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Although Alfred Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1940, he continued to make occasional films with a British setting.

It could be, from very very merciful angle, an anti-alcoholism public service announcement, yet through the behavior of scriptwriters ! And if it is, as I heard, partly Mariah Carey's biography, then the tagline should be In music she found her dream, her love, herself. Not cinema ! OK, I said to myself, so what about the songs? However as a fan of Mariah Carey's music and voice (like me), or not, you must hate these songs. The only track that worth hearing, Want You; a duet with (Eric Benét), is butchered in the background of one scene, even (Benét) got no respectable character during it !! Some of the songs were so 80s, and sorrowfully I mean it in the bad sense.The acting was extremely UGLY. (Max Beesley) must work in any other line than acting. (Mariah Carey) earned the Worst Actress award for that year fair and square. Speaking about ugliness, one of the most famous beauties back then, Mariah herself, looked really not beautiful for most of the time. Maybe that's the effect of this movie on her ! I hated it for making nothing to be watched, heard, or bearable. The release of it was postponed for 3 weeks when Mariah was hospitalized as a result of an emotional and physical breakdown. Till now I believe that that happened due to undeclared reason which is watching this movie before releasing it (and I'm not kidding!).You read that it is listed among the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book (The Official Razzie® Movie Guide). Now I beg to differ. Bad it is. Enjoyably? It isn't. In fact it doesn't require any culture or smartness to comprehend that the only watchable, and enjoyable, thing here is the scene in which Mariah Carey was wearing that gray bikini. Although I hate gray, but who cares ? If only she made the whole movie in it !!

Also, given this is a samurai film, Ghost Dog amazingly doesn't use a one inch punch or karate kick for the entire flick.He doesn't need to, Ghost Dog adheres only to his own standards and plays by his own adopted set of rules.

The characters and their basic story lines remain somewhat the same they have the same beginnings, same names and backgrounds and the same final, end-of-story resolutions, but their personalities and attitudes as well as many of the significant incidents are given a somewhat different treatment. Fanny is the most altered; she has more spunk (waaaaaaaay more spunk, possibly more than is easy to forgive for die-hard Austen fans) and Frances O'Conner is more attractive than Fanny seems to be described in the novel (or as portrayed by the actress in the mini-series.) She is also fashioned a bit as a reflection of Jane Austen herself as a writer of love stories, and even a very subjective POV of a History of England novel much like that actually written by Miss Austen as a teenager. Sir Thomas' character is written a little darker and of course the slavery issue becomes one of the centerpieces of the story, something that was glossed over so lightly in the novel and the mini-series that it was barely noticeable. Indeed, it may be brought too much forward to forgive for die-hard Austen fans. I will leave it to others who are better informed and educated than I am to decide whether the 1990's politically-correct ideologies of the young people in this early 19th century story seem unrealistically anachronistic.However, as a movie by itself, viewed as inspired by rather than based upon the novel, it works very well. It is interesting and the characters and enhanced story lines are mostly well-thought out. Tom Bertram, Jr. is a tortured artiste, and is not just an idle playboy, but one who is desperately trying to distract himself from the great burden of guilt he carries regarding how his family's fortune is made on the sweat, tears and broken backs of forced, slave labor. The only characters who really do remain truthful to the novel are Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris. I like that it is brought right out in the open that Lady B is a borderline alcoholic (if she hasn't actually crossed over that line.) While Edmund is portrayed still very closely to how he was originally written, he, too, is given a little more of an edge. A little side observation Embeth Davidtz, who plays Mary Crawford, so much resembles Jackie Smith-Wood, who played the same character in the '83 mini-series that she could be Smith-Wood's daughter (or at least her much-younger sister.)The ladies' costumes are gorgeous, the prettiest I've ever seen in any Jane Austen film\/TV adaptation.

Silly, mindless fun can be good for the soul, I suspect. But the thing that makes the silliness work is that it has to be funny. This really wasn't.

The fight between Robin and Little John was humorous, as was Blinkin explaining the fate of Robin's family after Robin's return from the Crusades. But those funny scenes were few and far between. For the most part the silliness of this movie was just that - silly. It was clear from the start that no one involved in this project was taking this very seriously. That's no criticism. This isn't intended to be taken seriously - not even by the actors I'm sure. Cary Elwes was fine as Robin of Locksley. There was nothing particularly wrong with any of the performances.

Silly, mindless fun can be good for the soul, I suspect. But the thing that makes the silliness work is that it has to be funny. This really wasn't. Admittedly there were a handful of scenes that made me chuckle a bit. The fight between Robin and Little John was humorous, as was Blinkin explaining the fate of Robin's family after Robin's return from the Crusades. But those funny scenes were few and far between. For the most part the silliness of this movie was just that - silly. It was clear from the start that no one involved in this project was taking this very seriously. That's no criticism. This isn't intended to be taken seriously - not even by the actors I'm sure. Cary Elwes was fine as Robin of Locksley. There was nothing particularly wrong with any of the performances. The movie is filled with quite intentional future anachronisms (references to Pablo Picasso, Winston Churchill, George Bush and Mark Twain spring to mind) and even pokes some fun at Kevin Costner's performance as Robin Hood in the 1991 movie Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, as Elwes notes for all the world to hear that this Robin speaks with an English accent! Brooks makes sure that he gives himself a part as Rabbi Tuckman - this movie's version of Friar Tuck.Yes, it's all in good fun. It's just a shame that the good fun couldn't have been funnier. But it is typical Mel Brooks. His fans will love it.

But back in 1974, it was almost unprecedented for the makers of a Best Picture Academy Award-winner to return to the well. It's significant that this is called The Godfather Part II rather than Godfather II, since Coppola and his collaborators did not give us more of the same, but extended the original story of the Corleone family backwards and forwards, while deepening the characterisations.Darting back and forth in time, this follows Michael (Pacino) through the 1950s, as his would-be legitimate business gets into sleazy deals in Cuba and the US Senate, and he is forced to break the ultimate taboo by having his own brother murdered. Meanwhile, we see his father Vito (De Niro) as a young man, organising a street gang in turn-of-the-century New York. Coppola, steeped in Italian-American myth of the immigrant experience, canonises Vito, who founds the Mafia to protect his people from more predatory dons, while exposing the way Vito's family business harbours the seed of his son's monstrously corrupt empire.This was the film in which Pacino and De Niro were first teamed, though the exigencies of the narrative mean that they never actually meet. Both are electrifying but Pacino is especially strong, his hollow gaze showing the high price Michael has paid for his position. And with supporting roles from the likes of Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Lee Strasberg, to say nothing of Roger Corman and Harry Dean Stanton in bit parts, this is nothing short of magisterial.Courtesy Empire magazine ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" These days, any old franchise can spin off a string of Roman numeral sequels.

There is little in the way of flashy editing or dazzling set pieces, only some fine actors delivering a wildly intelligent and sophisticated screenplay. But this shining aspect alone puts Mr. Smith Goes to Washington at a level of grandiose brilliance that has all the same appeal as a sparkling big budget epic. The movie is about Jefferson Smith, played by one of my favorite actors James Stewart. After the senator of his state passes away, Smith is rushed into office to hold the US Senate seat. Smith is naive but has a very big heart with equally big ambition. He pushes for a national boys camps with the best intentions, but when his selfless prospects get in the way of plans for a dam, two other senators, Jim Taylor and Joseph Paine, conspire to get Smith kicked out of office through scandal and corruption. It is a harsh criticism of the American government, but also a wonderfully characterized and extremely captivating underdog story which Stewart plays perfectly.I've already said a lot about the screenplay of this film, but I'm going to keep talking about it because it's just that compelling. The storyline of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is its shining aspect that makes it one of the smartest films of its decade. What begins as a fun little tale about a naive young man getting to play with the big dogs in the Senate becomes a darker and very critical commentary on the US governmental system. It's not to say that the film doesn't also remain lighthearted where it needs to be. It's a very pleasant story in which our protagonist prevails through his own will and determination. But there is a consistent theme of political corruption that only goes as far as a dam construction in the film, but alludes to more serious corruption that has sadly become all the more prevalent since the film was released.One of the most amazing things about this film is just how relevant it is in todays society. Political corruption is a plague and a curse that we can't seem to rid ourselves of in this world. It only seems to grow to darker and more sinister things as the years go by, and at the time Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was made this idea of such corruption was so much smaller than it is today, in a world where under the table bargains are made every day, screwing over the good hearted Jefferson Smiths of the world. It's sad that we still see this corruption today, but at least it still makes Mr. Smith Goes to Washington a socially relevant piece of cinema.But aside from the brooding undercurrent of this film, it really does have a happy message. It shows that through selfless and kind hearted perseverance we can overcome the challenges put forth unto us by the tyrannical fat cats sitting in their ivory towers, thinking they are invincible against the sympathetic little man. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington doesn't end on a dark note and it doesn't force feed us cynical thoughts about American government. Instead it uplifts us and gives up hope that there is good in the world. That's why I think James Stewart was so perfectly cast in this role because of how incredibly likable he is in any role her pursues. The character of Jefferson Smith inadvertently demands empathy, and that isn't difficult to do when he is so empathetically portrayed by James Stewart.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great little film. It's got a very socially relevant message, one that is transferred excellently from the marvelous script to the screen by exquisite actors. The dialouge in this film keeps you so enthralled in this movie from start to finish and the filibuster at the end of the movie is just as compelling and epic as any final battle sequence in an action movie. This screenplay does with words what other films could and sometimes even couldn't do with guns, swords, or explosions. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a compelling piece of rich cinema that shouldn't be missed.
