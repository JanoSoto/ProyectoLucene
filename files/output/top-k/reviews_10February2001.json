Well acted by a great ensemble cast that portray an 'Altmanesque' kaleidoscope of small-town characters, most of whom are eccentrics.  The plot revolves around the suicide of Cookie, a matriarch of one of the town's leading families. Since suicide is considered disgraceful, two of her nieces, upon discovering her body, cover it up to make it look like a murder. And then an innocent man becomes the prime suspect and...off we go.  Ok, so it's not as 'deep' as many of Altman's films, nor as dark either. But that's not bad, and Cookie's Fortune is a very enjoyable movie. I recommend it highly for a Saturday night rental.

Some may accuse it of being formulaic, but I feel that there is just enough unexpected-ness in it to keep the audience interested.  I would hope that the apparent similarities to the director, Gus Van Sant's earlier work, Good Will Hunting, do not dissuade anyone from seeing the film.  Any similarities are unimportant and do not take away from the fact that this is a good movie which stands alone as a deep film with an good plot. The script is very well written and all of the dialog appears real and natural.  It is a thought provoking drama, but it is not depressing or sappy, as all too many dramas are.  At the same time, it does not give the impression of simply being a feel-good movie. Also, although there are several humorous lines in the movie, they do not rely on cheap puns or slap stick humor.William Forester once wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book, but now is a recluse, hiding from his fame, who never leaves his book-filled apartment in the Bronx, but spends his time reading and bird watching, as well as watching the teenagers of the neighborhood play basketball in the park outside his window.  Jamal Wallace is one of these teenagers.  He hides his love of reading, and his brilliant writing skills, and chooses instead to gain the acceptance of his peers through his skill at basketball. A prep school has offered Jamal a scholarship because of his high test scores, and their need to win a basketball championship.  The two characters meet, and Forester becomes a sort of teacher\/mentor, but both learn many things from each other.  Symbolism is important in this film, and it makes many good points about people, how we relate to each other, and how we deal with the difficulties of life.The movie stays away from any violence and sex.  It is rated PG-13 because of brief strong language and sexual references, but even these are few, and not over done, using only what is necessary to create real characters and setting -- a refreshing difference from many films that are now being made. The message of the film is good and moral, but it was wonderful to see a serious film staring a young black person that does not hit you over the head with messages of racial tolerance.One of the surprises in the film is the great soundtrack.  It is mostly Jazz songs from Miles Davis and others, which seems well suited to the mood of the movie and to the setting, another well done part of the film.  The final song, a medley of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and What a Wonderful World is great.  I was happy that this movie had refused to do what many recent movies have done in capitalizing on a soundtrack and trying to use or create hit pop songs in a movie.  It also stays away from sappy and unnecessary orchestra music that is often used to try to create emotion in the audience. This movie does not need to resort to tricks like this in order to make you feel for the characters.  Another happy surprise is a cameo from Matt Damon.The acting is wonderful, particularly from the experienced Sean Connery, playing the title character, and from newcomer Robert Brown, as Jamal. Even the more minor parts in the film, such as Jamal's older brother, played by Busta Rhymes, and Jamal's friends and teachers are well-acted.  Anna Paquin is well suited for her role as Claire, a rich girl from the prep school that Jamal transfers to.  The two seem to make a connection, but a romantic subplot is not pursued very far in the film.  I found this a refreshing change, and one of the factors that kept the movie from being too predictable, as well as much more realistic.  Real life romances do not usually happen the way they often do in films.  A disappointment was the character played by F. Murray Abraham.  Although well acted, there is a complete lack of character development, and the teacher-that-gives-the-brilliant-student-a-hard-time stereotype is hard to ignore.  Despite this one shortcoming, this is an excellent film.As the film ended and the credits began to roll, I noticed that no one in the theater got up to leave, as is usually the case in theaters.  The audience remained seated until the credits and music had finished, and the lights came back on.  It is just that kind of a movie.  I would defiantly recommend it to anyone wishing to see a mature and thought-provoking film that is entertaining and enjoyable to watch, and will leave you feeling inspired.

Our Irish friend's acrid comments show he obviously doesn't like Steinbeck and that's his privilege.  Now, having said that, I must say he's wrong.  This film is excellent.  Just that.  The cast is wonderful and the story is a classic  the destruction of innocence by cruel reality (viz  the title of the story taken from a line from a Robert Burns's poem).  And, while Steinbeck was not one to let a sentimental moment pass by, e.g, Lennie's Christ-like innocence, inappropriate super-human strength which inadvertently wreaks havoc resulting in his euthanasia with the same instrument as used for Curley's dog, these scenes are never maudlin.  Too, for the serious Steinbeck fan, there's more, much more.  This story, and the play, created at Steinbeck's most experimental period, is fraught with symbolism.  There's the big guy, a victim of the little guy's vanity.  Many are not aware that Steinbeck was small (5'3) and very self-conscious about his size. The cast is outstanding  Betty Field's careless and bored character, Mae contrasts with the mighty innocence of Chaney's Lennie.  There are the solid characters of Bickford's Slim, Meredith's George and Bohnen's Candy; Steele was at his best as the vain, pugnacious Curley; Veteran character actor, Noah Berry Jr. as Whit adds another element of sympathy. This is one of our American classic films.  We invented and developed this genre of art and this film must stand as one of its finest examples.
