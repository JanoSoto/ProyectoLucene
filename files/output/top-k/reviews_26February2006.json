It's as unconceivable now as it was then, but thinking about it, it sure would be swell. I'd say this movie is a classic if ever anyone asked me. A classic science fiction film with just the bare minimum of sci-fi elements that focuses more on human stories. Not just by making the space man a lot like us, but with a story about a man from space with a message for this world, who needs to understand the Earth's people and their actions before he can know how to best reach them. Would it be patriotic for us to say we love our planet? We know from living here that too many nations can't live without war, how could a foreigner, from another planet as well, appreciate this fact? Maybe there are things this movie doesn't show us or try to tell us about if this were to realistically happen. But it sure is able to cook up an interesting story to go with an ambitious idea.And right there you understand what the sci-fi genre is, a genre where the conflict inherent in making one is how does being human fit into a story about aliens? So if the alien is more like us, we're more likely to pay attention and buy into it. Science fiction, I'll admit, is not one of my favorite genres. It's nature is generally so advanced that it requires viewers to be on another wavelength to want to be taken to other worlds. But films like this really help us to see the benefits and virtues of this genre, to give a new sense to the quality of dramatization, and give us something completely unknown to try and relate to. Infiltrating our society draws out questions of character and makes us apply human characteristics to something that isn't human, not like we as humans are. And this creates the possibility for a greater understanding of things unknown.The greatest conflict in this story comes from, if this is a film where the main character wants to save Earth by giving us information, if the least we can't do is treat him with respect and trust him just a little, do we feel we deserve to be saved? If you take him at the actions he demonstrates, there's no reason not to trust him. But in this film, characters let hysteria and confusion get the better of them. Which is a very realistic and unfortunate way of portraying it. Though it shows you more of the strengths of the sci-fi genre, in a classic film such as this, you don't find the same sentiment as with war dramas or westerns that have the very same amount of humanity. Well, maybe it has the same idea at heart but the storytelling is focused on technical credibility, that it teaches viewers to be less wrapped up in emotionalism, which gets too sappy at times.So I really like the potential science fiction has to tell a different kind of story. But more often you see that what the genre is mostly comprised of are second-rate stories that are completely preoccupied with the fantasy of foreign things where you have to look for the qualities you have in common. You'll find sometimes these other programs beat you over the head with their message and leave nothing familiar to hold onto. This film tells it's story in a wonderful way that leaves for a lot of meaningful thought afterward. In the end, it all comes down to the question of war - is it necessary. We know why we use war to protect ourselves, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the idea that some societies can live without war and trust peace. That the idea of peace is never suppression of our instinct to protect ourselves. And that we can do just as much good by thinking than by showing aggression. We are humans after all, not animals.As for film quality, this is a movie that I'd like to walk around in. Washington D.C. seems like it used to be a wonderful place of culture and heritage, where you could walk around at night and really see something non-threatening. But then, wasn't all America like that at one point? The film's music score is very simple, and mostly understated, until several key moments where I recognize how many films were influenced by this film just in the music department. I viewed this movie for the first time only recently and this isn't the typical 'something strange is about us' score cues, but instead they suggest something very sinister is underneath the image of a spaceship and an indestructible robot.

I've seen four of his films now, and liked two of them ('Breaking the Waves' and 'Dogville'), really disliked one ('Dancer in the Dark') and of course, wasn't too chuffed with this film in 'The Idiots' either! Shot in a documentary jumpy style, the film starts off with Karen sitting alone at a restaurant where she encounters what she thinks is mental-challenged people being looked after by a carer. She ends up being dragged along with them, and soon realises that it is all an act! Intrigued, she meets the rest of the group led by Stoffer, who all embrace their inner idiot! A group that challenges social norms, and manage to convene in Stoffer's fanciful but barren mansion, which is owned by his Uncle. Stoffer is on a quest to make the group really prove themselves in their own environment in an anarchistic fashion through challenging society's view of them by acting as an idiot, and I guess, somehow finding true freedom! However, that didn't really work for me! The problem with this film- is while it does draw you in- you are not sure of what it is trying to say about social attitudes of the mentally challenged. And it is not a particularly funny film, nor does it really question attitudes towards the handicapped, other than displaying that people perceptions of the handicapped can be easily misled by a bunch of so-called social misfits. If anything, the idiot act feels a little indulgent of this group to go around being radical without any fear of repercussion. It could almost be construed as mocking, but I don't think that is Von Trier's intention. Regardless, I didn't like the group and in one scene, I'm rooting for the father to take his daughter away from these people. In another scene, Karen's reason for being at the restaurant is revealed when she finally confronts her family- but it is us; the audience, who are left wondering as to why Karen decided to play such a cruel game on her immediate family in that particular situation. What was Von Trier trying to say about grief? If he is saying that people need to let themselves go, and find bliss by doing this idiot act, then I seriously don't think it works! Part of life, is confronting your emotions, and sure, while it's okay to expose yourself as an emotionally fragile incoherent babbling mess when it comes to grief, there is a point where you have to confront that issue. Karen doesn't confront anything in the end; instead she deliberately displays raw idiocy to prove that she doesn't want to deal with reality! To give Stoffer some sort of satisfaction of proving worth in rebelling some social expectation doesn't ring true with me at all.'The Idiots', in my opinion, is one of Von Trier's lesser efforts, and while it's not truly horrible, I knew it didn't work when I just didn't like the majority of the characters or what they were trying to prove in a social context. And while areas of the film are made to look like a documentary, the actual content of the story was not one, so when a camera is blatantly in shot in one scene, it just proves to be sloppy film-making especially when it was never established that there was a film crew watching these social misfits! The orgy scene got over the sexual aspect of the group well, and sure, while the imagines were confronting, it didn't bother me as much as the overall story and characters- with the exception of Karen, and the guy who has the office job! Like I said, one of Von Trier's lesser efforts that I didn't hate completely.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"26 February 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is one of the better ones concerning alternate realities and materialism clashing with a real life that I've seen. The beginning is a bit like The Kid, but with less laughs and more depth. We see Jack Campbell (Cage) preparing to board a plane to London so he can get ahead in his career, and having his girlfriend Kate plead with him to stay in New York. He does board the plane, promising that even though her doubts tell her differently, they'll be together again in a year. In the next scene, 13 years later, Jack is shown single and at work, respected by all - though it's hard to say whether anyone except the girlfriends we see little of truly enjoy having him around. A co-worker tells him he should return the 1st call he's gotten from Kate in all this time; another claims his rich bachelor lifestyle isn't half-bad. On Christmas Eve he plans to have an emergency meeting the next day, not caring that it's a holiday. On his way home he meets a mysterious man, Cash, he makes a deal with over his lottery ticket, who then hints he'll give Jack something unexpected, even if he has everything as he claims. The next morning, Jack's life is turned upside-down when he awakens surrounded by Kate, his wife of 13 years, 2 kids, and a dog, in New Jersey. He flees to his New York apartment then his office, to discover that nobody in either knows him. He has a life in Suburbia with a middle-class family, friends he doesn't know, and a job at a tire-factory, all of which are sub-par to him. Instead of trying to act as though he knows what he's doing to fit in, he rebels against his new life, getting into fights with Kate over how he can't by the $2,400 suit he wants and hates his daily routine involving his average-paying job and family. As he resolves to make things work as long as he's stuck where he is, he gradually warms up to his family, if attempting to regain his old job and maybe a city apartment. But once he seems truly content in what he's got, Cash hints that his glimpse is almost over. Jack doesn't know how much time he has left, or how to keep what he's won, but he'll have to figure it out before he loses Kate a 2nd time. (SPOILERS) It was interesting in the end to see why he saw what life could have been when he ended up loving Kate, especially since the audience is reminded of something only mentioned in the beginning of the plot as he is shocked to see how Kate has changed because of his choices. (SPOILERS END) Nicholas Cage's acting was good, and the story was OK. It's too bad there wasn't a clearer picture of Jack's negative personality before his life changed. The only major thing he's shown doing thoughtlessly between his scenes of leaving then living with Kate is planning a meeting on a holiday, so I don't feel like we ever got to know what kind of person he originally was, even though he was a p**ck compared to the happy man Kate was used to him being. Jack and Kate could've been played by different people for when they were in college and when they were older, or at least used techniques to make them appear notably older, since Jack says Kate has grown to a woman even more beautiful than she was just having left college, though I can't see a difference. Cash is an angel, but I've never seen an angel pull a gun on the 200 lb white man who tries to intervene when he threatens the racist secretary - sounds more like a dervish to me. Also, I'm unclear why he decided Jack's glimpse was over when he did. I wondered whether Jack actually did learn his lesson by that time, because just when things seemed to go smoothly he'd blow it in a big way by having a fight in public, or suggesting to move the family to NYC to get his former job at Wall Street. 1 thing I wish they'd changed was the fact that Jack - in the alternative life - never attended college in London and ended up happily marrying.

The beginning is a bit like The Kid, but with less laughs and more depth. We see Jack Campbell (Cage) preparing to board a plane to London so he can get ahead in his career, and having his girlfriend Kate plead with him to stay in New York. He does board the plane, promising that even though her doubts tell her differently, they'll be together again in a year. In the next scene, 13 years later, Jack is shown single and at work, respected by all - though it's hard to say whether anyone except the girlfriends we see little of truly enjoy having him around. A co-worker tells him he should return the 1st call he's gotten from Kate in all this time; another claims his rich bachelor lifestyle isn't half-bad. On Christmas Eve he plans to have an emergency meeting the next day, not caring that it's a holiday. On his way home he meets a mysterious man, Cash, he makes a deal with over his lottery ticket, who then hints he'll give Jack something unexpected, even if he has everything as he claims. The next morning, Jack's life is turned upside-down when he awakens surrounded by Kate, his wife of 13 years, 2 kids, and a dog, in New Jersey. He flees to his New York apartment then his office, to discover that nobody in either knows him. He has a life in Suburbia with a middle-class family, friends he doesn't know, and a job at a tire-factory, all of which are sub-par to him. Instead of trying to act as though he knows what he's doing to fit in, he rebels against his new life, getting into fights with Kate over how he can't by the $2,400 suit he wants and hates his daily routine involving his average-paying job and family. As he resolves to make things work as long as he's stuck where he is, he gradually warms up to his family, if attempting to regain his old job and maybe a city apartment. But once he seems truly content in what he's got, Cash hints that his glimpse is almost over. Jack doesn't know how much time he has left, or how to keep what he's won, but he'll have to figure it out before he loses Kate a 2nd time. (SPOILERS) It was interesting in the end to see why he saw what life could have been when he ended up loving Kate, especially since the audience is reminded of something only mentioned in the beginning of the plot as he is shocked to see how Kate has changed because of his choices. (SPOILERS END) Nicholas Cage's acting was good, and the story was OK. It's too bad there wasn't a clearer picture of Jack's negative personality before his life changed. The only major thing he's shown doing thoughtlessly between his scenes of leaving then living with Kate is planning a meeting on a holiday, so I don't feel like we ever got to know what kind of person he originally was, even though he was a p**ck compared to the happy man Kate was used to him being. Jack and Kate could've been played by different people for when they were in college and when they were older, or at least used techniques to make them appear notably older, since Jack says Kate has grown to a woman even more beautiful than she was just having left college, though I can't see a difference. Cash is an angel, but I've never seen an angel pull a gun on the 200 lb white man who tries to intervene when he threatens the racist secretary - sounds more like a dervish to me. Also, I'm unclear why he decided Jack's glimpse was over when he did. I wondered whether Jack actually did learn his lesson by that time, because just when things seemed to go smoothly he'd blow it in a big way by having a fight in public, or suggesting to move the family to NYC to get his former job at Wall Street. 1 thing I wish they'd changed was the fact that Jack - in the alternative life - never attended college in London and ended up happily marrying. It would've seemed better to show him as having gone to college but not neglecting and breaking contact with Kate after he returned.

From the beginning through to the very end, the surreal imagery is all relative to Henry's mental condition. Now it doesn't have to get this specific, but you can rationalize it down to the fact that Henry has a mental tumour or growth that is causing his grip on reality to fracture and decay and is slowly killing him.Everywhere Henry goes, we see destruction. It's in all things, -the barren dug up earthen fields he walks, the house with a hole in the roof and cracked windows in which sits the charred man pulling the levers, to his apartment which gives new meaning to the decorative term earthy. Lynch uses the mounds of earth as a symbol for decay, much the way Dali does with ants in his paintings and short film Un Chien Andalou. A recurring image of Henry's interior decay is light bulbs dimming or burning out altogether when he's around...and we take this as a figurative illustration of the sort of erratic synaptic firings that are happening inside the ol' Eraserhead.Now there may or may not be a Mary X and a Family X, it could all be part of Henry's dissilusions, but their roles are less important than that of the baby...the fact that the Doctors aren't even sure if it is a baby about sums it up. Lynch couldn't have made it more ambiguous...it's not a proper baby, it's not a mutant...it's a growth. It's a manifestation of Henry's tumour or whatever disease it is that is eating him from the inside. Once Henry is left alone (it's all relative to who actually exists or not) with it, it suddenly starts decaying hideously. Henry's condition worsens. The only redemption he can find from his terrifying insanity is in a vision of a lady in his radiator inviting him to heaven through the radiator bars as if they were the pearly gates themself, telling him that there everything is fine. The woman herself is deformed as well, as Henry's projection of his sickness pervades everything around him. Yet the woman is his redemptor as she crushes the little wormly fetuses, helping soothe the spread of the tumour within. Henry's tumour manifests itself in a couple of other ways as well, one is the man in the house with the hole in the roof. The house is a cage, it's his skull, and it's got a severe deformity if it has a hole in the top, letting out all sanity. The man is charred, burned and twitchy, he's in decay, yet he's the one pulling the levers for Henry's brain. His tumour is a malignant, destructive thing, yet it is what is in control. It is what releases the worm like babies....it's sending itself elsewhere to create further decay. Henry's apartment is like himself...it's in decay, and the piles of earth do more than just remind of us that in a passive way...Henry's pet worm that he finds in his mail box tunnels through the earth gorging itself on it. That is what worms do, they eat their way through earth, and as a metaphor they are a physical representation of the destructive force of Henry's tumour, which is eating itself through his brain. Now I wish I could watch the movie again before I wrap this up, but I'll do my best with what my memory gives me. A couple of tangents...Henry fantasizes about his beautiful next door neighbour, but as she enters his world, he doesn't want her to see his growth...ie the baby, he doesn't want her to recognize his problem, but as they make love she can't help but notice, while all the while being sucked down into the void of Henry's psyche. The next thing that happens is that Henry's brain is being probed and drilled into, again highlighting the sensations and pains Henry must be receiving from this malignant growth. The next time Henry sees his neighbour, (in reality), he imagines she looks at him and sees only his decay, ie the head of the baby. This is when we come to the final destruction, the final decay, the final seizure or anneurysm.... The baby, the growth is only very precariously being held together by its bandages...as Henry's sanity is also dangling very precariously. Henry decides to stop fighting, and let the baby, let his sickness loose, to grow and overtake him, which it does, the insides of the baby swell and overflow and the baby's head increases in size 10 times, and the rest of the apartment self destructs, the power outlets spark, the lights go into epileptic fit, and the sound effects, which I have failed to mention but play an important psychological role all through, come to an excruciating head. Henry is left facing what it was we saw in the opening scene...what looked like a planet but what is actually his tumour, exploding towards him, and then it's all over and he's in the arms of the Lady from the Radiator, holding her, letting go of the pain and the trouble, and ready for his good thing. It's a very obtuse film, but very sad and beautiful and troubling all at once.

It's a very obtuse film, but very sad and beautiful and troubling all at once.

From the beginning through to the very end, the surreal imagery is all relative to Henry's mental condition. Now it doesn't have to get this specific, but you can rationalize it down to the fact that Henry has a mental tumour or growth that is causing his grip on reality to fracture and decay and is slowly killing him.Everywhere Henry goes, we see destruction. It's in all things, -the barren dug up earthen fields he walks, the house with a hole in the roof and cracked windows in which sits the charred man pulling the levers, to his apartment which gives new meaning to the decorative term earthy. Lynch uses the mounds of earth as a symbol for decay, much the way Dali does with ants in his paintings and short film Un Chien Andalou. A recurring image of Henry's interior decay is light bulbs dimming or burning out altogether when he's around...and we take this as a figurative illustration of the sort of erratic synaptic firings that are happening inside the ol' Eraserhead.Now there may or may not be a Mary X and a Family X, it could all be part of Henry's dissilusions, but their roles are less important than that of the baby...the fact that the Doctors aren't even sure if it is a baby about sums it up. Lynch couldn't have made it more ambiguous...it's not a proper baby, it's not a mutant...it's a growth. It's a manifestation of Henry's tumour or whatever disease it is that is eating him from the inside. Once Henry is left alone (it's all relative to who actually exists or not) with it, it suddenly starts decaying hideously. Henry's condition worsens. The only redemption he can find from his terrifying insanity is in a vision of a lady in his radiator inviting him to heaven through the radiator bars as if they were the pearly gates themself, telling him that there everything is fine. The woman herself is deformed as well, as Henry's projection of his sickness pervades everything around him. Yet the woman is his redemptor as she crushes the little wormly fetuses, helping soothe the spread of the tumour within. Henry's tumour manifests itself in a couple of other ways as well, one is the man in the house with the hole in the roof. The house is a cage, it's his skull, and it's got a severe deformity if it has a hole in the top, letting out all sanity. The man is charred, burned and twitchy, he's in decay, yet he's the one pulling the levers for Henry's brain. His tumour is a malignant, destructive thing, yet it is what is in control. It is what releases the worm like babies....it's sending itself elsewhere to create further decay. Henry's apartment is like himself...it's in decay, and the piles of earth do more than just remind of us that in a passive way...Henry's pet worm that he finds in his mail box tunnels through the earth gorging itself on it. That is what worms do, they eat their way through earth, and as a metaphor they are a physical representation of the destructive force of Henry's tumour, which is eating itself through his brain. Now I wish I could watch the movie again before I wrap this up, but I'll do my best with what my memory gives me. A couple of tangents...Henry fantasizes about his beautiful next door neighbour, but as she enters his world, he doesn't want her to see his growth...ie the baby, he doesn't want her to recognize his problem, but as they make love she can't help but notice, while all the while being sucked down into the void of Henry's psyche. The next thing that happens is that Henry's brain is being probed and drilled into, again highlighting the sensations and pains Henry must be receiving from this malignant growth. The next time Henry sees his neighbour, (in reality), he imagines she looks at him and sees only his decay, ie the head of the baby. This is when we come to the final destruction, the final decay, the final seizure or anneurysm.... The baby, the growth is only very precariously being held together by its bandages...as Henry's sanity is also dangling very precariously. Henry decides to stop fighting, and let the baby, let his sickness loose, to grow and overtake him, which it does, the insides of the baby swell and overflow and the baby's head increases in size 10 times, and the rest of the apartment self destructs, the power outlets spark, the lights go into epileptic fit, and the sound effects, which I have failed to mention but play an important psychological role all through, come to an excruciating head.

Soon after reaching a considerable amount of cash they decide to retire for a relaxing life on their own island with all the girls they want. But before this dream can become reality, they have to elude the cops led by the Sarge Stedanko who will stop at nothing to get their hands on them. All of this leads to many unplanned confrontations and actions that don't always workout for the best.The third film of the series is a really spaced-out stoner comedy (even more so then the first two flicks) from the comical duo Cheech and Chong. This one is more spaced-out because it throws in some surreal moments into fodder. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two outings, sure nothing will beat the memorable Up In Smoke, but I thought they slightly out did themselves here compared to their previous outing Next Movie and that could be attributed to Stacy Keach returning as Sarge Stedanko too. It was great to see that Sarge and his man are on the trail again. Though, I wish there was a bit more screen time for Keach.Everything about this one seems more silly and absurd, especially the scenes involving how anyone, or anything that smokes their strong weed will turn into a lizard. The whole concept is purely stoner humour! The film doesn't have much in a way of narrative, but more so comical episodes. But that's what you expect anyway. Something is always happening with Cheech and Chong getting in all sorts of mayhem and also meeting buoyant and irregular characters along the way. One of those characters involves a whacked out doctor and Paul Ruben's performance as Howie Hamburger Dude adds to the laughs too. The humour is required taste, definitely. It throws in many sexual and drug related gags. Sure, some of the jokes and gimmicks are crude, messy, coarse and fall flat, but the pair works off each other perfectly well with their fluid timing that you seem to let it all go. They alone can carry a film. It moves along rather quickly, which helps considerably too and there's a well-booted and spicy soundtrack to keep the energy levels high. Also I loved the ironic ending to their dream life. The script might be filled with low-brow lines, but still you got some clever wit and pointless rambles that are engaging enough, if moronic in vibe. It's not terribly perfect as a whole, but there are enough spirited and unpredictable sketches (like the nut-house and acid trip scene and those ones involving the incompetent police) and performances to overlook these failures. From what I hear and read, people usually rate this one as their second best feature and I tend to agree.Incredibly stupid, but I got a kick out of it nonetheless.

It's very easy to say that it suffers unfairly in comparison to the masterpiece that was Chinatown, & that one should take it on its own terms. Fair enough, but to anyone who hasn't seen Chinatown, the plot of The Two Jakes is completely & utterly incomprehensible, as opposed to extremely confusing to those who have. The film can only be understood as an addition to the story that began in Chinatown, & as such, can't avoid savage comparisons when placed alongside such a vastly superior film.It picks up the story of Jake Gittes ten years or so after the events of Chinatown. He finds himself embroiled in another seemingly straightforward infidelity case gone wrong, which leads to corruption & treachery in the highest corridors of power, this time over oil, rather than water. The twist, such as it is, involves Katherine Mulwray, the incestuous offspring of Evelyn Mulwray & her father, the vile Noah Cross, the heroine & villain from Chinatown.Sounds good, but this interesting idea is buried within a labyrinthine mess of a plot that jumps all over the place, with real estate scams, terminal diseases, petty hoodlums, earthquakes, gay bars, & most irritating of all, Jake's over-demanding fiancé.What buries the film is the fact that it doesn't ever really know what sort of film it actually wants to be. Chinatown was a twisted detective story that got darker & darker every minute, & left the viewer in a world where evil triumphed, nothing was certain, & no one could be trusted. The Two Jakes, however, is constantly veering between Jake's depressing musings over the past, screwball sex comedy with Madeleine Stowe's loopy widow, vague hints at conspiracy theories over who really runs Los Angeles, & a general air of cuteness around the character of Jake Gittes. Rather than being regarded by his peers as the disruptive & sleazy bedroom peeper that he is, he tends to be popular among just about everyone, cop & criminal alike. You can just hear them saying, Oh, that Jake, he's such a character, tsk, tsk...There's no terrifying villain to even approach the demon that John Huston created with Noah Cross - no real villain at all, come to think of it. Harvey Keitel's Jake Berman is the architect behind the whole scam, but ends up as some sort of hero\/victim who was acting with good intentions all along (despite shooting a man in cold blood), Mickey Nice (Ruben Blades) is more like a cartoon character waving weapons around & never using them, & Earl Rawley (Richard Farnsworth) is never exactly made out to be doing anything REALLY immoral or illegal, despite being the man who seems to be in charge of absolutely everything (i.e. the successor to Noah Cross).The great twist regarding the identity of Katherine Mulwray is the final nail in the coffin. Given Jake's obsession over the past, & over her in particular, it's not convincing at all that he wouldn't have recognised her immediately, even though he meets her 'alter-ego' several times before finally realising her true identity in one of the most poorly executed revelation scenes I've ever seen. You're left thinking, Um, so who's she really meant to be? Oh, that's right, Katherine Mulwray - but wouldn't he have known anyway, er, are you sure she's Katherine Mulwray, he didn't actually say, maybe she's someone else...For the psychotic Chinatown fan (& yes, I do count myself as one), there's plenty of cameos & references - Joe Mantell as Jake's offsider Walsh, Perry Lopez as a handicapped Lou Escobar, James Hong as Kahn, Evelyn Mulwray's butler, the snotty clerk in the hall of records makes an appearance, the same orange groves are used as a location (complete with the exact same 'No Trespassing' sign - it just happens to be lying around), old photos & newsclippings are used ad nauseam, despite the fact that they're stills from Chinatown that couldn't possibly have been taken as photos, & even Faye Dunaway pops up, in a brief voice-over.Plenty of things to remind the fans what it's a sequel to, & there are some wonderfully haunting echoes of the past that constantly torments Jake Gittes, but ultimately, The Two Jakes is just a big, disappointing mess. Loads of talent, no direction.Chinatown's writer & creator, Robert Towne, had originally envisioned a trilogy of J.J. Gittes films chronicling the history of Los Angeles, one set in the 1930's about water, one in the 1940's about oil, & another in the 1950's about the freeway system (apparently to be called 'Cloverleaf', after a type of freeway exit configuration). He, along with Robert Evans & Jack Nicholson, set up a company in the 1980's called TEN (Towne, Evans, Nicholson) to continue the endeavour, & Towne was slated to direct The Two Jakes, but he walked away long before the production actually started. The one reason that's most often cited was his objection to the original casting of producer Robert Evans as Jake Berman. Roman Polanski wasn't available to direct for obvious reasons.So, much like Jake Gittes' own thoughts, The Two Jakes is largely a collection of what if?s.

Here's my problem with this film. How did a young man in 1967 graduate from college and still remain so clueless about women? Ben acts like he has no idea what Mrs. Robinson is after. How can that be? To me, that is unbelievable. He's supposed to be this brilliant student, editor of the college newspaper, etc., and he stutters and stammers and acts like he's never been with a woman. It's just ridiculous. OK, so imagine that you can accept that part. Can you then accept that Ben would think that it's going to work out between Elaine and him? Especially since he's basically stalking her??? Oh, by the way, Elaine, I've been sleeping with your mom for months and I was hoping that now I could just switch over to you. HUH???? To me, the writing is the problem. He doesn't know people at all! This story made sense to me when I was 13. It really is written at the young teenager maturity level. Ben acts like he's about 16, instead of a college graduate.

No, instead, this is one you rent when your kids are away at grandma's or are at a sleepover. No sane parent would ever want their kids to see this sick film--especially with its frontal nudity and very, very adult subject matter. BUT, for adults with a high tolerance for the weird and bawdy, this is definitely a great film. However, others should be forewarned--it is truly an intentionally offensive and gross film.Yes, the film is deliberately trashy and shocking--featuring some of the sickest and funniest moments on film. Some examples? Well, when Divine's character runs away from home, she meets up with a guy (actually Devine but NOT in drag) and there is a bizarre sex scene where she (?) makes love to this guy (herself). And, to top it off for grossness and weirdness, the guy has huge brown skidmarks in his underwear! Also, there is copious amounts of child abuse, an aunt that is angry that her nephew the hairdresser is NOT gay and she sees this as very unnatural and sick, a Christmas scene that is one of the funniest and most irreverent in history, a hand being chopped off in retribution for acid being thrown into Devine's face, etc., etc. There's just so much over-the-top and funny grossness and awful behavior it's hard to keep track of it all!!The film appears to have been filmed on a budget of about $16.93--with over-the-top acting (if you can even call it acting), grainy cinematography and a script that seems, at times, like it was just made up as the film was rolling. And, together, these actually give the film some goofy charm and make it an interesting bit of social criticism--particularly regarding the cult of the celebrity and beauty.

I remember hearing that Kevin Bacon could possibly win an award for his outstanding performance in this film and that it was one of those films that will make any person with a heart break into tears. So, I submerged myself into this film one fateful night and watched a cliché Hollywood story with some very decent acting attempt to pull at my heartstrings and moments of nostalgia. I must admit, some of the rumors were correct. Bacon, as well as others did some phenomenal acting in this little film, but it was the story that ultimately disappointed me. I needed creativity, spontaneity, and excitement, alas, all I found was a simpleton story that could easily be found in any book dealing with dogs, pre-teens, summers, and social climbing while suffering from the classic Old Yeller syndrome.My Dog Skip doesn't hold back in using every classic Hollywood trick in the book when building the relationship between Willie and his dog, Skip. From the dog becoming a part of the community to eventually saving lives while teaching lessons, My Dog Skip does not promote originality at all. You could see the director talking to his crew about how other Hollywood hits like Turner & Hooch, Benji, or any of the Lassie series (either television or film) did it, and how he would not like to stray far from those devises. Would it have harmed director Jay Russell to be original, to take a stronger stance on developing the author Morris' words a bit stronger. This could have been a sensational film about friendship during the troubled years of America (i.e. the War and apparent racism in Mississippi), but instead Russell skirted around the issues and penetrated our hearts with a cute Muniz and a dog that was prepped for the camera. I apologize about my cynicism towards this feature, but I witnessed a lack of respect for both the patrons in the audience and the time it was attempting to portray. Even though this was developed as a children's film, I believe that more should have been explained about the circumstances surrounding Dink, more should have been developed about the bootleggers, and more needed to be developed about the scattered racism in town. Russell attempted to paint this beautiful image of rural Mississippi in 1942, but it felt that instead of using paint he used candy to gloss over some of the rougher edges. There is a point when we must realize that children can accept the facts of our nation, and that a boyhood friendship can still grow strong even during times that we are not proud of.What is friendship? According to My Dog Skip, friendship is helping an insecure someone reach a better point in their life. Friendship means always being the initiator, while ultimately realizing that this same person may never repay the favor. Do you not agree? These were the life lessons that I learned from this film. This is another hearty mistake that I believe hurt Jay Russell's feature. Here we have Muniz unable to cope with the social struggles of life without the help outgoing and energetic Skip. If it weren't for this dog, Willie Morris may never had broken free of those insecure shackles of life. Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end. Without giving anything away, the final note of this film is rather depressing, not due to the events that occur, but due to the actions of Morris. I nearly shed a tear because I felt horrible that this dog was so exhaustingly great to this boy, yet Skip is slowly forgotten.While I may not have great ideas to share about the plot of this film, I did think that the acting was a par above your typical dog befriends boy films. Muniz does his job well considering being hired mainly for the cute element. He kept my eyes on the film, but it was Kevin Bacon's role that kept me glued to the screen. Kevin Bacon continues to prove that no matter what part you give him, he will stand up and ensure that he gives his undivided attention to the character. He will take you away from seeing Kevin Bacon on screen, and force you to see the depths of his character. I believe an entire film could have been centered on Bacon's portrayal and possibly been better than what we witnessed here. Diane Lane again demonstrates her ability to play the every woman role. She needed to be handed more in this film to broaden her character. Not enough meat was given to her to chomp on, which hurts one of the pivotal scenes early in the film. Luke Wilson, well, he plays Luke Wilson. If you have seen any of his films, than you have seen his portrayal in this feature. He needed to reach deeper into the Born on the 4th of July moments to truly capture his character. Then, I cannot end without giving credit to Clint Howard. Clint Howard is an undiscovered gem in Hollywood. While his brother hogs the spotlight, Clint can honestly stand on his two feet in my book. It was his portrayal of Millard in My Dog Skip that strengthened this mediocre film.Overall, I didn't like this film. There was no creativity or originality of the story (which in my eyes was too candy-coated even for the youngest of viewers).

So, I submerged myself into this film one fateful night and watched a cliché Hollywood story with some very decent acting attempt to pull at my heartstrings and moments of nostalgia. I must admit, some of the rumors were correct. Bacon, as well as others did some phenomenal acting in this little film, but it was the story that ultimately disappointed me. I needed creativity, spontaneity, and excitement, alas, all I found was a simpleton story that could easily be found in any book dealing with dogs, pre-teens, summers, and social climbing while suffering from the classic Old Yeller syndrome.My Dog Skip doesn't hold back in using every classic Hollywood trick in the book when building the relationship between Willie and his dog, Skip. From the dog becoming a part of the community to eventually saving lives while teaching lessons, My Dog Skip does not promote originality at all. You could see the director talking to his crew about how other Hollywood hits like Turner & Hooch, Benji, or any of the Lassie series (either television or film) did it, and how he would not like to stray far from those devises. Would it have harmed director Jay Russell to be original, to take a stronger stance on developing the author Morris' words a bit stronger. This could have been a sensational film about friendship during the troubled years of America (i.e. the War and apparent racism in Mississippi), but instead Russell skirted around the issues and penetrated our hearts with a cute Muniz and a dog that was prepped for the camera. I apologize about my cynicism towards this feature, but I witnessed a lack of respect for both the patrons in the audience and the time it was attempting to portray. Even though this was developed as a children's film, I believe that more should have been explained about the circumstances surrounding Dink, more should have been developed about the bootleggers, and more needed to be developed about the scattered racism in town. Russell attempted to paint this beautiful image of rural Mississippi in 1942, but it felt that instead of using paint he used candy to gloss over some of the rougher edges. There is a point when we must realize that children can accept the facts of our nation, and that a boyhood friendship can still grow strong even during times that we are not proud of.What is friendship? According to My Dog Skip, friendship is helping an insecure someone reach a better point in their life. Friendship means always being the initiator, while ultimately realizing that this same person may never repay the favor. Do you not agree? These were the life lessons that I learned from this film. This is another hearty mistake that I believe hurt Jay Russell's feature. Here we have Muniz unable to cope with the social struggles of life without the help outgoing and energetic Skip. If it weren't for this dog, Willie Morris may never had broken free of those insecure shackles of life. Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end. Without giving anything away, the final note of this film is rather depressing, not due to the events that occur, but due to the actions of Morris. I nearly shed a tear because I felt horrible that this dog was so exhaustingly great to this boy, yet Skip is slowly forgotten.While I may not have great ideas to share about the plot of this film, I did think that the acting was a par above your typical dog befriends boy films. Muniz does his job well considering being hired mainly for the cute element. He kept my eyes on the film, but it was Kevin Bacon's role that kept me glued to the screen. Kevin Bacon continues to prove that no matter what part you give him, he will stand up and ensure that he gives his undivided attention to the character. He will take you away from seeing Kevin Bacon on screen, and force you to see the depths of his character. I believe an entire film could have been centered on Bacon's portrayal and possibly been better than what we witnessed here. Diane Lane again demonstrates her ability to play the every woman role. She needed to be handed more in this film to broaden her character. Not enough meat was given to her to chomp on, which hurts one of the pivotal scenes early in the film. Luke Wilson, well, he plays Luke Wilson. If you have seen any of his films, than you have seen his portrayal in this feature. He needed to reach deeper into the Born on the 4th of July moments to truly capture his character. Then, I cannot end without giving credit to Clint Howard. Clint Howard is an undiscovered gem in Hollywood. While his brother hogs the spotlight, Clint can honestly stand on his two feet in my book. It was his portrayal of Millard in My Dog Skip that strengthened this mediocre film.Overall, I didn't like this film. There was no creativity or originality of the story (which in my eyes was too candy-coated even for the youngest of viewers). This was one of those films where I believe the acting was directly in line for what it needed, but alas, the story was nowhere to be found.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Drama, Family, Sport"},{"date":"26 February 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" American Beauty is an enjoyable and thought-provoking film. However, when I looked closer (to borrow from the tag-line), what I found was somewhat lacking.Lester Burnham, is, of course, Humbert Learns. And this is the first failure of the film -- Ball seeks to invoke Nabokov's Lolita, but seems to me to have fundamentally misunderstood it. For while Angela Hayes might as well be Dolores Haze, Lester Burnham is not Humbert Humbert. For where is his Annabel Leigh? For Humbert, his attraction to nymphets has its origin early in his life and becomes his life-obsession. Lester Burnham's attraction to Angela Hayes seems to come out of nowhere -- we receive no indication that such attractions have been a long-standing difficulty for him, much less an obsession. (The film does not reveal to us any personal history relevant to this question.) And what is it that Humbert must learn? How he can avoid his descent into monstrousness? Can he redeem his memories of Annabel Leigh? Or must they torture him, and turn him inevitably to wickedness? But it is easy to learn to avoid the fall when you lack the tragic flaw. It is easy to learn the answer when the question is far simpler.Although Lester Burnham is definitely not Humbert Humbert -- he is a far less complex character -- he is in some ways Willy Loman. And yet, here again I feel the film fails, not this time in its premises but in its conclusion. As far as I can understand it, in this film, Willy Loman learns by smoking weed, screwing over his boss, quiting his job, buying a car, getting a slacker job, slobbering over teenage girls, and having his drug dealer teach him some vaguely pantheist philosophy. Is that what Willy Loman needs to learn? Is that what Willy Loman did wrong? Lester Burnham ends up dead anyway, but we are supposed to believe that his life was in the end a success rather than a failure? Is this success? Willy Loman, like Humbert Humbert, is a question -- the question of Humbert Humbert they fail to understand; the question of Willy Loman, they attempt to answer, but the answer to me at least seems unsatisfactory.
