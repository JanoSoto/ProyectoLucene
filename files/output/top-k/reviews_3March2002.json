I'm not even bothering with the Second one.Anyway, here I sit, bored out of my mind, and mad as hell at the snow on the ground, but I can't help that.  I have Panama Red, by the New Riders of the Purple Sage blaring through my speakers right now and it's setting the perfect mood to write a review on a movie that came out during the same era as that classic song.  Here goes nothing...Smokey and the Bandit, as many of you already know, was filmed during Burt's big hey-day, and to the film-maker's (and Burt's) surprise became a smash-hit when it was released only in the south, during the same year as Star Wars.  By the end of 1977, after the movie was released nation-wide, (depending on who you believe) only Star Wars had grossed more than the red-neck action\/comedy.  It was released among a whole slew of films of the same genre, but Smokey stood out due to it's talented cast, funny dialogue, and well-done action sequences.  Rumor also has it that this was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite movie.  I'm not sure but I wish he were still around to say so.The premise works WAY better than it should.  Here it is A bored pair of millionaires (father and son, in this case), the Enises, get wind of a hot-shot truck driver and think that it will make for some good laughs to challenge this guy (the bandit) to a little game of transporting 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana to Atlanta in 28 hours.  Oh, and that's round-trip I might add.  What's in it for the Bandit? Well, $80,000 if he wins.  That's what.  Just what he needs for buying a new rig.  Now, having a little more than his share of self-confidence (and ego), the Bandit accepts and even dupes the two into putting up more money so he can buy a sports car to block for the big-rig.  So the Bandit rounds up his good buddy Snowman to drive the truck while he leads the way in a brand spankin-new Trans Am. Let the games begin...Getting to Texarkana and picking up the beer is a breeze.  It's on the trip back that the Bandit picks up a runaway bride (Sally Field) and catches the attention of yet another father and son duo.  This time, it's THE SHERRIFF BUFORD T. JUSTICE and his bumbling idiot son junior.  This is where things shift from light-hearted fare, to laugh-out-loud hilarious. What I think makes it so funny is Jackie Gleason's portryal of a red-neck sherrif that is so cock-sure of himself that he doesn't even realize that he's a legend only in his own mind.  Did I mention that he treats his son (a grown man who appears to be in his 30s) like a seven year old kid? As a result, junior ACTS just like a seven year-old kid with a mental deficiancy.   Also, I might want to mention that the previously mentioned runaway bride was the bride-to-be of the unfortunate junior.  So, with that said, Sheriff Justice has not one, but two reasons for apprehending the Bandit.That is the set-up right there.  And it works.  This type of movie was common back in the day, but this one stands above them all.  It's a little bit glossier and you can tell that the budget was a little higher than say, that of The Great Smokey Roadblock, which I found horrible.  All of the characters (even the sheriff) are likeable and the music is fun and upbeat. I can honestly say that this movie never wears out it's welcome because I've seen it more than any other movie.  Having Jerry Reed as the Snowman is just fun times.  The guy is truly a great actor and you'll wonder why he never did more movies.  He's got a fun screen prescence (Just check out the Waterboy) and his delivery of the lines is dead-on.If you haven't seen this movie (have you been living under a rock?) please do.

WAHOO!!!  ","genre":"Action, Comedy"},{"date":"3 March 2002","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  At times it seems that it is better to watch a bad movie, only because it makes you appreciate the good ones more. Sometimes when you watch so many great films, like I've been doing lately, it becomes a little tiresome, and you really don't care about that particular movie, you just know it was great, but there is a numbness about it.I have never been insistent on watching Westerns, mainly because I live in a desert and I really don't care to have it thrown back into my face for a couple of hours that it is dry and hot and miserable. That doesn't mean that I don't like Westerns period, but I'm just not into them. But seriously, who doesn't like a classic like The Wild Bunch? My dad, being an old Western movie fan, recommended Mackenna's Gold to me as my favorite movie with Gregory Peck. I generally don't care for his advice, but I thought to myself, what the heck, why not? So I watched this supposedly good film with an open mind, and I got a trashy piece of celluloid. When I read the opening credits, at first, the cast seems to me like thy might make this movie pretty good. It came out in 1969, and some rather great films came out that year like Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and Z.The plot revolves around Mackenna, played by Peck, who is a sheriff from the town of Hadleyburg, which we only hear about. Mackenna has seen a map that supposedly leads to gold, from an old Apache legend. Mackenna burns the map, and is found by an old rival and outlaw Colorado, played by Sharif. We spend the next two hours while Sharif forces Peck to lead him and two other Apaches to the gold, since he is the only person who saw what was on the map. Along the journey, we encounter Apaches, who are trying to protect the gold, and US soldiers who are trying to get a piece of the money too. I was not surprised, because when you've seen one cowboys vs. Indians movie, you've seen them all.The dialogues exchanged between Peck and Sharif throughout are so idiotic and laughable, that it made me shake my head. If it had been any worse, I'm sure I would've had a concussion. It made Peck look bad, and I thought this guy was a great actor (who saw To Kill a Mockingbird?). He almost literally sleepwalks through his performance. I figured that since he did have the good guy role, that I should've at least been interested in what happened to him; I could have cared less. Omar Sharif-oh jeez-wasn't this guy in Doctor Zhivago? His acting was unbelievably over-the-top and laughable (including that dumb spanish accent), that even a jerk like Val Kilmer could've wet himself. It feels as if the writers didn't care about what they were doing, and just wrote one draft of the script. The actors are stuck working with corny dialogue, yet Sharif was the only one trying to distract from that, but it made him look and sound terrible.The direction was just as bad. At one point in the film (or should I say movie since it doesn't deserve to be called a film), Peck, Sharif, and three other people on horses are escaping from a large group of Apache Indians. They get onto this big raft with their horses and escape down a river. They come upon some rough rapids, and right before they hit them, they take their horses and jump off into the water. As they did this, it looks like the filmmakers somehow speeded up the film, and it looked terribly choppy, in dire need of some good editing, and convincing special effects tricks. This same kind of editing job is seen two more times in the movie. Now, if you compare this to The Wild Bunch, that came out the same year, you'll see that Peckinpah's editing is so much smoother, and the action happening, for example the end battle scene, what we see actually makes sense. It seems in Mackenna's Gold, at the last minute, they tried to do the same thing, but with skewed results. If they had just cut out the entire first hour and fifty-eight minutes, and just kept the ending, it would've made a pretty good short. The action finale is one of those `roll-your-eyes' kind of things, but the editing wasn't half-bad, although the special effects showing the mountains crumbling are some of the shoddiest I have ever seen.

Sometimes when you watch so many great films, like I've been doing lately, it becomes a little tiresome, and you really don't care about that particular movie, you just know it was great, but there is a numbness about it.I have never been insistent on watching Westerns, mainly because I live in a desert and I really don't care to have it thrown back into my face for a couple of hours that it is dry and hot and miserable. That doesn't mean that I don't like Westerns period, but I'm just not into them. But seriously, who doesn't like a classic like The Wild Bunch? My dad, being an old Western movie fan, recommended Mackenna's Gold to me as my favorite movie with Gregory Peck. I generally don't care for his advice, but I thought to myself, what the heck, why not? So I watched this supposedly good film with an open mind, and I got a trashy piece of celluloid. When I read the opening credits, at first, the cast seems to me like thy might make this movie pretty good. It came out in 1969, and some rather great films came out that year like Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and Z.The plot revolves around Mackenna, played by Peck, who is a sheriff from the town of Hadleyburg, which we only hear about. Mackenna has seen a map that supposedly leads to gold, from an old Apache legend. Mackenna burns the map, and is found by an old rival and outlaw Colorado, played by Sharif. We spend the next two hours while Sharif forces Peck to lead him and two other Apaches to the gold, since he is the only person who saw what was on the map. Along the journey, we encounter Apaches, who are trying to protect the gold, and US soldiers who are trying to get a piece of the money too. I was not surprised, because when you've seen one cowboys vs. Indians movie, you've seen them all.The dialogues exchanged between Peck and Sharif throughout are so idiotic and laughable, that it made me shake my head. If it had been any worse, I'm sure I would've had a concussion. It made Peck look bad, and I thought this guy was a great actor (who saw To Kill a Mockingbird?). He almost literally sleepwalks through his performance. I figured that since he did have the good guy role, that I should've at least been interested in what happened to him; I could have cared less. Omar Sharif-oh jeez-wasn't this guy in Doctor Zhivago? His acting was unbelievably over-the-top and laughable (including that dumb spanish accent), that even a jerk like Val Kilmer could've wet himself. It feels as if the writers didn't care about what they were doing, and just wrote one draft of the script. The actors are stuck working with corny dialogue, yet Sharif was the only one trying to distract from that, but it made him look and sound terrible.The direction was just as bad. At one point in the film (or should I say movie since it doesn't deserve to be called a film), Peck, Sharif, and three other people on horses are escaping from a large group of Apache Indians. They get onto this big raft with their horses and escape down a river. They come upon some rough rapids, and right before they hit them, they take their horses and jump off into the water. As they did this, it looks like the filmmakers somehow speeded up the film, and it looked terribly choppy, in dire need of some good editing, and convincing special effects tricks. This same kind of editing job is seen two more times in the movie. Now, if you compare this to The Wild Bunch, that came out the same year, you'll see that Peckinpah's editing is so much smoother, and the action happening, for example the end battle scene, what we see actually makes sense. It seems in Mackenna's Gold, at the last minute, they tried to do the same thing, but with skewed results. If they had just cut out the entire first hour and fifty-eight minutes, and just kept the ending, it would've made a pretty good short. The action finale is one of those `roll-your-eyes' kind of things, but the editing wasn't half-bad, although the special effects showing the mountains crumbling are some of the shoddiest I have ever seen.

Watching Allen's mind spill on to film is tends to be very offbeat, and a bit odd, but that is what makes watching his films such a great experience. There is no real plot to be found here, but as the title vaguely suggests, they are just a collection of small stories. Some of them, told through the point of view of lower class people in the eyes of younger Woody Allen, Joe, played by a tiny little Seth Green.He goes on about how the songs played on the radio remind him of a particular event. It is strange how memories work like that, rising from that archive inside your brain that seems to be lost, but in a single second, a certain song or picture might dust off that memory, opening a doorway into the past. The film seems to stress how songs from those radio days bring back such memories. Not all of the stories revolve around Allen's younger self, but through various characters. Like radio voice, Sally(Mia Farrow), and his Aunt Bee(Diane Wiest), who just can't seem to find her true love. Reminds me of the way A Christmas Story is told, but on a larger scale, not sticking to one story. I guess a series of vignettes to convey the memories fit Allen's purpose here. I truly don't think he has one particular story that he can remember in full, but these scattered memories pulled together to create the whole works well.Allen has a great eye for period detail, and I felt like I was taken into that time and place. The dialogue is sharp and funny; he sure doesn't fail us in that category. I guess such a film as this could go on forever. Stories like these could continue, and he shows us that the absence of a proper resolution is a better choice. He could end it anywhere, and the way he chooses is indisputable.Those listeners didn't have television, and Allen illustrates here how much the radio effected these people's lives. If some tragic event were to happen to someone they didn't even know, they would be effected emotionally. Young Joe's obsession with the masked avenger is humorous to the audience because we find that he really is just a short and bald man played by Wallace Shawn.

Probably not, but it is the essence of memories that keep them alive. But, as Allen points out, `as with each passing year, their voices do seem to grow dimmer.'He has created a marvelous tribute to the era of Radio Days, showing me a time that is rarely recalled, unless I'm threatened to get my TV taken away, then the guilt-trip line is, `all they had back then were radio's, they didn't have TV.' Allen, however, brings those memories back in sort of a dreamlike fashion. There is no story to be told here, just memories told to us in the way he remembers them (such as setting the place and time up with a rainy street in Rockwell, New York; it looked most beautiful when it was like that, he says).

In the beginning, all this machine does is blow things into little pieces. But thanks to a little fate, the machine starts operating the way its supposed to, and four kids find themselves in the path of the machine.

Honey, I Shrunk the Kids has alot of special effects. Some of the effects look good, other effects look really fake. If this movie had been made today the effects would have been more elaborate. But who cares if the effects look fake when the movie is so much fun. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is lots of fun. The performances are terrific. Rick Moranis is perfect as the nutty professor who has to find his two kids (as well as the two kids from next door) and fix up this mess. Marcia Strassman shines as Moranis's wife, and Matt Frewer is hysterical as Moranis's next door neighbor who's big plans for a weekend fishing trip go down the drain when his kids suddenly disappear (of course his two kids are two of the four kids that are shrunk).

This was exactly the same day the first Batman movie opened. While Batman exploded to an opening weekend record (at that time), Honey, I Shrunk the Kids opened in the #2 spot and it held its ground very well through the rest of the summer finishing as the surprise sleeper hit of the summer of 1989. And what a surprise this film turned out to be. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a very funny, wildly entertaining comedy\/fantasy about a nutty professor who's working on a device to make objects shrink. In the beginning, all this machine does is blow things into little pieces. But thanks to a little fate, the machine starts operating the way its supposed to, and four kids find themselves in the path of the machine. They are shrunk to the tiniest of sizes, end up being swept into garbage, and have to find their way back home by going through the backyard which to their point of view looks like a large jungle. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids has alot of special effects. Some of the effects look good, other effects look really fake. If this movie had been made today the effects would have been more elaborate. But who cares if the effects look fake when the movie is so much fun. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is lots of fun. The performances are terrific. Rick Moranis is perfect as the nutty professor who has to find his two kids (as well as the two kids from next door) and fix up this mess. Marcia Strassman shines as Moranis's wife, and Matt Frewer is hysterical as Moranis's next door neighbor who's big plans for a weekend fishing trip go down the drain when his kids suddenly disappear (of course his two kids are two of the four kids that are shrunk). The four young actors playing the shrunk kids are all terrific, and the movie really belongs to them. Those kids are played by Amy O'Neill, Thomas Brown, Jared Rushton, and Robert Oliveri. Haven't seen much of them today, but they're all excellent in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. This is a Disney film that I could watch over and over again because it's so much fun. And I'm not a child. Kids should like it too. I don't think it's too scary even though there are a couple of scenes with the kids in perilous situations. Nevertheless, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a movie for the whole family. Skip the two sequels Honey, I Blew Up the Kid and Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves as well as the TV series of the same name. They don't come close to matching this one for all out fun.***1\/2 (out of four)  ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"3 March 2002","score":"","review":"  As I am writing this review I am listening to the dazed and confused soundtrack being a great big fan of the movie that I am, I went out and bought both editions.

War movies have been quite a fad lately, though I hope the reason for them is deeper than the word fad suggests. Still, the movies have for the most part been about World War II, a war in which there was at least a good sense of duty and of good versus evil. (The one major exception in recent war movies is Black Hawk Down, but even in Desert Storm, there was a fair sense of purpose.)Vietnam, however, was a whole different ballgame. The war was poorly justified, patriotism was all but extinct, and the only thing possibly more horrid than the bloody massacres of battle was the treatment of soldiers upon their return. In terms of cultural effect, Vietnam was quite the antithesis of those other wars.We Were Soldiers does justice in describing this war, particularly in its earlier stages, better than any other film I've seen. It makes no bones about the fact that the entire situation was ill-advised, yet instead of pointing fingers in blame, it points out the heroes, the few whose characters shone through despite the situations, and it remembers the fallen. Though it takes place early in the war, before the counterculture and its so-called peace movements had been well-established, it still touches on the societal mistreatments that America was soon to bestow upon the very men it called to duty.I really don't feel I can describe the film in enough detail. Perhaps its ambiguity in areas are what make it such a strong testimony of our most ambiguous war. Still, I think I can safely say that the film contains many of the best points of other recent war movies. It tells a true story with as much reverence as Black Hawk Down. It relates the men at war to the people they left at home as well... rather, far better than Pearl Harbor (and without any Michael-Bay Camp, either). Perhaps most significantly, it prods at the questions of war itself as good as Saving Private Ryan.As for the cast... Mel continues to amaze with the same vein of acting as in Braveheart and The Patriot. He plays a man of many parts, and does so well... There's not a moment at home that you forget he's a soldier, nor a moment in the field you forget he's a husband and father. C'mon, it's Mel at his best, need I say more?Greg Kinnear again proves what an underrated actor he is. (I'm still mad that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his role in As Good As It Gets, though he was better IMO than Helen Hunt and ol' Jack, both of whom won trophies for their parts.) The guy could be an actor with body language alone. He can give a million lines of speech by a single stare, and when he does speak, he makes it count. I only wish he'd had more screen time.Chris Klein is never the greatest of actor, but one that can hold his own, and this is probably his best role yet.Sam Elliot played the tough guy, the man of few words who only takes orders from men who give good ones. It was a bit too much of the stereotypical old, grizzled soldier IMO, but he pulls it off great. Reminded me so much of Lee Marvin (a la Dirty Dozen) in this flick. (BTW, Hulk fans, I am now looking quite forward to his portrayal as Thunderbolt Ross.)The rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, the wives, the other soldiers, were also well cast. There were no holes in the performances. Really, the film was seamless as a whole. If there are any major points for complaint, I didn't catch them.

The dialogues couldn't be better. Also the story was wonderful. I didn't know a lot about the figure of John Nash, but that wasn't very bad. That man is very great genious but he suffers from sichzophrenia. And that makes his life too a hell. The subject of psychological illnesses were good, but I think it is not correct that Alicia (the wife of Nash) didn't bring him to a psychological centrum. First she did it, but when he had to return because his illness became worse she followed Nash and that was totaly wrong. This film can give a wrong interpretation of a psychological centrum and it will influence people that such a centrum is a hard place to be and that it is better that you don't go to such a place. But this is totally wrong!!!!! It isn't a bad place... it aren't terrible places. They help you there! The scenes of John Nash, who is trilling of electrian shocks is totally misplaced! For the rest is this movie very good, only the typical Hollywood scenes. Especially the handkerchief scene is a little bit too much of it.The movie gives a wonderful image of the life of John Nash!The actors1. Russell Crowe JOHN NASH  he gives the performance of a real sichzofreen. I guess that they have such a life. He is nominated for the Oscars and he may win, but Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge) may win for me, but he isn't nominated. So I can agree that Russell will win.2. Jennifer Connely ALICIA NASH  she isn't much on screen this time, but when she is there you can't give any bad comments on her.3. Ed Harris WILLIAM PARCHER he is a real actor and this was the perfect role for him.4. Christhopher Plummer DR. ROSEN an old legend, he is always nice to see in such films, I hope he will continue to make such films and not such films as 'Dragenhunt' or something like that.5.

The dialogues couldn't be better. Also the story was wonderful. I didn't know a lot about the figure of John Nash, but that wasn't very bad. That man is very great genious but he suffers from sichzophrenia. And that makes his life too a hell. The subject of psychological illnesses were good, but I think it is not correct that Alicia (the wife of Nash) didn't bring him to a psychological centrum. First she did it, but when he had to return because his illness became worse she followed Nash and that was totaly wrong. This film can give a wrong interpretation of a psychological centrum and it will influence people that such a centrum is a hard place to be and that it is better that you don't go to such a place. But this is totally wrong!!!!! It isn't a bad place... it aren't terrible places. They help you there! The scenes of John Nash, who is trilling of electrian shocks is totally misplaced! For the rest is this movie very good, only the typical Hollywood scenes. Especially the handkerchief scene is a little bit too much of it.The movie gives a wonderful image of the life of John Nash!The actors1. Russell Crowe JOHN NASH  he gives the performance of a real sichzofreen. I guess that they have such a life. He is nominated for the Oscars and he may win, but Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge) may win for me, but he isn't nominated. So I can agree that Russell will win.2. Jennifer Connely ALICIA NASH  she isn't much on screen this time, but when she is there you can't give any bad comments on her.3. Ed Harris WILLIAM PARCHER he is a real actor and this was the perfect role for him.4. Christhopher Plummer DR.

Most of the unfavorable comments arise from the perspective of Ryan Rose, played by Denis O'Hare, the neighbor or outsider of the Hollywood business and the audience of the movie.  The entire movie shot in digital video (DV), is like this loud barking dog, represented by critics acclaiming the movie as one of the years' best, and the audience just can't stand it.  They want to just kill the dog (see How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog) and go on to the next movie.Well, if you feel that way, so be it.I think this movie is a real gem.  If you're looking for a real plot--you won't find much here, except some surprising character revelations.  This film is shot in a dogma-magnolia-tenebaums style where the moments and emotions fuel the movie rather than a specific character transformation from point A to point B.  It's a comedy, where the actors' and directors' intent is to poke fun in their own lives and world.  If you're looking for sympathetic characters with no flaws--you won't find any here, except maybe the neighbors who are the outsiders.  Then again, these characters were not made to be sympathetic, but for you to take them as who they are.The film starts out very slowly, like the preparation of any party.  While the leads do not take any part in the actual preparation, a glimpse into their lives are seen.  The camera and directing moves around like a voyeur into different rooms and conversations when the partygoers arrive.  The directing style is very close and personal, intimate and claustrophobic at times, but raw and real.Real and as real as it can ever get in Hollywood.  For example, two couples are played by actors who are married to each other in real life (Kline and Cates, the Golds; and Hickey and Posey, the Adams).  Kline and Cates' real life children also participate in some very, very adorable scenes which may lend to their future acting careers.  The photographs on the wall were taken by Jennifer Beals, who has photographed the couple a lot in preproduction--though you can't see them up close.  Otis is Jennifer Jason Leigh's dog outside of this film and in this film.  Even the yoga instructor and props are part of Leigh's life.  Cumming and Leigh wrote the scripts with these SPECIFIC actors and actresses in mind, thus giving them mannerisms they actually do on film and also, not on camera.  There is this portion in the film where the guests came up with toasts, celebrating Cumming and Leigh's anniversary.  However, these toasts were not scripted but improvised or written by the characters themselves to surprise Cumming and Leigh.  The toasts themselves were very creative and yet within their characters.  Cumming even signs his own book in real life, called Tommy's Toy, for a neighbor.  Cumming claims in the DVD that he will finish that book sometime this year.Yeah, whatever.Sure, all this seems very self-important, indulgent, stereotypical Hollywood glamour, but I haven't seen any authentic casting like this in any other movie.  Even though, they are all actors playing actors who are close friends in real life, it is an effortless and authentic kind of feeling you get when you watch them interact with each other. If you didn't know that beforehand, then maybe you won't be able to tell the difference.I enjoyed this one scene when they were playing Charades.  I guess actors take this game seriously, because in a way, it is their craft, so they pick these obscure titles from novels, songs, or whatever for the other team to guess.  But in one scene, Jerry Adams, the business man plays by Hickey, goes absolutely ballistic and overly competitive.  Like a whining critic cursing at a bad movie for cheating him out of his money and time, he hilariously verbally jumps on his own teammates for not going on to the next syllable or not getting the point.  Don't you know someone like that when you are playing this friendly board game or party game?*Possible spoiler ahead.There is no real plot, but two points the movie attempts to get across. First of all, everyone is flawed--the dialogue scathingly points out the scratches on every character.  These flaws are mainly demonstrated in the Hollywood perspective of deciding to have a child.  Second, the choice of having a career versus having a child and family is the centerpiece of this film.  The issue is brought out in the interactions between Jane Adams (child but still working and stressed), Cates (two children, not working and happy?) and Leigh (working, but going downhill, but her husband wants a child).   This depends on the maturity of the characters--(i.e. whether or not they are still thinking they are 10 years younger than they really are) and the flaw in Leigh's character not willing to give up her career and her desire to play some role she can no longer play.  Though it also seems Leigh's character's personal life (in the film) is affecting her acting career in her latest project, it is an introspective look on the choices we make in our personal lives in terms of drawing a line between the workplace and home.  If the line becomes blurry or it doesn't exist in this glass house they live in, then, how would you cope with it if you were in their shoes?  Are their shoes any different form ours?The ending seems somewhat forced and abrupt, but overall, for a 19 day shoot, I guess they did the best with what they had.  7\/10.

Most of the unfavorable comments arise from the perspective of Ryan Rose, played by Denis O'Hare, the neighbor or outsider of the Hollywood business and the audience of the movie.  The entire movie shot in digital video (DV), is like this loud barking dog, represented by critics acclaiming the movie as one of the years' best, and the audience just can't stand it.  They want to just kill the dog (see How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog) and go on to the next movie.Well, if you feel that way, so be it.I think this movie is a real gem.  If you're looking for a real plot--you won't find much here, except some surprising character revelations.  This film is shot in a dogma-magnolia-tenebaums style where the moments and emotions fuel the movie rather than a specific character transformation from point A to point B.  It's a comedy, where the actors' and directors' intent is to poke fun in their own lives and world.  If you're looking for sympathetic characters with no flaws--you won't find any here, except maybe the neighbors who are the outsiders.  Then again, these characters were not made to be sympathetic, but for you to take them as who they are.The film starts out very slowly, like the preparation of any party.  While the leads do not take any part in the actual preparation, a glimpse into their lives are seen.  The camera and directing moves around like a voyeur into different rooms and conversations when the partygoers arrive.  The directing style is very close and personal, intimate and claustrophobic at times, but raw and real.Real and as real as it can ever get in Hollywood.  For example, two couples are played by actors who are married to each other in real life (Kline and Cates, the Golds; and Hickey and Posey, the Adams).  Kline and Cates' real life children also participate in some very, very adorable scenes which may lend to their future acting careers.  The photographs on the wall were taken by Jennifer Beals, who has photographed the couple a lot in preproduction--though you can't see them up close.  Otis is Jennifer Jason Leigh's dog outside of this film and in this film.  Even the yoga instructor and props are part of Leigh's life.  Cumming and Leigh wrote the scripts with these SPECIFIC actors and actresses in mind, thus giving them mannerisms they actually do on film and also, not on camera.  There is this portion in the film where the guests came up with toasts, celebrating Cumming and Leigh's anniversary.  However, these toasts were not scripted but improvised or written by the characters themselves to surprise Cumming and Leigh.  The toasts themselves were very creative and yet within their characters.  Cumming even signs his own book in real life, called Tommy's Toy, for a neighbor.  Cumming claims in the DVD that he will finish that book sometime this year.Yeah, whatever.Sure, all this seems very self-important, indulgent, stereotypical Hollywood glamour, but I haven't seen any authentic casting like this in any other movie.  Even though, they are all actors playing actors who are close friends in real life, it is an effortless and authentic kind of feeling you get when you watch them interact with each other. If you didn't know that beforehand, then maybe you won't be able to tell the difference.I enjoyed this one scene when they were playing Charades.  I guess actors take this game seriously, because in a way, it is their craft, so they pick these obscure titles from novels, songs, or whatever for the other team to guess.  But in one scene, Jerry Adams, the business man plays by Hickey, goes absolutely ballistic and overly competitive.  Like a whining critic cursing at a bad movie for cheating him out of his money and time, he hilariously verbally jumps on his own teammates for not going on to the next syllable or not getting the point.  Don't you know someone like that when you are playing this friendly board game or party game?*Possible spoiler ahead.There is no real plot, but two points the movie attempts to get across. First of all, everyone is flawed--the dialogue scathingly points out the scratches on every character.  These flaws are mainly demonstrated in the Hollywood perspective of deciding to have a child.  Second, the choice of having a career versus having a child and family is the centerpiece of this film.  The issue is brought out in the interactions between Jane Adams (child but still working and stressed), Cates (two children, not working and happy?) and Leigh (working, but going downhill, but her husband wants a child).   This depends on the maturity of the characters--(i.e. whether or not they are still thinking they are 10 years younger than they really are) and the flaw in Leigh's character not willing to give up her career and her desire to play some role she can no longer play.  Though it also seems Leigh's character's personal life (in the film) is affecting her acting career in her latest project, it is an introspective look on the choices we make in our personal lives in terms of drawing a line between the workplace and home.  If the line becomes blurry or it doesn't exist in this glass house they live in, then, how would you cope with it if you were in their shoes?

Namely, BRAVEHEART and PAYBACK were both fantastic movies that I watch over and over again.  But WE WERE SOLDIERS does not live up to the previous titles. The movie was talked up to be extremely graphic with explicit images of war violence.  And, in fact, it was pretty graphic.  But after seeing SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, this movie was mild by comparison.  Also, I did not find myself caring about any of the characters as much as I did the characters in RYAN and BLACK HAWK.  The movie does not seem to flow very well.  The first act of the movie is very long and teeters on the edge of boredom.  It mostly follows the 400 soldiers that would be the first to encounter the North Vietnamese army as they prepare and train.  The audience learns about the characters and the beautiful wives and adoring children they will inevitably leave behind.  By the way, the woman that plays Chris Klein's wife is SUPER HOT!  If I had a woman like that, there is no power on earth that would pry me away from her.  Not the Viet Nam War or anything else.  Anyway, that first act dragged on a little too long.  Also, the characters are presented as just a little too saint-like.  Half way through I was thinking, Is Mel Gibson a soldier or a preacher?  The movie practically beats you over the head with a cross as you watch.  I kept expecting to see Mel Gibson walking on water. By the way, combat helmets have chin straps for a reason.  Why do the soldiers in this movie only wear their chin straps while they are in formation on a parade field, when not much is really happening?  But then, when all hell breaks loose on the battle field, nobody puts their chin straps on.  I thought that was distracting.   Now for my biggest problem with this movie.  CAUTION!  SPOILER ALERT!OK, fair warning.  The wives wait back at home to hear word of their husbands.  The telegrams informing them of the dead are delivered by the ominous yellow cab.  So, when the yellow cab shows up, the wives all freak out and the audience is nervous to find out who has now died.  Each time that yellow cab shows up, somebody else has died.  And we are worried about Mel Gibson's wife and family, of course.  Then, at the end of the movie, the yellow cab makes one last stop...at Mel Gibson's house where his wife and kids are waiting.  The door bell rings, and the wife looks out the window.  There is that awful yellow cab.  She can hardly open the door, and emotionally orders the children to bed.  Then, bravely opens the door...and surprise!  Its Mel Gibson!  He survived!  And felt that it was necessary to RING THE DOORBELL TO HIS OWN HOUSE!  WHERE HIS FAMILY LIVED!  Maybe it was just a little JOKE he was playing on his EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT WIFE!!!???  A cruel little joke.  I am sure his character was thinking, Haha, it will be hilarious to trick my wife in to thinking I have been horribly killed in battle!  Then, SURPRISE!  No, I don't think that was what his character had in mind.  I think the director of the movie took a CHEAP SHOT at the AUDIENCE!  And this was a low point for the movie, to be sure.  No one in my family ever rings the doorbell when they are coming home, they just WALK IN because THAT IS WHERE WE ALL LIVE.  I don't ring the doorbell to my own HOUSE!I don't want to be disrespectful to this movie or to the cause of the Viet Nam War, or to the men who died there.  My father fought hard in Viet Nam, and saw a lot of action.  As I grew up, he spared no detail in telling me about the various horrors he witnessed.  And because of this, I have a better understanding of what Viet Nam was about and therefore I have a higher standard by which I judge movies dealing with the subject.  In my opinion, I have never seen a movie about Viet Nam that depicted the events accurately.  No, not even PLATOON was accurate.  When directors make movies about the Viet Nam war and they glorify or romanticize the events, then they do an injustice to heroes who fought there.  WE WERE SOLDIERS tries to do justice to the events, but it falls short somewhere.  However, it is not without a certain element of entertainment.  And I really enjoyed Sam Niel's character.  He was great as an old war dog, bitter and strong. Unfortunately, I have to rate this movie fairly low for the reasons listed above.
