It's not often I find films poetic, but in this case, I found Jesus' Son to be quite lyrical. It's not necessarily a cautionary tale, it doesn't spit any messages in your face. It's merely a depiction of a certain period in someone's life, a picture so beautifully and non-judgmentally rendered, it reminded me of well-written poetry in texture and feeling. The pacing was slow, but not belabored. More American films should be like this. It's been said before, but the States could stand to take a lesson from European cinema.Crudup's character, F$@#head, is multi-layered, avoiding being pigeonholed as just a junkie, or an over-sensitive individual, or a young man just down on his luck. We feel bad for him, but we don't pity him; he's slow-witted, but smart enough to pull himself out of the trenches of self-abuse when maturity calls upon him to do so. He's an everyman, albeit with a golden heart, guilty of nothing more than some bad choices in tough circumstances. Who can't identify with that? I've been trailing his career since I first saw him in 'Inventing the Abbotts,' and while he hasn't produced a body of work comparable to other character actors I so admire, I look forward to seeing his career ascend. Ditto Samantha Morton. I loved her performance in 'Sweet and Lowdown,' thought it was quite affecting, and her role here, as Michelle, is no less astonishing in its emotional complexity; she's got a big but fragile heart, finally collapsing under the weight of her bond to F#$@head. My sense is that her career will resemble Emily Watson's, both in diversity of characters and, if there's any justice, longevity.If you're looking for a stylistic, gracefully acted drama about self-renewal, this one's for you.

Robert De Niro is brilliant as the mentally disturbed, yet universally lonely Travis Bickle.  Jodie Foster is extraordinary as the 12 year old prostitute Iris, vengeful towards her parents.  Martin Scorsese did a ground breaking movie, not for the violence, but for it's powerful impact as a humanist story in a way of speaking.  Upon first inspection of this film, I really didn't know what to think about it. I thought it was unnecessarily violent towards the end, and thus thought the murder in the film was ludicrous and pointless.  But I watched it again the next day, and discovered something about not only Travis, but New York.  New York was a disturbing place back in the 70's according to Bickle. Even though New York is cleaned up modern day, the story and characters are not in anyway outdated.The picture quality of the televisions, the fashions and background of New York City may feel outdated, but they are materialistic things, not the actual core of this story.  Loneliness is their just as much as it is today, and the feeling of this film are universal.  The film doesn't senselessly indulge into a preposterous plot or negates from its character, and that gives us time to associate with Travis.  We all feel like him at one time or another, and our central protagonist is a chilling yet touching person to watch.  He thinks about assassinating a Presidential candidate 24\/7.  He is an avid porn theater attendant so much it drives the only person that may care for him away, and he feels the way we all ultimately feel Alone.This film isn't old or ever will be, because things truly never change. Their will always be Travis Bickles in the world, because a room is always filled with a hopeless guy in the corner hoping to be noticed and appreciated.  Travis's attempt to save Iris is somewhat of a contradiction; since no one will save him, he must save someone who at one time asks to be saved but doesn't fancy the idea afterwards. Even though Travis is around people while driving the cab during the night shift doesn't mean he is appreciated or noticed.  He feels like Iris screaming for help, yet no one seems to answer.  Travis knows that he has to answer because it is only fair to another person that you would treat them as you would like to be treated.Robert De Niro became one of my favorite actors after I saw this film, only acknowledging him as a respected actor to that point.  But I finally realized that I identified with his character and felt whole again knowing I wasn't the only one who felt alone.

I tried to answer that question for myself and found myself heaving with relief that reviewing films isn't my day-time job. I LOVE films, I'm passionate about film (like Homer Simpson once said Mother. Teacher. Secret Lover). I love to sit down and watch a film of my choice at my convenience, and I guess there's not much fun in being made to go see a particular movie (one you didn't necessarily wanted to see) at a particular moment and having to write a witty article about it. (You're not in the mood?! Well, you better GET IN THE MOOD!, to quote a certain outraged George 'Can't stand ya').I don't (pretend to) have something interesting to say about every movie I see. Let me rephrase that not every movie I see makes me want to get things off my chest, or out of my system. And that basically answers the initial question the movies I write about are mostly the ones I disliked, or am disappointed in. I live in a society were we like to complain a lot and I, too, am better in prosecuting than in defending or praising. Usually, I have no trouble putting in words what I think is wrong with a particular movie (it's pretty easy to sum up the sometimes obvious mistakes and\/or flaws), but ask me about some of my favorite films (Blue Velvet; Dawn Of The Dead; Pulp Fiction; A Clockwork Orange; Ordinary people; Koyaanisqatsi; Rear Window) and I'll probably go mute on you. And that's the reason why I didn't (try to) review any of the above titles on this site. These films make me very happy. I just like them a lot. Everything just seems right. They keep me glued to the screen. They succeed in sucking me in. I never analyzed any of them to discover why I liked them (let alone analyzing them to discover IF I liked them). I just did. (Maybe another reason I don't review my favorite movies is that everything that can be said about those films, as most of them are considered to be 'important masterpieces', has already been said... and said and said and said -- although  this is not necessarily true because I reviewed the fairly unknown Shivers, which I hated, a few weeks ago on this site and was bemused to find out that I had used almost the exact same words as someone else on the same page). And I almost hate the question 'why' in these matters, as every answer is almost always followed immediately by yet another 'why'? (remember that brief scene with the late John Candy and Macaulay Culkin in Uncle Buck?).I'm not saying that there isn't an explanation for why I liked a certain film (or book, or painting, or piece of music), but if there is, I certainly won't spend my (insert coughing-sound here) Valuable Time on trying to find it. I don't want to sound pretentious (especially not for a merely 23 year old guy who has still a lot to learn about the English language, amongst other things), but I guess I'm not only speaking for myself here, but also for a lot of artists (filmmakers, writers, painters) out there.While I was writing the above paragraphs, I suddenly thought back of something I saw on television a couple of weeks ago. I can't remember the exacts, but a woman had just shown beautiful drawings and paintings which she had used to express her feelings. The interviewer said `Yes, very nice. But now we need you to put it in words'. O, my God, I thought when the guy said it. That must be one of the fundamental flaws of humanity the necessity to put it in words. We need to be able to put things in words. We need it in writing. Feelings, sensations, sentiments are way too abstract. We need to capture it somehow, put it in a jar and label it. Thereby limiting the meaning of something. The spoken word and the written word -- those are boundaries we created ourselves. Created by ourselves because we need to be in control of things.I just read Pauline Kael's review of Kubrick's The Shining, and I found myself repeatedly exclaiming the words `Yes!', and `of course'. When I read Kael's review of The Shining, I had the idea that I was now actually able to explain (and put in words -- sigh!) why I think The Evil Dead, also one of my personal favorites, is so much better than many other horror-films. In my review of The Shining, I stated that I thought the visual beauty distracted the viewer from the fact that its psychological premise was going nowhere. I agree with Ms. Kael that the visual beauty also distracts from the horror. Kubrick probably used the novel of Stephen King as an alibi to explore some visual ideas (A hotel with long corridors! Did somebody say 'Steadicam?'). Wasn't it Orson Welles who considered the camera as the greatest toy? Well, I guess Kubrick thought the same thing. The only difference was that Kubrick took the game just too damn serious. Visual Perfection was the goal. Not emotions. Not fun. With, more often than not, rather contrived, hollow results. The same thing goes for John carpenter's Halloween. His movie is technically pretty much flawless. Neat. No rawness. Even his killer doesn't display any raunchiness. He walks neatly. Wears a spotless white mask and blue overall. Kills neatly, too. In the sleeves of the soundtrack, Carpenter reminisces that, during editing, the executive of production said to him 'It ain't scary. Save it with the music'. It's true. The movie is just too darn neat too really scare us, and heavily relies on its successful, but also a bit too neat and one-tone, music score. I'm not saying that every horror-film should be as raw as `The Blair Witch Project' (I can't wait for Myrick and Sanchez to shoot a mockumentary that takes place at sea!), but I guess that, when things get too polished, it'll kill the horror.`The Evil Dead' works on several levels whereas most horror- movies only try to aim for one of the following goals 1. Over the top comedy (like `Braindead') 2. Physical violence; blood and guts. 3. Psychological suspense. This movie has it all. But, even more, it even succeeds in maintaining a raw look (logically, as the movie was made on a shoestring budget) and still manages to be a minor triumph of cinematography, editing, and direction.Raimi takes your basic campfire story (a bunch of teens in a remote cabin fall victim to an ancient demonic force) and uses it to show off a bunch of great visual ideas. Using visual ideas to scare you. He picks the best and scariest places to put the camera. Who said art had to be in great taste? If there's one genre you can show off in (on a low budget), it must be horror.There are numerous unforgettable moments in this feature. The arrival of the youngsters at the cabin, for example, which is, in my book, one of the most stunning scenes in the history of cinema. The camera follows the oldsmobile as it slowly drives through the woody area. The teens get out, but only one of them actually starts heading toward the cabin. There's no dialogue and the only sound we hear is the rhythmic banging of a rocking-chair against the wall of the cabin. A great scene, preparing us for things to come. Breathtakingly photographed and smartly edited. Or what about the scene were Cheryl wanders off in the woods by herself at night, winding up being raped by a possessed tree? Or the scene filmed from a the point of view of a possessed zombie who is locked up in the basement and snarling and laughing watches its potential victims (`For God's sake, what happened to her eyes!?'). And, of course, that wonderful closing shot in which we move rapidly through the woods, work our way through a barricaded cabin and attack a surprised Bruce Campbell, the sole survivor who was just about to count his blessings.This is the only film in Raimi's oeuvre where he uses beautiful images and great editing to support a story, instead of just occasionally throwing in a weird angle. I'm not a big fan of his subsequent work (including `Evil Dead 2' and `Army Of Darkness').Geez, I really went off on a tear, now didn't I?

(You're not in the mood?! Well, you better GET IN THE MOOD!, to quote a certain outraged George 'Can't stand ya').I don't (pretend to) have something interesting to say about every movie I see. Let me rephrase that not every movie I see makes me want to get things off my chest, or out of my system. And that basically answers the initial question the movies I write about are mostly the ones I disliked, or am disappointed in. I live in a society were we like to complain a lot and I, too, am better in prosecuting than in defending or praising. Usually, I have no trouble putting in words what I think is wrong with a particular movie (it's pretty easy to sum up the sometimes obvious mistakes and\/or flaws), but ask me about some of my favorite films (Blue Velvet; Dawn Of The Dead; Pulp Fiction; A Clockwork Orange; Ordinary people; Koyaanisqatsi; Rear Window) and I'll probably go mute on you. And that's the reason why I didn't (try to) review any of the above titles on this site. These films make me very happy. I just like them a lot. Everything just seems right. They keep me glued to the screen. They succeed in sucking me in. I never analyzed any of them to discover why I liked them (let alone analyzing them to discover IF I liked them). I just did. (Maybe another reason I don't review my favorite movies is that everything that can be said about those films, as most of them are considered to be 'important masterpieces', has already been said... and said and said and said -- although  this is not necessarily true because I reviewed the fairly unknown Shivers, which I hated, a few weeks ago on this site and was bemused to find out that I had used almost the exact same words as someone else on the same page). And I almost hate the question 'why' in these matters, as every answer is almost always followed immediately by yet another 'why'? (remember that brief scene with the late John Candy and Macaulay Culkin in Uncle Buck?).I'm not saying that there isn't an explanation for why I liked a certain film (or book, or painting, or piece of music), but if there is, I certainly won't spend my (insert coughing-sound here) Valuable Time on trying to find it. I don't want to sound pretentious (especially not for a merely 23 year old guy who has still a lot to learn about the English language, amongst other things), but I guess I'm not only speaking for myself here, but also for a lot of artists (filmmakers, writers, painters) out there.While I was writing the above paragraphs, I suddenly thought back of something I saw on television a couple of weeks ago. I can't remember the exacts, but a woman had just shown beautiful drawings and paintings which she had used to express her feelings. The interviewer said `Yes, very nice. But now we need you to put it in words'. O, my God, I thought when the guy said it. That must be one of the fundamental flaws of humanity the necessity to put it in words. We need to be able to put things in words. We need it in writing. Feelings, sensations, sentiments are way too abstract. We need to capture it somehow, put it in a jar and label it. Thereby limiting the meaning of something. The spoken word and the written word -- those are boundaries we created ourselves. Created by ourselves because we need to be in control of things.I just read Pauline Kael's review of Kubrick's The Shining, and I found myself repeatedly exclaiming the words `Yes!', and `of course'. When I read Kael's review of The Shining, I had the idea that I was now actually able to explain (and put in words -- sigh!) why I think The Evil Dead, also one of my personal favorites, is so much better than many other horror-films. In my review of The Shining, I stated that I thought the visual beauty distracted the viewer from the fact that its psychological premise was going nowhere. I agree with Ms. Kael that the visual beauty also distracts from the horror. Kubrick probably used the novel of Stephen King as an alibi to explore some visual ideas (A hotel with long corridors! Did somebody say 'Steadicam?'). Wasn't it Orson Welles who considered the camera as the greatest toy? Well, I guess Kubrick thought the same thing. The only difference was that Kubrick took the game just too damn serious. Visual Perfection was the goal. Not emotions. Not fun. With, more often than not, rather contrived, hollow results. The same thing goes for John carpenter's Halloween. His movie is technically pretty much flawless. Neat. No rawness. Even his killer doesn't display any raunchiness. He walks neatly. Wears a spotless white mask and blue overall. Kills neatly, too. In the sleeves of the soundtrack, Carpenter reminisces that, during editing, the executive of production said to him 'It ain't scary. Save it with the music'. It's true. The movie is just too darn neat too really scare us, and heavily relies on its successful, but also a bit too neat and one-tone, music score. I'm not saying that every horror-film should be as raw as `The Blair Witch Project' (I can't wait for Myrick and Sanchez to shoot a mockumentary that takes place at sea!), but I guess that, when things get too polished, it'll kill the horror.`The Evil Dead' works on several levels whereas most horror- movies only try to aim for one of the following goals 1. Over the top comedy (like `Braindead') 2. Physical violence; blood and guts. 3. Psychological suspense. This movie has it all. But, even more, it even succeeds in maintaining a raw look (logically, as the movie was made on a shoestring budget) and still manages to be a minor triumph of cinematography, editing, and direction.Raimi takes your basic campfire story (a bunch of teens in a remote cabin fall victim to an ancient demonic force) and uses it to show off a bunch of great visual ideas. Using visual ideas to scare you. He picks the best and scariest places to put the camera. Who said art had to be in great taste? If there's one genre you can show off in (on a low budget), it must be horror.There are numerous unforgettable moments in this feature. The arrival of the youngsters at the cabin, for example, which is, in my book, one of the most stunning scenes in the history of cinema. The camera follows the oldsmobile as it slowly drives through the woody area. The teens get out, but only one of them actually starts heading toward the cabin. There's no dialogue and the only sound we hear is the rhythmic banging of a rocking-chair against the wall of the cabin. A great scene, preparing us for things to come. Breathtakingly photographed and smartly edited. Or what about the scene were Cheryl wanders off in the woods by herself at night, winding up being raped by a possessed tree? Or the scene filmed from a the point of view of a possessed zombie who is locked up in the basement and snarling and laughing watches its potential victims (`For God's sake, what happened to her eyes!?'). And, of course, that wonderful closing shot in which we move rapidly through the woods, work our way through a barricaded cabin and attack a surprised Bruce Campbell, the sole survivor who was just about to count his blessings.This is the only film in Raimi's oeuvre where he uses beautiful images and great editing to support a story, instead of just occasionally throwing in a weird angle. I'm not a big fan of his subsequent work (including `Evil Dead 2' and `Army Of Darkness').Geez, I really went off on a tear, now didn't I? Didn't I use the sentence Getting things out of my system about a hundred or so lines ago? Well, I guess I can go to bed now.**** out of **** ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"28 September 2000","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  You want the truth about this film?It's a two-and-a-half-hour nature documentary, with occasional references to WWII thrown in.

This is horror at its purest, and this makes it the best horror film ever (By the way, the THX DVD is awesome).

Quite a change in persona, eh? The whole 'Master\/Slave' thing there made me wince, ala bad visions of the Village people showing up-but ya hadda love the bug eating stuff.Rubber bats on strings, a stake pounding, some eerie 'off camera' sightings of wolves, Drac nails 4 or so gals on the way through the film-seems to me that this had it all. And ya have to admit, the ghoulish Trio harem of his was kinda risque for 1931 too.So what do I give it?
