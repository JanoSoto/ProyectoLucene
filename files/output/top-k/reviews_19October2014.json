And I usually don't watch something when they nag me to death about it. Which meant I watched it with a negative mindset right from the start. That being said, I have nothing but respect for a movie with a fair amount of ingenuity and thought provoking ideas being crafted back in 1968. I was amazed and intrigued by a lot of the scenes as to how they did it - with what looked like just camera work. However, because of that negative mindset(as before mentioned), some scenes became horridly outdrawn ranging from sometimes five to fifteen minutes of random assaults of either complete silence or static\/strange sounds. Instead of enjoying the obvious attempt to create suspense and atmosphere, it instead became a strenuous struggle on my poor head-phoned-ears. (SPOILERS) As for the plot and story, ,aybe I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the message between the first part of the lunar monolith, the journey to Jupiter and the second monolith. I felt like that part had little to do with the actual message of the film and instead was just that - a space journey(Well DUH. It IS the theme of the movie). I've seen a lot of films where the depths are endless and the message or meaning can be interpreted in many different ways(Ex The Fountain, Mulholland Drive). I still struggle here. It just feels empty to be honest. The idea that an alien or artificial intelligence provided knowledge to prehistoric man or in fact engineered our species isn't thought provoking for me. It is something that I have discussed and theorized with friends and as an atheist it is an idea that is common nowadays. Of course, this film has provided many authors, film directors -artists- with the inspiration for this idea - so credit where its due. But, for me, it is a piece of cake that I've already had too much of and does not impress upon me anymore. I am very much for films where the director lets the audience think for themselves and agree on the fact that most entertainment nowadays hold your hand or spoon feed you the content throughout the whole experience. It might be nice to feel like a child again, but we have to grow up sometime and movies like these shakes that groggy dreamlike state Hollywood has forced upon our minds. I celebrate every movie, game, book that allow us to use our brain - but to me, as an atheist, this movie is not thought provoking at all(for the beginning of humanity's existence that is).The controversial ending(As someone said) is interesting and freshly new, as for my film experiences. I liked the idea that he perhaps was traveling in time, a wormhole, and experiencing his death\/aging by seeing the future. Every time something happened, a sound, a movement, the most obvious his glass of liquor, he saw himself in a vision older and when the other vision saw him it became him. On the other hand, the camera's point of view could have been from the monolith the entire time in that time-capsule, watching him grow old or making him grow old to be reborn a new. I have a sneaking suspicion that the monoliths had something to do with HAL9000's malfunctions and odd behavior - or am I wrong on that point? There are probably some points I have forgotten and I'll have to watch it again sometime in a more neutral state.

The whole basis of the plot is a political, social, and convoluted network of double-crossings and connections. The six guests from the board game are all a part of the other's predicament of blackmail by Mr. Boddy, even though none of them have met each other until they all arrive at the mansion. But you don't need to keep track of all of the background blackmailing information to enjoy it because it's a comedy, not a drama or spy movie where you're trying to predict the ending the whole way through. The guests are primarily connected by other characters, some that are not in the film, and some that are servants of the mansion (Yvette has a prior connection to about three of the guests). I would say that it's better just to let the characters develop in your mind during their brief revelations of why they are blackmailed instead of trying to remember all of it. Besides, Wadsworth the butler, played by Tim Curry, runs through the entire night in five minutes at the end and makes it all clear-ish to the audience. In some ways, Wadsworth is the main character because he sort of runs the show and knows what's going on. He is rather proper and butlery, but has a distinct personality. The other six guests have equal parts to Wadsworth, but are set apart from him because they are all rather in the dark on several points and are all suspected of murdering Mr. Boddy. They all have well developed personalities and individualized styles of humor. Mrs. White is cold and very defensive in a way that kind of says I'm guilty but you can't really prove it. She makes a number of snide remarks about people, particularly towards Yvette and her late husbands, but she doesn't always deliver them in ways that automatically tell you that it's supposed to be funny. This is true of many of the funny lines of this movie, though certainly not all. There are several quick remarks that don't seem like they will produce any kind of humor, but when you take it together and figure out what they mean, you find the funny side of it. Mr. Green is an incredibly clumsy and nervous man who seems to make a fool of himself in some way whatever he is doing, and the humor he creates is a bit more blatant. Mrs. Peacock is a rather shrill older lady that looks like she jumped in a pile of leaves before coming to the dinner. She tries to create the impression that she is innocent by being excessively flaky and flustered. Professor Plum is rather excitable and wide-eyed throughout and pleads innocence by acting rather frightened the whole time. Miss Scarlet is the one that seems most guilty because she creates the impression that she is proud of what she is being blackmailed for and almost looks for approval from the others. Lastly, Colonel Mustard is the accusatory one of the bunch, trying to point the blame away from himself and often embarrassing himself as he does. Each guest murders one person, and these six victims play small parts, some smaller than others depending on how quickly they get killed off. The two most developed of these, apart from Wadsworth, are Yvette and the cop. Yvette assists in the investigation of the murders and is very scared of both the guests that she is associated with and the situation they are caught in. She adds to the slight air of suspense that floats through the proceedings. The cop makes the whole group nervous with his suspicion, and sort of embodies the audience's feelings with his confused reactions to the guests' antics. All of the character are well cast and well played by their actors. The three endings are kind of fun, and they collectively embody the three ways one would expect the film to end. The first one has the crook that you don't expect (Mrs. Peacock) as the murderer. The second has the one you would expect (Miss Scarlet). The third and real ending has the impartial one where everyone did it and Wadsworth is the truly guilty one. I found the whole thing to be fairly interesting and very funny throughout. Whether you like this movie or not really depends on whether you like the jokes and how much you care about how the blackmail plot plays into it. There isn't much to criticize with the execution, though I guess you could poke holes in the way that the victims are incorporated. Regardless of whether you enjoy it or not, it is well done, and there aren't many examples supporting the theory that it isn't. So I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy. For me, it's hard to say what other movies it is similar to, so I don't know what kind of cinematic tastes it appeals to, though it has a lot of memorable quotes if you like that. I rather think they could make a reboot of this with Benedict Cumberpatch as Wadsworth, Anne Hathaway as Miss Scarlet, Jim Carrey as Professor Plum, Uma Thurman as Mrs. White, Bruce Willis as Colonel Mustard, Will Ferrel as Mr. Green, Una Stubbs as Mrs. Peacock, Luke Evans as Mr. Boddy, and Emma Stone as Yvette. But, somehow, I feel like it might not have the same elements that people like about the original. Overall Rating 8.6\/10.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"19 October 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film, Taxi Driver, provides viewers with an excellent example of a character study film done right. Through violence, sorrow, and disgust, the film is a one of a kind directed perfectly by Scorsese. Taxi Driver follows the life of a lonely and frustrated New York City cab driver, Travis Bickle, played wonderfully by Robert De Niro. Travis is a Vietnam vet now suffering from insomnia, and he takes a job as a night shift cabbie. As one would expect of late nights in New York, Travis is a witness of all types of sleazy late-night activities, such as prostitution and drug dealing. Travis begins to become increasingly frustrated with all the immorality and the direction that the world is headed in. His strong opinions and personality pushes most people away from him; he develops a short, and failed love interest with woman named Betsy, who works for the campaign of want to be senatorial candidate Charles Palantine. Travis becomes concerned with a twelve- year-old prostitute, played by Jodie Foster, and is determined to save her from her pimp. After all the desperation and frustration, a sense of self-righteousness develops within Travis, and he takes a course of action to try and make the world fit his mold of what an ideal society should be. Scorsese helps to show that a lavishly decorated movie, starring an exuberant cast of characters is not needed to create a widely acclaimed masterpiece. Scorsese's film featured a bleak and disturbing main character, and does not leave the viewer feeling happy upon finishing it, yet you cannot help but recognize its greatness. Taxi Driver shares many similarities, but it also has many differences compared to Scorsese's other works. Like many of his other films, the cinematography is arguably the strongest element of the film, and the awkward dialogue paired with Travis' internal dialogue creates a very unique film. The film also incorporates crime into it like many other great Scorsese films such as Goodfellas, and The Departed. Unlike the mentioned films however, Taxi Driver does not have any sort of mafia theme in it like a lot of Scorsese's previous works. In terms of characters as well, the characters in Taxi Driver are for the most part outwardly mundane and un-exciting. This film does not have wild and outspoken characters such as Joe Pesci or Mark Wahlberg from Scorsese's works, and instead focuses on the internal problems of Travis and the rotting of New York City. The social commentary of this film hits on two different areas. The first, is the psychological impact of the Vietnam War. While the film never makes clear that the reasons for Travis' insomnia and other psychological problems are related to the war, it does not seem too far fetched to assume that the war definitely had some sort of impact. The commentary tries to show the lasting pain and psychological problems the war had on its participants, and is most likely a subtle criticism of the whole war in general. In regards to the war however, the film's clear and main point is to show the negative and lasting affects of the experience on the returning soldiers. The other realm of the film's commentary has to do with New York City, at the time the movie was made. Taxi Driver shows the deteriorating state of New York and in some ways is a plea for help. Travis is obviously not the figure Scorsese wants to help fix the city, but he uses Travis to show the desperation that is needed for help. This film deserves a 9 out of 10 stars. The development of Robert De Niro's character from a frustrated cab driver to a wannabe martyr is acted out perfectly. The film does an amazing job of stirring up emotions despite the lack of overt emotion within the film. The viewer feels the pain and sorrow that Travis somehow manages to hide, and becomes frustrated when Travis does not realize the disgust of his actions. The greatness of the movie is in its ability to keep the viewer engaged when quite often, while at times the film seems stagnant The film's strongest element is quite possibly the cinematography. From the close up scenes, the moments of silence, and the score, Taxi Driver has the total package when it comes to cinematography. As many have said before, Taxi Driver features one of the best-shot scenes of all time. The scene where Travis is trying to make contact with Betsy on the phone and the camera pans over to a barren hallway is the one in reference. This scene is so great because you feel Travis' emotions, and when the camera goes over to the hallway it's as if Scorsese is telling the viewer to not look at the pain Travis is feeling. The barren hallway is also a metaphor for Travis' life as it is simply empty and lonely. The arc of Travis is another interesting element of the film. Travis' arc from a low life cabbie toward redemption does not feel forced and is developed in a way that feels realistic. By about the halfway point, Travis' desire to take matters into his own hands, in regards to cleaning up the city, begins to take action, and in his mind will lead to him becoming a hero. The third stand out element of the film is the conflict, and the films ability to create great external and internal conflict. The external conflict of the film has to do with the state of city which is filled with prostitution, violence, and other forms of crime. The internal conflict is Travis' own personal battle with his psychological problems and his loneliness caused by his off- putting personality. Taxi Driver does not feature any sort of explosions, quirky dialogue, or have a Hollywood ending, but is a film that can still be appreciated today. Taxi Driver holds up to the test of time thirty-eight years later.

Taxi Driver follows the life of a lonely and frustrated New York City cab driver, Travis Bickle, played wonderfully by Robert De Niro. Travis is a Vietnam vet now suffering from insomnia, and he takes a job as a night shift cabbie. As one would expect of late nights in New York, Travis is a witness of all types of sleazy late-night activities, such as prostitution and drug dealing. Travis begins to become increasingly frustrated with all the immorality and the direction that the world is headed in. His strong opinions and personality pushes most people away from him; he develops a short, and failed love interest with woman named Betsy, who works for the campaign of want to be senatorial candidate Charles Palantine. Travis becomes concerned with a twelve- year-old prostitute, played by Jodie Foster, and is determined to save her from her pimp. After all the desperation and frustration, a sense of self-righteousness develops within Travis, and he takes a course of action to try and make the world fit his mold of what an ideal society should be. Scorsese helps to show that a lavishly decorated movie, starring an exuberant cast of characters is not needed to create a widely acclaimed masterpiece. Scorsese's film featured a bleak and disturbing main character, and does not leave the viewer feeling happy upon finishing it, yet you cannot help but recognize its greatness. Taxi Driver shares many similarities, but it also has many differences compared to Scorsese's other works. Like many of his other films, the cinematography is arguably the strongest element of the film, and the awkward dialogue paired with Travis' internal dialogue creates a very unique film. The film also incorporates crime into it like many other great Scorsese films such as Goodfellas, and The Departed. Unlike the mentioned films however, Taxi Driver does not have any sort of mafia theme in it like a lot of Scorsese's previous works. In terms of characters as well, the characters in Taxi Driver are for the most part outwardly mundane and un-exciting. This film does not have wild and outspoken characters such as Joe Pesci or Mark Wahlberg from Scorsese's works, and instead focuses on the internal problems of Travis and the rotting of New York City. The social commentary of this film hits on two different areas. The first, is the psychological impact of the Vietnam War. While the film never makes clear that the reasons for Travis' insomnia and other psychological problems are related to the war, it does not seem too far fetched to assume that the war definitely had some sort of impact. The commentary tries to show the lasting pain and psychological problems the war had on its participants, and is most likely a subtle criticism of the whole war in general. In regards to the war however, the film's clear and main point is to show the negative and lasting affects of the experience on the returning soldiers. The other realm of the film's commentary has to do with New York City, at the time the movie was made. Taxi Driver shows the deteriorating state of New York and in some ways is a plea for help. Travis is obviously not the figure Scorsese wants to help fix the city, but he uses Travis to show the desperation that is needed for help. This film deserves a 9 out of 10 stars. The development of Robert De Niro's character from a frustrated cab driver to a wannabe martyr is acted out perfectly. The film does an amazing job of stirring up emotions despite the lack of overt emotion within the film. The viewer feels the pain and sorrow that Travis somehow manages to hide, and becomes frustrated when Travis does not realize the disgust of his actions. The greatness of the movie is in its ability to keep the viewer engaged when quite often, while at times the film seems stagnant The film's strongest element is quite possibly the cinematography. From the close up scenes, the moments of silence, and the score, Taxi Driver has the total package when it comes to cinematography. As many have said before, Taxi Driver features one of the best-shot scenes of all time. The scene where Travis is trying to make contact with Betsy on the phone and the camera pans over to a barren hallway is the one in reference. This scene is so great because you feel Travis' emotions, and when the camera goes over to the hallway it's as if Scorsese is telling the viewer to not look at the pain Travis is feeling. The barren hallway is also a metaphor for Travis' life as it is simply empty and lonely. The arc of Travis is another interesting element of the film. Travis' arc from a low life cabbie toward redemption does not feel forced and is developed in a way that feels realistic. By about the halfway point, Travis' desire to take matters into his own hands, in regards to cleaning up the city, begins to take action, and in his mind will lead to him becoming a hero. The third stand out element of the film is the conflict, and the films ability to create great external and internal conflict. The external conflict of the film has to do with the state of city which is filled with prostitution, violence, and other forms of crime. The internal conflict is Travis' own personal battle with his psychological problems and his loneliness caused by his off- putting personality. Taxi Driver does not feature any sort of explosions, quirky dialogue, or have a Hollywood ending, but is a film that can still be appreciated today. Taxi Driver holds up to the test of time thirty-eight years later.

In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and León are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Leóns relationship she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they sayLéon You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda I finished growing up, Léon. I just get older. Léon For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up. Then it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.But in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building? Yet it does, and it's beautiful.

Clap your... oh. Never mind, because there is small amount of people that honestly like this movie. This movie wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. Still, it was just a little too ridiculous. I have to give the movie, some credit as it was trying to do something new with the Dinosaur concept. Too bad, it didn't establish its world that way. In an alternate futuristic a dark and edgy cyberpunk society, a tough female police detective, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg) is paired with a talking dinosaur, Theodore Rex (Voiced by George Newbern) to find the killer of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals leading them to a mad scientist bent on creating a new Armageddon. Directed by Jonathan R. Betuel, the movie is badly delivered. It was supposed to capitalize on the 1990s Dinosaur craze that films like 1993's Jurassic Park & TV Shows, 1991's Dinosaurs help create. Sadly, it's fails due to a plot that is hard to understand with a complicated text prologue and horrible dialogue. The plot drags down to a slow pace due to a lot of filler scenes like the undercover clothes scene. BTW- he looks the same, undercover. Things are never explain like why the Dinosaurs have psychic powers or how anthropomorphic dinosaurs even came to this world. The film gets even weirder when clones and cyborgs are also in the film. The movie plot remind me of a mix between 1982's Blade Runner and 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, with similarities. I really think the movie too many concepts in the film. The confusion and sheer randomness of the on screen action is actually kind of impressive It feels like a mess. A little more exposition would be great to have here. Even if the plot was clear, the poor animatronics made it a hard watch. It uses the same technology as the Dinosaurs TV show had at the time. The only problem is that is a step-down. For a movie that was $33.5 million dollars to make; you would think that they would use their money, well, and give the actor that plays the title character, a better Dinosaur suit to wear. The lip movements don't even sync with the costume's movement. Most of the actors signed on thinking the dinosaur would be computer enhanced. The fundamental problem with this movie is that Theodore doesn't act like a T. Rex. He's too anthropomorphized to be taken serious. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying hypocrite of a creature. One minute, he's preaching the teachings of non-violence, and the next minute, he's threating to bite people's head off. They really can't make up, their mind. His running gag about being a recovering carnivore is just downright too preachy. Last is his bumbling behavior that remind me of Jars Jar Binks's level of hatred. It does wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him are just more misses than hits to the funny bone. For a buddy cop comedy, this movie jokes are just unfunny for the most part. Whoopi Goldberg is no help. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal, but legal entanglements kept her on the production. The supporting cast is just as forgettable in their performance. I nearly forgot that Richard Roundtree and Bud Cort are in this film. It's funny in a way, that Molly Rex (Voiced by Carol Kane) is just Theodore Rex in drag. It's disturbing as hell, that they look the same. The production crew look like they just reused the same costume. Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona, but the songs are not that catchy. It's get weirder with the forced love-interest sub-plot. The pacing ruins it. It's weird that she wants to get with Theodore on the same day of her murder ex-husband funeral. Talk about moving on, too quickly. The editing is just crappy as they intercut sequences that has little to do with each other. Many of the camera shots were unoriginal. It even has the nerves to steal epic shots from 1982's E.T like the flying in front of a full moon shot. There is a lot of shaky cam and oddly done Dutch angles that makes little to no sense to have. Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film went direct-to-video, and consequently became the most expensive direct-to-video film ever made at the time of its release. The film can be compare to 1986's Howard the Duck in how kid friendly it is. It has a lot of sexual innuendos, and brutal action scenes. Sadly, none of them really add much to the entertaining value of this film. I really doubt this movie was made for kids in the first place. Overall A lot of people might get confused with this to a notable biography of Theodore Roosevelt. It seem like the movie did influence a bit of 2004's Anonymous Rex, which is a book series that, coincidentally, is about a dinosaur detective solving crimes amongst humans as well. Just better written. If you want to check out, a film about crime solving dinosaurs, Anonymous Rex might be the better film to watch, over this. This movie sucks.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"19 October 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Hey Theodore Rex! If you're happy for this movie, and you know it. Clap your... oh. Never mind, because there is small amount of people that honestly like this movie. This movie wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. Still, it was just a little too ridiculous. I have to give the movie, some credit as it was trying to do something new with the Dinosaur concept. Too bad, it didn't establish its world that way. In an alternate futuristic a dark and edgy cyberpunk society, a tough female police detective, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg) is paired with a talking dinosaur, Theodore Rex (Voiced by George Newbern) to find the killer of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals leading them to a mad scientist bent on creating a new Armageddon. Directed by Jonathan R. Betuel, the movie is badly delivered. It was supposed to capitalize on the 1990s Dinosaur craze that films like 1993's Jurassic Park & TV Shows, 1991's Dinosaurs help create. Sadly, it's fails due to a plot that is hard to understand with a complicated text prologue and horrible dialogue. The plot drags down to a slow pace due to a lot of filler scenes like the undercover clothes scene. BTW- he looks the same, undercover. Things are never explain like why the Dinosaurs have psychic powers or how anthropomorphic dinosaurs even came to this world. The film gets even weirder when clones and cyborgs are also in the film. The movie plot remind me of a mix between 1982's Blade Runner and 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, with similarities. I really think the movie too many concepts in the film. The confusion and sheer randomness of the on screen action is actually kind of impressive It feels like a mess. A little more exposition would be great to have here. Even if the plot was clear, the poor animatronics made it a hard watch. It uses the same technology as the Dinosaurs TV show had at the time. The only problem is that is a step-down. For a movie that was $33.5 million dollars to make; you would think that they would use their money, well, and give the actor that plays the title character, a better Dinosaur suit to wear. The lip movements don't even sync with the costume's movement. Most of the actors signed on thinking the dinosaur would be computer enhanced. The fundamental problem with this movie is that Theodore doesn't act like a T. Rex. He's too anthropomorphized to be taken serious. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying hypocrite of a creature. One minute, he's preaching the teachings of non-violence, and the next minute, he's threating to bite people's head off. They really can't make up, their mind. His running gag about being a recovering carnivore is just downright too preachy. Last is his bumbling behavior that remind me of Jars Jar Binks's level of hatred. It does wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him are just more misses than hits to the funny bone. For a buddy cop comedy, this movie jokes are just unfunny for the most part. Whoopi Goldberg is no help. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal, but legal entanglements kept her on the production. The supporting cast is just as forgettable in their performance. I nearly forgot that Richard Roundtree and Bud Cort are in this film. It's funny in a way, that Molly Rex (Voiced by Carol Kane) is just Theodore Rex in drag. It's disturbing as hell, that they look the same. The production crew look like they just reused the same costume. Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona, but the songs are not that catchy. It's get weirder with the forced love-interest sub-plot. The pacing ruins it. It's weird that she wants to get with Theodore on the same day of her murder ex-husband funeral. Talk about moving on, too quickly. The editing is just crappy as they intercut sequences that has little to do with each other. Many of the camera shots were unoriginal. It even has the nerves to steal epic shots from 1982's E.T like the flying in front of a full moon shot. There is a lot of shaky cam and oddly done Dutch angles that makes little to no sense to have. Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film went direct-to-video, and consequently became the most expensive direct-to-video film ever made at the time of its release. The film can be compare to 1986's Howard the Duck in how kid friendly it is. It has a lot of sexual innuendos, and brutal action scenes. Sadly, none of them really add much to the entertaining value of this film. I really doubt this movie was made for kids in the first place.

And I am one of those guys who stays to the bitter end of every movie. I see it as almost a badge of honor. But there are 4 movies I have failed in the last two years, and this is one of them.I don't think Nixon was an especially bad movie. I just could not get into it. There was a lot of dialogue, but I could never figure out who was doing the talking and what their significance to the story was. That was the first problem. Huge cast of characters, but I was not familiar enough with the events with which they were associated or with who they were supposed to be to be able to follow along. In addition, the movie had a few flash-backs and fast-forwards, which didn't help in sorting things out.The second problem was that Anthony Hopkins just didn't look like Richard Nixon. He did his typical fine performance, but in this movie, acting was not enough. Richard Nixon's appearance is so distinctive that there is no way you can sort of look like him. You either do, or you don't. Nixon's sharp features preclude him from being well-represented by only a close resemblance. All they gave Hopkins was Nixon's type II pattern baldness hairline. I watched scene after scene with seemingly random people who I couldn't keep straight and this old sad-sack that was always right in the middle of them. I had to keep reminding myself that the sad sack was supposed to be Richard Nixon.As stated earlier, I don't think this was an especially bad movie. For me, it just did not flow well. I had to help it along, and with its confusing cast of characters that became too great a struggle. I'm not sure when I turned it off, but I think it was after over 2 hours of watching. I'm sure I was near the end and I probably could have finished it, but I was so confused by that time that I didn't see the point.After thinking back, the movie plays more like a documentary than a vehicle for entertainment. It is heavy on facts and history and might be more suited to students of political history. It is a thinking person's movie. Maybe that was my problem. I was just looking for something to relax to before I went to bed. You have to be prepared to work to get through this one. A suggestion might be for you to Google Nixon before watching it to get some background refreshers. Or maybe you just need to be older than I am. I think if you were a politically-aware adult in the early 70s you'd probably have enough knowledge to be able to follow this film.

The trouble is that there is no intel on Electra making it tricky for Rath to find her. By the time, Rath does find her, Bain is already on the scene, but Bain locates the buyers rather than the mark. Rath then tricks Bain into thinking that he has killed Electra. Rath soon begins to realise that the Contractor is playing both himself and Bain off against each other and tries to find out who's doing it and why whilst also trying to stay one step ahead of his deadly rival.When watching films, I sometimes have to say to myself 'Come on, it's only a film, don't take it so seriously' and for the most part I can suspend disbelief, but there were some things in this film that just didn't make sense....1) Bain gets arrested by the police early on, but manages to slip his cuffs and escape killing about 3 maybe 4 police officers in the process. Due to the nature of his escape and due to the fact that he killed a few officers made me think to myself 'Wow!!

Rath believed that the 'Contractor' was dead, but Rath fired at the Contractor's heart and the 'Contractor' had some sort of prosthetic shell covering his heart due to the fact that he knew Rath would aim for his heart.

It's possible that the 'Contractor' may have played Rath and Bain off against each other purely for his own amusement and in order for Rath to prove that he truly is the best, but this is unclear.All in all, if you take this film as it is then it is an entertaining and fairly decent thriller.

The only thing I cared about was watching crazy Pacino do what he does best and be an outrageous, charismatic character that steals every scene regardless of how it is written.Unfortunately, though, there is little in terms of genuine emotional investment. The only emotion I felt was frustration.One final remark You don't need to make the Devil too smart, but make him scary. The scariest thing this Devil did was make some homeless people beat a guy to death in a scene that had little to offer in terms of suspense or fear. How about a Satan with a really nasty bite?

As a punishment, I knew the twisted ending before I had watched the movie. However, although the idea was decent, there were horrible gaps and inconsistencies in the logic of the movie. Since it is a N. Shyamalan movie, people got used to these gaps and stuff over the years, however sixth sense is one of the firsts and I believe that is the reason for the high score in IMDb. If this movie was in cinemas in 2014 it could not get more than 6 or 7 stars at most.Anyway, our story is about an child psychologist who was shot in his house by a child whom he was not able to help in the past. It is not a spoiler yet because it is how everything started. Then he continues walking around for almost a year (they say next fall, but it means some time definitely passed), trying to help another little kid who claims to see dead people who do not understand that they are dead. OK, this is also acceptable since it is the basis of many horror stories. Meanwhile his wife is not talking to him, not a word even and we have no idea why. He is the one who got shot, and next scene, wife is not talking to him. At the end, we understood that he is one of the dead people who is not aware of the situation. OK, I can accept this one as well. But how can they accept us to believe that it makes sense when no one is talking to you??? Your wife is not talking to you, even has not a single emotions towards you. Also in one scene, we see our guy waiting with the mother of the child in a living room for him to get back from school. Really? Not a single word with a foreigner in a room? He asked some questions like hello, how are you? I am your child's shrink and when she did not reply what happened? He taught that no one speaks with him because he got shot???In my opinion it was a forced ending. People were diverted from the fact by some scenes that makes no sense at all. For people who watched a thriller like The Others, this movie is full of logic gaps. If you want to spend some nice time, I suggest this movie. However I believe it is not a master piece or worths anything around 8 stars...

I was even enjoying this as much as the original Guns of Navarone, that is, until the plot holes popped up (the original also had plot holes). This is not a dumb action movie that begs you to switch off your brain, so the plot holes pretty much ruin the experience. It turns out the whole plot was very significantly changed from the book though so keep that in mind.*spoilers* - The biggest plot hole is the fact they were sent there because they knew Nikolai and could identify him and they knew Nikolai was at least a traitor from personal experience. So when they met him, why would they believe the story about another Nikolai that was the real traitor\/spy? - Another hole is that it turns out the British were constantly in touch with the partisans so they didn't have to send commandos to kill Nikolai, they could have simply told them to kill him.- And then there is the whole bluff with the penicillin. First they bluff that they have it in their suitcase but they can't open it, then when it turns out it has wood inside the case, they say they buried it. Any German with half a brain would see the contradiction in the story. If they buried it for that matter, why bring the suitcase at all knowing that the Germans would force them to open it? - Also the masked infiltrators were obviously discovered dead by the partisans first since they knew about it when they nabbed Force 10, so why did they leave the dead bodies there to be discovered by the Chetniks and thus give themselves away? - Why would Miller instruct them how to plant the bomb at the dam, but not tell them the critical information that it would be a slow destruction and thus let them know how to time the whole thing so that they could get away and not allow the bomb to be discovered?- I also had a problem with the fact that simple explosives could not destroy the bridge but water could. But this may be a lack of engineering knowledge on my part and perhaps the water eroded the ground underneath, except that he was going on and on about how it was attached to rock so I have doubts...

I do recommend this film to people who are a fan of cop thrillers because they will enjoy this film, however I thought it was slow in some aspects and this is not a film that I would rush to watch again anytime soon.***\/***** Could be worse. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"19 October 2014","score":"","review":" The Time Machine is not a great film, but it is fun to watch. English Victorian inventor H. George Wells (Rod Taylor), after expressing his understandable disillusionment with present to David Filby (Alan Young), travels into the future to discover what mankind has done with its overly efficient weapons of war. Needless to say, George does not like what he finds. He first witnesses the brutal slaughter of human beings in two World Wars. This film, released just two years before the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, also exploits the tense atmosphere of the Cold War by suggesting that mankind was also insane enough to wage nuclear wars. Having witnessed air strikes with nuclear bombs, George travels even further into the future presumably to the 50th century where he learns of the terrible consequences of nuclear war the disintegration of civilization and the emergence of two primitive cultures. One of these cultures lives happily on the earth's surface and does not engage in any physical labour, though now and then they had to put up with seeing some of their member disappear underground forever during air raid sirens. The second lives underground and has a dark secret.This film can be read in one of two ways. It works as an entertainment, as we satisfy our curiosity about what it's presumably like for a man to travel far into the future in his time machine. On a somewhat more subtle level, the Time Machine is also an anti-war film that takes issue particularly with the increasingly destructive weapons of war that are being invented. At one point, George returns back to Victorian England in order to warn his good friends about the terrible consequences that would befall civilization as a result of the current arms race between the great western powers. These friends scoff at the idea that George even travelled to the future, to say nothing of being a witness to the destruction of civilization at the hands of terrible weapons such as the nuclear bomb. As a result, George sees no hope for the human race in his own time and travels to the 50th century in order to help the people on the surface build a new and hopefully better civilization. In short, what The Time Machine is saying is that most human beings in the 20th century are incredibly short sighted, because they used science and technology to hasten their own destruction rather than make the world a better place.

In the next scene, we see him with his doctor (Huston). He's had a heart transplant. He lives on a boat, and he is visited by a woman (de Jesus) who asks him to look into the murder of her sister. He explains that he's retired. She informs him that he has her sister's heart.I was entertained by this film, I love Clint Eastwood, and I love many of his films. This wasn't one of his better ones, but he was good. The plot -- the motive for the killings -- left me cold, as the execution of it seemed chancy, and the reason for it bizarre. Also there was the typical casting error that's always made. I never know why. Really spoils it.I'm sure I'm going to sound like some crazed aggressive feminist, which I assure you I'm not, but here we go again. We've got Clint Eastwood, in his seventies here, chasing people after a heart transplant. He's like Superman. When he was 67, in Absolute Power, he was jumping out of windows. No one questions it, just like no one questions Harrison Ford or any other elderly male actor having costars half their age and still playing leads. Yet women stars are sidelined because of age.The age is now higher, and yes, if you're Judy Dench or Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep, you too can star in a movie. And yes, it's better than it was. It's not good enough. We're lucky that there are people who want to write and produce scripts for these stars, but look at everyone else - Angelica Huston, Sally Field, Meg Ryan, all the way back, whose sell-by date relegates them to character roles.Eastwood was too old for Bridges of Madison Cunty, he was too old for Absolute Power, and he was too old for this. I don't love him any less; I grew up watching him. But the movie world tells us it's natural for your mother to be around her son's age (Angela Lansbury-Laurence Harvey), 14 years older than your daughter (Kate Nelligan-Sandra Bullock), a girlfriend to someone, and then, ten years later, the same actor's mother (Tom Hanks-Sally Field).Once on TV, Kaye Ballard asked a casting agent why a 30-year-old is sometimes cast as the mother of a 29-year old male. The agent said she didn't know, but her husband was 31 and the woman playing his mother on a show was 32. Go figure. There's a 28-year difference between Wanda de Jesus and Clint Eastwood. I want to see Susan Sarandon on screen with her romantic lead 28 years younger. We'd never stop hearing about it.
