Many films should be prefaced with the phrase 'once upon a time' and this one is no exception. Producer DeNiro could not get Stan and Ollie so he put himself in the latter role, and chose Penn for the part of Laurel. We keep expecting to see Penn break out into Laurelish tears at any moment, and it is only the sound of the water that prevents us from hearing DeNiro shouting whooaaaaaaa as he slides down the falls. And there are so many times I expected Ollie to swat Stanley, but it never happens.Left to their mugging, my rating might be higher, but somehow inserting Demi into the mix spoils something. If the time were 1930, the little girl who plays a key role would have had a much older looking mother, or at least one who looked more bedraggled by her life in that wilderness.Then the storyline takes a disastrous violent turn just after the statute seems to have produced another miracle. Such a scene worked in Some Like It Hot when the killer jumped out of the cake. Here it ruins the mood that is being set. Surely there was another way to get the girl into the water.I have no problem, however, watching it again.

The movie is based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis.The film stars Christian Bale (Little Women, Batman Begins) as Patrick Bateman, a young, handsome, affluent executive in late 1980's New York City. He seems to have it all, cushy job, pretty fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), posh apartment, powerful friends. What he doesn't have is a soul. As he says in the beginning of the film, There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there. Patrick is a serial killer (or is he? watch the film, what do you think?). The film graphically portrays his nightly homicidal habits, without becoming too slasher flick about it. This film isn't for the faint at heart, besides blood and gore, there are some pretty graphic sexual encounters and nudity. But there is comedy here as well. You'll find yourself laughing at some sequences and feeling terribly guilty about it. The next moment you're wincing at it's raw violence.If Patrick is the hyper prototype of the 80's yuppie male, then his friends are more realistic reflections of it. In one scene, he and his friends are discussing women. One of his friends asserts that the ideal woman consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb f***ing mouth shut. In another scene, he and his friends are discussing some of the world's problems. When Patrick lists some of the ills that society needs to solve (he doesn't really care, he just wants to be seen as knowledgeable), his friends are amused. The people around him in this yuppie society are obsessed with surfaces. They keep all of their real thoughts, concerns, and emotions buried, and only care about what people wear, drive, own, and buy. For this reason, Patrick, who actually has no inner emotions, is able to move undetected among them.The film is an exposition of the morally bankrupt 1980's male dominated corporate culture. But this theme is still relevant today. Our culture idealizes the macho, ruthless businessman who treats women as objects and possessions. In a scene of the movie, Patrick tells a woman that he later murders that he's into murders and executions and she mishears him, thinking he said, mergers and acquisitions; it really comes to the same thing. It is these same men who are now running corporate America. Is it any wonder that corporations seem to feel so little responsibility to their employees, stockholders, the public, the environment, the law, or virtually anything at all? Indeed, Patrick's broad choice of victims in the film (even more in the book) mirror those who are often victimized by corporate America. Women, the poor, the homeless, minorities, the elderly, even animals.Overall, this is a great film with superb acting by Christian Bale and a few others, including Chloe Sevigny who plays Jean, Patrick's secretary. The end is perplexing and will cause you to watch the entire movie again to see if you can figure it out.

Eastwood plays the same sort of character he typically plays - a likable tough guy with a powerful sense of justice and ice for blood. This Eastwood, however, has lost his wife to a drunk driver, some of his partners to murderous criminals, and some aspect of his sanity to his job. He's an inspector in the San Francisco police force's Homicide Division. The film is highly regarded for Eastwood's charismatic performance, for the boldness of the Dirty Harry character, and for the several spaghetti-western quotes uttered by Eastwood. I have a slightly different take on this film. Dirty Harry was released in the same year as The French Connection - http\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0067116\/combined - a film partly based on real life detectives catching the feeling of police dealing with the hard realities of the drug trade in the big apple of the early 1970s. Dirty Harry - as cool as Eastwood's character may be - is a one-dimensional creature compared with Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle. Something about Harry Callahan's political incorrectness resonates in a disturbing way with people who have only examined police work and the justice system through their televisions. The reality of this aspect of modern life is far less interesting, dramatic, and straightforward. And the critique of American justice is at least as powerfully made in the French Connection as it is here. Furthermore, The French Connection was an extremely innovative film, while Dirty Harry was a fairly typical stylized police-fantasy. The only explanations for the on-going popularity of this film, then, are Eastwood's charisma and the sheer entertainment value of this gutsy, gritty, hardcore crime drama. Harry is on the trail of a serial killer played by the phenomenal character actor Andrew J. Robinson in his major film debut. Andy Robinson makes a great psycho, and, at times, appears so out-of-control (nicely contrasted with Eastwood's reptilian calm) that it is a wonder he didn't seriously injure himself during the shooting of the film. When Robinson abducts a young girl and buries her alive, extorting $200, 000 from the mayor's office, Harry uses some unconventional tactics to bring him to justice. This brings us slightly past the midpoint of the film, and just to the point where it accelerates into a first-rate action thriller. While I think Dirty Harry is a very good film, and worth seeing at least a couple of times, I do not necessarily agree with the general opinion concerning the film. It is disappointing to me that this film did not make Andy Robinson the star that it helped to make Clint Eastwood into - especially since the range of characters and emotions these two men have shown themselves capable of is so disparate (in favor of Mr. Robinson). It is also surprising to me to see that the obvious connection (dare I say plagiarisn) between this film and the French Connection has been glossed over by film history so completely. In the same light, it bothers me that this film is rated so highly as compared with the French Connection. And finally, I am pleased that Dirty Harry is still a film that action fans enjoy, because unlike most of what the action genre produces today, this is a film with a message, and a subtle and hauntingly memorable intelligence.

It is my favorite film by Stanley Kubrik, who I believe, along with Martin Scorsese, is the greatest director ever. Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, 2001, and Dr. Strangelove are some of the best of all time, for me anyway. I wish that Kubrik could have had the opportunity to direct Artificial Intelligence, but Spielberg's homage did just fine. Back to A Clockwork Orange. This film is painful to watch on many levels. It is violent, but that is the subject matter. Due to that, this film is not for everyone. The soundtrack adds so much depth. The opening shot is planted in my brain, which is a closeup of Alex's face in the milk bar that features eerie music that fits so wonderfully. I do not want to describe the plot, because many others have and I do not want to give anything away. I do, however, want to write about my interpretation of the scene in which Alex is being treated in the movie theater by scientists who are trying to forcefully remove the evil from within his mind and heart. In the scene, they strap Alex down in a chair and hold his eyes open, so that he can not blink or look away from the screen. While he is strapped down, he watches footage of violence, rape, and war. In a way, this scene describes what the movie does to the viewer. When watching this film, it is impossible to look away, no matter how far it goes. The violence is not stylish or exciting. Instead, it is painful, brutal, hateful, and violent. Kubrik made this film to turn audiences off by violence. In today's world, violence seems to be the key to the success of a film. Just look at The Matrix or Kill Bill (I love both of these films by the way). I believe that Kubrik's mission was the same as the scientists, which was to scare the evil out of you. At least, that is what the film did to me. You know what I'm saying? If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Art does not get much better than this. It's a shame that the movie is loved by younger audiences due to the fact that they find the violence to be hilarious. They have it all wrong.

The storyline is solid, and is, contrary to what most people believe, somewhat true to the story. Like it or not, Guile and Chun-Li are meant to be the main characters in SF2 and the movie reflects this. In the games, their endings are directly tied to Bison. Of the remaining 14 characters (obviously not counting Bison,) only one other is Cammy's, and that's only because Bison tells her about her amnesia.As for the casting, it was very well done. The only problems I saw\/heard are Van-Damme's French accent, Dhalsim's casting as a doctor, which WAS well done despite being unfaithful to the game, T. Hawk's lack of height (I think Rainwater is shorter than Van-Damme) and Chapa's short hair. Otherwise, everything else was spot-on, especially the casting for Bison. Raul Julia is the only person that I think could've done it. He's a fairly versatile actor AND he looks like Bison. A couple other characters were miscasted like Dhalsim, but the excellent acting made up for that.The combination of Charlie and Blanka was both acceptable and unacceptable. How? Street Fighter Alpha didn't come out until a year after this film did, but both Blanka's and Guile's endings disprove the combination. Getting back to the story, it was actually believable for not being based around a tournament like SF2 is. Being forced into a three day timetable by Bison's ransom demands made the movie seem all the more action-packed, to me at least. The scene between Bison and Chun-Li in Bison's quarters could've been cut out, though, except for the part where Bison was about to get his butt kicked by Chun-Li. The final battle between Bison and Guile was the most blatantly choreographed yet still exciting thing I had ever seen in a martial arts movie up to that point, other than the odd scene from a few Jackie Chan movies.The sound was pretty horrible. Generic rap somehow found its way into the movie in the cage fighting arena scene, and I swear I heard it again when I played the god-awful SF3 Third Strike. That one should've been permanently shelved. The orchestrated music that made it into the movie was nearly impossible to hear, although some of it was vaguely reminiscent of Guile's stage in SF2. The worst part was the lack of music from the game. A symphony orchestra doing all the music from the characters that made it into the movie (so no Fei-Long or Akuma) would've been great. So would have the Amiga CD32 version of Super Turbo if it was out or the arcade version of Super.Many of the characters signature moves are not present. I counted one Hadouken (to Vega in the Ryu+Ken vs. Vega+Sagat fight in Bison's quarters, very easy to miss as it's done at point-blank range,) a few flash kicks (minus the special effect,) and one Psycho Crusher (I think that's the name.) No Sonic Boom, no Shoryuken, no anything else.Overall, there are a few glaring issues (sound and lack of special moves mostly,) but it's still very enjoyable.7\/10Recommended to Martial arts fans Van-Damme fans Street Fighter fansNot Recommended to Street Fighter fans who believe Ryu and Ken are supposed to be the main characters without realizing only three endings out of sixteen people (not counting Bison and including Akuma) are actually tied to Bison himself.

But the film is curious because the reformed John Robie, ably played by Cary Grant, has reformed but does not want to admit the fact. The storyline I suggest bears out my minor cavil on what is an engrossing film with rather good characters and a definite difference about it. The former jewel thief is living on the Riviera in some splendor; then cat burglaries bearing the signatures of his work are committed by someone. The police suspect him; he goes to his old WWII partisan compatriots to see if he can find out who is incriminating him. They are silent. Then he is discovered by Francie Stevens, daughter of an American millionaire, who enjoys playing with danger, and toying with him. She finds his being a thief exciting, the film's unusual element; he finds her attempts to tempt him with other jewels amusing--he has reformed. Then he has to kill a man he once worked with, whose daughter turns against him. Soon her mother's necklace is stolen and he has to find a way to catch the real criminal, immediately. Working with a British police inspector, Robie sets out to trap the criminal, using a vast party with elaborate costumes--he being disguised as a blackamoor--and substituting the police inspector in similar disguise to free him to pursue the thief on the roof of the palazzo where the party has been staged--the dead man's daughter. Robie gets Francie; and Francie get the husband she wants. She also loves his villa; Mother will love it!, she murmurs at the last, as Robie completes his civilization. The cast in the film is good but not outstanding. Cary Grant is graceful and interesting as Robie; Grace Kelly is lovely and rather intelligent as Francie. Her mother, played by Jessie Royce Landis, becomes an outstanding U.S. type, the pioneer widow of a millionaire updated. As the Police Inspector, John Williams is in wonderful form. others in the cast are adequate but none is outstanding; and because of the nature of the investigation carried out by Robie, many persons have one line or a scream, or are seen but not heard. The technical achievements during this feature's production are very fine indeed. Hal Pereira's art direction, set decoration, Edith Head's costumes, sound, lighting, are all very much above average. Some scenes in this well-paced adventure have become famous the beach scene where Grant finally comes ashore; the visit to a restaurant filled with angry French chefs carrying cleavers, the funeral, Francie's breakneck drive up the coastal highway next to a cliff, the visit to a château, the party scene, the fireworks during which Francie and Robie kiss in slow motion, the final; roof chase, all are celebrated. I personally find the film occasionally cold; I also cannot reconcile Robie's acceptance of his own lazy-minded past as something a genuinely reformed man would have thought exactly as stated. But this is a mature Alfred Hitchcock full-color classic, with the director in top form realizing John Michael Hayes' screenplay from David Dodge's novel, and using the Riviera as his palette. This is a deservedly popular romantic adventure for many causes.

Jo Stockton is discovered in a bookstore by a photographer who sees in her a gamin-like cover girl. She has to accept his preposterous offer of a modeling career, the last thing she desires, because he promises her a trip to Paris for shooting; and it is there she can meet the founder of 'empathicalism, a beatnik philosophy that invites you to walk in someone else's mental bedroom slippers in order to create empathy. of course when Jo gets to Paris, nothing is as she expected.

The famous scenes include the Think Pink number, a photography session montage, the wooing of Hepburn by Astaire to get her to come along and the presentation number when her photograph appears on the front cover. Of course, all turns out romantically and professionally right in the end; the only trouble with the film is that it does end.

All sorts of explanations have been put forward. It's a romance, a melodrama - even the intriguing explanation that it was the representation of a love triangle involving the director, a notion which falls flat, because the director did not write the script. In fact, it is a good old fashioned war propaganda film. Why should the Americans enter the Second World War?Although the film is set in North Africa, all the principal characters are either American or from somewhere in Europe. The Americans are from a country that is neutral. Most of the others, the French, the Czech with the Hungarian name etc, are embroiled in the war somewhere.Among all the turmoil in Casablanca Rick Blaine has built himself a little neutral island. It's cosy, with his chess set in his little office, with Dooley Wilson at the piano, and Sasha the Russian barman. The turmoil can go on but Rick Blaine, like the USA, is strictly neutral.But Rick cannot remain neutral for long, and sooner or later, the second world war - in the shape of Ilsa and her boyfriend - turn up at his door. Rick must now take an active part in the war, just as the USA have to join the fighting.The final scene show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the reluctant collaborator of a Frenchman and his American ally.The film may have been a message to the people of America or even a message to the President (casablanca is Spanish for white house). But the message is there. It's 1942, and it's off to war for the USA; because it is inevitable that the USA are going to get embroiled in this one way or another.Those who have read some of my other reviews know that I am quite capable of slitting the throats of sacred cows. In this case I am quite happy to give it 10 out of 10, because it IS a good film; and it is not the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you it is a good film; it is the ordinary filmgoing public who will tell you. It is heavily layered, well acted, competently directed, and Orson Welles is nowhere to be seen!There are some reviewers who say that the acting in this is bad. When did Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains or Conrad Veidt ever act badly? They couldn't if they tried.No other director but Curtiz could have directed this. Interesting is the scene where two factions sing against one another, a device he has used in at least one other of his films.

It's a romance, a melodrama - even the intriguing explanation that it was the representation of a love triangle involving the director, a notion which falls flat, because the director did not write the script. In fact, it is a good old fashioned war propaganda film. Why should the Americans enter the Second World War?Although the film is set in North Africa, all the principal characters are either American or from somewhere in Europe. The Americans are from a country that is neutral. Most of the others, the French, the Czech with the Hungarian name etc, are embroiled in the war somewhere.Among all the turmoil in Casablanca Rick Blaine has built himself a little neutral island. It's cosy, with his chess set in his little office, with Dooley Wilson at the piano, and Sasha the Russian barman. The turmoil can go on but Rick Blaine, like the USA, is strictly neutral.But Rick cannot remain neutral for long, and sooner or later, the second world war - in the shape of Ilsa and her boyfriend - turn up at his door. Rick must now take an active part in the war, just as the USA have to join the fighting.The final scene show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the reluctant collaborator of a Frenchman and his American ally.The film may have been a message to the people of America or even a message to the President (casablanca is Spanish for white house). But the message is there. It's 1942, and it's off to war for the USA; because it is inevitable that the USA are going to get embroiled in this one way or another.Those who have read some of my other reviews know that I am quite capable of slitting the throats of sacred cows. In this case I am quite happy to give it 10 out of 10, because it IS a good film; and it is not the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you it is a good film; it is the ordinary filmgoing public who will tell you. It is heavily layered, well acted, competently directed, and Orson Welles is nowhere to be seen!There are some reviewers who say that the acting in this is bad. When did Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains or Conrad Veidt ever act badly? They couldn't if they tried.No other director but Curtiz could have directed this. Interesting is the scene where two factions sing against one another, a device he has used in at least one other of his films. For this film, Curtiz won an about-time-too Oscar for best director.Another great thing about this film is that it is so rich in content that you can play it again, Sam, as often as you like.

Released in the summer of 89 a year of many big hits, this movie just got lost in the shuffle, but found a home at the local video store. It follows Yankovic's character as he gets to run a television station and turns what should be just a filler channel into one of the top rated networks on television on the back of a wacky children's show host. Al is rather good in his performance and Michael Richards is good as the janitor turned star, and the movie has some really funny parody scenes that I found to be the highlight of this one. There are problems though as the movie bogs down here and there a couple of times and there is not all that much going on. Still it is worth a look as it has some very funny stuff in it as well. So if you want to watch poodles learn to fly, a hilarious Raiders and Rambo spoof, a janitor trying to fight for his freedom from some goons then check it out.

It definitely ranks in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. What is so great about this movie is how Tarantino managed to steel from so many other films that he actually created something completely original. He also did this with Kill Bill. He deserved his Oscar for the screenplay. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction should have been awarded the Oscar for the best film of the year, but that honor went to Forrest Gump. It's a shame that Samuel L. Jackson was not awarded for his role as Jules. It is also a shame that Uma Thurman was nominated for her role in Pulp Fiction, but not for her performance in either Kill Bill. That's strange. Pulp Fiction is one of the funniest movies ever conceived. It is also one of the most intense. Of the three stories, The Gold Watch, which is about Bruce Willi's character, Butch, is my least favorite. But, it is far from being bad. To me, it plays homage to Deliverance, which is a great movie, too. I'm sure that's what Tarantino was going for. The third story, The Bonnie Situation, is a fast-paced slap in the face. Amazing! The first story, which is about Vincent Vega's, played by John Travolta, night with his boss's wife, played by Uma Thurman, on the town. It ends with one of the most heart-pounding scenes that I have ever viewed. I can't forget the Prologue and Epilogue, which takes place in a coffee shop. How brilliant is that scene? A restaurant being robbed. Keep up the good work Tarantino. I can't wait for his World War II film.
