Her first night there, she witnesses two girls in the academy get killed. The head of the academy, Miss Tanner, (Alida Valli) officially welcomes her and shows her to her room, where her roommate, Olga, (Barbara Magnolfi) who tells her about the murders. After a rough start, a series of strange occurrences start happening around the studio. All of them inspire Suzy to do some snooping around the academy. Her investigations brings up evidence that someone at the academy is hiding a dreadful secret, one they will stop at nothing to hide.The Good News This is a classic film. The first thing that most notice is that the movie is simply beautiful to look at. Everything is filmed in shockingly bright colors, and their continual reappearance is refreshing to see. The deep, dark reds and blacks, and the light, fluorescent blues and greens are quite in abundance here, giving the film an almost dream-like atmosphere. The film is journey through the world of dreams, offering many common themes and visions. The constant booming sounds that pop up everywhere in the film continually make the viewer on edge, and drawing them into the story even more. Almost every scene in here has a sound of some sort, and most of the time it comes in at the right moment to jangle the nerves. When it wants to, it can also be as graphic as it wants to. The opening double murder is as graphic and brutal as anything ever filmed, and in terms of opening a movie up, is arguably the greatest opening scene in movie history. It delivers one of the few rare shock jumps and is so creative in it's concept and shocking in it's realization that it has to be seen just solely on this sequence alone. However, unlike other films that start out with a great bang, the film rarely does let up, stopping only for the usual exposition and introduction of characters that are necessary for these films before going right back in into the discovery of the truth at the academy. The greatly hyped closing sequence is rightfully atmospheric and doesn't disappoint at all, especially considering what it's up against. This is a great book-ended film, as it opens and closes on very strong points. There is a decidedly European style to the whole affair as well, mixed in with all the other wonderful attributes to the film as well. From the typical Argento brilliance on the camera to the way of telling a simple story to all the little things inside that can only be found on repeated viewings, this is a European approach to horror in it's most classic sense.The Bad News There is a plain and very harsh truth about the film there's no real jumps in it at all. The film is very beautiful to look at and makes you think, but it doesn't make you jump. It has it's moments of incredible suspense, but this is not a jump tactic. It can be used to set one up, and often times it does try this approach, but it never really delivers the jump that it sets up. The dreamlike atmosphere that it so wonderfully exploits also makes the film simply confusing for first-time viewers. It's purposely done that way, cause as stated before, Argento wants to concentrate on the visual rather than telling a story. What happens is of little consequence. What is important is how it is told, and those who are not used to that can sit through the film wondering what everything is about. It's all symbolically done, and that can be something to first time viewers to get through.The Final Verdict There are a couple things to get around, but make no mistake, this is still a classic entry in the Euro-horror scene and arguably in the genre.

Simply put, Mickey and Mallory are supposed to be a twisted perversion of the old-fashioned 1950s couple who married for love and see themselves as the only two people on earth who really matter. They love rockabilly, they drive a 1960s car, and they cruise the back highways of America. However, they just love to kill people; they're natural born killers. And they didn't kill Mallory's parents because they were abusive; it was because they didn't get her father's permission to wed. And she didn't have a brother; she blew up her entire house!

DEATHS H. Rider Haggard, Thomas R. Marshall.KEVIN We now come to our second Charlie Chaplin film and quite possibly his seminal masterpiece, 1925's The Gold Rush. This movie is wonderful. I laughed really hard right from the beginning. I love the opening where the Tramp first walks on screen, still with his hat and shoes and cane even though there's snow everywhere and he really looks out of his element. I think my favorite comedic beat in the film was the scene where the cabin is teetering over the edge of the cliff. That scene is even better in the 1941 version due to the added tension of sound effects. Another great thing in this movie for me was the irresistible Georgia Hale. Every moment she's on screen everything just lights up. I hear Chaplin was quite the control freak with his films, and I'm sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did.DOUG In June 1925, after nearly two years of production, Charles Chaplin finally releases the film for which he is best remembered, and with good reason The Gold Rush is not just a great comedy, but a great film. And not just because it contains some of Chaplin's best remembered scenes. The gourmet shoe-eating scene is wonderful, the way he is determined to enjoy every bit of the shoe, sucking on the nails like bones, twisting the shoe laces like spaghetti. The scene with the house teetering on the edge of the cliff is one of the greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put on film. And everyone loves when starving Big Jim hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken. But there's something more here. Chaplin isn't just interested in telling jokes, but there's a rather poignant story happening here in the romance between the Tramp and Georgia. The scene where he imagines Georgia and her friends enjoying his New Year's Eve party is especially poignant, as he performs the 'Oceana Roll' with a pair of rolls on forks. Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942. When you watch the later version, it is cool to realize that it's really Chaplin's voice you're hearing. There were a few noticeable alterations in the two versions, one being that instead of the Tramp reading a note from Georgia that he thinks is for him, he really receives a (different) note from Georgia to him. I prefer the later version of that scene, but I prefer the ending of the earlier version where they kiss; the revised version seems to end rather abruptly.Last film Strike (1925). Next film Phantom of the Opera (1925).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each film before we watch the next, never reading the other's review before we finish our own. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.

Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942. When you watch the later version, it is cool to realize that it's really Chaplin's voice you're hearing. There were a few noticeable alterations in the two versions, one being that instead of the Tramp reading a note from Georgia that he thinks is for him, he really receives a (different) note from Georgia to him. I prefer the later version of that scene, but I prefer the ending of the earlier version where they kiss; the revised version seems to end rather abruptly.Last film Strike (1925).

DEATHS H. Rider Haggard, Thomas R. Marshall.KEVIN We now come to our second Charlie Chaplin film and quite possibly his seminal masterpiece, 1925's The Gold Rush. This movie is wonderful. I laughed really hard right from the beginning. I love the opening where the Tramp first walks on screen, still with his hat and shoes and cane even though there's snow everywhere and he really looks out of his element. I think my favorite comedic beat in the film was the scene where the cabin is teetering over the edge of the cliff. That scene is even better in the 1941 version due to the added tension of sound effects. Another great thing in this movie for me was the irresistible Georgia Hale. Every moment she's on screen everything just lights up. I hear Chaplin was quite the control freak with his films, and I'm sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did.DOUG In June 1925, after nearly two years of production, Charles Chaplin finally releases the film for which he is best remembered, and with good reason The Gold Rush is not just a great comedy, but a great film. And not just because it contains some of Chaplin's best remembered scenes. The gourmet shoe-eating scene is wonderful, the way he is determined to enjoy every bit of the shoe, sucking on the nails like bones, twisting the shoe laces like spaghetti. The scene with the house teetering on the edge of the cliff is one of the greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put on film. And everyone loves when starving Big Jim hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken. But there's something more here. Chaplin isn't just interested in telling jokes, but there's a rather poignant story happening here in the romance between the Tramp and Georgia. The scene where he imagines Georgia and her friends enjoying his New Year's Eve party is especially poignant, as he performs the 'Oceana Roll' with a pair of rolls on forks. Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942.

When I first watched it, I wasn't expecting too much. However, I was so impressed with the witty dialog, the flashy characters and the sky's-the-limit premise, that I could not turn it off and I've since watched it many times over again.It starts out with Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) who is a recent college dropout. He is able to make a good living running a 24-7 poker game from his apartment. However, he is the midst of a moral crisis. On one hand, he wants to make a lot of money, which he is able to do through his poker parlor. But on the other hand, he wants to satisfy his hard-to-please father who is a judge and does not approve of his illegal venture. He soon runs into a childhood friend who turns him on to a job which will seemingly allow him to do both.Seth starts working at the stock-selling firm JT Marlin which is miles away from Wall Street, both literally and figuratively. While there, he is surrounded by several aggressive, type-A personalities who are f***ing millionaires but have little in the way of discipline or morals. The movie does a great job in illustrating the kind of lifestyle that they lead. They live in huge mansions, are seen driving fancy cars, go out to classy bars and expensive restaurants, etc, etc.His co-workers are wonderfully played by Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel, Nick Katt, and Thomas Everett Scott. Affleck has a relatively small role as the head recruiter who gives clever and motivational speeches to the trainees. His main purpose in the film is for comic relief, which he seems to have a knack for. Diesel, not usually know for his acting, gives a solid performance as fast-talking Chris Varick, who is the master at closing out clients over the phone. Katt plays Greg, a broker who takes Seth under his wing but soon becomes jealous of Seth and his quick rise to the top. It was a little bit disappointing that his character did not play as prominent of a role in the ending. I was expecting some kind of climax to the tension that was building up between him and Seth. However, the build-up seemed to be wasted in the end. Scott has a disappointingly small role as the two-faced head of the firm, Michael Brantley. He could have been a really interesting character in the movie but unfortunately very little time was devoted to him.As Seth gets settled in to the firm and becomes very good at his job, he begins to question how the firm is able to legally pay out the large sums of money to its brokers. He soon finds out that everything is not all that it is cracked up to be. He goes from an innocent pawn with dreams of being a millionaire to a conscientious sympathizer who feels bad about the damage that he unknowingly has done. Toward the end, you begin to notice a change in both his demeanor and appearance. Ribisi, in one of his first starring roles, does a magnificent job in portraying Seth through his metamorphosis.The biggest flaw in this movie is the romance between Seth and Abbie (Nia Long). I felt the movie could have better without it as it only really slowed down an otherwise fast-paced and entertaining movie. Its only purpose is to create tension between Seth and Greg (which never gets resolved) and to set Seth up for the ultimate betrayal (which could have been done by other means).By the end, you (and Seth) begin to ask the question of What if. Although the ending is a little bit disappointing, you definitely feel that sitting through the movie was two hours very well spent. The snappy dialog and colorful characters alone make it well worth-watching.

Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers Eddie Adams working as a waiter at a club. After partying with Jack Horner and his many friends and associates, including Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) whom he befriends and strikes a close relationship with, Eddie Adams decides to go by and stick with the title Dirk Diggler. Dirk Diggler becomes a hit due to his size and charm, and the notoriety and money comes along with it. Not everything is perfect, however, in this colorful and lively landscape, and when things go from bad to worse the story continues to follow everyone from their rise and fall, from their attempts at their ambitions to their dangerous habits. Horner and company find themselves in a world of chaos and confusion, and Dirk Diggler along with Reed Rothchild end up doing no better.Boogie Nights is brilliant and bizarre, frightening and funny, creative and compelling. It's one of the greatest films of the 90s and Paul Thomas Anderson is as talented and as ambitious a filmmaker as Stanley Kubrick. Part of what makes Boogie Nights so brilliant is the cast. There isn't a single performance here that is weak. Everyone is given enough screen time to really digest and express their characters that they play. There is a lot of character development here as the cast is huge. It's simply astounding how much we learn about so many characters. There's a lot going on throughout the film, but we never feel distracted by anything else. Every character has so much depth, so much personality, and so much truth that you almost never really want to leave them. This is the kind of film that could go on for multiple hours and it would never get any less entertaining. From the opening shot of the film we are in this world. We meet nearly all of the main characters in the opening shot of the film, and there isn't a single mannerism that comes across as false. Paul Thomas Anderson isn't trying to strike any sort of personal truth with this film It is simply about a large family who have ambitions and have dreams, but because they have gotten involved in this world and have become a part of this world they have alienated themselves for greater things. We realize these things almost immediately, and the film is about these characters coming to realize these things as well. It's a coming-of-age film that just so happens to take place in the porno film industry. Along the way we get several references to the life and times of porn actor John Holmes. There's a hilarious scene in which Dirk Diggler has a documentary made about his life and we see Dirk say the same words that John Holmes said in an infamous interview that hinted at the fact that Holmes embellished the truth about a lot of aspects of his career. It is absolutely hilarious, and Mark Wahlberg does an outstanding job in the role. We see a lot of these kinds of mannerisms throughout the film from Dirk, and it all rings so true and so sad. Burt Reynolds does an equally brilliant job. I dislike him as an actor, but his work here is full of depth and subtlety. I like how Anderson doesn't judge his characters. If anyone is going to make a film about the porno industry, THIS is the way to do it! If there is anything wrong with the film, it is that Anderson doesn't quite go far enough. I liked this film a lot, but I wanted to LOVE it. Anderson keeps his camera at a distance from all of his characters and all of the events, and while it is an effective technique and it is a strong and effective technique, it also keeps the viewers from being able to get really involved with the world of this film. We, as the audience, are not invited to REALLY sink our teeth into this subject matter. As a result, by the end of the film, you are left feeling a little cold. These aren't the kinds of characters you really want to re-visit. I have the same problem with The Godfather. I think Paul Thomas Anderson was still trying to get used to the technique of filming a large cast. He did eventually perfect the technique with Magnolia, but it's something you have to really get used to if you're going to ENJOY this film. I think it's a great film. I think it's a little overrated. I think that it is, at times, very disturbing and I am baffled that this got away with an R rating while Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, & Her Lover got an NC-17, but nevertheless, it's a great film. It really showcases Anderson's skills and confidence as a director, and, while you may not actually like the film, you will certainly admire it to death.

This was, of course, the career-maker for two of Hollywood's biggest stars, and an inspiration to young would-be filmmakers.One element that has not, perhaps, received as much attention is the degree to which this movie deconstructs for the audience one of its primary tropes what it means to be educated. As an educator, I find the point a crucial one, and one which elevates this movie from the merely very good to the level of important.There is certainly a simple surface reading, in several scenes in which the audience is explicitly told that it is individual talent, ambition, and personal character which make for genius, not just a collection of degrees after your name from a prestigious university. The best of these is the scene early on at the bar, as Matt Damon's Will Hunting character dresses down one preppie pseudo-intellectual after another, revealing that the 'education' they have received could have been bettered at any local library. It's funny, and it's true education doesn't happen when you get an A in a class, it happens when you internalize a bit of knowledge so thoroughly that you can integrate it, on the fly, with other material, as Hunting proceeds to do in a blistering (and hilarious) verbal assault.But just as important is the subtext of Damon's character's story-arc as he proceeds from working-Joe to star-pupil. Rather than being seduced by the prospect of grants, lab-space, or prestigious employment which his degree could net him, Hunting chooses to pursue his principles (and the love of his life). It could be a ham-handed, overly dramatic feel-good moment, but it's not because Hunting doesn't arrive at this decision by giving up his brains and following his heart. Quite the opposite. His decision is almost cold-bloodedly rational. It is arrived at after much debate, external and internal, and a number of quotes, statistics, anecdotes and analogies are forwarded from both sides of the debate it's an instance of education in action, not as a bloodless, disconnected ivory-tower theory, but as a living model for our lives.

But after I watched Cube Zero the other night, I decided that I HAD to see it, and that the time was now. I expected a decent movie something atmospheric and intelligent, but largely nothing I hadn't seen before. What I got, instead, was an unexpected cinematic gem, far better than most other movies.The acting was great, not excellent by any means, but still of a very high caliber. The two most memorable deserve special mentioning.Nicole de Boer (Jone Leaven The Math Student) did an outstanding job. She had a solid and believable performance throughout the entire film. She was very steady, and even made actions as mundane as her thinking for extended periods of time enjoyable.Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin The Cop) gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance as a man who sinks deeper and deeper into depraved madness. in most cases, actors given this kind of role will make their characters descend into madness far too quickly. While he might have overacted a little from time to time, he gave a extremely well-paced performance and believably portrayed his characters increasing insanity.Personally, I found these actors\/actresses all far above average and more than competent in their roles. I'm actually surprised that they haven't gone on to at least be recognizable mid-name actors. A special mention should be given to whoever did the casting. They did an absolutely perfect job at choosing the roles.The direction was simple, yet effective. It used a style that reminded me very much of Alfred Hitchcock minimalist, but maximizing every aspect of the film. Vincenzo Natali created a powerful and thick environment; tense and atmospheric. Even moreso than the crew, I would have expected him to have become a much greater success than he is now.Natali also wrote the script which, like his direction, is simple and effective. 7 people wake up in a labyrinth of trapped cubes and must find their way out. The cast is small, the premise simple, and the dangers evident. And yet these are all its greatest strengths. With a small cast, every danger, every death, means much more than if there was a larger cast. Also, with a smaller cast there's much more time to develop each character, which the script maximizes upon. The simplicity of the script, the almost bare danger, makes it all the more terrifying. You know the rules, you know what's going to happen, and you know that there's no way to avoid it.The emptiness of the cube, the isolation from anything and everything else, is felt in every passing minute. The utter pointlessness of it all is as thoroughly maddening to the audience as it is to the characters. This, however, gives every action more meaning, and adds to the film's overall tone. The dark colors of the various rooms add to heavy and dismal atmosphere. The emptiness beyond the cube creates a further sense of isolation. And the powerful message at the end of the film (which I won't spoil for anybody), the bitter-sweet irony of it all, is what makes this such an excellent film.Overall, this is a classic sci-fi thriller. It's a definite must-see for science fiction and horror fans, as well as fans of powerful human drama.

Flipping through the channels on a hotel television, I came across the film during the final chase scene and, upon first glance, it made absolutely no sense. How was the guy being chased in two places at once? What were those creatures attacking that ship? What's with him stopping the bullets? Incidentally, I ran into this same spot two nights in a row.When I actually came around to seeing the entire movie (on television yet again) in sequence several years later, I began to realize how great it actually was. I must have watched all the replays each time I clicked on the television. This would later be coupled with my general love for the trilogy that spawned about a year ago at this time.I've seen some of the comments from people who disliked the movie. They either didn't get it or said it was overrated. The latter has gained more prominence since everyone and their mom has spoofed the once unique Bullet Time sequence and the general themes of The Matrix. It's kind of sad that the repetition of third parties has detracted from the masterpiece and brilliance of Bullet Time, which was a revolutionary piece of art. I still love watching it (along with the rest of the movie), and I wish I could go back in time to the day the movie was released just to sit with the audience and hear their reactions as Neo bent backwards, slowly dodging and weaving out of the way of the bullets. Beautiful.To further comment on the detractions of the film, I have to say that you either got it and loved the movie or sat there and hated it. There's no happy medium for this film it seems, though I don't think the Wachowski Brothers mind. To be honest, there are small flaws within the movie, but it never detracts from my viewing experience.But even with all the fight scenes and special effects, what's a movie without actors? Keanu Reeves (Neo\/Thomas Anderson) is not someone you would normally pick to play heavy roles, and many can't get past Keanu's spaced demeanor. Sure, it's definitely a laugh to poke fun at it (Whoa!), but within the context of The Matrix, he's perfect. Neo, as others have described him, is the Silent Buddha type he'll lead more through his actions than with lengthy speeches. If Neo were completely confident, brash, and outspoken, it would be hard to root for him. Thank God Will Smith chose Wild Wild West, eh? Laurence Fishburne embodies Morpheus, the cool-headed leader with the greatest of faith in the prophecy of the One. Morpheus is brought to life by Fishburne and it's hard to imagine anyone else trying to fill that role. The same goes for Carrie-Ann Moss, who convinced me as Trinity that she can and most likely WILL kick your ass, whether you like it or not. Furthermore, she compliments Keanu's laid back style with her own intense approach. I suppose that's why, within the film, Trinity is drawn to Neo.To be honest, Hugo Weaving should get more credit for his role as Agent Smith. Smith helps carry the weight of the second half of the film along with Neo. Weaving effectively gives the Agent his confident, silently-smirking-at-you-constantly demeanor that parallels Neo's character. Much of the appeal of The Matrix undoubtedly comes from Weaving's performance in terms of mass media. If you put on a black suit with shades, almost everyone knows who you are.The most underrated performance is that of the late Gloria Foster, who portrays The Oracle. She absolutely nails down the character of the all-knowing, disarming grandmotherly woman who is not only witty, but also blunt and to the point. The scene where The Oracle and Neo meet is a very nice exchange, with each actor carrying their own parts appropriately.The best scene? Boy, that's a tough one. I could pick almost any scene in the movie and say why it's good. The best dialogue scenes would have to be either the interrogation with the Agents and Neo, Morpheus revealing in the Construct what the Matrix is, the before mentioned Oracle\/Neo scene, or Smith's interrogation of Morpheus. And I'm just slimming down my list here, folks! The best action scene, I believe, is the subway showdown between Neo and Smith. Sure, the rooftop scene had the famous Bullet Time shot, and the helicopter ride was intense, but this sequence is one of THE best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen. There are nice little touches, including the Old West-esquire showdown that occurs just prior to the fight. The Lobby Scene should not be forgotten either as it was a beautiful piece of cinematography.In the end, The Matrix is one of the greatest achievements in modern film making. It's not the greatest film of all time, but in the scope of science fiction, action films, and modern movies (within the last two decades), it ranks among the greats. The Matrix sets the bar for future films of its type.

I suppose that's why, within the film, Trinity is drawn to Neo.To be honest, Hugo Weaving should get more credit for his role as Agent Smith. Smith helps carry the weight of the second half of the film along with Neo. Weaving effectively gives the Agent his confident, silently-smirking-at-you-constantly demeanor that parallels Neo's character. Much of the appeal of The Matrix undoubtedly comes from Weaving's performance in terms of mass media. If you put on a black suit with shades, almost everyone knows who you are.The most underrated performance is that of the late Gloria Foster, who portrays The Oracle. She absolutely nails down the character of the all-knowing, disarming grandmotherly woman who is not only witty, but also blunt and to the point. The scene where The Oracle and Neo meet is a very nice exchange, with each actor carrying their own parts appropriately.The best scene? Boy, that's a tough one. I could pick almost any scene in the movie and say why it's good. The best dialogue scenes would have to be either the interrogation with the Agents and Neo, Morpheus revealing in the Construct what the Matrix is, the before mentioned Oracle\/Neo scene, or Smith's interrogation of Morpheus. And I'm just slimming down my list here, folks! The best action scene, I believe, is the subway showdown between Neo and Smith. Sure, the rooftop scene had the famous Bullet Time shot, and the helicopter ride was intense, but this sequence is one of THE best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen. There are nice little touches, including the Old West-esquire showdown that occurs just prior to the fight. The Lobby Scene should not be forgotten either as it was a beautiful piece of cinematography.In the end, The Matrix is one of the greatest achievements in modern film making. It's not the greatest film of all time, but in the scope of science fiction, action films, and modern movies (within the last two decades), it ranks among the greats. The Matrix sets the bar for future films of its type.

Flipping through the channels on a hotel television, I came across the film during the final chase scene and, upon first glance, it made absolutely no sense. How was the guy being chased in two places at once? What were those creatures attacking that ship? What's with him stopping the bullets? Incidentally, I ran into this same spot two nights in a row.When I actually came around to seeing the entire movie (on television yet again) in sequence several years later, I began to realize how great it actually was. I must have watched all the replays each time I clicked on the television. This would later be coupled with my general love for the trilogy that spawned about a year ago at this time.I've seen some of the comments from people who disliked the movie. They either didn't get it or said it was overrated. The latter has gained more prominence since everyone and their mom has spoofed the once unique Bullet Time sequence and the general themes of The Matrix. It's kind of sad that the repetition of third parties has detracted from the masterpiece and brilliance of Bullet Time, which was a revolutionary piece of art. I still love watching it (along with the rest of the movie), and I wish I could go back in time to the day the movie was released just to sit with the audience and hear their reactions as Neo bent backwards, slowly dodging and weaving out of the way of the bullets. Beautiful.To further comment on the detractions of the film, I have to say that you either got it and loved the movie or sat there and hated it. There's no happy medium for this film it seems, though I don't think the Wachowski Brothers mind. To be honest, there are small flaws within the movie, but it never detracts from my viewing experience.But even with all the fight scenes and special effects, what's a movie without actors? Keanu Reeves (Neo\/Thomas Anderson) is not someone you would normally pick to play heavy roles, and many can't get past Keanu's spaced demeanor. Sure, it's definitely a laugh to poke fun at it (Whoa!), but within the context of The Matrix, he's perfect. Neo, as others have described him, is the Silent Buddha type he'll lead more through his actions than with lengthy speeches. If Neo were completely confident, brash, and outspoken, it would be hard to root for him. Thank God Will Smith chose Wild Wild West, eh? Laurence Fishburne embodies Morpheus, the cool-headed leader with the greatest of faith in the prophecy of the One. Morpheus is brought to life by Fishburne and it's hard to imagine anyone else trying to fill that role. The same goes for Carrie-Ann Moss, who convinced me as Trinity that she can and most likely WILL kick your ass, whether you like it or not.

Although Batman 89 remains my favourite over the entire franchise (old and new) I'd never really appreciated just how facile the second instalment was.I'd always liked Returns as a child simply because it was a Batman film. I'd never understood or appreciated the intelligence and artistic style of how it was put together. The entire film is resembles a sad poem. The characters always craved something more than they had but were always cursed never to find retribution.Tim Burton has received plenty of criticism via the use of hindsight for never having explored the true character of Bruce Wayne. I think, perhaps, that is something that works in his favour. Burton's Wayne is an enigma, someone we just can't understand and at all and Michael Keaton pulls this off splendidly. We can see in Keaton's face that there is always a deep rooted pain in every menial action he makes. It is an absolute pity that Burton wasn't allowed to do a 3rd Batman film because that could have made something really special. I'd hazard a guess and say that it would have been a film primarily about Batman, and his battle with his inner demons and origin, thus making the perfect trilogy. Needless to say Warner Brothers felt the need to mess with something that was working.The Catwoman is a divine character. It is typical Tim Burton in the scene where she is pushed from the window and her origin is put into place. Unlike Selina Kyle, Catwoman is sexually heightened, confident and mysterious. She is everything Selina wants to be. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is wonderful. It is no wonder that we believe Batman to have fallen for her, she almost mirrors him as a character and he says so at the final confrontation We're the same. Split, right down the centre. Danny DeVito also pulls of an Oscar winning performance as the disgusting and rejected Penguin. Underneath his ambitious self, he is merely a horny teenager wanting to experience a little bit of human life. That is why his story is so compelling and we are almost moved to see him die. If you compare this with Schumacher's Two Face then it makes for a much more interesting villain. Max Shreck was perhaps the face of true evil in this film and he eventually gets his comeuppance. I do enjoy the fact that Batman sees right through Shreck but does nothing. Had any other director had this film then I am sure they would have opted for a confrontation once Bruce had discovered the truth.The movie, altogether I think, is an intelligent dark comedy. As someone has previously mentioned in these reviews it really isn't what you would expect of a Batman film. If you want a version that stays faithful the original idea and is so suave then Begins is the answer. If you are after something a little discrepant then look no further than Tim Burton's versions.

It's brilliant and pleasing with a sense of accomplishment. If you haven't seen this one, find the DVD.

He loved his work, and struggled to reach a young upstart, named Vincent a rousing hot-head, with a propensity for blowing it, because of needed ego-strokes. A hard head with ability, but in need of mentoring to save him from himself. 'The Color of money' for me is a man trying not to lose himself in a vastly enveloping world. He is trying to stay alive. He's attempting to keep his life 'in play'. So that he doesn't die a career and identity 'self esteem' death on the side. The 'Color of Money' is a seminal work. It's brilliant and pleasing with a sense of accomplishment. If you haven't seen this one, find the DVD. I rate it a 10 for excellence.(****) ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"24 July 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" From the first part, this counterpart actually grips me more and takes me to a better understanding than the proceeding. I am not a Tom Cruise Fan, and I guess Paul did make it a lot better than a 'Tom movie', thank God. But This aging 'dinosaur', who is making a comeback on the pool-circuit has a new hotshot, in the picture, (that being Tom of course) that is great, but green as anything. Being and acting on the mind that he (Fellson) has...he pursues an idea to take and mentor this 'grandstander' who already has a lot of talent. If he can teach him. The jury isn't out yet on that one though. But I was in awe of this movie even before I took an interest in writing. The images of Newman, are so powerful to me, taking a hold of my mind with an encapsulating effectiveness. As I took new interest in a story that would have otherwise board me, I saw a man attempting to hold onto his own life in the process. He, a business man and a hustler, a sensitive lover and still a player, but faithful to all, how rare.

His wife i think he did once upon a time have a deep affection for whether it was love or not thats hard to say. I think as he got bigger and more famous he lost track of feelings and was true to no one but himself, i do however think he did love Curt as he wanted to work with him and have him be apart of his life and music, but i think that his manager and others around made him see things different, i also don't think when it came to his career he always thought of himself as much as he let people pull him along with what they wanted him to be. Turning him into something cold and unfeeling as it went along, i think when Curt left he just got colder and unfeeling inside not caring about anyone anymore other than what he wanted, what he could have and what was available to him. As for Authur i think he was all gone over Curt, and i think he might have given Curt some real connection as far as just being with him and not a star, he saw him as he was in front of him. and Authur was infatuated with both men i think. You could see that from his scene in his room(when he got caught) It was a bright, musical movie with a lot of movement. It was creative and not dull at all. I'm not much of Christian Bale fan, i don't care for him in nothing he's in, hes the same in every movie its like you can see that hes acting. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was great in this movie, from everything he did to every new look he held, their were moments when he was even beautiful.. and he came across wonderfully. Ewan McGregor i don't think i will ever see the same. It was stunning and shocking at time, he did however a brilliant job as showing us his emotions and the personality of his character. Altho it was an odd movie it was engrossing and interesting to see. His wife however i felt bad for she loved him unconditionally and got treated like crap, she was tossed out and thrown aside like she was nothing. It was sad to see that, Toni Collete did an awesome job though. If you want to see a movie that different, i would say watch this one. And i don't think as much as it would be great to see Brian and Curt together, they are two people who even may have loved one another wouldn't have been good for one another. They were my fav couple out of the men of course.

Gore, homemade flamethrower, Chainsaws, does it get any better! The movie picks up 7 years later when Mike gets out of the loony bin, and meets up with Reggie to pursue the Tall Man and his army of creatures. This movie is great as I said above it has it all, but the only thing I pegged it down to a nine for is the acting some of the acting is weak, the script too. I loved they used more flying spheres in this movie, and added a little more gore new monsters it's a new ride from the first! I recommend this in a heartbeat if you loved the first one like I did this movie is awesome, trust me. My last thought It's great could I say this anymore!
