And then the movie begins in more earnest with the rise and triumph of the title character. The production values seem to never flag from the moment we arrive in Africa (shot in Morocco and Jordan, mostly), with embracing scenery, huge casts of extras (and horses), unusual levels of excitement that seem historically about right, and some intensely wonderful acting.This is a gutsy, highly polished British movie from the end of the great Golden Age of this kind of great dramatic style. The story is fascinating and grand, and the scenery is absolutely one of the central points throughout. You get sucked in and swept away with all the huge wide and often silent desert landscapes. And most of all, the story is astounding. It's about a man who is exceptional--a real man, not Bruce Willis in some office tower.Peter O'Toole is at his best here. David Lean, the director, seemed to know how to keep him both rebellious and restrained. (If you see a later film, like The Ruling Class, you'll see a typical overcooked performance from O'Toole, equally remarkable I suppose but less finessed.) This portrayal of the daring British military officer in the Arabian desert is not meant to be perfectly factual (there are lots of battles about the facts, online and even in the opening scenes of the movie), it's meant to be moving and historically significant, and historically close enough.And it's personally impressive. This is a story that takes place on two main levels. One is the man's new understanding of the politics of the mideast in the 1910s and 20s. The other is the man himself, this wild and cunning and sometimes fearless and sometimes almost insane man who is able to adapt to Arab life and enter its problems from within and yet still remain thoroughly British in his attitudes. It's quite something to see, and O'Toole makes it believable more than you'd expect. If you met the real Lawrence of Arabia you might object that he's not playing his part quite right.The movie also has lasting importance as the Arab world (or the Middle East as it is still called) goes through more political change. It makes what Lawrence accomplished all the more profound. You might say that if he hadn't done it someone else would have, that the rise of Arab power we inevitable. Maybe. But that's not what happened, and this is. In a way, the whole movie is about Lawrence trying to unify the Arabs. His goal at first is to defeat the Turks who are occupying Arabia, but it eventually becomes more personal. He identifies with the plight of the Arabs but never quite becomes one.There are things that bring this down to earth a little, especially the playing with clichés (the photographer is good but sort of patched on, and some of the Arab characters are thinly sketched). But there is a host of wonderful actors, the one true Middle Easterner being Omar Sharif (he's Egyptian by birth, and he's quite good here). The other main ones are such good actors you don't quite remember they are English to the core--Alec Guinness and Claude Rains (quite old here, but still wonderful). Anthony Quinn (originally Mexican) is really good though his fake nose needed some better color--a weird thing for them to mess up on in a hugely complicated movie like this.Most of all it's O'Toole and more O'Toole, appropriately. A penetrating, original, almost possessed performance within a gorgeous, long but not too long film.

What really matters here, first and foremost, is the movie's depiction of life in Mexico and Mexico City, and what we see is a scary place. I would not want to live there. These depictions are effective, but also somewhat heavy-handed, labored and obvious. The movie is a slow-going slog at times, with a good deal of repetition, especially in the first story.

People are seeking meaning or redemption in love of their fellow human beings, in their connections with others, and they are not finding it. In one story, a man has replaced love of human beings with love of his dogs. This brings him misery, however. Instead they are finding violence in the attempt to be happy on the temporal earthly plane via their connections with others or nature or any earthly thing such as success and applause and renown.The movie does not offer an explanation for this misdirected activity and it doesn't offer a way out of it and beyond it, but the general outlines of these are clear.

With nods to the Twilight Zone and The Wizard of Oz with Freddy Krueger featuring as the witch with in the first five minutes you know this is more of nightmare adventure than a horror.Some strong visual effects are sadly brought down by some less effective ones. Thankfully The Final Nightmare benefits from a 1080p makeover with the now redundant 3D segments looking balanced. Director and long-time Newline employee Rachel Talalay takes the helm with producer Rob Shay putting in a humorous cameo early doors. Although the tone seems inconsistent Talalay delivers and an array of tracking shots and thought-out compositions . There's more of a real dreamlike feel in some scenes but it delivers very few shocks or surprises. The twist and insight into Freddy's past- from a child, youth to adulthood makes The Final Nightmare of interest even if the scenes are only brief.The acting is a lot better with the lead teens surprising good alongside the likes of Lisa Green and Yaphet Kotto as Doc. Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr cameo as well as Alice Cooper as Mr. Underwood. In addition, Johnny Depp (who starred in the original and by now a big star) cameos and fans may feel it's a shame Depp didn't save this for the superior New Nightmare.Brian May's (not of the band Queen) score has all the familiar cues you expect and gives the film much of the required chills in the unsurprising death set pieces. In a nice round up in the closing credits many of the actors from previous films appear in a Nightmare on Elm Street flashback scene compilation accompanied by Iggy Pop's 'Why Was I Born? (Freddy's Dead)' track.Michael DeLuca's screenplay and Talalay's story tackles some serious issues, the effects of abuse, parenting and the like but this is brushed aside for the Freddy showman factor. Here Robert Englund while excellent as Krueger plays up DeLuca's comedy aspect, unfortunately the makeup on display while slickly done is again on the latex side and rubber looking. The climax delivers a little more blood and action then expected but the final effects take that edge away.This 'final' instalment is more of the dreams of a 50's kid than nightmarish - it's a fun enough entry that gives a fitting yet abrupt end to the child killer.

It's clearly a 'formula' creation - but it's a perfect formula, perfectly executed, with perfect stars and the perfect director. In a way, it's the epitome of the old-school Hollywood studio flick. But it's also much, much more.As a drama, the film is near perfect. The weird triangle of Grant-Arthur-Hayworth is fascinating, yet supported by sub-plots that are all strong enough to be good movies in themselves. We have Mitchell's 'The Kid' fighting to keep his status as a pilot. Barthelmess fighting to return from disgrace. Grant struggling to keep his fledgling airline going. It's all epic stuff, as good as anything the studios produced.But there's also a mythic quality - the 'angels' reference. These are men who are striving to be more than just the sum of their earthly struggles. This is mankind trying to hoist itself up by its bootstraps. To build a wonderful future in one of the most backwards places on the planet.The mystique of aviation is central to that mythology, and perfectly captured by Hawks. As a sometime flier myself, I've been present when aviators have been killed, and seen a similar reaction to what's shown in this film. The risks are accepted up-front, so when something does go wrong there's no pause in the conversation. Everything continues, almost as if nothing had happened. The one actual flying sequence in the film, where Barthelmess lands and takes off on a tiny mesa, is not only spectacular in itself (as executed by the great Paul Mantz), it's absolutely true to the kind of flying that bush pilots continue to engage in, even today. Hawks clearly knew his stuff.Then there are the film's cinematic merits. Largely filmed on sets, it has an oddly claustrophobic feel. These characters live in a hell-world of jungle heat and stark black shadows, waiting desperately to soar into the sunlight. The musical interludes are haunting, on a par with the 'Play It Again' sequence in Casablanca. And the performances are gigantic. Grant, in particular, was never better, perfectly evoking flippant humor as a mask over deep sadness.This is a 'romantic' film in the grandest sense. It's one of my favorite films of all time, and certainly one of the best Hollywood films of all time. It may seem a bit dated, or melodramatic to modern audiences, but to me that sense of distance only adds to its charm. This is a film that's mellowed with age, gained depth and complexity.

Renoir did it in La Règle du jeu. People playing different roles - master and servant, husband and lover, poacher and grounds-keeper, break for their roles and connect with each other. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and has been in AFI Top 10 since it was released.Faces is the anti-thesis of La Règle du jeu. Here to the player stop playing their parts but instead of connecting with each other, they distance themselves from each other. So we have husband and wife, married woman and a gigolo, married man and a prostitute, all breaking their roles but to distance themselves even more from each other. In process they reveal how the very roles are a sham, that we just play out of habit, convenience and society. It challenges our very lives.Of course, this makes for a very nasty picture but with incredible moments of truth. It is very honest and very depressing and a very hard watch while still being fascinating. Its the kind of picture that you appreciate more than you enjoy.

The British Empire goes to war with Transvaal and Oranje, two independent republics in South Africa. Transvaal and Oranje are ruled by the Boers, descendants of Dutch settlers. The British want to colonise South Africa for the usual reasons to acquire rich mineral deposits (specifically gold), deny other European nations the same, and to establish a staging ground to strengthen their hegemonic rule over the African continent. To this day, similar colonialist manoeuvres, largely ignored, continue across Africa.The Empire initially expects its little war to be nothing more than a colonial police action, but the Boers prove to be tough opponents. Using various guerrilla tactics, the Boer resistance manages to stretch the war out for a number of years. By 1889, over half a million British soldiers are stationed in South Africa. As news about the Empire's actions start to filter back to Britain &#x96; the British were essentially engaged in genocide, massacring civilians and setting up huge concentration camps &#x96; the British public began to raise protests. An anti-British coalition between France, Germany and Russia begins to form, ostensibly to lend humanitarian aide but really for their own Colonialist purposes.Determined to end the war as swiftly as possible, Lord Kitchener, a British Field Marshall, creates numerous special commando groups. These commandos are given carte blanch to rape and licentiously kill Boers. One such unit is the Bushveldt Carbineers, populated by several Australians, including Lieutenant Harry Breaker Morant. In total, 16000 Australians saw service along with 6500 New Zealanders.The fighting continues. Germany threatens to enter the war under the guise of protecting South African civilian populations from the unorthodox military tactics and civilian internment programs of the British forces. In response Britain cooks up a plan to end all hostilities. They will charge Lieutenant Morant, and several others, with having committed war crimes. The gesture is meant to be seen as a peace offering, a symbolic gesture which will end all hostilities and reconcile all nations. More importantly, it will give Germany no pretext for entering South Africa (she had been arming the Boers for over half a decade). Australia also supports the trial; the execution of these men will prove that she is a newly independent nation, a mature, modern state worthy of joining other big boy nations. Yeah right.Based on a stage-play by Kenneth Ross, Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant is a legal drama centring on the trial of Morant and several of his fellow commandos. In the UK, upon release, the film was read as another bit of anti-Empire, anti-Britania bashing, then in vogue. In America it was treated as being about Vietnam (particularly the Mai Lai massacre), whilst in Australia its oft viewed as being about a poor, victimized Australia, a nation which paid a horrible price for being loyal to the British Empire. Morant is himself typically viewed as an Australian folk-hero, a brave guy scapegoated by evil Brits for doing his duty and who dies nobly against an exquisite sunrise.Beresford, though, is aiming to say something else. His Morant is a good guy, a poet and intellectual who is sacrificed on the altar of political expediency and who is corrupted and made monstrous by the very institution of war. The British and Australians, meanwhile, are hypocritical power brokers who execute men for crimes which the state itself sanctions. This is the chief interest of the film. Beresford isn't interested in condemning Imperialism but in chewing on the hypocrisy of an Empire which condemns soldiers for violence which it itself promotes. The Colonialist, then, has an ethical compass which points any direction but always for the same reason to preserve Colonialism.Though at times powerful, Breaker Morant's overly verbose, Beresford can't escape his story's stage-play origins, all points are signposted, characters take too long to say the same things, the film's audience is always several steps ahead of a script which hermetically seals up all issues, Beresford's anti-Christianity is too heavy-handed, characters are turned into walking mouthpieces, there is little ambiguity or nuance, and Beresford's aesthetic is one of predictable shot\/reverse shot patterns, which are themselves predictably opened out by periodic flashbacks or attempts at pseudo-monumental compositions. It's not only that the film isn't formally adventurous, but that it says all the right things in a lowbrow manner, less righteously indignant than predictably righteous.Elsewhere historical subtleties are erased. The Boers are given no voice (the ethics of killing Boers is likewise pushed aside), the fact that they were themselves apartheid-loving is ignored, Black Africans are, of course, absent and Morant and his gang are presented as underdogs (Morant was a violent racist, described by his biographer as a con man, a cheat, a barefaced liar, the greatest male chauvinist pig of all time, an exhibitionist, racist and sadist and who joined the forces specifically to kill Boers). The film's ancestors are Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory and Joseph Losey's King and Country. Kubrick's film, machine-like, foreboding and portentous, dealt with a French state which views its subjects as ants, which sacrifices soldiers on the battlefield for meaningless lumps of dirt, and which then executes them for refusing to do the same. Like Beresford's film, soldiers exist in a twisted double bind. Losey's film, meanwhile, deals specifically with the British class system. Here, a soldier is charged for abandoning his post, is viewed with scorn by his upper class lawyer and is finally executed at the hands of the British class system; despite being an exemplary soldier in all respects, our hero is deemed disposable solely because he is not a member of the ruling classes.In 1902 the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed, adding Boer territory to yet another domain of pink on the British Imperial map.7.9\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

Morant is himself typically viewed as an Australian folk-hero, a brave guy scapegoated by evil Brits for doing his duty and who dies nobly against an exquisite sunrise.Beresford, though, is aiming to say something else. His Morant is a good guy, a poet and intellectual who is sacrificed on the altar of political expediency and who is corrupted and made monstrous by the very institution of war. The British and Australians, meanwhile, are hypocritical power brokers who execute men for crimes which the state itself sanctions. This is the chief interest of the film. Beresford isn't interested in condemning Imperialism but in chewing on the hypocrisy of an Empire which condemns soldiers for violence which it itself promotes. The Colonialist, then, has an ethical compass which points any direction but always for the same reason to preserve Colonialism.Though at times powerful, Breaker Morant's overly verbose, Beresford can't escape his story's stage-play origins, all points are signposted, characters take too long to say the same things, the film's audience is always several steps ahead of a script which hermetically seals up all issues, Beresford's anti-Christianity is too heavy-handed, characters are turned into walking mouthpieces, there is little ambiguity or nuance, and Beresford's aesthetic is one of predictable shot\/reverse shot patterns, which are themselves predictably opened out by periodic flashbacks or attempts at pseudo-monumental compositions. It's not only that the film isn't formally adventurous, but that it says all the right things in a lowbrow manner, less righteously indignant than predictably righteous.Elsewhere historical subtleties are erased. The Boers are given no voice (the ethics of killing Boers is likewise pushed aside), the fact that they were themselves apartheid-loving is ignored, Black Africans are, of course, absent and Morant and his gang are presented as underdogs (Morant was a violent racist, described by his biographer as a con man, a cheat, a barefaced liar, the greatest male chauvinist pig of all time, an exhibitionist, racist and sadist and who joined the forces specifically to kill Boers). The film's ancestors are Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory and Joseph Losey's King and Country. Kubrick's film, machine-like, foreboding and portentous, dealt with a French state which views its subjects as ants, which sacrifices soldiers on the battlefield for meaningless lumps of dirt, and which then executes them for refusing to do the same. Like Beresford's film, soldiers exist in a twisted double bind. Losey's film, meanwhile, deals specifically with the British class system. Here, a soldier is charged for abandoning his post, is viewed with scorn by his upper class lawyer and is finally executed at the hands of the British class system; despite being an exemplary soldier in all respects, our hero is deemed disposable solely because he is not a member of the ruling classes.In 1902 the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed, adding Boer territory to yet another domain of pink on the British Imperial map.7.9\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The British Empire goes to war with Transvaal and Oranje, two independent republics in South Africa. Transvaal and Oranje are ruled by the Boers, descendants of Dutch settlers. The British want to colonise South Africa for the usual reasons to acquire rich mineral deposits (specifically gold), deny other European nations the same, and to establish a staging ground to strengthen their hegemonic rule over the African continent. To this day, similar colonialist manoeuvres, largely ignored, continue across Africa.The Empire initially expects its little war to be nothing more than a colonial police action, but the Boers prove to be tough opponents. Using various guerrilla tactics, the Boer resistance manages to stretch the war out for a number of years. By 1889, over half a million British soldiers are stationed in South Africa. As news about the Empire's actions start to filter back to Britain &#x96; the British were essentially engaged in genocide, massacring civilians and setting up huge concentration camps &#x96; the British public began to raise protests. An anti-British coalition between France, Germany and Russia begins to form, ostensibly to lend humanitarian aide but really for their own Colonialist purposes.Determined to end the war as swiftly as possible, Lord Kitchener, a British Field Marshall, creates numerous special commando groups. These commandos are given carte blanch to rape and licentiously kill Boers. One such unit is the Bushveldt Carbineers, populated by several Australians, including Lieutenant Harry Breaker Morant. In total, 16000 Australians saw service along with 6500 New Zealanders.The fighting continues. Germany threatens to enter the war under the guise of protecting South African civilian populations from the unorthodox military tactics and civilian internment programs of the British forces. In response Britain cooks up a plan to end all hostilities. They will charge Lieutenant Morant, and several others, with having committed war crimes. The gesture is meant to be seen as a peace offering, a symbolic gesture which will end all hostilities and reconcile all nations. More importantly, it will give Germany no pretext for entering South Africa (she had been arming the Boers for over half a decade). Australia also supports the trial; the execution of these men will prove that she is a newly independent nation, a mature, modern state worthy of joining other big boy nations. Yeah right.Based on a stage-play by Kenneth Ross, Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant is a legal drama centring on the trial of Morant and several of his fellow commandos.
