I still recall seeing Star Wars as a child with my parents and it blew me away. I have never collected the figures or read any of the books I love to watch the movies. There are many films I enjoy from the Shrek to Lord of the Rings have all been favorites of mine. My personal favorite Star Wars goes like this Empire, A New Hope, Jedi-didn't like the muppets much, and then Phantom Menace. Films in my home collection run from Gladiator to James Bond and the Mummy. I must say the Phantom Menace was watchable but not a great movie to me. Jar Jar drove me crazy with his slapstick, and my nephews and nieces that I thought would get a buzz from seeing Star Wars thought it just Ok. My wife fell asleep, though she enjoys watching the originals. I recently saw episode two. I loved it, so did my nieces, nephews and wife. The story kept moving along at a good pace. The settings were amazing. If romance was not your cup of tea it would soon move back to Obi's detective story and the last 45mins were a blast. The politics,my nieces and nephews did not seem to understand, but for me were the most interesting part of the story, how everyone was being manipulated. In the Phantom Menace there were some good surroundings but the characters didn't seem to interact with them in this film you could see the depth to the city and felt as part of the locations. I felt actually cold out there in the rain with Obi in part of the movie. The dialogue in the romance scenes was a little corny but I'm used to that from the Star Wars universe, I've also sprouted some pretty corny lines myself when young and in love. The sound and effects especially the sonic mines blew my mind.What I'd love to see is a Lucas produced re-edit of the Phantom Menace with slightly less Jar Jar. I can hardly now wait for the next film and getting the box set of all the DVD's when they come out. This is now on top of my favorite Star Wars movies, equal to Empire and a New Hope I give it 10 out of ten and thank everyone involved for bringing fun and wonder back into the Star Wars universe.

How much time do you think George spent cooking up this snooze-a-loney and cheese sandwhich of a story?  OK, someone is trying to kill Senator Padme (Natalie Portman is extremely hot!) and the trusty Jedi, Obi Wan and his apprentice, Anakin, are sent to protect her and figure out who is out to kill her.  The Republic is dangerously close to collapse and on the verge of a major war with the trade federation.  Are my readers asleep yet?  Well, go see the movie, that will put you to sleep quick enough.That's the basis of the plot, and yes, it sucked.  There is a couple instances in the film that remind us of the STAR WARS of the old days. But they are few and far between, and not nearly as exciting as the originals.Which brings me to a couple of good points, and I will mention them first, before RIPPING THIS FILM TO SHREDS.  Ewan McGregor is the only one who does any real acting in this film.  His character of Obi Wan is flawless and he brings excitement to the screen.  The best part of the movie is when Obi Wan ventures alone to the rain planet and confronts Jango Fett.  (Yes, its Boba's father.  I guess EVERY character in the original movies has to be taking after their FATHERS in these new movies!)  On the water planet, a giant clone army is being created.  All of them, clones of the fearsome bounty hunter, Jango Fett.  This part of the movie gives us insight in to Jango's past and possible future, and it was well done.  It builds up to a decent fight scene between Jango and Obi Wan, where both characters get to show their stuff.  The special effects of the weirdo alien hosts are well done, and the sets appear to be sprawling and well conceived, in a very sci fi style.That's it.  That's all the good stuff.  Now, to take my gloves off.  THIS MOVIE SUCKED!  The ACTING was THE WORST I have EVER seen in a movie theatre, and I saw UNIVERSAL SOLDIER with Jean Claude Van Damm and Dolf Lundgren. OK? I mean, the acting was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!  TO the point of being both irritating and laughable.  The worst actor, of course, being Hayden Christiansen.  Where did this guy go to acting school?  The SEWER?  And Samuel Jackson delivers THE WORST performance of his entire CAREER!But, in the defense of the actors, they had VERY LITTLE to work with.  A good example of a typical, cliche line is Anakin wooing Padme, I don't like the sand.  It's coarse, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.  Not like you.  You are soft and smooth.  OH BROTHER!  PLEASE somebody make him SHUT UP!  But no, he KEEPS ON!  And the worst portion of acting is when Anakin returns from trying to rescue his mother, and he has a little emotional breakdown in front of Padme.  It's no fair!  He whines, Obi Wan is holding me back! I hate the sand people!  I hate them!  Most of the people in the audience where turning their heads from embarassment for the poor actor.Now on to Yoda.  The special effects team did not manage to pull off his fight scene believably.  My head line to this review is a comical quote from one of Yoda's many, many irritating dialogue sequences.  He is sensing some disturbance in the force, and he QUOTES an old STAR TREK line. Pain!...Suffering!  He exclaims.  Remember that STAR TREK episode when Kirk and Spok went in to that cave and confronted that creature made of rock?  And then Spok mind-melded with the creature and he yells to Kirk, Pain...SUFFERING!  I laughed out loud when I heard Yoda repeating that horrible line.All of the fight scenes in this movie are lack-luster.  But, its difficult for an audience member to be excited by a fight scene when you don't care AT ALL about any of the characters on screen.  I think the big problem was that the story failed to give a clear sense of what was at stake.  In the original movies, you knew exactly what was at stake.  The underdog, Luke, had to blow up the Death Star, or else they would blow up the entire planet that the rebel alliance was on.  That's pretty clear.  Also, they had to save the princess.  How clear is that?  Very clear.  So it was easier to care about these characters.  Not to mention, there was a lot of character growth in the original movies.  EPISODE 2 has no character growth whatsoever.Also I noticed that George failed to include some STAR WARS classics.  No one said, Delusions of grandure.  There was no swinging on ropes.  When he finally did work in, I have a bad feeling about this it was EXTREMELY forced!  VERY awkward!Also, watch out for C3Po's TERRIBLE jokes.  He gets his head knocked off, so he says, Oh, I have lost my head!  His head rolls over by his body, he says, I am simply beside myself!  WHO is writing THAT CRAP!!?!? A five year old?  What kind of moron writes a line that is THAT obvious?  In all of Hollywood, George Lucas could not a find a writer to help him come up with something more clever than THAT?!  I have to tell you , I was absolutely SHOCKED to hear lines that were so banal.  Even DISNEY features have better writing than that.So why is it selling so many tickets?  Why all the hype?  Why is everyone so excited?  Well, the fact is, EPISODE 2 is actually better than EPISODE 1. So everyone is excited.  But what does that really say?  If you said, Well, its better than PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE what would that really mean?  PLAN 9 was considered the WORST movie ever made!  EPISODE 1 was SO AWFUL how could any other movie be worse than that?  The fact is, if the name STAR WARS was not attached to this movie, no one would see it.  In fact, no one in their right mind would finance a script so ill-conceived.  So the movie would never have even been made.And just to let you know, yes, Jar Jar is in this movie.  Obviously, George Lucas listened to the millions of people who so vehemently hated that horrible character.  So, Jar Jar's appearance is quite limited.  But, he still remains INCREDIBLY irritating and HARD to watch!  Jar Jar is, by far, the WORST character ever conceived.Jar Jar is also a good metaphor for what has become of the STAR WARS sage. It is over done, poorly written, very obnoxious, and it would not exist without extensive computer special effects over-kill.

Now, to take my gloves off.  THIS MOVIE SUCKED!  The ACTING was THE WORST I have EVER seen in a movie theatre, and I saw UNIVERSAL SOLDIER with Jean Claude Van Damm and Dolf Lundgren. OK? I mean, the acting was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!  TO the point of being both irritating and laughable.  The worst actor, of course, being Hayden Christiansen.  Where did this guy go to acting school?  The SEWER?  And Samuel Jackson delivers THE WORST performance of his entire CAREER!But, in the defense of the actors, they had VERY LITTLE to work with.  A good example of a typical, cliche line is Anakin wooing Padme, I don't like the sand.  It's coarse, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.  Not like you.  You are soft and smooth.  OH BROTHER!  PLEASE somebody make him SHUT UP!  But no, he KEEPS ON!  And the worst portion of acting is when Anakin returns from trying to rescue his mother, and he has a little emotional breakdown in front of Padme.  It's no fair!  He whines, Obi Wan is holding me back! I hate the sand people!  I hate them!  Most of the people in the audience where turning their heads from embarassment for the poor actor.Now on to Yoda.  The special effects team did not manage to pull off his fight scene believably.  My head line to this review is a comical quote from one of Yoda's many, many irritating dialogue sequences.  He is sensing some disturbance in the force, and he QUOTES an old STAR TREK line. Pain!...Suffering!  He exclaims.  Remember that STAR TREK episode when Kirk and Spok went in to that cave and confronted that creature made of rock?  And then Spok mind-melded with the creature and he yells to Kirk, Pain...SUFFERING!  I laughed out loud when I heard Yoda repeating that horrible line.All of the fight scenes in this movie are lack-luster.  But, its difficult for an audience member to be excited by a fight scene when you don't care AT ALL about any of the characters on screen.  I think the big problem was that the story failed to give a clear sense of what was at stake.  In the original movies, you knew exactly what was at stake.  The underdog, Luke, had to blow up the Death Star, or else they would blow up the entire planet that the rebel alliance was on.  That's pretty clear.  Also, they had to save the princess.  How clear is that?  Very clear.  So it was easier to care about these characters.  Not to mention, there was a lot of character growth in the original movies.  EPISODE 2 has no character growth whatsoever.Also I noticed that George failed to include some STAR WARS classics.  No one said, Delusions of grandure.  There was no swinging on ropes.  When he finally did work in, I have a bad feeling about this it was EXTREMELY forced!  VERY awkward!Also, watch out for C3Po's TERRIBLE jokes.  He gets his head knocked off, so he says, Oh, I have lost my head!  His head rolls over by his body, he says, I am simply beside myself!  WHO is writing THAT CRAP!!?!? A five year old?  What kind of moron writes a line that is THAT obvious?  In all of Hollywood, George Lucas could not a find a writer to help him come up with something more clever than THAT?!  I have to tell you , I was absolutely SHOCKED to hear lines that were so banal.  Even DISNEY features have better writing than that.So why is it selling so many tickets?  Why all the hype?  Why is everyone so excited?  Well, the fact is, EPISODE 2 is actually better than EPISODE 1. So everyone is excited.  But what does that really say?  If you said, Well, its better than PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE what would that really mean?  PLAN 9 was considered the WORST movie ever made!  EPISODE 1 was SO AWFUL how could any other movie be worse than that?  The fact is, if the name STAR WARS was not attached to this movie, no one would see it.  In fact, no one in their right mind would finance a script so ill-conceived.  So the movie would never have even been made.And just to let you know, yes, Jar Jar is in this movie.  Obviously, George Lucas listened to the millions of people who so vehemently hated that horrible character.  So, Jar Jar's appearance is quite limited.  But, he still remains INCREDIBLY irritating and HARD to watch!  Jar Jar is, by far, the WORST character ever conceived.Jar Jar is also a good metaphor for what has become of the STAR WARS sage. It is over done, poorly written, very obnoxious, and it would not exist without extensive computer special effects over-kill.

There's plenty of action, although it mostly occurs at the end, and the storylines are well developed through some exposition which may feel tedious to some.  Let's face it -- Star Wars is never going to be mistaken for Wagner's Ring cycle, or even Lord of the Rings, and it's not supposed to be ... it's supposed to be fun, and Clones is, much more so than Phantom Menace.** SPOILERS AHEAD **That said, this movie has several obvious flaws, first and foremost the dialogue.  If Lucas wrote the dialogue himself, he should hire a writer, and if he didn't, he should fire a writer.  Most of the flaws will pass below your radar screen if you're really absorbed into the film, but some lines are so bad that you will roll your eyes.  Most disturbing to me are the lines for C3PO.  In other films, C3PO got laughs for the context in which he was speaking, a natural flow from his nervous character in stressful situations.  This time, he says things like What a drag, which not only have no place in a galaxy far far away, but sound like an attempt to insert humor a la Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Blech.Ewan MacGregor is given some terrible dialogue as well but he handles it well enough that it isn't too jarring.  Speaking of jarring, we were promised that Jar Jar Binks and his unbelievable quasi-Jamaican-pidgin English would be greatly reduced, and it was, but not enough.Another flaw, and in my mind a completely avoidable one, was Anakin's character.  A problem for prequels is that we all know what will happen; the suspense is finding out why and how.  However, Hayden Christenson's Anakin was a jerk from minute one in this film and it undercuts any sympathy we have for him.  It also undercuts our faith in the Jedi, because if they can't see that Anakin is a bad seed, how the heck are they supposed to be powerful and wise?  Why didn't they wait until after Anakin's great tragedy (about 2\/3rds of the way through) to have his resentment and arrogance break through to the surface?  It would have made a lot more sense than his unbridled petulance being almost completely ignored.  Anakin is so unlikeable you almost wish that someone would kick his butt and when it happens, you aren't unhappy about it.  Padme's attraction to him makes no sense; she'd be better suited for Obi-Wan.But there are plenty of good things too, especially Christopher Lee as Count Dooku\/Darth Tyranous (subtle name!) and Temuera Morrison as Jengo Fett. Lee is always outstanding and natural as a villain; he's certainly capping his career with two plums, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars cycles. Morrison is quietly malevolent, a brooding presence who is one of the few in the movie who knows how to underplay for effect.  The Yoda sequence at the end is a great payoff for the audience, and his unchaining from the limitations of puppetry is a huge boost to the story.  There is also a couple of lines set up by the subplot of the Trade Federation, where orders are given to shoot the Federation starships.  You can't tell me that's a coincidence -- it's a funny shot at Star Trek, which not only preceded Lucas but in terms of cultural saturation still surpasses him.  The action -- when it occurs -- is outstanding, very gripping, again a nice payoff for the audience.Attack of the Clones is a worthwhile installment but doesn't come close to the level of Empire Strikes Back, the best episode in the series. Hopefully, Lucas will wrap up the prequels in a way that gets us back there. I can't wait to find out.

Also, this film actually has a very complex and intricate plot.  Unfortunately, Lucas's creativity is much stronger than his screenwriting skills, and the complexity of the plot is overshadowed by the incredibly trite love story and downright awful acting.  Moreover, this movie has the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a film (that's saying a lot), with the exception of B movies like Death Race 2000 and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (even Beyond the Valley of the Dolls had more interesting dialogue).  There is a couple minutes of banter between Padme and Annakin that sounds genuinely as though it could be set to some cheesy pop music and sung by N'SYNC.  The acting by Hayden Christenson is abyssmal -- he turns a character who is as complex as they come and reduces him to a whiny, spoiled brat.  Granted, a lot of this is Lucas's fault -- aside from the horrible dialogue, Lucas chooses to have those horrible pauses (a la soap operas), where the focus is on the character for just a bit too long, just long enough for them to contort their face into some exaggerated look.  Well, Christenson repeats the same stare in these exaggerated pauses a number of times throughout the film, and it becomes quite tiresome, as it is the only time where the viewer might actually think he's trying to act.  Unfortunately, Natalie Portman's Padme does not fair much better, though there are more than a few moments where her acting is believable.  Between the cheesy love story (there is nothing unique about it, aside from its location) and bad dialogue, the first 130hr of the movie is nothing but laughable.  Some of this is intentional (Lucas tries to throw in some clever and humorous foreshadowing, like Obi-Wan saying to Annakin You'll be the death of me someday), but most of it is a result of shoddy acting\/writing.  Even the more serious twists in the film (the death of Annakin's mother, not like you didn't see it coming) are comical just by how over-dramatically they are executed.  However, the last 45 minutes has some of the most fun battle sequences I've watched.It isn't very intense, but the last sequence of the movie is entertaining on an entirely different level.  Throughout the film, there are only a few minor moments where the special effects do not seem a part of the picture -- one is the movements of Yoda while on Coruscant, and the other is the ocean on the alien planet (where they make the clones).  These special effects become the foreground in the last segments of the movie, with some pretty amazing creature animation.  However, Yoda's fight scene at the end returns to the theme of the first 2\/3 of the film -- absurdity.  It has the feeling of the fight scene in the Matrix between Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.  One almost expects Yoda to wave Count Dooku to him; instead, though, we are treated to a fast-forward fight by the most beloved Star Wars character.  There is no doubt in my mind, however, that it was thrown into the film because Lucas wanted to have some fun with it.  In fact, I wonder if that is really how best to explain this movie.There is very little real acting (actually, Ewan McGregor gives a pretty fantastic performance, though Samuel L Jackson still seems out of place and Jimmy Smits is horrible as usual), even less good dialogue, but the special effects are incredible, and overall it is an enjoyable and entertaining film.

Spielberg convincingly adds human traits to the artificially created boy &#145;David' who is taken on and adopted by a family. The irrational behavior ingrained in David is made apparent when he is sitting on the dinner table and forces down food in his body. Ironically, it is the human part in David that becomes the biggest problem for the family to handle. Mother Monica played by Frances O'Connor (II) reluctantly disbands David and so begins David's journey to win back his mothers love by chasing a fairy tale she had once read to him. When David learns that he is not unique, we see a fitting display of human emotions and tantrums by a frustrated boy who refuses to believe that his hopes and dreams were to no avail. The last segment of the film may appear disconnected with the rest of the story, but I believe it raises some interesting questions. How is David's fulfillment of his dreams any different from ours?

At this young, tender age I innocently believed that all comedies were created equal. If a film wanted to make me laugh, it would make me laugh - no questions asked. Truth be told, I can't even remember why I rented it. Perhaps it was because Joe Pesci was in it; if he was funny in HOME ALONE, then surely he'd be funny here. And the movie would be a blast as well.As it turned out, I was right on only one count. Pesci is wonderful in 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG, playing his sadistic mobster shtick to the hilt. However, a little bit of Pesci goes a looooong way halfway into the picture, I realized that his brand of dark comedy had seeped into every comic situation, rendering the movie a sordid mess.I have nothing against dark comedy, but 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG doesn't so much push the envelope as rend it asunder. There is so much vulgarity and mean-spiritedness that I actually began to pity the characters, trapped as they were in their little 1950s sitcom universe from Hell.Joe Pesci notwithstanding, every character in this movie is a loathsome stereotype. We have the naive young man, the squeamish girlfriend, the clueless father, the ditzy wife, the crotchety old grandma, etc. And let's not forget all those hot-blooded Italians and sneaky Mexicans.There was one - only ONE - point where I really surrendered myself to gales of joyful laughter. It was the great comic set-piece wherein Pesci's mobster is asleep and dreams that the eight severed heads of the movie's title come to life and begin singing Mr. Head Man (to the tune of Mr. Sandman) like seasoned recording artists. Then their headless bodies crash through the wall and begin to strangle our hero. I laughed my proverbial butt off at this surreal comic masterpiece. Then the scene ended - and I went back to being not amused again.At the end of the movie, one of the characters tries to make up for nearly two hours of bleak vacuum by spouting a barrage of head puns (Stop a-HEAD, Anyone need to use the HEAD?, etc.) and other corny jokes, some of which were, admittedly, quite clever.

While I am not a conossieur of Woo's cinematic career, after witnessing Mission Impossible II -- a film that was as big a box office success as it was a debacle in the creativity department -- and the superior Face\/Off, I must say that while Woo's talent at putting action onscreen is noteworthy, it seems also his biggest weakness. Under his direction, explosions and stylized cartoon-like violence are sometimes superbly done, sometimes overlong and overblown; but the real problem with Woo's action is when it grows obtrusive and it becomes tedium in a script that should have been tight and tense. Mission Impossible II was all tedium, and it constantly resorted to slow-mo shootings and explosions to hide the fact that the script was as lame as they come. Face\/Off, despite the preposterous premise, has a script that is tight and intense in more than one occasion, but that also goes limp towards the end when more than a few interesting plot points are simply shaken off by action sequences.Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a FBI agent who, during an attempt to stop the notorious master criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) lost his young son. Archer, a man dedicated to his family and his job, struggles with the pain caused by the loss and is looking forward to finally arrest Troy; six years later the occasion finally comes and, after a sensational airplane chase, Archer captures both Castor Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) and Castor Troy himself who, victim of an accident, is taken to an hospital in an apparently irreversible coma. Buth things are not as easy as they seem.Apparently, a major bomb had been planted somewhere in Los Angeles and the two criminal brothers are the only ones who know where it is located and how to disarm it. But as Pollux -- who does not know about his brother's accident -- refuses to reveal any details unless he can speak to Castor, there is nothing left to do but have Sean Archer himself go through a few cosmetic changes, a little bit of liposuction, and a facial surgery to (gulp!) wear Castor Troy's real face! And what if the real Castor Troy suddenly wakes up and 'wears' Archer's face, so that one looks exactly like the other? Yep, you've guessed it right.I heard a lot of people complaining about how 'unrealistic' and 'unbelievable' the premise is. Well people, get over it. Blaming this film of being unrealistic is like blaming Being John Malkovich of the same thing. I am as picky as the next guy when it comes to implausibility, but there are movies meant to be realism and movies that are not. Suspension of disbelief, and tons of it, is obviously essential for Face\/Off.Providing we accept the impossible premise, the film stays for the most part enjoyable, before it eventually goes overboard and becomes a chaotic action overkill. We are provided with a plot, the swap of identities, that has been used a lot of times in cinema and literary works, especially for comedies. Here however, it is used with dramatic efficacy in quite a few scenes, and it delivers some scenes that are emotionally engaging and tense, and that at times even scratch the surface of intellectually challenging material. Not that script is without flaws; the sequence where Sean Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage!) escapes from a maximum security prison, for instance, is quite sloppy and hard to digest. But seeing the two arch-enemies exploring each other's world and trying to cope with it, thereby becoming the other person, is definitely interesting.This also brings me to the bad part of the movie; while Face\/Off does not have the ambition of being a 'thought-provoking' or philosophical movie, I simply do not understand the need of shaking off certain plot points through overlong action scenes whose outcome is absolutely predictable. Also, action -- no matter how well shot -- is involving as long as it is used with parsimony; the initial sequence that leads to the arrest of the Troy brothers is perfect, because it stops before getting tiresome. The final hero vs. villain sequence not only is overlong, but it does not feel right suddenly, everything between the two enemies -- including a hint at emotional attachment to each other's world -- is resolved by a sequence where all the villains die and all the good people stay alive, and where people miss their targets whenever the director feels like we need to see more. It feels as the film is afraid of having become a thriller more than an action movie.The acting by the two leads is fairly good. Neither of them is between my favorite actors, but I enjoyed them much more here than I did in many other movies.Face\/Off is both a moderate success and a moderate failure but, despite all its flaws, gets my recommendation. Although I doubt Woo will ever become one of my favorite directors, I must say that this film gave me the impression that he can, indeed, do good things.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Spoiler Alert Most of the people who like John Woo seem to like him because of his mastery at shooting action scenes.

Although I doubt Woo will ever become one of my favorite directors, I must say that this film gave me the impression that he can, indeed, do good things.6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"26 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Spoiler Alert Most of the people who like John Woo seem to like him because of his mastery at shooting action scenes. While I am not a conossieur of Woo's cinematic career, after witnessing Mission Impossible II -- a film that was as big a box office success as it was a debacle in the creativity department -- and the superior Face\/Off, I must say that while Woo's talent at putting action onscreen is noteworthy, it seems also his biggest weakness. Under his direction, explosions and stylized cartoon-like violence are sometimes superbly done, sometimes overlong and overblown; but the real problem with Woo's action is when it grows obtrusive and it becomes tedium in a script that should have been tight and tense. Mission Impossible II was all tedium, and it constantly resorted to slow-mo shootings and explosions to hide the fact that the script was as lame as they come. Face\/Off, despite the preposterous premise, has a script that is tight and intense in more than one occasion, but that also goes limp towards the end when more than a few interesting plot points are simply shaken off by action sequences.Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a FBI agent who, during an attempt to stop the notorious master criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) lost his young son. Archer, a man dedicated to his family and his job, struggles with the pain caused by the loss and is looking forward to finally arrest Troy; six years later the occasion finally comes and, after a sensational airplane chase, Archer captures both Castor Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) and Castor Troy himself who, victim of an accident, is taken to an hospital in an apparently irreversible coma. Buth things are not as easy as they seem.Apparently, a major bomb had been planted somewhere in Los Angeles and the two criminal brothers are the only ones who know where it is located and how to disarm it. But as Pollux -- who does not know about his brother's accident -- refuses to reveal any details unless he can speak to Castor, there is nothing left to do but have Sean Archer himself go through a few cosmetic changes, a little bit of liposuction, and a facial surgery to (gulp!) wear Castor Troy's real face! And what if the real Castor Troy suddenly wakes up and 'wears' Archer's face, so that one looks exactly like the other? Yep, you've guessed it right.I heard a lot of people complaining about how 'unrealistic' and 'unbelievable' the premise is. Well people, get over it. Blaming this film of being unrealistic is like blaming Being John Malkovich of the same thing. I am as picky as the next guy when it comes to implausibility, but there are movies meant to be realism and movies that are not. Suspension of disbelief, and tons of it, is obviously essential for Face\/Off.Providing we accept the impossible premise, the film stays for the most part enjoyable, before it eventually goes overboard and becomes a chaotic action overkill. We are provided with a plot, the swap of identities, that has been used a lot of times in cinema and literary works, especially for comedies. Here however, it is used with dramatic efficacy in quite a few scenes, and it delivers some scenes that are emotionally engaging and tense, and that at times even scratch the surface of intellectually challenging material. Not that script is without flaws; the sequence where Sean Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage!) escapes from a maximum security prison, for instance, is quite sloppy and hard to digest. But seeing the two arch-enemies exploring each other's world and trying to cope with it, thereby becoming the other person, is definitely interesting.This also brings me to the bad part of the movie; while Face\/Off does not have the ambition of being a 'thought-provoking' or philosophical movie, I simply do not understand the need of shaking off certain plot points through overlong action scenes whose outcome is absolutely predictable. Also, action -- no matter how well shot -- is involving as long as it is used with parsimony; the initial sequence that leads to the arrest of the Troy brothers is perfect, because it stops before getting tiresome. The final hero vs. villain sequence not only is overlong, but it does not feel right suddenly, everything between the two enemies -- including a hint at emotional attachment to each other's world -- is resolved by a sequence where all the villains die and all the good people stay alive, and where people miss their targets whenever the director feels like we need to see more. It feels as the film is afraid of having become a thriller more than an action movie.The acting by the two leads is fairly good. Neither of them is between my favorite actors, but I enjoyed them much more here than I did in many other movies.Face\/Off is both a moderate success and a moderate failure but, despite all its flaws, gets my recommendation.

But if that's the case, why isn't the way he teaches never criticized by Yoda or Mace Windu?I had a hard time believing this was, what, eight years after the last movie? Anakin had grown into a fifteen\/sixteen year old boy while Padme looked exactly the same age as the last time. And the love-scenes were horrible. Have you ever heard people talk who are in love?

The Characters In Nadia, there are about 30 episodes, so the characters could be more subtle, as there is more character development time.  In Atlantis, however, they have to be more out there, given 95 minutes to become fixed in memory. Also, though some characters are similar, where in Nadia do you find characters like Mole, Sweet, Mrs. Packard, Audrey, Cookie, or Vinny (My favorite)?  Or, where in Atlantis do you find characters like Nemo, Marie, King, Grandis, Hanson, or Sanson (another favorite)? 2 The Plot In Atlantis, the plot moves faster, since there is only 95 minutes.  Nadia is more spread out over the 30 or so episodes.  There are different intricities in both, and they are different, I tell you!Overall, I loved both and the fact that Atlantis was inspired by Nadia made it even better to watch.  I give it 10\/10.

And yes, the geek gets with the princess, but you knew that was going to happen.  You didn't think Nadia was going to get with Sanson, did you?  Or Kida with Vinny (Mole is out of the question)?  And lastly, yes, the good guys win, but this is Disney, for God's sake! The differences 1. The Characters In Nadia, there are about 30 episodes, so the characters could be more subtle, as there is more character development time.  In Atlantis, however, they have to be more out there, given 95 minutes to become fixed in memory. Also, though some characters are similar, where in Nadia do you find characters like Mole, Sweet, Mrs. Packard, Audrey, Cookie, or Vinny (My favorite)?  Or, where in Atlantis do you find characters like Nemo, Marie, King, Grandis, Hanson, or Sanson (another favorite)? 2 The Plot In Atlantis, the plot moves faster, since there is only 95 minutes.  Nadia is more spread out over the 30 or so episodes.  There are different intricities in both, and they are different, I tell you!Overall, I loved both and the fact that Atlantis was inspired by Nadia made it even better to watch.  I give it 10\/10.

I know people get upset over it being a ripoff of either Nadia or Laputa.  I, however, found it a refreshing break from the normal Disney movies.  Though I enjoy the Disney songs as singing material, they just wouldn't fit in this story.  As for it being a ripoff, let's think.  I loved Nadia, in fact, it's my favorite anime besides CCS and Tenchi Muyo, but I've heard it was inspired by Laputa.  I've never seen Laputa, so I cannot judge that.  Some comparisons between Nadia and Atlantis Are 1. The Characters Milo greatly resembles Jean, but if you think about it, that is a typical stereotype of a brainy nerd who is interested in ancient civilizations. And if one really wanted to get technical, one could say they were both inspired by John from Peter Pan.  Kida and Nadia are both dressed alike, but that could just be a safe way to make them look exotic, yet not innappropriate for younger audiences.  Think about Jeannie in I Dream of Jeannie.  Helga and Electra look alike, but they really aren't alike at all, except for feeling betrayed by their employers and trying to kill them.  The Nautilus and the Ulysses are alike, but they are both undersea vehicles too!2.

One part is horror\/slasher flick, the other is a fairly unique satire on the eighties and it's rampant materialism and empty attachment to appearances.  However, as someone who lived as an adult in the eighties I can say most of the cultural ambience was something seen more in movies and MTV than in real life.Christian Bale was a pretty good choice to play Bateman, appearing at turns comic, dangerously evil, and a soulless Adonis.  By far American Psycho is at it's most effective as a satire.  There's several great scenes with Bateman discussing with deep seriousness the profoundness of eighties pop music, or the various yuppies comparing their business cards with the same aplomb as athletes comparing bicep size or similar.  Bateman is every bit the empty shell of materialism, and is not only aware of his position but embraces it.  Something is a little different however.  I really felt we're essentially seeing a feminist perspective on Bateman and his cronies, all the more likely since the movie was directed by a woman.  For being so busy no one seems to actually work, all they do is show up at their offices to make phone calls for power lunches and doodle in their notebooks.  (Which is strange because I thought overwork and burning candles at both ends was a hallmark of the eighties.)  Bateman and company's names and appearances are interchangeable, and no matter how many sexual conquests they may have, how many possessions they may own, or how stellar their business card, they can't stand out and are little more than paper cutouts.***************Spoiler Warning****************By far for me the most powerful part of the movie wasn't his secretary reading his notebook and realizing he's whacked inside, instead it was when he goes back to the apartment and finds it completely empty.  The effect of Bateman walking into the bare whiteness in that scene was a little spooky, and probably the only part in the movie where Bateman loses his gusto.  Also, unsurprisingly, it's the woman realtor in the apartment who sets him straight.While the cinematography was overall pretty good, that scene was about the best of it.  The psycho killer part is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, and some parts were pretty silly, such as the now infamous naked rampage with a chainsaw through an apartment building, followed by the saw toss down the stairwell.  Overall the movie tries to keep the same effect of vacuosity, that even as a killer Bateman can't get noticed,  until the end we find it's all just a dream.  However, it doesn't work, and the movie ends giving you the feeling someone really had an unhappy time in the eighties.

It had received lukewarm reviews and I, at the time, was not really in the mood for another feel good triumph of the human spirit movie.  But I came out most pleasantly suprised. For the past little while, I've had a love-hate relationship with this movie.  I liked it, and thought it a very mature film by Ron Howard, yet I feel it was a sycophantic attemtpt to draw attention at the academy awards, attention that I feel should have rightly gone to The Lord Of The Rings  The Fellowship Of The Ring.   Now, to say off the bat, Russell Crowe's performance is nothing short of marvelous.  I don't particularly care for him, but I can certainly respect his brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.  While Howard glosses over the more displeasing character traits of Nash a la The Hurricane, traits which include alleged Anti-Semitism, it's not his movie.  Crowe owns the screen, and, being in virtually every scene, he elevates what could have been a tale of a man's struggle with a severe mental illness he can't deal with, and the people that stuck with him, into something that, while not approaching art, is heart-wrenching, with a predictable, but nonetheless welcomed happy ending.  I find it difficult to understand how this film earned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, yet failed to garner one for the man who made the effort worthwhile.  Yet, Hollywood loves mental illness.  From Forrest Gump, to Rain Man, to Charly, films about heart over mind seem to never get old with the judges at the Oscars. I feel that this is as good a film as could have been made about this character, almost entirely due to Crowe, without becoming distant to the viewer.  Do we really want to know about Nash's Anti-Semitism?  Not really, no.  A Beautiful Mind will always appear to me a film that made a campaign at the academy awards, and robbed a far superior film of it's honor.  But it's definitely worth seeing.
