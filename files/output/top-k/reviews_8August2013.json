There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.

Ignorance no longer need be a problem, not once you see All That Jazz. I've never seen an artist's thinking, inspiration, and life depicted better in a more flashy, colorful, and wild film.The protagonist, Joe Gideon is for the first two thirds of the film, practically never captured on screen without a cigarette on his lips. Watching All That Jazz is like stealing the cigarette from his mouth and inhaling his artistic expression. The most obvious aspect of All That Jazz that is successful is the manner in which its technically made. Bob Fosse is the director here and each scene is directed with such precision, you can feel the real-life, artistic pain melt off the screen. In a film that centers itself around dancing, the choreography is feisty, swift, and collectible complex and inventive. The sets and costumes are dazzling and prove the film cares about it's look just as much it does entertaining us and even more so than both of those, it makes a priority of saying something about artists. The film editing is used as a poem of madness and completely works for All That Jazz.The grounding strength of All That Jazz is Roy Scheider being front and center breathing life and artistic smoke into the film. Never a moment where he takes things too far, everything is held back like a man who has bit off more than he could chew would hold things back. Scheider is perfectly astute and the film wouldn't be the same without his understanding of the character and story. All That Jazz is centered around a flawed man with a drug addiction, uncontrollable sexual desires, stress levels that go through the roof, and personal relationships that have more bumps than they are smooth. Yet, we understand this man's life and work because of Scheider.All That Jazz is bright, flashy, and seeking attention to this business and lifestyle. Artistic people are misunderstood by people as some sort of hippie that tries to sway away from the norm any chance they get. No, they understand themselves and feel they have something to share with the world. They see the world differently than normal people do. They have a firmer grasp on what things mean to them. It almost feels like a style of film Fellini would be directing. All That Jazz is in tune with the the work, the stress, and the real-life hardships that come as a package deal in the entertainment industry. The film is like shining bright lights on big distress.Through this wild, raunchy film, Fosse makes a commentary on an artist's experience understandable to the common man in a very entertaining way.

Filled with art, dance, and personal expression, All That Jazz will suffocate you with its fantastically told metaphor of an artist's life.

I'm glad I'm one of those who appreciate that beauty. There are few movies or works of art that I consider greater than this film.There are facets of this movie that I find difficult to explain, though.The first is the terrible murder plot, and what role it plays in the emotion stirred by this film. Do we humans have a heinous dark side aroused by the very idea of cold blooded murder? I don't think so (at least not most of us). My best explanation is the huge contrast we see transpire in Walter Neff as he crosses from normal caring insurance man into killer under the influence of Phyllis Dietrichson. Although rare, this is something we know can exist in reality in everyday life in some human beings. The rare chance to watch that metamorphosis occur in a normal real-life setting provides a morbid fascination to us. Billy Wilder depicts it masterfully on screen, but it seems that a powerful and fascinating story is truly an important element for a great film, even for film noir, even for a genius director.Another facet that I find difficult to explain is the casting and sets. Obviously the choice of actors was a significant element in this film's success, as was their appearance (such as Stanwyck's blonde wig), and the scene settings. The appearance and settings, of course, were by Billy Wilder's design, but whether the actual casting was more accident than design is something I often wonder about. Fate has often played an important role in many of our classics. Regarding visual effects, film experts point out Wilder's use of venetian blind wall shadows, which add greatly to the noir realism. Another visual effect might be the tall ceilings in the home and offices. I'm not much in psychology, but I sometimes wonder if this doesn't give the Dietrichson home a castle-like impression of wealth, another contrast effect. We all know it's much more shocking when people of wealth and influence commit crimes than when average Joe's like me do. The tall ceilings in the Pacific All Risk offices make me think of old buildings, and in my amateur analysis I wonder if this doesn't add a nostalgic appeal to the film today. But maybe I'm wrong. Some of the office building scenes are actually quite modern.Finally, I must mention that New York Times' Bosley Crowther was one of the few critics to give Double Indemnity a negative review in 1944. Two years later Crowther gave the film The Postman Always Rings Twice, a good review. Postman is a fine film, but it doesn't hold a candle to Double Indemnity; just further proof of my claim that Crowther wasn't much of a critic. Some people wouldn't know a good movie if it fell on them.

With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure.Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall.This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky.This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor.Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley.

Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.3\/5 (Entertainment Good | Story Poor | Film Poor) ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 August 2013","score":"","review":" First thing's first the film's opening credits montage is pretty darn cool. With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure.Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall.This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky.This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor.Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley.

Sadly here you;re very mistaken. You've been very short changed I'm afraid. Working from Elmore Leonard's novel, Quentin must of been self conscious in his telling of this nothing impressive tale. There's hardly any Tarantino humor or VIOLENCE. We have a few stretched out scenes, wasted ones, of little significance, ones that take place in Jackson's Venice beach apartment. We can tell he's held back here, as if to honor or not disrespect crime author, Leonard's book. Pam Grier playing the title, one of the many great performances, is a 44 year old black woman trying to make ends meat, by earning her undeserved share of money made off selling guns, that her boss, Ordell Robbie sells. Jackson is fun to watch in this, playing bad good, in reverse to the much gentler and reserved teacher he played in 187. When Grier is arrested by the feds, she has her own way of snaking out of it, outwitting authorities, while hatching a plan to rip off Ordeal. You gotta admire the courage and strength of the character, but the storytelling just seems to be prolonged. There's not many surprises in the thriller department either. We know what each character wants, whether he\/she is good or bad. They're an open book. Deniro was fun to watch as as ex parolee friend of Jackson, who lags around in Jackson's apartment with skinny bikini bodied pot smoking Mel (Fonda). Her murder in the car park was a shock. On the whole Jackie Brown was a bitter disappointment when seeing it in the cinema. This disappointing feature almost had me wondering if I was in the right cinema. I enjoyed it more second time around on video, but this Tarantino flick is a two an hour flick that could of easily been told in 90 minutes.

Having left on some unscrupulous terms, disagreements with the production company and two mediocre films in a row, he blasts back into the fray with an entry that maintains the grounded, un-Bondian feel that had to follow the likes of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice in this Diamonds are Forever. In a sense, this is like a combination of the aforementioned two films as well as George Lazenby's lone entry On Her Majesty's Secret Service; combining a rooted sensibility with that unmistakable panache Connery brings to the role on top of its desire to tick the usual boxes in providing all the glamorous women; stunts as well as a showdown in an enemy's lair. There is an odd feeling of change littered throughout Diamonds are Forever, an odd imbalanced gear to things wherein Bond's actor is different; Blofeld's actor has changed, although the actor already appeared in one of Connery's earlier entries, on top of this very gradual sense that things are coming to an end for Blofeld's organisation SPECTRE. Preceding this entry and as the franchise grew, there is an unmistakable sense that Bond has already picked his way through the various villains associated with the organisation and now, following two duels with the man himself, the end may very well be neigh.The film begins with Connery seeking vengeance for something that happened to the same character when it was played by another man. Now seemingly immune to women after having genuinely loved one in the last entry, only to have her taken away from him, he is sceptic to the charms of a bikini-clad bimbo and instead uses the very item that accentuates her sexuality, in her clothing, to demand answers through an interrogation. One thing leads to another and Charles Gray's Blofeld is happened upon in a secret base wherein he has successfully cloned himself. Things are rounded off with Blofeld seemingly out of the picture and with the series free to crack on with fresh directions.The bulk of the piece comes to revolve around a smuggling ring, a ring specialising in the transporting of diamonds from South Africa to Europe. Back in London at headquarters, Bond even asks as to why the department being brought in on such a routine operation. One imagines that, after averting the world's economy from collapsing and foiling plots to initiate a Third World War a full two times, this would seem rather droll in comparison. Those thieves, bandits and crooks in the smuggling trade don't even know how close they came to annihilation on two separate counts, had it not been for the heroism of this man. Here, he is told to impersonate a renowned diamond smuggler, who has already been caught, and infiltrate the circles abroad by first meeting with his American contact. Mission in tow, Bond is far from sent jetting off to the far flung thriving metropolis' of Tokyo, nor indeed is he sent to somewhere whereby he may garner access to Jamaica's rum bars and tropical beaches. Nor even is he sent packing to the mysterious passageways and Cold War paranoia drenched streets of Istanbul. No, for he takes a hovercraft to Holland.When he arrives, we observe a decent first hour or so in what essentially transpires to be a prelude to something like Charley Varrick, or even Peckinpah's The Getaway. While vastly inferior to each of those examples, the film maintains this bizarre atmospheric of chase and deception as each party tries to remain one up in the company of another; something unknown in a Bond film to this point and not again seen until 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, where the arid locale of Egypt doubled up for this scorching playground wherein varying parties would try to get their hands on some valuable data at the cost, potentially, of one another's lives. Jill St. John plays the American contact, a woman named Tiffany Case who exudes a sort of tantalising presence on the screen as business and pleasure threaten to meld together on top of the fact Bond is deceiving her in adopting a false identity. Two folks who are desperate to get their hands on the diamonds are the quite riotous Mr. Wint (Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Smith), two homosexual hit men, whose choice of lifestyle does rear up some problematic issues for the film but regardless, quite honestly steal the film.The film is synonymous with an era in the Bond franchise whereby surrounding entries saw Bond tackle class-A drugs; an elusive assassin and a form of pharmaceutical warfare inherent in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There is a great deal of colour and exuberance to the film, perhaps surprisingly so. Here is the follow up to the film that saw Bond lose a lover, but there isn't necessarily an mite of anguish nor suffering. Moreover, there features a homosexual hit men couple; the odd sequence whereby two women seemingly beat Bond up in a luxury Nevada villa for absolutely no apparent reason; a car chase involving a moon-buggy and the shrill glamour and spectacle of seeing a place such as Las Vegas in a Bond film where, ordinarily, grot and greyed out colour schemes dominate an already oppressive espionage atmosphere. I don't suppose there's anything greatly wrong with Diamonds are Forever, it just isn't a particularly fascinating entry; worse were made earlier, better were made subsequently &#x96; this is brighter, more sparky entry which uses its MacGuffin well and pulls some neat surprises on us.

There is an odd feeling of change littered throughout Diamonds are Forever, an odd imbalanced gear to things wherein Bond's actor is different; Blofeld's actor has changed, although the actor already appeared in one of Connery's earlier entries, on top of this very gradual sense that things are coming to an end for Blofeld's organisation SPECTRE. Preceding this entry and as the franchise grew, there is an unmistakable sense that Bond has already picked his way through the various villains associated with the organisation and now, following two duels with the man himself, the end may very well be neigh.The film begins with Connery seeking vengeance for something that happened to the same character when it was played by another man. Now seemingly immune to women after having genuinely loved one in the last entry, only to have her taken away from him, he is sceptic to the charms of a bikini-clad bimbo and instead uses the very item that accentuates her sexuality, in her clothing, to demand answers through an interrogation. One thing leads to another and Charles Gray's Blofeld is happened upon in a secret base wherein he has successfully cloned himself. Things are rounded off with Blofeld seemingly out of the picture and with the series free to crack on with fresh directions.The bulk of the piece comes to revolve around a smuggling ring, a ring specialising in the transporting of diamonds from South Africa to Europe. Back in London at headquarters, Bond even asks as to why the department being brought in on such a routine operation. One imagines that, after averting the world's economy from collapsing and foiling plots to initiate a Third World War a full two times, this would seem rather droll in comparison. Those thieves, bandits and crooks in the smuggling trade don't even know how close they came to annihilation on two separate counts, had it not been for the heroism of this man. Here, he is told to impersonate a renowned diamond smuggler, who has already been caught, and infiltrate the circles abroad by first meeting with his American contact. Mission in tow, Bond is far from sent jetting off to the far flung thriving metropolis' of Tokyo, nor indeed is he sent to somewhere whereby he may garner access to Jamaica's rum bars and tropical beaches. Nor even is he sent packing to the mysterious passageways and Cold War paranoia drenched streets of Istanbul. No, for he takes a hovercraft to Holland.When he arrives, we observe a decent first hour or so in what essentially transpires to be a prelude to something like Charley Varrick, or even Peckinpah's The Getaway. While vastly inferior to each of those examples, the film maintains this bizarre atmospheric of chase and deception as each party tries to remain one up in the company of another; something unknown in a Bond film to this point and not again seen until 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, where the arid locale of Egypt doubled up for this scorching playground wherein varying parties would try to get their hands on some valuable data at the cost, potentially, of one another's lives. Jill St. John plays the American contact, a woman named Tiffany Case who exudes a sort of tantalising presence on the screen as business and pleasure threaten to meld together on top of the fact Bond is deceiving her in adopting a false identity. Two folks who are desperate to get their hands on the diamonds are the quite riotous Mr. Wint (Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Smith), two homosexual hit men, whose choice of lifestyle does rear up some problematic issues for the film but regardless, quite honestly steal the film.The film is synonymous with an era in the Bond franchise whereby surrounding entries saw Bond tackle class-A drugs; an elusive assassin and a form of pharmaceutical warfare inherent in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There is a great deal of colour and exuberance to the film, perhaps surprisingly so. Here is the follow up to the film that saw Bond lose a lover, but there isn't necessarily an mite of anguish nor suffering. Moreover, there features a homosexual hit men couple; the odd sequence whereby two women seemingly beat Bond up in a luxury Nevada villa for absolutely no apparent reason; a car chase involving a moon-buggy and the shrill glamour and spectacle of seeing a place such as Las Vegas in a Bond film where, ordinarily, grot and greyed out colour schemes dominate an already oppressive espionage atmosphere. I don't suppose there's anything greatly wrong with Diamonds are Forever, it just isn't a particularly fascinating entry; worse were made earlier, better were made subsequently &#x96; this is brighter, more sparky entry which uses its MacGuffin well and pulls some neat surprises on us.

And if not 'Mo' Better' than the glorious predecessor, Lee still 'did the right thing' by tackling a less political subject and pay a beautiful tribute to jazz music through one of the most under-appreciated performances of the 90's Denzel Washington as Bleek Gilliam, the trumpet player.Do the Right Thing also coincided with the year Washington won his first Oscar for his performance as the tormented Afro-American soldier questioning the value of his engagement with the Yankees. As Bleek, Washington not only shows a more light-hearted facet of his acting range, but also proves a unique ability to portray men driven by anger, selfishness but with enough pride and confidence to win our respect. His characters might be flawed but we understand them and the emotional pay-off is that they ultimately try to change, for the best, closing some fascinating characters' arcs, among which Bleek isn't an exception.Bleek is interesting because he crystallizes the curse of making constantly bad choices, and by 'bad' I mean 'tragic', even more because only the scope of a life highlight them. And Mo' Better Blues spans thirty years of Bleek's life so we have glimpses on the devastating effects of the most benign choices. It opens in 1969 when Bleek's friends urge him to come play softball, but it is trumpet which he must play, under his mother's tyrannic supervision. His father coerces her to let the boy be a boy, but he's too busy watching TV to be listened to. The kids finally leave, calling Bleek a 'sissy', Bleek resumes playing with much reluctance.The immediate ellipse endorses the mother's authoritarian education; Bleek became a handsome trumpet player with a way with women, leader of a quintet featuring Shadow Henderson (Wesley Snipes) the saxophone player, Bill Nunn in the bass and Giancarlo Esposito in the piano. What a great delight to watch all these actors joined interacting in the artist's room. The list would be incomplete without Spike Lee who plays Giant, an ironic name for the vertically challenged manager of the band. Anyway, life seems to smile to Bleek, but all the film's stylish shots can't hide behind the shadowy and smoothly designed atmosphere, the presages of an imminent downfall. Mo' Better Blues chronicles a series of bad choices made by a man not by lack of luck or intelligence, but because his ego and certitudes prevent him from realizing the harm he causes to his entourage, and ultimately, to himself. Bleek is too blinded by his leadership to understand that it might not last, especially with such a promising sax player, who proves his value every night through outstanding solos. He's too caught up by his friendship with Giant he lets him ruin the band's career. Giant is a gambler who makes the wrong bets, who fails to convince the club owners Moe and Josh Flatbush (John and Nicholas Turturro) to renegotiate the contract, and much more, who gets no respect because of his diminutive size. Not stupid or unlucky, but Bleek's tragedy is that his best friend is. Spike Lee perfectly plays Giant, the lovable loser. But Bleek is also the architect of his own demise, notably on the love department. He dates two women who couldn't have been more opposite Cynda Williams as Clarke Bettencourt, a glamorous, light-skinned artist whose dream is to be Bleek's Muse and sing for him but she can't break the iced gate of his own ego forcing Bleek to turn the subject into a Mo'Better moment, a classy euphemism for sex. But it is interrupted when she accidentally bites Bleek's very tool of work his lip, confirming the impossible junction of work and passion. But Clarke's pleas find echoes in Shadow and her character magnificently blooms when she sings a sweet ballad for Shadow's quartet (guess who misses?) and proves Bleek wrong. But his heart belongs to Indigo (Joie Lee), the less glamorous but more dedicated woman who patiently endures his rejections.We know they're meant for each other, but Bleek is still obsessed with Clarke's body, the highest in the hierarchy of beauty standards in the black community. Realistically, it's only when Bleek's career is over that he seeks Indigo's help, and she knows. Paying the highest price of being Giant's friend, his lip is permanently hurt by two loan sharks. By the way, the film tactfully avoids the ridiculous triumphant comeback cliché invited to join the band by Shadow, Bleek can't play correctly and leaves the stage &#x85; forever, the heart full of pain and humiliation. All he's got left is Indigo, and she only accepts after he begs her to ''save his life', which means that he finally triumphed over his own ego.Part choice, part luck, the film subtly parallels life with jazz music, which is one third- dedication, one third-inspiration and one-third improvisation, Bleek was too dedicated to himself to see how listening to the others could help him. I could relate to Bleek for I had my share of bad choices, for I'm still trusting my best friend to whom I owe many of the biggest problems I have (and he's still a friend) for even with my future wife, I kept lusting about other more voluptuous women, while I still know that she was the one. I remember an old man who hardly knew me but said there's something erroneous about me. Now, I knew what he meant and this is something I can also say about Bleek, hoping that, like him, my life will change positively.And the ending says it all when the exact opening scene is recreated, only this time, Bleek lets his son go play with his friend, probably realizing that one simple choice can have one hell of an effect on one's life, and not repeating the same mistakes is already a way to succeed.

It demonstrates this idea by a man who gets on the slippery slope of adultery that ends with a double murder. In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.The main plot of the story is the external one to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves. This plot ends in failure. Suspicion ruins his love and he commits another murder to hide the first. His suspicion is proved to be misplaced as his lover refuses to kill him before he kills her. In the end, he is caught, confesses and dies from his wounds.But we already knew that he doesn't get away since the movie starts with his confession and the whole thing takes place in a flashback that catches up to the present.If the movie ended where it began, it would have been a simple morality play about how the slippery slope of the loss of morality (that started with some innocent flirting) can quickly spiral out of control and take everything with it. But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end. He realizes he has lost everything and chooses to confess. He also choose to put two young lovers who have broken up because of mutual distrust back on track to be reunited. This minor plot line of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.Double Indemnity is a very tight story.

It was a film a head of its time.Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is a focus puller at a film studio and aspiring director who takes his 8mm camera everywhere he goes. He is a quiet, shy man who lives alone, has few friends and was a victim of his father's psychological experiments. But Mark is a serial killer and wants to make documentary about his activities.Peeping Tom is a certainly a bold film for time and it easy to see why it was controversial when it was first released. Powell keeps a very creepy atmosphere throughout the film, amplified by Boehm's performance, giving his character a quiet, softly spoken demeanour and it was an uneasy experience to be around it.Peeping Tom has a very voyeuristic look, a deliberately choice, particularly when see the murders through the camera. This is a film about obsession and it is even more poignant now due to the information age we live where we have 24 hour media, Youtube, social media and mini-cameras and phone cameras. This is a film that has many themes during the running time, focusing on obsession of death and pain, fear, the growing use of technology, the efforts of someone having in private life and how a serial killer would function, as well as some satire about the British film industry.It is always difficult to make a film focusing on a unlikeable character, but Powell and Boehm make it work due to the complexities of Mark's character. Mark was a man who was a victim of his father who tortured him as a child in the name of intelligential pursuit and this is a film that tries to be more grounded with its look at a serial killer he is not a man who seems to take pleasure from his actions and does it out of compulsion. He cannot even be away from his camera. This is also a film that shows a serial killer need to keep trophies. Yet at the same time Powell never justifies what Mark does.Peeping Tom is of course an important film due to its subject matter and its style, particularly the POV approach and it a compelling psychological-thriller\/horror-thriller. It is classic it deserves to be and it shame that Powell did not get to it.

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.
