The movie to me is too silly but it does have some funny moments.  The jokes were just too silly sometimes and sometimes the jokes were just a little on the tasteless side.  And it is really sad when the best acting job is done by Shannon Doherty.  Don't get me wrong this was an enjoyable movie but I have seen many other good comedies.Jay and Silent Bob were very funny but I have never liked Jason Lee or Ben Affleck, neither is a particularly good actor and here they have few good lines.  The highlight of the movie is an appearance by Stan Lee who is the creator of the Spiderman, X-men and other comic strips.  He is very funny. The plot centers around a group of people that hang around a mall all day, hence the term Mallrats.  Jason Lee and Jeremy London are two lazy young men that have recently lost their girlfriends and are depressed.  They actually did very little with their girlfriends. London lost his girl because her dad wanted her to appear on his game show instead of going to Florida with him.The movie has a lot of satirical elements.  There is a takeoff on The Dating Game, Star Wars, Looney tunes, Batman and much more.  Perhaps that is the problem there is too many spoofs of other shows and movies and not enough jokes they come up with on their own.  The movie does make a lot of fun of the whole mall culture and people who hang out there too much. I think I would recommend this movie to teenagers mostly.  It was mostly forgettable to me.  I have seen a lot better but then again I have seen a lot worse.  I guess if you are really bored and there is absolutely nothing better on TV than this wouldn't be bad to watch.  I guess the movie is just too over the top for me.  There are a lot of people that got started here that went on to do better things like Claire Forlani, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and more so someone liked this movie.

One day the tortoise and the hair prepared themselves for a race. Knowing he had the advantage over the tortoise and sure of his ability to win, the hair flew right by the tortoise leaving him to choke on the dust. Realizing his lengthy lead in time, the hair sat down for a quick nap. Upon returning to humanity from his state of slumber the hair noticed that the tortoise was about to defeat him and ruin his pride. With all his might the hair charged for the finish line with all his strength but his speed was not able to overcome the tortoise's brawn. The moral of the story is `slow and steady wins the race.' Director M Night Shyamalan must have been paying close attention in kindergarten because he makes prolific use of this moral. The hair represents Modern horror films. They try to squeeze too much out of to little. The possibility of victory is present, but the follow-through is rarely executed. Everything seems to be crammed into the first half an hour (if that) and then everything is put on snooze. When finally waking up, the story must charge full-speed-ahead to catch up with itself because closing. Rarely does this happen resulting in contrived endings and illogical situations. Then, from the heavens, a savoir was sent to thwart the sins of these painful horror flicks and make a film that a tortoise could be proud of. A film that is just as edgy as it smart. That man was M. Night Shyamalan and that film was The Sixth Sense. The film moved at the pace of a tortoise (maybe slower) and because of this allowed for strong characterization, deep thinking and to be dramatic as hell. It turned out to be a huge summer hit that thrilled and baffled audiences alike. Not since Psycho was a film so respected that the ending was not given away. Working with the theory of `if it isn't broke don't fix it', Shyamalan returned with Unbreakable. Maybe the film was a disappointment because of the high standards placed upon it from The Sixth Sense, or maybe because it seemed to be nothing more than a retread through old water. Either way Shyamalan tried so hard to make a film that would live up to The Sixth Sense he failed. Now Shyamalan is not a stupid man. He saw a change in the cards for his next feature, Signs. To make another Sixth Sense would have been a bad career move; some maybe even expected that to happen. So he decided to take on an entirely different angle in the storytelling department without sacrificing any of his trademark style. This is the simple story, of a simple man, with a simple life who receives a complex lesson. Graham is an ex-reverend who lives on a quiet piece of farmland with his two unique children and his ex-baseball-playing brother. Graham had a lapse in faith when his wife was killed and now he can't understand why God would do such a thing to him. He bears her burden everyday of his life, often calling out to her in his sleep to receive only silence. `She doesn't answer?' Asks his daughter. But this once simple man is given a rude awakening when unexplainable occurrences start happening around town. Events that see huge circles appear in corn fields, sees mysterious strangers exhibit unusual behaviour around town, sees once peaceful pets turn ravenous in the blink of an eye and sees the world go into a mass media frenzy when these crop circles and unexplained lights start showing up all over the planet. Everything then comes down to, not a war or worlds, or even a war at all, but rather a struggle of belief. As started in the English dictionary, belief is said to be a feeling that something is true, but to believe one must first get inside the unknown and sink beneath the surface, not everything is gained at face value. In religion the argument of `experience' states `some people talk about God in terms of personal experience. They believe that they can know God personally by prayer. Within religion believers sometimes talk about 'encountering God' through prayer and worship. Within the world of religion, some people believe that miracles are events which because of our faith, demonstrate that God is alive and active. That is then countered with the `An unfair God' statement which reads as such ` Some psychologists claim that religious 'experiences' are tricks of the mind, that if we want to really believe in something than we will. Within regard to miracles, even if some were 'true' then what kind of God is it that allows some people to be healed but not others? This hardly seems a God that is fair and just.' The basis of this film is woven around both of those issues. Yet this is not a religious film with a sci-fi twist, nor is it trying to preach to anyone. This film is a deep study of how the mind functions between what is considered reality and what is considered faith. At first glace this appeared as nothing more than an abstract, Saturday mourning creature feature. Such is not the case. Earlier I stated that not everything is gained at face value. This is why it is imperative to look beneath the surface. The aliens here are not aliens at all. There is very little development given to the visitors. We don't know where them came from, why they are here, or what their intentions are. When authors leave characters in their stories nameless it is because they want you to relate to that character on a personal level. In not giving any information about the aliens Shyamalan is allowing the audience to relate to them whichever way the viewer pleases. Leaving this open inevitably lets the audience determine what the film is about and what they will take away from it. Although instruments of fear, the aliens aren't used to toy with characters emotions. They are rather, beacons of faith. There are two types of people in the world tells Graham. There are those who believe in miracles and signs and there are those who think there is no one looking out for them. Since Graham thinks there is no one looking out for him, he is placed into the second type of person. His faith is flailing in the wind, ready to detach itself from the body and soul at any minute, Yet Graham still has the power to grab it if he wishes, but usually it isn't just that easy. With the coming of the aliens Graham is sent on his own personal vision quest. Are they someone's idea of a joke? Did God send them? Did his wife send them? He doesn't know but he is going to find out one way or another. In order to understand a situation you must understand the answers, and to understand the answers you must first search for them. It is the aliens who propel Graham to find those answers to the unexplained things in his life, often without even knowing he is doing it. Shyamalan writes another electrifying script that unlike the Sixth Sense, presents the viewer with the situations and only loosely ties them together in the end. This leaves the viewers on just as much of a search for answers as our main character and allows for more critical thinking than required by The Sixth Sense. Although this method of scripting proved just as effective as The Sixth Sense the ending did seem rather uncalled for. Even though it did its job in bringing everything together, there was nothing interesting about, even ruining some of the dramatic build-up. Also without the `surprise' ending some people will not be able to pick up on what this film is trying to get across. Nevertheless it makes up for that with Shyamalan's highly symbolic storytelling. Have you ever had a puzzle that once completed you glued to a piece of cardboards so that it would never fall apart on you? Shyamalan's direction acts as that glue. His ultra-slow pacing allows for mass character development and allows for greater tension between every connecting joint. He is also able to manipulate the camera in such a way that you are given just enough effect that determining what is important and what isn't is an impossibility. People keep coming back to Shyamalan's films because he requires a great deal of audience participation. You are the ones digging to find the clues; he is only providing the interrogation so that you can be granted access to the characters mind and soul. With a new actor comes a new set of expectations. Bruce Willis would be a hard act to follow if the casting for this film wasn't perfect. Shyamalan knew he has to bring in an actor who could match Willis' dramatic capability. Mel Gibson was the choice and a right choice he was. Gibson gives his best performance since Braveheart. He acts every emotion down to its last haunting detail. We have no trouble feeling that he is going through a time of struggle but he never lets us forget that he is also a loving parents and an everyday human being. Shyamalan has a knack for brining emotions out of his characters that are disturbing and unexplainable but at the same time uncharacteristically human. For a film that had to compete against The Sixth Sense this one was able to hold its ground fine, it's thinking mans version of tell-me-a-scary-story fun. Although it didn't surpass The Sixth Sense its yearning to trying something new was welcomed with open arms making it (alongside Frailty) one of the best thrillers, if not films, that last year had to offer.

He is also able to manipulate the camera in such a way that you are given just enough effect that determining what is important and what isn't is an impossibility. People keep coming back to Shyamalan's films because he requires a great deal of audience participation. You are the ones digging to find the clues; he is only providing the interrogation so that you can be granted access to the characters mind and soul. With a new actor comes a new set of expectations. Bruce Willis would be a hard act to follow if the casting for this film wasn't perfect. Shyamalan knew he has to bring in an actor who could match Willis' dramatic capability. Mel Gibson was the choice and a right choice he was. Gibson gives his best performance since Braveheart. He acts every emotion down to its last haunting detail. We have no trouble feeling that he is going through a time of struggle but he never lets us forget that he is also a loving parents and an everyday human being. Shyamalan has a knack for brining emotions out of his characters that are disturbing and unexplainable but at the same time uncharacteristically human. For a film that had to compete against The Sixth Sense this one was able to hold its ground fine, it's thinking mans version of tell-me-a-scary-story fun. Although it didn't surpass The Sixth Sense its yearning to trying something new was welcomed with open arms making it (alongside Frailty) one of the best thrillers, if not films, that last year had to offer.

After reading what it was about, I wondered if it was a good movie I had just never heard of.  Many times I saw it on sale and wanted to take a risk buying it.  Yesterday, I saw it on sale and decided to take a chance.  The cover of the DVD shows the two main characters, Rebecca and Enid.  After watching the movie, I feel the cover really only portrays Enid in the right light.  Rebecca seems to come off (how she is portrayed on the cover) in the beginning of the movie, but grows throughout.  The movie is basically the struggle of life for Enid.  The challenges one faces when they are trying to find themselves and where they want to go.  A time where you just seem to stand still because nothing seems to go your way.  You do not seem to have any idea where to go, but you wish you did.  This movie is good like that.  It is like watching a television show.  Its down to earth and not trying to be bigger than what it is.  Many actors in is this movie (you might not know their names) you have seen in other movies and TV shows.  I really don't want to give allot away about the movie other than its the struggle of life for Enid's character.  Everything seems to go wrong and when you think things are going good ... that's when they go even worse.  It just goes to show, no one can predict life.  Before I end, I have to mention one character in this movie that shows up twice.  I don't recall the character's name, but he is wicked funny.  He is a total southern redneck with mullet and white trash style.  He embraces his 40oz, beef jerky, and nun-chucks well.  He is speaks out and is absolutely crazy and funny.  Got to check it out.

It doesn't recur to gore excesses and the usual horror clichés (the old and isolated grand house that can only be haunted, lights going off and objects moving about by themselves, dark corners and dusty basements and attics...)but we have here a very clean and extremely well lighted place where it seems impossible that anything wrong can happen. But then, the most effective horror can be drawn from normal and totally pleasant-looking environments, which makes it more terrifying. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of visual compositions (his career began as a photographer), and among all of his films this one remains to me as his most beautiful. It is full of carefully composed and paced tracking shots where the hotel decor plays an essential part in the visual symmetry and composition ample spaces where the characters look vulnerable, endless corridors and huge function rooms where one can almost get lost.The hotel is a gigantic maze that reflects the hedge maze outside, and the Torrance family are trapped in it. The Stephen King novel is very good, but a bit boring and overlong, since it develops sub-stories about characters that are not relevant to this story, and tells the past of the Torrances in several flashbacks. Kubrick goes straight to business after half an hour,lets out anything that does not interest us here and changes the plot significantly and gives the story a completely different ending. Because of that, many fans of the novel didn't like the film when it first came out (it disappointed me too, when I fist saw it on television after reading the novel) and Stephen King himself hated it and fell out with Kubrick for what he considered it was a distorted and self-indulgent manipulation of his story. But new viewings of the film have helped me to discover its real quality and visual beauty and the way in which the horror is not actually shown explicitly but implied in our imagination through the characters' behaviour and the chilling score. The Torrances don't get slain one after the other every time someone goes off wandering by themselves like it always happen in the usual slash movie. Here the horror lies in the increasing hallucinations of Jack, the visions of Danny and the gradual mental breakdown of Wendy caused by Jack's bullying. The most chilling moments are the close-up of a dishevelled and stubble Jack staring blankly into space as his mind is cracking, and Wendy going through his manuscript only to find out that he has been writing one same sentence through hundreds of pages. That is a brilliant way of showing how a man is going insane before he actually starts using violence. The only gore concession in the film is Halloran's axe murder, which may seem gratuitous since he was expected to take Wendy and Danny back to civilisation, leaving Jack to die alone in the hotel. But his failed mission has a purpose too, because his snow-cat is actually used at the end by the woman and the child to escape from that evil place.

It doesn't recur to gore excesses and the usual horror clichés (the old and isolated grand house that can only be haunted, lights going off and objects moving about by themselves, dark corners and dusty basements and attics...)but we have here a very clean and extremely well lighted place where it seems impossible that anything wrong can happen. But then, the most effective horror can be drawn from normal and totally pleasant-looking environments, which makes it more terrifying. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of visual compositions (his career began as a photographer), and among all of his films this one remains to me as his most beautiful. It is full of carefully composed and paced tracking shots where the hotel decor plays an essential part in the visual symmetry and composition ample spaces where the characters look vulnerable, endless corridors and huge function rooms where one can almost get lost.The hotel is a gigantic maze that reflects the hedge maze outside, and the Torrance family are trapped in it. The Stephen King novel is very good, but a bit boring and overlong, since it develops sub-stories about characters that are not relevant to this story, and tells the past of the Torrances in several flashbacks. Kubrick goes straight to business after half an hour,lets out anything that does not interest us here and changes the plot significantly and gives the story a completely different ending. Because of that, many fans of the novel didn't like the film when it first came out (it disappointed me too, when I fist saw it on television after reading the novel) and Stephen King himself hated it and fell out with Kubrick for what he considered it was a distorted and self-indulgent manipulation of his story. But new viewings of the film have helped me to discover its real quality and visual beauty and the way in which the horror is not actually shown explicitly but implied in our imagination through the characters' behaviour and the chilling score. The Torrances don't get slain one after the other every time someone goes off wandering by themselves like it always happen in the usual slash movie. Here the horror lies in the increasing hallucinations of Jack, the visions of Danny and the gradual mental breakdown of Wendy caused by Jack's bullying. The most chilling moments are the close-up of a dishevelled and stubble Jack staring blankly into space as his mind is cracking, and Wendy going through his manuscript only to find out that he has been writing one same sentence through hundreds of pages. That is a brilliant way of showing how a man is going insane before he actually starts using violence. The only gore concession in the film is Halloran's axe murder, which may seem gratuitous since he was expected to take Wendy and Danny back to civilisation, leaving Jack to die alone in the hotel. But his failed mission has a purpose too, because his snow-cat is actually used at the end by the woman and the child to escape from that evil place. But then, since the hotel doesn't get destroyed like it happens in the book, the ending is open for another family of caretakers to come in next winter and the Overlook's evil circle to start again.

Gimme a break, all the intellectual challenge is wasted in the first 45 minutes within several tear-jerking scenes with David´s (the robot boy) teddybear and his mother abandoning him in a deep forest. Spielberg once again believes that moviegoers are so stupid he has to slap his thoughts and ideas repetitively into their faces until they get the idea. Dismiss this crap. I give 4\/10 for some of the most stunning visuals ever seen in a movie. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"}]
