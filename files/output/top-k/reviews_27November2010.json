Wait what? The name Ridley Scott is synonymous with darkly innovative science fiction so it's always weird to see his name attached the most unlikely of projects such as Thelma & Louise. I'm not complaining though because Ridley Scott or not, this movie is actually pretty good. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon play Thelma and Louise, respectively. The movie gives us little initial backstory, but we know enough to get into the story. We can figure that they are two long time friends who have probably lived in the same little old town for their entire lives. What we know for sure is that they have had enough and now figure it is time to hit the road and seek some real adventure. So they do just that and the main plot excitingly kicks off. Everything is going great until they stop at a bar and one of the patrons starts to get a little too friendly with Thelma. Before anything terrible can happen, Louise saves her friend and the whole situation seems to be resolved until the rapist gives a little too much lip and Louise shoots him dead. The two panic stricken ladies flee the scene and after calming down they resolve to flee to Mexico. But of course the law gets involved and they are right on their tail for the majority of the film. It's definitely a fun story with its fill of excitement and adventure.The two leading ladies are characterized very well as the anti-heroes, and Sarandon and Davis pull off these roles excellently. They're a joy to watch and their chemistry is riveting. Their progression through the movie is also very interesting to watch as they flip flop roles throughout the film. At times Thelma will be the strong and controlled type, but at other times Louise will have to take over this role while Thelma gets her head on straight. The mishaps these two have on their way to Mexico present increasingly more complex dilemmas to work out of, and the excellent performances of Sarandon and Davis keep it entertaining most of the way through. The rest of the cast, for what it's worth, are good too but the main focus is on Thelma and Louise. This film seems very anti-male, however. Pretty much every male character in this movie is either a scoundrel, a liar, or a cheater. I guess that's fitting for a movie that focuses on two strong willed and self sufficient women, but I had to scratch my head and think, jeez... we're not all this bad are we? But at least you can clearly see the film's intentions.Thelma & Louise won an Oscar for best original screenplay and I can't argue too much with that. It's a well deserved Oscar because the dialouge in this is definitely something worth noting. It captures the mindsets and attitudes of the midwest population very well. The script has a lot of life to it and even if Thelma and Louise were the only two characters in the film it would still be entertaining for a while to watch them interact. As for the story itself, most of what happens keeps it interesting, but it seems to drag towards the middle and becomes somewhat tedious. But it is all worth it when you reach the end where you realize what might have seemed tedious before was actually just build up for a riveting ending that sent chills through my body. The ending is absolutely fantastic and is no shorter or longer than it needed to be.Thelma & Louise is a worthwhile watch. It's a fun adventure story with two great main characters who you will fall in love with and be rooting for the entire movie. The portrayal of men is a little discerning, but it's also fitting to some of the central focus of the film. The film may seem redundant towards the middle but it's all worth it in the end, making this movie an all around good ride.

The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.The Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.Lt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.From there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.Like I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau (The Room) when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.Well, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.It's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, This is merely superconductor electromagnetism.

There isn't a whole lot too this film but that might be what makes it so great. It's a straightforward story about Robert Rodriguez's own man with no name character. But instead of literally being called The Man With No Name, our protagonist is simple called El Mariachi. El Mariachi is a traveling guitar player whose only dream is to carry on the legacy his guitarist ancestors established. He has to take a detour from this dream when he is mistaken for someone with much more sinister intentions than he. A man by the name of Azul is taking out a drug dealer's men trying to get his money the drug dealer owes him. Moco the drug dealer sends his men out to find and kill Azul. The only problem is his men don't know what he looks like and their only identifier is that he wears all black and carries a guitar case filled with guns. Unfortunately for El Mariachi, he also fits this description minus the firearms. And even though the story is fairly simple, it feels like a lot happens in this film, especially for one that only runs 80 minutes.The most defining thing about El Mariachi is its independent feel, which doesn't hold the film back at all. In fact, it gives it a much more intense and gritty feel. It's lack of glamour and glitz makes it a lot more visceral and, to me at least, more exciting. Rodriguez directs this film with a very rough around the edges feel to it. There are a lot of close ups and plenty of quick hand-held shots that put you into the middle of the action, but due to the low budget aura of the film you don't feel shoved into the action, instead just precariously placed there to watch it all unfold in a very real sense without being over dramatized. You have to respect El Mariachi for what it is and if you do you can enjoy it much more.Like I said before, El Mariachi delivers a lot in under 90 minutes. Amidst the great low budget action sequences there really is a great story, despite any simplicity there is on the surface. The film gives us a quick and intense opening sequence in which Azul breaks out of jail and finds out he wont be receiving his money from Moco. We are then introduced to our protagonist and what he stands for. Then we are quickly thrown into the heat of the story as Azul goes on a killing spree for revenge, and El Mariachi is chased down as a result of these actions. The film never has a dull point, which isn't saying much for such a short film, but it still makes it much more enjoyable overall. And even though we see a simple storyline on the surface, we are actually delivered a very well constructed protagonist. He is somebody we are really able to feel sorry for. He pursues such a pure dream of being a renowned guitarist just like his ancestors before him, and yet he has that dream trashed and scattered by the evil of the world. He begins the film as pretty much the only character with good intentions. The rest of the cast, albeit small, are all greedy scoundrels who taint El Mariachi's good hope. In hindsight, it is actually very depressing. And then of course the film ends with a bittersweet set up for Rodriguez's sequel to El Mariachi, Desperado.El Mariachi is simply awesome. For something so low budget and so limited, Rodriguez does great things with this movie. It's a short but fun ride that begins strong, entertains in the middle, and ends with a bang. This film shows how much can be done with so little and how you can still make a great movie without an overtly complex concept. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it.

In fact, it gives it a much more intense and gritty feel. It's lack of glamour and glitz makes it a lot more visceral and, to me at least, more exciting. Rodriguez directs this film with a very rough around the edges feel to it. There are a lot of close ups and plenty of quick hand-held shots that put you into the middle of the action, but due to the low budget aura of the film you don't feel shoved into the action, instead just precariously placed there to watch it all unfold in a very real sense without being over dramatized. You have to respect El Mariachi for what it is and if you do you can enjoy it much more.Like I said before, El Mariachi delivers a lot in under 90 minutes. Amidst the great low budget action sequences there really is a great story, despite any simplicity there is on the surface. The film gives us a quick and intense opening sequence in which Azul breaks out of jail and finds out he wont be receiving his money from Moco. We are then introduced to our protagonist and what he stands for. Then we are quickly thrown into the heat of the story as Azul goes on a killing spree for revenge, and El Mariachi is chased down as a result of these actions. The film never has a dull point, which isn't saying much for such a short film, but it still makes it much more enjoyable overall. And even though we see a simple storyline on the surface, we are actually delivered a very well constructed protagonist. He is somebody we are really able to feel sorry for. He pursues such a pure dream of being a renowned guitarist just like his ancestors before him, and yet he has that dream trashed and scattered by the evil of the world. He begins the film as pretty much the only character with good intentions. The rest of the cast, albeit small, are all greedy scoundrels who taint El Mariachi's good hope. In hindsight, it is actually very depressing. And then of course the film ends with a bittersweet set up for Rodriguez's sequel to El Mariachi, Desperado.El Mariachi is simply awesome. For something so low budget and so limited, Rodriguez does great things with this movie. It's a short but fun ride that begins strong, entertains in the middle, and ends with a bang. This film shows how much can be done with so little and how you can still make a great movie without an overtly complex concept. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it.

There isn't a whole lot too this film but that might be what makes it so great. It's a straightforward story about Robert Rodriguez's own man with no name character. But instead of literally being called The Man With No Name, our protagonist is simple called El Mariachi. El Mariachi is a traveling guitar player whose only dream is to carry on the legacy his guitarist ancestors established. He has to take a detour from this dream when he is mistaken for someone with much more sinister intentions than he. A man by the name of Azul is taking out a drug dealer's men trying to get his money the drug dealer owes him. Moco the drug dealer sends his men out to find and kill Azul. The only problem is his men don't know what he looks like and their only identifier is that he wears all black and carries a guitar case filled with guns. Unfortunately for El Mariachi, he also fits this description minus the firearms. And even though the story is fairly simple, it feels like a lot happens in this film, especially for one that only runs 80 minutes.The most defining thing about El Mariachi is its independent feel, which doesn't hold the film back at all.

It is The Karate Kid divided into three smaller karate kids. Then you times that by zero effort and you get one big fat goose egg of a movie. It is the fourth installment in the 3 Ninjas saga, and it is by far the worst. The other films I will review in time, but this is the big one. This is the one that everyone hates. It has terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and an awful story. When it comes to the acting the only person I liked was Jim Varney, but that is not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. As you would expect the child acting fails completely. The 3 ninjas are all annoying especially the little one. As for Hulk Hogan I didn't hate the performance, but it is exactly what you would expect. Then we have the action which is terrible. It goes for fighting that is practically slapstick instead of actual fighting. That is something I hate about a lot of kung fu\/karate movies. So many of them just go for laughs from kiddies instead of actual honor for the fighting. It insults it, and if I was a karate teacher I would spit on pieces of trash like this everyday. In my opinion martial arts should stay in the more adult categories. The only true exception I have seen for these largely kid friendly martial arts movies is The Karate Kid that's it. I can't wait for a day when another film like that comes around and shows kids what the art of combat is about instead of constant shots to the balls. Until then we get this. Also another thing terrible about the fighting that is unbearable is how they have weapons with knives, but they never use them. I know it's for kids, but if there is a terrorist in front of you and you have a knife that guy is getting stabbed. Have stabbing or lose the knives in my opinion. Also the fighting suffers from those cliché noises that are made when you make a punch. It gets really annoying quickly. Now we move on to the plot. It really all seems like an excuse to have Hulk Hogan. They might as well call it Hulk and 3 Ninjas. He was what sold the film in the first place, but I am going to try and explain the plot. The ninjas go to an amusement park, and it gets taken over by terrorists. The only hope is the 3 ninjas, a smart girl with glasses, and Hulk Hogan......(3 hours of laughing later) Yeah that is one of the lamest excuses for a plot I have ever seen. Then we have dialogue which just like the fighting suffers from way to much childish humor. The jokes are very repetitive. The movie just isn't funny. I'm not going to give this film a 0 star rating. It's bad, but at least it isn't Pocket Ninjas.

This sequence is an example of virtuoso visual storytelling, with very little dialogue and the story being told through a montage of David Lean inspired wide and epic landscape shots. It builds towards a superb and highly amusing action adventure sequence that very cleverly adds some character development to Indiana Jones, well played at this stage by the late River Phoenix. It then segues forward some 25 years with a very clever cut to the Harrison Ford incarnation.The strength of this story (a collaboration between George Lucas, Spielberg, and writers Menno Meyjes and Jeffery Boam, with no doubt significant input from Connery and Ford) is the Indiana Jones character finding his estranged father, played in a tour de force performance by Sean Connery. While there is the obligatory search for a lost artifact, in this case the Holy Grail, this search is the secondary plot, with the interplay between father and son becoming the primary plot. Despite just a 12 year difference in ages between Ford and Connery, their interplay works brilliantly and is the genuine heart of the movie. This powerful emotional connection between these characters is an ingredient that is missing from the previous two films and really brings this audience into the story. While the set pieces don't have the same level of ingenuity, relentless pace or sheer film-making bravado as Raiders of the Lost Ark,the film is far more character based, light hearted and emotionally involving than the previous two outings. The film maintains interest in these acting sequences thanks to wonderful performances. While Connery and Ford do dominate the proceedings, Denholm Elliot and Jonathan Rhys Davis offer excellent support again. Irish actress Alison Doody is highly amusing as Elsa Schneider, and it is a shame that her career didn't take off after this film the way it should have done. Veteran British actors Michael Byrne and Julian Glover have fun with their roles, and Byrne in particular is given some pithy one liners. The story builds neatly to a clever and powerful climax, leading to a warm and amusing coda at the end of the movie.Technically the film as accomplished as usual. However, the more character driven nature of the story means that visual effects take much more of a back seat in this film, and ILMs work is more subtle and understated in this film, making use of mainly traditional optical techniques and on set live special effects, with the one exception of a very well realised effect at the films climax which involved the use of stop motion combined the morphing technology overseen by ILM digital pioneers Doug Smythe and Les Dittert. The films centrepiece, a major action sequence set in the desert using horses, trucks, cars and a tank is carried off with usual Spielberg bravado and style, and works due to the audience following what the characters are doing, rather than the set piece itself. Kudos to Oscar winning special effects supervisor George Gibbs, second unit director Michael Moore and editor Michael Kahn and producer George Lucas (who also helped out with the editing) for making the action sequences look so polished and convincing. Spielberg even manages to insert little gems of witty dialogue and some terrific visual gags into the action, particularly one involving Indiana Jones incredulous reaction to using a Luger revolver. They work so well because they fit the situation the characters are in. The sound work is first rate, and Ben Burtt and Richard Hymns won Oscars for their sound effects. What is impressive is that because the sound helps convince you are right there with what is going on, rather than being loud and in your face. Burtt had already won Academy awards for his work on Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and ET. He has continued to work on a wide body of work since and is still one of Hollywood top artists in this area. Richard Hymns, after winning this first Academy Award, went on to win again in this area for Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan and has also worked on a series of high profile films including Avatar. Douglas Slocombe's photography is more understated this time around, but still stylish. The film seems to make a statement that it is the characters rather than the action which is to the forefront, and indicates a maturing of the franchise.

Among other things they discuss a local string of crimes perpetrated by two low life brothers named Seth and Richie Gecko, that include robbery, murder and kidnapping. It seems they are headed for the border which will mean they go right through the local area. Earl hopes that will be the case, he is the local sheriff after all.A quick reveal shows that Seth and Richie are indeed nearby, and after an action packed and frankly hilarious shootout they leave the smoldering remains of the bottle-O and hit the road.The Gecko's aren't your regular petty crims, Seth (George Clooney) is the heavily tatted mastermind, cool, calm and calculated. All business. While Richie is deeply insecure, cold-bloodedly violent and basically f*cking nuts, always a good combo.They are indeed on the way to Mexico, to be more specific a backwater town named El-Ray, where they will be meeting their fence, (the guy who will buy the stolen goods), but first they must cross the border, where they are Public Enemy #s 1 & 2.Enter Jacob, Kate and Scott, a family on holiday in their camper van. Jacob has lost his wife in a car-wreck, which made him question his faith to the point that he has given up his role as a Priest, Kate and Scott are his children, the fact that Scott is of Chinese descent is acknowledged but never explained.Seth and Richie abduct the entire family and demand that they escort them across the border to safety, now even though Jacob has a troubled past he is still humble, yet steely determined, and he initially says no chance. That is until Seth threatens to sic Richie onto Kate.Now to expedite proceedings after some shennanigans they find themselves across the border and in Mexico, where Seth directs them to a local bar called the Titty-Twister for celebratory beers.Now up to this point the happenings in this film were only improbable. Here it gets a little bit crazier.At the totally O.T.T. Titty Twister the Tarantino part of the film ends, the rest being all Rodriguez. The bar is populated by heaps of familiar character actors and film personalities, a short list includes Cheech Marin, Tom Savini, Greg Nicotero, Danny Trejo and Fred Williamson, Salma arrives later. The bar has strippers and crazy dancers, an inhouse band, surly staff and dangerous looking clientèle.Nice.After some petty fights involving various staff and drinkers, (featuring what I would venture a guess as being the first genital cannon in cinema outside of porn!) the tone slips down a notch, as Salma arrives.53 minutes running time.Salma plays Satanico Pandemonium, the exotically named, exotic looking, exotic dancer, complete with the previously mentioned albino reptile. Over the next three or so minutes she puts on a dance that has the bar transfixed, and I dare say many bars in the audience were transfixed from this point too.Now up to this point the happenings in the film were only wildly improbable. Here it goes cuckoo-f*cking-bananas! 58 minutes running time.Salma, (as we know it) moves on, and all sh*t breaks loose.The remainder of the film has scant plot aside from the fact that our characters are beset by honest to goodness vampires from this point on until the credits. There are numerous sightgags, some effects work that is equal parts dodgy and inspired, and gore galore, but all of it more cheesy than cringe-inducing.Most standard vampire rules apply, stakes, holy water, crosses etc&#x85; and the small group of surviving non-bloodsuckers must make it to dawn to see if the final rule, that of death by sunlight, applies.There is some great dialogue, frenetic action and inspired chaos, there are also some quite hilarious intermissions, most notably Fred Williamson's 'Nam recollections that seem to ramble on and on, all the while becoming more animated.While this isn't as critically embraced as Pulp Fiction or even Sin City, and with reason, From Dusk Till Dawn is amazingly efficient genre-busting film-making. I've said before you can't watch the same film over and over again without getting bored, you need some variety, something different sometimes.The fact is that From Dusk Till Dawn is likely totally different from almost anything you'll watch this year.

Many critics, magazines and sites have listed Yi yi in the lists of the best films of the decade and due to that the film has gained quite a reputation. But the reputation doesn't mean that this would be an easy treat or a pretentious art-house flick. Win of the best director at Cannes and plenty of other trophies for Edward Yang have just proved how talented he is. Just as in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999) in Yi yi the situations build around family rituals; weddings, funerals, births and divorces. But at once I must say that one cannot even compare Yi yi with Magnolia, many have but I think they're competing on very different calibers. Yi yi is much more insightful, impressionistic and intimate compared to its western companion.An honest man, who is the shareholder of an IT company hears that his mother in law has sunk into a coma the same day his brother in law is getting married. This shakes his family, which includes his wife, his 8-year-old son and a teenage daughter. The doctor recommends them to keep company for her and different kind of confessions and explanations bond the stories of the characters together.Yi yi is a family saga, a chronicle and a study of the agony caused by performance pressures. Most of the story is set near a high block of flats and the halls of it, which is full of rich residents. Edward Yang's film is a fascination of impressionistic imagery; the reflections on the windows, the precisely considered pictures to the silhouette of high buildings and the traffic jams. His 'mise-en-scene' is amazingly well handled and he comes close to Bressonian geographic perfection where each image has a meaning. As Eric Rohmer has said film is art of state and the state of Yang's film tells us about rootlessness and agony. The visuality of Yi yi is very subtle - Yang uses a lot of inappropriate long shots when he shows us the chores of his characters, outside the room, behind the window filled with distressing reflections of the city and the traffic. So the postmodern architecture works as a way for Yang to tell us something about the lives of the characters.Edward Yang's film is a quality film for its style, but also for its purpose and contents. It's quite a philosophical film filled with ontological riddles How can we see the whole truth, why am I me and not you. Yi yi is a film about generations and it forces the middle-aged characters to stop for a while and think about their lives; the choices made and the consequences to come. It challenges its viewer to think about the eternal question, the meaning of life and in an unique way.The urban aesthetics of Yi yi is gorgeous and the fascination Edward Yang feels for the high buildings, traffic and reflections is astonishing. At times the way he uses the state of film, resembles me of Jacques Tati's Play Time (1967). Filled with beautiful, gorgeous images Yi yi is a film about life and reality. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then Yi yi truly is an 'Imitation of Life' and sometimes an imitation can be greater than life itself.One and a two.. what does the easy dilemma of one plus two equal. It certainly sounds easy but perhaps it's not. The meaning of life - the eternal dilemma.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 November 2010","score":"","review":" Just as South-Korea so has Taiwan risen to the world of cinema in the beginning of the 21st century and Yi yi (A One and a Two) by Edward Yang is one of the top films of Taiwan. Many critics, magazines and sites have listed Yi yi in the lists of the best films of the decade and due to that the film has gained quite a reputation. But the reputation doesn't mean that this would be an easy treat or a pretentious art-house flick. Win of the best director at Cannes and plenty of other trophies for Edward Yang have just proved how talented he is. Just as in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999) in Yi yi the situations build around family rituals; weddings, funerals, births and divorces. But at once I must say that one cannot even compare Yi yi with Magnolia, many have but I think they're competing on very different calibers. Yi yi is much more insightful, impressionistic and intimate compared to its western companion.An honest man, who is the shareholder of an IT company hears that his mother in law has sunk into a coma the same day his brother in law is getting married. This shakes his family, which includes his wife, his 8-year-old son and a teenage daughter. The doctor recommends them to keep company for her and different kind of confessions and explanations bond the stories of the characters together.Yi yi is a family saga, a chronicle and a study of the agony caused by performance pressures. Most of the story is set near a high block of flats and the halls of it, which is full of rich residents. Edward Yang's film is a fascination of impressionistic imagery; the reflections on the windows, the precisely considered pictures to the silhouette of high buildings and the traffic jams. His 'mise-en-scene' is amazingly well handled and he comes close to Bressonian geographic perfection where each image has a meaning. As Eric Rohmer has said film is art of state and the state of Yang's film tells us about rootlessness and agony. The visuality of Yi yi is very subtle - Yang uses a lot of inappropriate long shots when he shows us the chores of his characters, outside the room, behind the window filled with distressing reflections of the city and the traffic. So the postmodern architecture works as a way for Yang to tell us something about the lives of the characters.Edward Yang's film is a quality film for its style, but also for its purpose and contents. It's quite a philosophical film filled with ontological riddles How can we see the whole truth, why am I me and not you. Yi yi is a film about generations and it forces the middle-aged characters to stop for a while and think about their lives; the choices made and the consequences to come. It challenges its viewer to think about the eternal question, the meaning of life and in an unique way.The urban aesthetics of Yi yi is gorgeous and the fascination Edward Yang feels for the high buildings, traffic and reflections is astonishing. At times the way he uses the state of film, resembles me of Jacques Tati's Play Time (1967). Filled with beautiful, gorgeous images Yi yi is a film about life and reality. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then Yi yi truly is an 'Imitation of Life' and sometimes an imitation can be greater than life itself.One and a two.. what does the easy dilemma of one plus two equal. It certainly sounds easy but perhaps it's not. The meaning of life - the eternal dilemma. Edward Yang doesn't offer any answers for his audience but he does give a lot of thinking to do, while he is studying the dilemma himself. Yi yi is without a doubt a great film for its content, style, philosophy and purpose.

This is quite unlike 90% of action films made in the last 2 decades, and it's better than almost all of them.Frank White is released from prison, by Christopher Walken, who is white - even for a white guy.In fact in this movie I am convinced that Walken glows in certain scenes he is so pasty, they actually could have used him for lighting.So back to Frank White, now a free man Frank decides to get straight back into it in every respect. In the initial scenes the various Its include his limo, the crime business - and various women including his lawyer.Frank obviously has a way with people, he is disarmingly honest (where possible) and direct, and he is very loyal to his gang. And they reciprocate. Frank also moves in different circles, as well as the lower socioeconomic area that he resides in, and does business with, he also spends time with the cities' elite, pressing the flesh and trying to broker deals of a different nature.There is the initial montage that goes along with reestablishing turf, various rival dealers and kingpins are dealt with, the violence in these scenes is quite immediate and realistic, no amazing stunt leaps or protracted death rolls here, you are shot and you fall down, there are no dramatic final carefully scripted words. (These scenes reminded me a lot of Beat Takeshi and his films, especially Brother, which coincidentally enough had a non-black guy running a crime gang staffed mostly by black guys.) Frank also turns an attempted mugging into an impromptu recruitment drive. This sounds odd, but is even odder when you factor in that he was interrupted mid titty-squeeze on the subway!The difference between Frank and say Nino Brown or Tony Montana, is that Frank actually seems determined to help the very same group of people that is selling to, one of his pet projects is personally funding a hospital in a poorer area using 16M of his own money.When he tries to co-opt a rival gang leader into assisting he is met with scorn and derision. Here we learn another thing about Frank, if you knock back a deal, he'll get what he wants anyway, just through other more violent means.As Frank and his crew expand and become more successful, he attracts the attention of two groups, rival gangs wary of losing turf and customers, and the cops. We already know how Frank and co deal with rival gangs, let's talk about the cops.The cops are both a strength and a weakness in this film. In the early sections we meet them all, Roy (Victor Argo) is the time-weathered Boss, determined to nab Frank but rendered almost powerless by the system. Tommy (Wesley Snipes) and Dennis (David Caruso) are the younger hotheads that are willing to do anything to keep the streets clean, there is also a fourth newly-wed cop who anyone (who has seen an action movie at least) knows is only there to be killed.The cops have a minor victory when they manage to find a real living witness to a crime committed by Frank's henchman, most notably Jimmy Jump (Larry Fishburne, more on him later). In a show of loyalty Frank plumps up the sizable bail to free his men, and this is where things change.The cops, realizing that the normal legit channels just don't work, decide to go to a slightly more shady Plan B, from here on in everything moves along towards the inevitable conclusion. Only in a film like this we can never be sure who will actually triumph, after all the criminal is loyal, honest and wants to maintain a valuable hospital servicing the inner city with his own money, and the cops are willing to use illegal means to get what they want.There is an exceptional car chase, a shoot out and some well written and impeccably timed one-liners in the concluding sequences, though this isn't your standard action\/crime film. Key characters on both sides are killed, often abruptly and violently, and loyalties are tested.The film ends in a slow languid scene that is in obvious contrast to the hectic action that preceded it, and the scene is quite fitting for a crime film in which there are no real winners.The King of New York is deservedly seen as a cult classic, and while many so called cult classic are of the sh*t films that people saw when they were high so they talk them up variety this one is truly worth your time.Now, as alluded to earlier, even though he was given scant mention in the above write up Larry Fishburne as Jimmy Jump must go down as one of the coolest MFs to ever appear in a film. Larry plays him as animated, chirpy yet also skittish. He is a cold-blooded assassin that also runs around like a 7 year old full of green cordial, and in one of the shootouts near the close of the film he moves effortlessly through the scenery, even while pumping rounds into other bad guys (and unfortunately some cops).Final Rating &#x96; 8.5 \/ 10.

It is shot in Italy and the dialogue is in Italian. However, it is difficult to find an original video in its native language track. The dubbing in English is average but it will not be taken into consideration in my assessment of the film.A Fistful of Dollars stars the legendary Clint Eastwood who plays the iconic man with no name. Here, he takes on the name of Joe after wandering into a town on a barren, desolate land. In this town, there are two warring families driven by greed, lust, and power. Their method of communication is through violence; this has wrecked the entire town resulting in its few inhabitants leading their lives in constant fear.Joe, the unwavering gunfighter, decides to pit the two families against each other through a series of cat-and-mouse games in an attempt to wipe all of them out and free the town. His plan works and backfires at the same time, making it interesting to observe how the situation would play out. Of course, if you have seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961) in which Leone's film is based upon, then you would have an idea what to expect.A Fistful of Dollars is Leone's second feature but his first collaboration with composer Ennio Morricone, whose music would play a huge role in the success of Leone's future films, reaching its zenith with the epic, operatic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Here, Morricone's raw sounds complement the stark cinematography and rough editing, giving the film a kind of gritty cover over its amateurish character interplay characterized by dead one-liners that are occasionally unintentionally funny.The final action set-piece raises the tension a notch higher. Complete with wind, dust, and in sweltering heat, Leone sets Joe against the chief villain in a dawn shootout that is expertly staged and precisely executed. It is this climatic sequence that gives viewers the best glimpse of Leone's filmmaking talent and his unmatched sense of timing.A Fistful of Dollars is a B-grade spaghetti Western that entertains and is quite admired by many. Leone tried to replicate it with For a Few Dollars More (1965) but, in my opinion, to a far less successful outcome.

The dialogues are a no-miss, some of them are truly excellent and add to the effect to the movie. Gandalf's You shall not Pass statement to the Balrog is of such power and magnitude, it will send a chill down your spine. The screenplay, the display, the music is all magnificent and adds to the beauty of the Lord of the Rings.All in all, The Fellowship of The Ring is a masterpiece. Those unfamiliar with the Middle-Earth and its characters will find it a little difficult to cope up with, but no worries. The mere beauty of this film will leave them happy come end. This is a terrific movie, and it will be one of the best movies I have ever seen, along with the other 2 movies of the LOTR franchise. A full 10 \/ 10. Do not miss it.

Giger; renowned lunatic genius), without a reduction in quality and realism. And with a horror theme to boot!Alien finds the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo awoken from (let's call it) hypersleep to find they are not near Earth, as should be the case, but still in the middle of nowhere. The ship's computer named Mother has intercepted some sort of signal that has impelled them to cite a space directive saying they must reroute the mission to investigate.The design of the ship is quite cool, things aren't all immaculate like most sci-fi films, and the crew actually has two blue-collar boys who look after the maintenance and engines, (and whinge about it 99% of the time). The high-tech stuff probably looked high-tech in the 80s, now it looks as futuristic as an Atari 2600 would to a kid with a PS3.So after some grumping (and some scenes that serve little else but to highlight the ranking order in the ship and an insight into each character) it is agreed that they must take an unplanned detour to look into things and investigate the signal. The landing does not go smoothly unfortunately and the ship is damaged on landing on the moon's surface, three of the crew, Dallas, Lambert and Cain head off to find the source of the signal while Parker and Brett attempt to get the ship space-worthy, with Ripley and Ash staying aboard to supervise.Now the action takes place with the research crew, as they near the signal they find an otherworldly structure, complete with what looks like a fossilized creature of some kind, and a lower area with hundreds of seed-pod looking things, only they are a metre tall and quiver when you near them. Cain accidentally falls into the pod area, and one of the pods opens in an ominous fashion.Cut to shortly after as the three approach the ship, Cain being carried by this point. After an animated discussion between Dallas, Ripley and Ash regarding the suitability of allowing them access to the ship with a something else in tow, Cain is put into the medical bay where they can see exactly what the hell is going on.Cain has a massive creature affixed to his face. No other way to say it. In truth I'd be ejecting him from the ship right now, complete with a eulogy of what a top bloke he was, after all no good can come from a massive creature being attached to your face, be it alien, animal or Kirstie Alley, (I know, low blow on an easy target).In looking at the creature Ash finds some startling facts (for those that haven't seen the film nor any of its sequels), it has built in defense mechanisms, most notably acid for blood, and seems to be rummaging around inside Cain's body&#x85; And they are still on the fence about ejecting him! The famous scene happens a little later, when Cain awakes seemingly no worse for wear, and the crew decide to have a little dinner party to celebrate a job well done before returning to hypersleep for the final leg home.Commence Ash retching a bit, flailing for a few seconds, lying on his back and giving painful birth through his chest cavity to a bouncing baby alien, that looks about, has a quick scream to set the tone and promptly bolts while the crew look at each other. Fair enough too, that sort of thing doesn't happen every day.The rest of the film involves the 6 survivors attempting to locate and destroy the being. They split into two teams initially (never a good idea), and set about hunting the thing down, perhaps in a large Tupperware container?

One of the pre-film trailers advertised a movie I had never heard of. It was a thriller called 'Bound' and the preview totally sold me - the flick looked stylish, violent, and intense. I had to see it! So, when it was released, I returned to the same cinema to check it out. I was far from disappointed. 'Bound' is a wonderful film noir up there with 'After Dark, My Sweet' and 'The Grifters'.Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Corky (Gina Gershon) steam the screen as lesbian lovers who decide to steal two million dollars from a Chicago mobster. They first meet in an elevator and Corky, who is just out of prison, soon discovers that she is doing some plumbing right next door to the apartment where Violet lives as a kept woman with her low-level mobster partner (the always excellent Joe Pantoliano).One evening Caesar bursts through the front door with a large paper grocery bag almost overflowing with blood-soaked money. He explains that the money belongs to Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian), the head of a Chicago crime family. Caesar's plan is to wash the blood off the money, hang it up to dry, iron each and every bill individually, then divide the money into denominations using an automatic counting machine, and place a band around each denomination. Then he will place all the cash neatly into a suitcase and present it to Gino when he flies in to collect it. But Violet and Corky have other ideas, and they hatch a plan to make off with the cash. Will they get away clean? This is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, but it is not for the prudish or the faint of heart. There are plenty of clever twists and some shocking violence. 'Bound' represents an opportunity to see what the directing team of the Wachowski Brothers did before they conquered the world with the mind-bending science fiction of the 'The Matrix' trilogy and the brilliant and unfairly reviled 'Speed Racer'. They show that they can be just as inventive and imaginative on a small budget as they are on a big one. If you like film noir, then this is highly recommended.
