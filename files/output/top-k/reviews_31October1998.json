[{"date":"31 October 1998","score":"16 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":"  John Carpenter is America's greatest living director of westerns.  Although Vampires is his first literal western, JC's been turning out 1st rate original westerns from Assault on Precinct 13 to They Live and Escape  From New York to The Thing.  Even though these movies don't take place in the west, they have all the ingredients of a good western the lone hero\/outlaw, the seige or attack, the showdown, and plenty of action. Vampires takes place and was filmed in the southwest (filmed in Sante Fe, NM).  Carpenter's DP Gary Kibbe captures some nice wide John Ford-ish western vistas, and Carpenter's minimalist score capture the desolate, hard nature of the place.  The real asset of this film is its cast, especially James Woods as the insanely tough and foul-mouthed slayer Jack Crow.  He really does some inspired improvised riffs, and when he's not kicking ass Woods has a lot of fun with it all.  Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter hero all man, flinty eyed & completely alone, and Woods plays this unsympathetic character with such a quick wit you can't help but admire the guy.  Thomas Ian Griffith plays a great Valek, the master vampire whom Jack has sworn to slay.  Griffith plays the character completely straight, and it works extremely well.  Griffith is an imposing figure, and you get a real sense of the nobility & savagery of Valek's character.  Compared to Woods, Griffith underplays his role, but still commands a very real presence of power & evil.  Carpenter stretches the $20 million dollar budget well, but you can sometimes see the zipper down the monster's back.  Despite a few fake looking wounds or rubbery stakes, Carpenter delivers a polished & stylish film, on par with movies costing 10 times as much (better in some cases).  I believe Carpenter works best with a little larger budget, but he should stay away from the typical Hollywood giant budget, he works best with a smaller production.  Vampires is a treat for any Carpenter fan, and hopefully marks the beginning of a new standard in his films.

The only good thing about this film James Wood. It's starts off with a great gory vampire killing scenes. This is followed by a party scene, which is followed by another killing scene, only the humans are dying. A calm scene follows this with people talking. With that I've identified all three different moods in this movie.1. Gory killing 2. Plot explanation 3. Partying, sex, and alcoholThe killing scenes eventually get very monotonous and boring. The characters also become very boring, except James Wood.  James Wood's character, Jack Crow was likable, despite the fact he enjoys entirely too much talking about other people's erections. His character was hardly consistent; he changes several times during the film, most notably, at the end of the film where he's everybody's friend, completely tolerant, a complete opposite from the middle of the film, when we've learned most about him.This movie also stars Thomas Ian Griffith, who seems to be cast solely on his resemblance to Christopher Walken. I guess Christopher Walken must have turned down the part. He most likely would have had lots more frightening lines rather than Thomas Ian Griffith, who basically does lots of groaning and hard breathing. More unbearably, through most of the movie he has this ridiculously stupid look on his face. All the scenes with Crow's sidekick, Tony Montoya seemed like filler. Most information from those scenes could have been revealed more easily and efficiently, and you are disappointed at the end when he doesn't die. There were several more characters, but they were hardly interesting.In the first scene, the master vampires are pinned as completely superior, but in the end, they are killed as easily as goons, James Wood, and the inexperienced wussy priest guy seem slack-jawed and carefree to kill them. The masters also seem as stupid as goons. Maybe this is based on the fact that they never explain how they become masters`Let's go kill some vampires.'`Yeah, whatever.'And that's where the un-needed erection jokes are used again.

As the character of Linda in the movie would say, I totally love this movie! The repeated viewings have allowed me to see where the movie's power really lies. I have narrowed it down to two things one, the movie taps into many of our subconscious fears; two, it is  technically brilliantly executed. On the first point 1) The boogeyman. A relentless killer who cannot be stopped. He is like The Thing (the movie that plays on the TV in the background), an alien creature who cannot be reasoned with, who you cannot hide from. He is the kitchen knife-wielding Terminator, and he could represent any fear that has a hold on you. 2) The threatened Suburbia. Adults work all their lives to create a safe haven to raise kids - only to disappear when the real danger lurks. This also taps into the missing parent fear. 3) Sin. As one character in Scream accurately points out, sin must be punished. It is the morality buried deep within all horror movies. 4) The Dark. Darkness represents evil. The Devil always comes out at night, and the scariest thing about haunted houses (the Myers house) is the unknown - the unknown of darkness, the unknown of how such evil could have occurred there. The unknown is a powerful force for obedience. On the second point 1) Camerawork. John Carpenter uses a roving, restless camera to good effect, the movie has a realistic street feel to it. This applies to characters as well. 2) Foreground composition. You never know where the killer is at any given moment. He's everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Until it's too late.On a movie buff note, watch for all the parallels to Hitchcock's Psycho, a movie which has spawned more imitators than virtually any other.
