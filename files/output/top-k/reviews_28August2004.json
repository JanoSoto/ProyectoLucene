You see, the acting is terrific, except for Duchovny, which is sad, because he got most of the line since he's the narrator. But Pitt is marvellous (as always - speaking as a heterosexual, so I mean his acting, just in case) and Lewis and Forbes are good as well. The story is also quite interesting doing research for your book on serial killers with the assistance of one. The problem with this movie is that it suffers from mediocre direction\/cinematography and particularly a bad soundtrack. The music sounds as if it was written for a softporn series, and add to that Duchovny's sleazy and boring narrative voice - at some points in the movie you're starting to think you're actually watching such a series. I can't believe no one else mentioned the awful music in their comments. Never use electric slide guitars in a movie soundtrack! It ruins the whole atmosphere. I thought is was going to be something like a non-Tarantino-esque 'True romance', but instead I got a decent yet very mediocre and out-of-a-dozen serial killer flick. Nice, but certainly not memorable. (Sorry for all the hyphens by the way.)

The graphicness of the drug taking scenes creeped me out -- I had to watch many of them through my fingers --  but the film touched me. It was a shock to see the birthdates and dates of death of many of the characters. I was born the same year as Babsi and my husband and several of our friends were born the same year as Axel. I saw the original German version last night and it is definitely better than the dubbed film. The voices used are American and full of teenaged slang, which may be appropriate for the age of the characters, but they are off-putting when heard with the Berlin settings. So much of the film is about Berlin as well as Christiane and her friends. Christiane F is so powerful that I remembered many of the scenes all these years. The story telling, the direction, and the acting are all impressive. Seeing it again reminded me of my own teenage years. It's sad that Christiane and her friends were caught up in such soul killing circumstances when they were so young. It's commendable that the film doesn't glamorise the drug taking, and yet never becomes didactic. It lets Christiane's life and her friends' lives speak for themselves. I have two criticisms, however. The final scene telling of Christiane's fate feels tacked on, almost like a happy ending forced on the film. I wanted to know more about Christiane's mother where was she when Christiane began taking drugs? Why in the scene in which she sees Christiane's self- inflicted tattoo does she react by only shrugging and saying `You'll have to live with it?' Why doesn't she ask more about who Christiane is spending her time with, especially this boy with the tattoo that Christiane copies? Why, after finding Christiane on the bathroom floor, does she call her boyfriend to help her withdraw? I would have taken her to a clinic straight away and never let her out of my sight again. I suppose I'll have to read the book to find out more about Christiane's family, but I would have liked to known more about her mother in the film to understand better how Christiane fell into the drug scene. Surely it wasn't just because her mother was divorced, her sister left to live with her father, and her mother neglected her to be with her own boyfriend (we never see how he reacts after discovering Christiane's syringe on the floor near her after she passes out).

Now here's what I'd like to know...why do people love this movie.The book was so lame and badly written I wanted to cry, and I couldn't get past the plot. I kept asking the one question the characters of the book never did...why? Why the hell would a man put so much on the line for a stupid field and then trek across the country to find some reclusive old man. I know what you're all thinking, it was an act of blind faith, he believed so much in the spirit and magic of baseball that he just did it without thinking. And I sort of understand that, I've seen that before in movies, but it felt so wrong in this movie. The motive behind his faith is too ridiculous for me to handle.I've read tons of comments on this movie and everyone is ga-ga over this so-called beautiful movie. People talking about how it made them love baseball for the first time, they were in awe of the movie's magic, they couldn't help but love the characters and the plot, they wept for hours into a catcher's mitt with their father, they thought it was perfect. Perfect!? What am I missing? Here's what the movie really was like. It was like some guy who loved baseball wanted to make a movie about his love for baseball, except he didn't know how to express this love so he slapped together a bunch of surreal and paranormal events in the hopes that they would somehow feel magical to the audience. Nothing fits together with this movie, it all feels forced. You got a crazy dreaming farmer who hears voices that give him abstract guidelines ( if this is supposed to be god, why doesn't he tell him to build something useful like a freakin playground for sick kids or something), then he obediently follows the orders while his half wit wife lovingly supports him without a fuss. Then you have ghosts appearing and looking spaced out while playing baseball, then Kinsella driving off on a stupid quest to find a bitter writer who is skeptical for about three seconds before catching the I love baseball virus and going on a kooky road trip back to iowa. Oh and before they get back Kinsella steps through a time warp of some kind to talk to an old doctor from the seventies, and then pick up the doctor's teenage self on the road. All the while nobody gives a damn why anything like this is happening, they just go along with it. The one guy who doesn't just roll over, Kinsella's brother, is pretty much considered to be the bad guy in the film. Why? Because he's confused over obviously insane behaviour, because he's trying to salvage a destroyed farm? And let's not forget the weepingly amazing ending Kinsella daughter takes a three foot fall off some bleachers and then is saved by a ghost baseball player who trans-mutates himself or whatever into his old doctor self so he can execute the medical smack-on-the-back method to save the girls life. Then the author dies and kinsella gets to play catch with his dad...whoop-dee-doo. You're right, that sounds like the best movie ever made...no, wait, it sounds like three different movies mixed together and then covered in a coating of suck.Everyone who loves this movie must be legally brain dead, I can only assume that most of the people writing these comment must be Americans who think baseball is the most glorious thing ever. Even these people can't decide what the movie is. Some people say that it's all about baseball, while others say it has nothing to do with baseball. Check it for yourself. Well I'm as confused as anyone cause I don't know what the hell this movie is about. If it is about baseball, and the faith and magic of baseball, then that's just stupid. Because I hate to break it to everyone, but baseball is the most mind numbingly boring sport ever devised. How can anyone marvel at this sport, is it the absence of strategy, the absence of motion for about 90 percent of the game, or is it the graceful ballet of spitting steroid-filled jerks who tug at their balls for that 90 percent?The acting was bad, the characters were annoying and empty, the plot was nonsensical, and the ending was stupid and once again forced my to wonder, 'why?'. I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but I'm sure this is just a lost cause. Most people love this movie for some reason, and can't wait to watch it again so the can bask in the magic of baseball dreams, eat a hotdog, and then cry. I hated the book, and the movie lived up to the book. If you want a touching movie about baseball, go rent 'The Sandlot' or something, at least it doesn't have characters who see ghosts and stand around staring at them like a bunch of nitwits.

You got a crazy dreaming farmer who hears voices that give him abstract guidelines ( if this is supposed to be god, why doesn't he tell him to build something useful like a freakin playground for sick kids or something), then he obediently follows the orders while his half wit wife lovingly supports him without a fuss. Then you have ghosts appearing and looking spaced out while playing baseball, then Kinsella driving off on a stupid quest to find a bitter writer who is skeptical for about three seconds before catching the I love baseball virus and going on a kooky road trip back to iowa. Oh and before they get back Kinsella steps through a time warp of some kind to talk to an old doctor from the seventies, and then pick up the doctor's teenage self on the road. All the while nobody gives a damn why anything like this is happening, they just go along with it. The one guy who doesn't just roll over, Kinsella's brother, is pretty much considered to be the bad guy in the film. Why? Because he's confused over obviously insane behaviour, because he's trying to salvage a destroyed farm? And let's not forget the weepingly amazing ending Kinsella daughter takes a three foot fall off some bleachers and then is saved by a ghost baseball player who trans-mutates himself or whatever into his old doctor self so he can execute the medical smack-on-the-back method to save the girls life. Then the author dies and kinsella gets to play catch with his dad...whoop-dee-doo. You're right, that sounds like the best movie ever made...no, wait, it sounds like three different movies mixed together and then covered in a coating of suck.Everyone who loves this movie must be legally brain dead, I can only assume that most of the people writing these comment must be Americans who think baseball is the most glorious thing ever. Even these people can't decide what the movie is. Some people say that it's all about baseball, while others say it has nothing to do with baseball. Check it for yourself. Well I'm as confused as anyone cause I don't know what the hell this movie is about. If it is about baseball, and the faith and magic of baseball, then that's just stupid. Because I hate to break it to everyone, but baseball is the most mind numbingly boring sport ever devised. How can anyone marvel at this sport, is it the absence of strategy, the absence of motion for about 90 percent of the game, or is it the graceful ballet of spitting steroid-filled jerks who tug at their balls for that 90 percent?The acting was bad, the characters were annoying and empty, the plot was nonsensical, and the ending was stupid and once again forced my to wonder, 'why?'. I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but I'm sure this is just a lost cause. Most people love this movie for some reason, and can't wait to watch it again so the can bask in the magic of baseball dreams, eat a hotdog, and then cry. I hated the book, and the movie lived up to the book. If you want a touching movie about baseball, go rent 'The Sandlot' or something, at least it doesn't have characters who see ghosts and stand around staring at them like a bunch of nitwits.

So, just being in space was enough for the 7 year old version of myself to give this film two thumbs up.Today, as I pop in Star Trek The Motion Picture, Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back or Alien, I am still pulled in, all of these films hold up nicely.  These films all had minor flaws, but all are watchable as an adult.The Black Hole plays like a boardroom of idiots rewrote a relatively spartan script about a mad scientist.  Much of the film was totally unnecessary - like the shooting gallery bit, the meteorite bit, and the evil robots standing in a row getting shot at bit, and were clearly added in.  Why?  Because boardroom mentality says you can't have sci-fi without laser wielding fights.  The boardroom wants cute robots, just like Star Wars, and the boardroom thought that getting pulled into a blackhole wasn't dramatic enough, so they did some group think and came up with a bright red meteor shower that is described by the cast in the same way you would talk about a thunder storm.This film is absolutely worthless.  I can't believe I actually liked it as a child.  The acting is horrible, the robots are very lame, the special effects suck, and basic facts about space are completely lost here (like everything freezing and snow starts falling when a compartment is exposed to space).  Just remember, this film came about 10 years after 2001, two years after Star Wars, one year after Star Trek, and came out the same year as Alien.  I don't remember seeing any strings holding up the Enterprise, the Odyssey or Luke's X-Wing.

I recently took the DVD home from my local library for a repeat viewing and found it lacking in a heck of a lot of ways. Since it places style over substance, I don't think the film has dated very well at all, which is frightening since it's only six years old; somehow it feels much older than that, which is not a good thing in a film that tries to preserve an already-dated movement for all posterity. In particular, the music video sequences are not only pretty anachronistic and\/or pointless but look absolutely silly now. There are sizeable goofs, gaping plot holes, what little plot there is trods on and on, and in general I feel like I'm being spoon-fed and cliché-beaten far too often while watching this film. The Tommy Stone character, a sort of ridiculous, generic 80s pop-superstar caricature whose musical style or appeal is never shown or explained whatsoever (while every third person on the street is wearing a Tommy Stone mask-- they didn't even do this for Michael Jackson, yo!), is pretty indicative of how this film goes wrong. Ewan McGregor's performance, as almost everyone has pointed out, is pretty great... although he DOES look way too much like Kurt Cobain, and I think his character paints Iggy Pop in a far-too-positive light. He also upstages pretty much everybody else on screen, including the essentially unlikeable reporter that so many others here seem to enjoy. Everybody else turns in flat or laughably overdone performances (sometimes both!).The soundtrack to this movie *is* really great and is the only thing that keeps the film from totally collapsing. Lots of especially choice Eno cuts, a bunch of equally wonderful stuff from T. Rex and Roxy Music, some pretty well-done nuevo-glam facsimiles from my boys in Shudder to Think (no one else would have been nearly so capable!), an all-star cast for the on-screen bands (holy cow-- the Wylde Rats include original Stooge Ron Asheton... not to mention Mike Watt, Thurston Moore, Steve Shelley, and Don Fleming!), and even a couple of period covers that SHOULD have come off as sacrilegious travesties but manage to largely succeed. This movie is, I will admit, one of the very few movies that can make gay life look slightly interesting and even a little arousing from a mostly-heterosexual viewer's perspective. But I think that, had the actual subject (glam rock, of course!) been less interesting and the music less well-done, this movie would have been a major dud. I do sort of take issue as well with the work of fiction based on real-life characters thing, because-- as with the equally fictional Amadeus-- many folks will go into this movie knowing next to nothing about the artists on whom the characters are closely modeled, and will leave thinking that SOMETHING like this must've actually happened. Oh, and for a really good time, freeze-frame the DVD every time a newspaper article is shown on-screen and check out the actual text of the article (I was especially amused by the story on Slade's cocaine arrest). It's a pretty stunning example of the lack of attention to detail that plagues the film throughout.

It was from the character's heart and mind and it was not a wasted moment. It was nice to see Chris Cooper as Redford's brother. He always puts me on notice every time he appears in a movie. Also, Scarlett Johansson in her first major role. Visually it was a beautiful-looking movie thanks to Oliver Stone's regular cinematographer Robert Richardson. I only saw the movie after buying Thomas Newman's musical score. His music cuts appear on many movie trailers in the past few years.Bottom line, I have very mixed feelings. It did not deserve the epic-size scope for an intimate, simple storyline. In this movie, Redford the director is better than Redford the actor.

After having watched it, I was very impressed, both by the acting and the overall film quality. The theme is based on the well-known novel of the same name, by Russian author, Vladimir Nabokov. I found it very well-presented; unlike what you might expect, you don't loathe or despise Irons' character. You may find some of his actions disturbing, perhaps even disgusting. But you understand him, and you sympathize with him. The plot is great, it evolves at a very good pace, rarely standing still at any point. I don't think there was any point during the film where I was bored. The acting is great; Jeremy Irons gives a stellar performance, as do Melanie Griffith, Frank Langella and Dominique Swain. Of all those, I think it was actually Swain who impressed me the most; maybe it's because this was her first film, and she didn't have any acting experience. Or maybe it's because, well, despite knowing that she was very young when she made this film, I was, just like Irons' character, Humbert, attracted to her. Her performance as Lolita is amazing. The cinematography is very good, at times great. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The characters are well-written and credible. The amount of humor in the film, however little it may be, was good. It helped the viewer ease into the somewhat uncomfortable subject of the film. The climax of the film is great; despite being hinted at, throughout the film, it came as a surprise, and truly sent a chill down my spine. Now, as I mentioned early on in this review, I have not seen Stanley Kubrick's version of Lolita; I have not read the book, either. Therefore, I can't really say if this is an accurate depiction of the story or not. But I found it to be a very good piece of cinema, and I suspect most people interested in the subject would too. I recommend this to fans of any of the actors, possibly Nabokov's novel, and\/or people who are interested in the subject matter. I will advise anyone who sees it, though, to be prepared; the film is quite explicit, and some will definitely take very much offense from it.

It is a movie that owes a lot to the history of cinema, that's for sure, and perhaps a bit to De Palma's persona life - I understand Peter Miller and his recording equipment are based on an episode in De Palma's life which has somewhat transpired a bit into all his films via voyeurism.The plot is a straightforward mystery story about a transsexual psychiatrist who's adopted the persona of &#145;Bobbi' and is murdering female patients for reasons concerning his sexuality.  Michael Caine performs this role with his natural talent. Nancy Allen plays a prostitute who becomes Dr. Elliot's next victim after she witnesses his first murder. Again, Allen also does a good job. And we have Dennis Franz as a rather stereotypical detective, and he's somewhat okay. Unfortunately their performances are restrained due to the screenplay which isn't awe-inspiring. The characters - especially detective Marino - do some illogical thinking and actions in the movie, like forcing Liz to commit illegal things to clear herself out of any suspicion&#133; even though he knows she's innocent. There are convoluted things like this going on throughout the movie.In between the plot De Palma overemphasizes the sex and gory violence in the movie, very seldom feeling necessary. This, I'd assume, is the giallo influence revealing itself. The ending is De Palma emulating Carrie's ending, which feels just a fill-in. And yet there's a scene I love in it a nurse is checking a bed-ridden Dr. Elliot, who wakes up and proceeds to strangle her; then he starts undressing - and this is all happening while above him, in several balconies, an audience watches with glee and applauds. This morbid interest in death is perhaps a reflection of the viewer's own voyeuristic interest in seeing this bloody story being told, which is not unlike Hitchcock's Rear Window. I recently read an internet article about a doctor recently made a public autopsy with an audience present, reminiscent of the old medical sessions where a teacher would cut up a body while his class watched the operation. There is modern interest in watching death, and perhaps for that Dressed To Kill is more relevant today than in 1980 the whole movie reeks with the notion of voyeurism and sensory information and the fascination with death, and perhaps demands from the viewer introspection as to why he wants to see these bloody movies.

If more were made of the Jim Henson animatronics and if it had stuck closer to the comic-book source instead of giving us a live action version of the awful (let's be honest) 80's animated show then it could have been a classic. Not what we get.The original black and white comics of TMNT were a-maz-ing! The depth, the mythology, the subtext, the endless Lovecraftian allusions and the overall coolness of it is something so great I am sure it can never be done again. The 80's animated show was a travesty. We got robots instead of humans in the Foot Clan, the friendly Utrom aliens were made into a bad guy (Krang), Rocksteady and Beebop!, the Technodrome!, underground drilling machine-thingies and those awful, awful surfer dialect words. Who can honestly NOT cringe when they hear 'Cowabunga', 'bodacious' or 'excellent' in this day and age?The plot loosely matches that of the first issue of the comic-book. Only it's toned down and it's too heavily influenced by the TV show. The Shredder has a tamer 'death' compared to the comic book (he was thrown off a roof while holding a live hand grenade-BOOM!). Though I am glad the Turtles' origin is told in flashback instead of starting right at the beginning like so many other comic-book movies. Steve Barron's direction (Merlin and erm...Coneheads) brings some integrity to the film. I like the grainy and gritty look to some scenes and he seems to take the animatronics more seriously than the directors for the later sequels.Speaking of which, the animatronics are actually still quite good and if made today I'd still be impressed. The real human cast is a bit of a letdown. Judith Hoag is awful as April O'Neil, in the comics she was a lab assistant to the evil Baxter Stockman but the TV show inexplicably changed her to a News Reporter. That's what she is here. And the ginger kid who plays Danny is pretty bad also. However, Elias Koteas is totally brilliant as Casey Jones. I can't imagine anyone being more perfect in this role.The humor, minus the surfer drawl, is still funny. I especially like Raphael (my fave-he has a BAD attitude) coming out of a cinema showing 'Critters' and saying 'Where the hell do they come up with this stuff?'And John Du Prez's(who???) score may sound heavily dated in parts but it keeps the action scenes moving along nicely. The fights may look incredibly staged and false but at least they have a nice beat.It's still superior to the sequels and plenty fun. Just don't grit your teeth so hard at the silly, completely out-of-place and out-of-time surfer words and appreciate the darker tone the sequels ditched in favor of kiddie-friendly rubbish. The DVD gives a 1.851 anamorphic transfer of the movie and it's very grainy and dirty (as the film was shot) but the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack packs a loud punch with plenty of bass. Extras are minimal. New Line should re-release this as a Platinum\/Infinifilm Special Edition.And just for the record, there will be NO 4th turtles movie. There was talk of it years ago but the guys who were interested in making it ended up choosing to produce the Bulletproof Monk movie instead.
