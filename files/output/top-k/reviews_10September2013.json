[{"date":"10 September 2013","score":"","review":" Released in 2000, Me, Myself & Irene is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades. He develops a split personality consisting of Charlie, the nice guy, and Hank, the take-no-crap dude. After going on meds, he's given the assignment of escorting Irene (Renee Zellwegger) from Rhode Island to upstate New York. The two become fugitives as Charlie\/Hank falls for Irene. Meanwhile Charlie's three black sons get involved in finding him.The film works because Carrey gives the schizophrenic role all his heart and the Farrelly brothers (the directors\/writers) go to extremes with the gags, as usual. There's quite a bit of crudeness and cussing, but I was able to overlook it and laugh. Most of the cussing comes from Charlie's three black sons who are veritable geniuses, but maintain their homey lingo. It's not meant to be offensive, but funny; you either get it or you don't.The film also works because we can all relate to the struggle within between wanting to get along with people and not wanting to be taken advantage of. It's somehow enjoyable to see Charlie morph into Hank with his take-no-sheet attitude. I also like the way the film ties up the schizophrenia issue. The answer is to maintain a balance between being overly nicey-wicey and overly forthright & intolerable. The middle road is the key.This was the first film I saw Renee in and she really shines here -- petite, sassy, smart and beautiful. I also like the funny three black sons and the addition of the dubious albino dude.FINAL WORD Me, Myself and Irene loses points for being unnecessarily crude, but -- if you can overlook that or laugh with it -- it is entertaining and funny. It places well with Carrey's funniest movies, although the first Ace Ventura film, The Mask and Liar, Liar are better.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Rhode Island and Vermont.GRADE B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 September 2013","score":"","review":" Released in 2000, Me, Myself & Irene is a Jim Carrey comedy about a Rhode Island motorcycle cop (Carrey) who has a mental breakdown after allowing people to walk all over him for three decades.

For one, it is historically accurate to the letter. Carlito, a former smack peddler, is released from prison after a few years. When released, the drug business has changed. Cocaine, rather than heroine, is the drug of choice for most New Yorkers. It is more expensive and much more widely used than heroine. Before Cocaine, drug dealers were guys who operated on the fringes of society and catered to artists and musicians. In addition, Heroine was relatively cheap compared to Coke. This was the world Carlito was used to in the 50's and 60's. Yet he was somehow able to make a name for himself in this parched landscape through toughness, street smarts and pragmatism.Now released from prison, he finds out that the dope business changed while he was on the inside. Cocaine is easily available and in high demand. Drug users are now part of mainstream society. They include young professionals, politicians and athletes. As a result, drug dealers are not only able to make more money, they also become celebrities in their own right. This was so true about New York in the 1970's. Guys like Nikki Barnes made the cover of magazines because of Coke. It was ridiculous. Another important issue to point out is the escalating violence that results as well. Because Coke is more expensive, dealers are able to buy more guns from the windfall profits. DePalma does an excellent job incorporating this into a generation gap issue between Carlito and the newer criminals. Carlito is a killer and a thug. But he killed for survival. Perhaps his mothers death when he was young gave him more respect for human life or his generation as a whole valued life more than the new generation of gangsters. Carlito was born in a time when many people did not survive childhood. Some women still died during childbirth. World Wars also took the lives of many men. Since the new generation didn't experience death like he did, they value human life less. More guns in circulation feeds the beast of indifference. Pachanga said it best They shotgun you just to see you fly up in the air.Overall, a great movie with a tragic ending. The movie incorporates many themes about living a life of crime, changing social attitudes and capitalism. Highly recommended.

That is a good description of the underworld characters that inhabit this film. The action starts when Tony, who recently was released after five years in prison, re-establishes contact with family and friends, who quickly lure him into a jewel caper. These guys are pros and, with Tony's guidance, they meticulously plan the heist.The execution of their plan takes place without dialogue or background music, accentuating the silence so necessary for their plan.In most heist films, the job itself is the final, climactic part of the story. In Rififi, the real story takes place after the job. Without revealing too much, I will say that this is a film about human nature. It reminds us that individuals almost never change their natures.Furthermore, almost all the characters in this film have their vices or weaknesses. The film talks about the rules, the unwritten principles that guide the actions of gangsters and conmen alike (for example, not ratting on associates). Due to their weaknesses, many of the characters violate the rules and fall prey to others.One scene to look for is when Cesar visits the jewelry store to case the security. He asks to use the phone, leaving his cash splayed over the countertop--a strategy of distraction that also is a basic con (confidence game).This film is blessed with topflight direction, great photography, good acting and a lean, well-written script.

The circumstances of the killing are bizarre and the search for the truth unearths a number of unexpected findings that could potentially derail careers, cause great embarrassment to certain individuals and seriously damage the reputation of the Army. The stakes are high and the pressure on the investigator is enormous but his determination to see the job through provides the basis for this thoroughly absorbing tale of corruption, cover-ups and one of the worst forms of betrayal imaginable.After the dead body of Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) is discovered at an Army training compound, top military investigator Paul Brenner (John Travolta) is assigned to the case. He and fellow Criminal Investigation Division officer Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) visit the site where the body was found and soon establish that the victim, who was found naked and staked to the ground, had been strangled, tortured and possibly raped. It emerges that Captain Campbell was the daughter of the base commander, General Joseph Campbell (James Cromwell).Brenner and Sunhill search the victim's home and in a concealed basement, find a collection of S & M paraphernalia and a number of video tapes which contain recordings of some of the activities that had taken place there. Shortly after, Colonel Robert Moore (James Woods) who was Elisabeth's commanding officer and mentor is questioned and arrested after his fingerprints are found on her dog tags. After a short spell in jail, Moore is released and put under house arrest but is found dead a little while later after apparently committing suicide.Despite coming under strong pressure to close the case after Moore's death, Brenner perseveres and goes on to discover that an incident which took place during her time at West Point and Elisabeth's difficult relationship with her father, both had a great significance to the way in which she died.In this story, Paul Brenner is a strong and resilient character who stays on course with his job despite being given a very tight deadline (36 hours) and being heavily pressured by both General Campbell and his adjutant, Colonel Fowler (Clarence Williams 111) on different occasions. He also has to contend with the uncomfortable tension that's created when he's teamed up with rape investigator Sarah Sunhill who also happens to be one of his ex-lovers. John Travolta, in a very strong performance, portrays Brenner's intensity, humour and single-mindedness with equal skill and is thoroughly convincing throughout.In a movie full of fine performances, James Woods and James Cromwell also stand out and their confrontations on separate occasions with John Travolta's character, provide a couple of the story's real high-points.The General's Daughter is full of sharp dialogue and enough secrets, suspects and scandal to surpass the expectations of most murder mystery fans The fact that a high percentage of the action takes place in dark, shadowy surroundings contributes strongly to the marvellous atmosphere of the piece and considering all its elements, it's perfectly understandable why this movie was such a great box office success.
