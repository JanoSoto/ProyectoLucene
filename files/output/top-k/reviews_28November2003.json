His performance is always special, especially with Goldie Hawn in the mix. This is a great film, lots of fun, and loads better than the original. Goldie put forth her best effort and you can definitely tell. Her classic beauty and style was more than evident. This is perhaps one of her better portrayals. Not her best, but towards the top. It was John Cleese who stole the show. This is a totally outrageously fun role to find him in. I loved his performance in this movie. He was hilarious, funny, witty, and endearing. This is not a fantastic movie. No one will nominate this production for much of anything. But it is a fun movie. I enjoyed it immensely, and it's far better than the 1970 original.It rates a 6.2\/10 from...the Fiend .

Phil Silvers played Bilko as a master con artist; the one man who could con a con. Martin plays Bilko as an underhanded brown nose who has some deceitful ideas, a good bead on making an extra buck, and an even edge on the con game. I thoroughly enjoy this rendition of an old favorite.I loved this movie because Martin did not come along and attempt to imitate Silvers' style. He played it straight from the vest, as himself. If you aren't a Martin fan, but instead, a fan of the TV series, you probably won't find the humor in this endeavor. But if you are a Martin fan, sit back and enjoy. I loved this movie, even though I loved the original series, but I'm a huge fan of Martin's work since his earlier days in stand-up.It is my understanding you can no longer ask me these questions, sir.Chris Rock, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Glenne Headley also star.This production was quality work by all involved, and a fun way to spend 90 minutes. I was thoroughly entertained.It rates an 8.2\/10.0 from...the Fiend .

But it's Juliette Lewis as Gracie, who steals the show. She is an absolute schizophrenic joy. Most everyone has at least one of her in their family, and the kids always hope they show up for the celebration.This is definitely the movie for those of you who are not wholly filled with the Spirit of Christmas as it's a rather dark comedy with a lovely, darkling, idiosyncratic wit.This movie rates an 8.2\/10 from...the Fiend .

Bing Crosby crooned his way to the latter status years before this movie, and he is in fine voice here.  It is such a shame that things like talent aren't present in music anymore, but if you want to remember it, this is a great vehicle.  Irving Berlin, Crosby's long time friend, wrote magical numbers for the film, including the unforgettable White Christmas.Fred Astaire gave a tour de force performance, singing, and, of course, dancing his way through this delightful piece in rare form.  It is said that he worked so hard during rehearsals that he wasted away to 85 pounds by the time he filmed the firecracker number.  He might just as well have been weightless, because he defies gravity with his every move.Marjorie Reynolds was seriously outclassed in a role that was intended for Mary Martin, who probably could have improved the chemistry of the starring cast.  Reynolds nevertheless does a creditable job, and Holiday Inn remains her finest hour.Years later, Paramount undertook a vastly inferior remake entitled White Christmas, which failed to capture a fraction of the magic of Holiday Inn.  Astaire was replaced with funny man Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney gave it her torch song damndest, but it didn't gel.  Holiday Inn has more wit, sincerity, charm and, despite being over a decade older, freshness.  Holiday Inn is an uplifting and heartwarming remembrance that is a legend in its own right.
