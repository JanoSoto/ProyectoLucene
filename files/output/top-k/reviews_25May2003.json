I don't think anyone else should attempt another biopic on Beethoven after this movie. True, this movie focuses on the search for his one great love but it does touch upon his life without creating too much of a melodrama out of it. You'll get to see how this genuis of a man became the legend that he is and how his insanity played a part in his excellence and intelligence.Gary Oldman is spectacular - he is definitely a great actor, up there with the rest of the greats. Unfortunately, because of his un-Hollywood choice of roles, he'll probably never receive an Oscar; he doesn't need one but as a big fan of his, you'd like to think that everyone else in the world is aware of his talent like how you are. I'd seen pictures of the real Beethoven and Gary Oldman never quite really look like him but he tried his best and it is quite eerie to see the lengths he went to for this role. The casting of Valeria Golino and Isabella Rossellini were perfect - you'd think Beethoven's great love was one of these beautiful actresses but, well, you'll have to find out for yourself. Isabella Rossellini exhibited her raw talent, which goes unnoticed amidst her stunning looks.Jeroen Krabbe was brilliant - too bad Hollywood never took notice of this massively talented Dutch actor and always cast him as the baddie. This movie salvaged whatever talent he had wasted on those stupid action movies but once again, Hollywood never took notice and Jeroen Krabbe has since returned to Europe to more respectable work than he ever got in Hollywood. Smart choice, Mr Krabbe!The only snag is probably the lack of character development amongst the brothers of Beethoven, especially one of them, who was a major force in his life. They only showed the effects of their separation on Beethoven without really letting us see how close they were to the point that it contributed to Beethoven's eventual destruction.All in all, this movie portrayed the depth of Beethoven's hatred, love and angst for the ones he loved so.

Lacking a big budget, he shot a film at the place he worked on a very low budget... Ten years later, he has a cult following that no one predicted. Add to that, he's a busy man. Shooting films, commercials, skits and doing a cameo for the recent 'Daredevil' movie, he never has and probably never will run out of steam (Until he retires which he says will be when he's 40). There are also two unique groups of fans. The first are the much smarter group that discuss his film universe, the metaphors behind his films, and the films themselves but the second group are more unfortunate. Usually of the teenage variety, they love the film for their potty mouthed humour and dirty talk and really don't get what's going on and more often than not are a pain in the back side. That's not to say all teens are like that. Some are actually more mature the 20 year old+ fans of Smith's but those are the fans and they are here to stay probably because of one movie that at first was just a small budget pet project then next minute, a huge cult classic. Looking at Smith's films, this film does still feel like his best. It's lacking any real story but in the end, it's really just about a normal day for the unfortunate Dante (Brian O'Halloran). It's also very smart. Filled with obscure literature references and the whole film seems to be loosely based on the play 'Waiting for Godot' which is frequently discussed in the fascinating book 'An Askew View The Films of Kevin Smith'. Although, in the end, the two things this film is most famous for is the swearing (Although much less than I expected) and the infamous 'Star Wars' discussion which proves to be one of the highlights of the film. In the end, it's a film about a lonely convenience store clerk looking for love and some sort of normal life in this crazy world. All his customers seem to be near psychotics and his best friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) is very depressing most of the time just adding to Dante's wounds. Either way, this is an amazing flick that is useful for two occasions Feeling phylosophical? Watch this film! Feeling in need of a good laugh and cheering up? Watch this film!

I think I know the show well enough to say that this movie is a complete disaster.The Fantasticks, as written for the stage, relies on several devices to carry its message.  The entire production is fantastical in that just about everything is realized in the audience's imagination.  Things like the wall between the houses (a pole), El Gallo's tree (just a ladder), the suspension of disbelief of Matt and Louisa as they're manipulated throughout the play.  Every time the movie does one of these things literally it breaks down the magic of The Fantasticks.  Without that intimate magic none of it really makes sense.The movie has a botched script too - every now and then a glimmer of the real show will surface and get the attention of those who know it, but then it falls apart again.  As a result none of the characters really work.  We don't believe in the kids - Matt and Louisa's character development must have ended up on the floor in editing.  The fathers appear to be more clowns than anything.  And El Gallo isn't mysterious or charming enough to woo a preteen in this version.  Worse, this script relies on heavy handed use of editing from one setting to another during several of the songs.  It's okay once or twice, but this movie is all over the place.  In a deleted song, the fathers jump instantaneously to the porch roof for no good reason.  It's really preposterous.As far as the cast goes, all disappoint except Louisa (Jean Louisa Kelly).  She has an excellent speaking voice for the role, and a lovely singing voice.  Several of her soprano lines were cut, alas, but she does a credible job with a lousy, wandering script.  The rest of the main cast appears to be doing a junior class play.  El Gallo in particular appears more angry\/anxious\/wishing-he-had-a-real-job than the suave\/confident\/paternal figure he's supposed to be.  He just throws away several of the key lines in the show like he's reading them for the first time.  And if you watch the deleted opening Try to Remember you'll be squirming in your seat has he drives his truck while smiling to the camera (the effects folks held back on the little dazzling star flash on his teeth, fortunately).  Ugh - a real pity.Several other reviewers have offered the advice to see the stage play and forget this movie.  They're right.  Watching this movie will leave you wondering why you wasted your time.  Seeing the play done live will touch you profoundly.

I think I know the show well enough to say that this movie is a complete disaster.The Fantasticks, as written for the stage, relies on several devices to carry its message.  The entire production is fantastical in that just about everything is realized in the audience's imagination.  Things like the wall between the houses (a pole), El Gallo's tree (just a ladder), the suspension of disbelief of Matt and Louisa as they're manipulated throughout the play.  Every time the movie does one of these things literally it breaks down the magic of The Fantasticks.  Without that intimate magic none of it really makes sense.The movie has a botched script too - every now and then a glimmer of the real show will surface and get the attention of those who know it, but then it falls apart again.  As a result none of the characters really work.  We don't believe in the kids - Matt and Louisa's character development must have ended up on the floor in editing.  The fathers appear to be more clowns than anything.  And El Gallo isn't mysterious or charming enough to woo a preteen in this version.

It can be creative and fun like in 'Evil Dead 2' or it can flat on it's face like some unbearable 80's films. 'Bad Taste', however, is quite different. Made during four years in New Zealand, it's a weird blend of Looney Tunes, horror films and low budget action. It is a huge accomplishment in low budget film right up there with films like 'Clerks' and 'El Mariachi' but it does have many faults too. The basic story is of a group of agent type people who have to save Earth from the threat of aliens who want to use humans as burger meat in outer space. They bumble through the film trying to catch and kill the aliens and leave a trail of gore certainly wherever they go. Of course, this film has developed a new legion of fans thanks to Peter Jackson's latest film being some sort of blockbuster. It's something to do with middle earth and rings and wizards, don't ask me! The high points of this film is just the way they accomplished things on such a cheap budget. The action at the end is very impressive for such a low budget and the cliff top battle between Derek (Peter Jackson) and Robert (Peter Jackson) is amazing mainly because they really make it look like Peter Jackson is fighting himself but the two sides of the fight must have been filmed very far apart. The Derek character is thin and with short hair but the Robert character is very chubby with a beard and long curly hair (Looking more like the Jackson we know now). However, the huge low point of this film is the character of Derek. Peter Jackson has no problem acting as Robert but the Derek character is, as I believed a review site called him, Rick Moranis on speed. The first 30 minutes of the film are ruined with him putting on increasingly stupid expressions. It improves in the second half when he becomes a homicidal, half dead maniac. The directing by Jackson, on the other hand, is nothing to complain about. He proves he's a brilliant director 14 years before 'Lord of the Rings' and the look of the film is very different to most low budget films. What originally was envisioned as a 20 minute short turned into an 80 minute movie. Although, you can see a bit of cutting would have helped. I felt the last half an hour was a really great time but the first 50 minutes only had great moments few and far between. Still, it's a sick, demented film that is sure to please many movie lovers. It becomes crazier as it goes along and proves that there is no limits to low budget filmmaking when you're as good as Peter Jackson!

He can repeat the same story over and over and it never gets boring. He can hold your interest in any one of his DVD commentaries and growing up as a gay man in Baltimore, has a very interesting life. He also wrote some of the all time funniest films. There are three sections of his life that you have to take note of. There was some black and white shorts and feature length films in the 60's but I will leave those out of this review. The first section of his life was his early, angry, gross out work which went on from 1972 to 1977 (Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Desperate Living), 1981 to 1990 was the transition period where his work changed (Polyester, Hairspray, Cry Baby) and then there's the more mature big budget Hollywood films from 1994 to 2001 (Serial Mom, Pecker, Cecil B. Demented). These films are all uniquely different and hold different styles of their own and all are important pieces of filmmaking but no matter what, 'Pink Flamingos' will be John's most famous work (with the possible exception of 'Hairspray'). Even Waters has said that if he came up with a cure for cancer and died the next day, 'Pink Flamingos' would still be his biggest achievment. Made in 1972 for a small budget (People say different things so I'm not going to put an exact budget on it), it starred the infamous drag queen Divine who performed the infamous final scene (But unlike other reviewers, I'm not going to say what it is) along with Dreamlanders Mink Stole, David Lochary and Mary Vivian Pearce. I'm going to run along the story even although you will most likely know it already. Divine is the filthiest person alive but the FBI is hot on her tail so she hides out in a trailer near the woods under the alias Babs Johnson. She lives with her egg obsessed son Crackers (Danny Mills), retarded mother Edie (Edith Massey) and her travelling companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce). Many papers call her the filthiest person alive but evil couple Raymond (David Lochary) and Connie (Mink Stole) Marble want that title will not stop at anything to hold that title for themselves. I could easily just talk about everything that goes on in the film as many reviewers have chosen to do but I feel this is a very original film which is actually a satire on modern family life. The Divine clan are trailer trash. They have incestuous relationships and do very sick things but the Marbles are the exact view of suburban life. Clean houses, well organized and in the end they turn out to be the failures. They consider themselves filthy yet are disgusted at Divine's accomplishments proving that Divine and trailer trash win out and that modern day families are basically just clones of each other. The film improves with repeat viewings as you see just how sharp the wit on display is. John Waters' script is filled with some of the most quoted lines in film history. Although nobody is really a trained actor, their performances far surpass any modern day oscar winner. Divine is, as always, perfectly cast in his role and has some of the best lines on display. Edith Massey presents her very unique style of acting and, believe me, she's a real talent. Mary Vivian Pearce (The only person to appear in EVERY John Waters film) once again provides some laughs even if she doesn't always get the big roles she deserves. Mink Stole and David Lochary are hilarious as the perverted couple who want to steal Divine's title to no avail but it is truly Danny Mills who stands out. John Waters discovers a new male talent in each of his films starting from here going right up to 'Cecil B. Demented', all of whom rarely appear in any other John Waters movie (In fact, I don't think any of them ever have). Danny is very real in this film which makes his gross out scenes stand out but, unlike a lot of other people, I did not once cringe at this movie. I found it's situations funny but I was more impressed with the sparkling satire on display. Divine's infamous last scene is much less shocking than an oral sex scene earlier in the film. Not to take away from his brilliant performance though. Although his later films are even better, Waters first color film is a brilliant black comedy worthy of repeat viewings. Two things though, I want to see more! Waters has said there is about an hour of deleted scenes but only 15 minutes were on the DVD and were only small snippets of deleted scenes (The Marble's earlier attack on Divine's trailer had much more to it than we see in the deleted scenes section). Mind you, Waters said he found the footage in his attic so maybe all the other stuff is lost or too old and ruined to be seen today. Also, there was a sequel planned for this film. The script is widely available but will never be seen due to the deaths of main actors. It's a shame, the script seems even better than the first 'Pink Flamingos'. I would also like to see what Danny Mills is doing these days. Overall, I love this film and couldn't say more about how much I love it. Well written and directed, it's brilliantly staged and is one of the best comedies of the later half of the century. Much better than any gross out movies today, it is pure genius of the highest order. A must see for any self respecting film viewer.

She lives with her egg obsessed son Crackers (Danny Mills), retarded mother Edie (Edith Massey) and her travelling companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce). Many papers call her the filthiest person alive but evil couple Raymond (David Lochary) and Connie (Mink Stole) Marble want that title will not stop at anything to hold that title for themselves. I could easily just talk about everything that goes on in the film as many reviewers have chosen to do but I feel this is a very original film which is actually a satire on modern family life. The Divine clan are trailer trash. They have incestuous relationships and do very sick things but the Marbles are the exact view of suburban life. Clean houses, well organized and in the end they turn out to be the failures. They consider themselves filthy yet are disgusted at Divine's accomplishments proving that Divine and trailer trash win out and that modern day families are basically just clones of each other. The film improves with repeat viewings as you see just how sharp the wit on display is. John Waters' script is filled with some of the most quoted lines in film history. Although nobody is really a trained actor, their performances far surpass any modern day oscar winner. Divine is, as always, perfectly cast in his role and has some of the best lines on display. Edith Massey presents her very unique style of acting and, believe me, she's a real talent. Mary Vivian Pearce (The only person to appear in EVERY John Waters film) once again provides some laughs even if she doesn't always get the big roles she deserves. Mink Stole and David Lochary are hilarious as the perverted couple who want to steal Divine's title to no avail but it is truly Danny Mills who stands out. John Waters discovers a new male talent in each of his films starting from here going right up to 'Cecil B. Demented', all of whom rarely appear in any other John Waters movie (In fact, I don't think any of them ever have). Danny is very real in this film which makes his gross out scenes stand out but, unlike a lot of other people, I did not once cringe at this movie. I found it's situations funny but I was more impressed with the sparkling satire on display. Divine's infamous last scene is much less shocking than an oral sex scene earlier in the film. Not to take away from his brilliant performance though. Although his later films are even better, Waters first color film is a brilliant black comedy worthy of repeat viewings. Two things though, I want to see more! Waters has said there is about an hour of deleted scenes but only 15 minutes were on the DVD and were only small snippets of deleted scenes (The Marble's earlier attack on Divine's trailer had much more to it than we see in the deleted scenes section). Mind you, Waters said he found the footage in his attic so maybe all the other stuff is lost or too old and ruined to be seen today. Also, there was a sequel planned for this film. The script is widely available but will never be seen due to the deaths of main actors. It's a shame, the script seems even better than the first 'Pink Flamingos'. I would also like to see what Danny Mills is doing these days. Overall, I love this film and couldn't say more about how much I love it. Well written and directed, it's brilliantly staged and is one of the best comedies of the later half of the century. Much better than any gross out movies today, it is pure genius of the highest order. A must see for any self respecting film viewer.

This family feud has overspilled into the streets where bloody gang warfare is barely controlled by a police force unable to arrest the members of those most powerful families.  In the middle of this violence is Romeo who is sad for lack of love.  When he and his friends gate crash a Capulet party he meets the beautiful Juliet Capulet and the two fall in love &#150; even though her father is arranging a most profitable political marriage to the Governor's son.  Romeo and Juliet are married in secret but their love is fated to be engulfed in the violence of their surroundings.In the past so-many years Shakespeare adaptations of one form or another are more common place for the teen market (think O or 10 Things I Hate About You).  However even now the filming of an update of a Shakespeare tale, using the original dialogue (more or less) would be an incredible risk &#150; as it was then.  This could easily have lost those who love Shakespeare (because of the modern setting) but also alienated the teens by using language that is difficult to follow.  Also Luhrmann's hyper stylised direction is also so very OTT at times that it risked turning the whole thing into a cartoon.However, it actually works.  The film opens on shaky ground &#150; the first 10 minutes pass by before you are allowed to settle into the film and see how it plays.  The actual opening is a great introduction and works well &#150; with the heavy music, sweeping cameras and the introduction to the main players.  However the confrontation between the Capulet boys and the Montague boys at a petrol station is too hyper and silly and risked losing the plot if it were to continue like this.  Happily this scene is the height of Luhrmann's directive flamboyance and, although there are touches, it never gets this frantic again.  Once the film settles the lines work very well and the film really does a great job of setting old fashioned terms (dagger, sabre, sword) in modern ways &#150; even replacing characters like Father Friar with a postal delivery service called Post Haste!The performances support the film &#150; if they can't deliver the lines convincingly and create modern characters then the film is lost.  Fortunately the majority of the cast deliver their lines well &#150; not always following the OTT direction to get OTT delivery.  DiCaprio is soft in the lead yet does well with the traumatic scenes towards the end.  He even looks a little too young for the role of a young lover but it still works.  Danes is almost as good but is less convincing in the more extreme emotions.  The pair work well together &#150; my favourite moment being that when they catch eyes mid-death towards the end.  For once Leguizamo's cartoon antics almost suit the role and he gives a bearable performance &#150; I can't stand the guy so that's saying something.  The best support came from Perrineau Jnr who was given the indignity of being in drag for a bit of the film but delivers his lines well.  The support include mostly well known faces and the only weak links are the actors playing the Montague boys (including Jamie Kennedy).Overall this was a very brave film and it is easy to look back now and think it must have been a sure thing.  The modern setting is used well once the frantic direction slows down a little bit 15 minutes in and a mostly talented cast make the lines sound alive.

Probably raking in even more than 'Star Wars' when you put together grosses of all 20 films with toys, magazines, videos, DVDs... It has earned a whole load of money in it's time but sometimes a Bond film needs to come along to put Bond back on track which usually happens after a very over the top film. We've had 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'For Your Eyes Only', 'The World is not Enough' and this film, 'Licence to Kill' or LTK as I will refer to it. LTK is based on part of Ian Fleming's second James Bond book 'Live and Let Die' where Bond's CIA agent buddy Felix Leiter is captured by a character known as The Robber and fed to sharks then left half dead with a note attached to him saying in capital letters HE DISAGREED WITH SOMETHING THAT ATE HIM. When the feature film version came out in 1973, many fans were annoyed to see this excellent sequence hadn't been adapted for the film. It would take a full 16 years to see this scene on film but it certainly pays off. In Timothy Dalton's second and last performance as James Bond, he is the best man for his friend Felix Leiter's (David Hedison reprising his role from 'Live and Let Die') wedding. As Leiter begins his honeymoon, a drug lord called Sanchez (An effective Robert Davi) who Leiter captured early on in the film, escapes and attacks Leiter and rapes and murders his wife. He has Leiter eaten by sharks and left for dead with a note identical to the one in the book 'Live and Let Die'. Bond decides he must avenge Leiter but, in a very well written scene, M (Robert Brown) takes away his licence to kill leading Bond to go on a personal vendetta against Sanchez. It's a very effective film. Dalton is amazing as Bond, Davi is an even superior villain than Telly Savalas, Carey Lowell is one of the best Bond girls in recent years, and Hedison is good in his role as Leiter besides his very over dramatic line I'll See You In Hell! which is a bit too over the top and which makes the other wise brilliant scene too comic. The only fault is the fact that the character of Felix Leiter has never been fully developed in the Bond films. Perhaps the least known recurring character, he has appeared in 7 films and has been played by 6 different actors, all of different age, weight and talent. Originally envisioned to always be played by Jack Lord, he demanded too much money after appearing in the first Bond film because he had just become a huge star on TV. In the books, Felix was sort of like Bond's CIA double but in the films was never fully developed. Although Rik Van Nutter probably portrayed him best in 'Thunderball', Hedison is a close second playing him in this film and 'Live and Let Die'. If the character had been played by the same actor more, his near death may be much more effective but it is done very well as it is. The stand out of this film has to be a young Benicio Del Toro as Sanchez' evil henchman Dario who is a close second to Odd Job as the perfect henchman. Unlike other henchman, he's very smart and lethal and can be quite vicious in many of his scenes. Speaking of viciousness, this film is probably most famous for it's violence. Although the violent bits are not continuous and are few and far between, they stand out for being very brutal but in the end, it only adds to this amazingly tense Bond thriller. However, two scenes that could have been the most violent were never depicted on screen. One was Dario's butchering of Lupe's lover and the other was Dario's rape of Della. These were both tastefully shown off screen and that makes these brutal attacks all the more effective. The script by Richard Maibum and Michael G. Wilson is their best Bond collaboration. They have took the best part of Fleming's 'Live and Let Die' novel and crafted it into a truly stand out Bond film. John Glen's final directing job on the Bond films is a nice farewell to a man who really put his stamp on the Bond films. As noted before, the performances are top notch with Dalton, Lowell, Davi and Del Toro standing out. Bringing a bit of comic relief to the preceedings is gadget master Q who steals the show in many of his scenes. This Bond film finishes up as a truly effective and haunting film which left me stunned. The recent Bond films are excellent but they don't make 'em like this any more.

Probably raking in even more than 'Star Wars' when you put together grosses of all 20 films with toys, magazines, videos, DVDs... It has earned a whole load of money in it's time but sometimes a Bond film needs to come along to put Bond back on track which usually happens after a very over the top film. We've had 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', 'For Your Eyes Only', 'The World is not Enough' and this film, 'Licence to Kill' or LTK as I will refer to it. LTK is based on part of Ian Fleming's second James Bond book 'Live and Let Die' where Bond's CIA agent buddy Felix Leiter is captured by a character known as The Robber and fed to sharks then left half dead with a note attached to him saying in capital letters HE DISAGREED WITH SOMETHING THAT ATE HIM. When the feature film version came out in 1973, many fans were annoyed to see this excellent sequence hadn't been adapted for the film. It would take a full 16 years to see this scene on film but it certainly pays off. In Timothy Dalton's second and last performance as James Bond, he is the best man for his friend Felix Leiter's (David Hedison reprising his role from 'Live and Let Die') wedding. As Leiter begins his honeymoon, a drug lord called Sanchez (An effective Robert Davi) who Leiter captured early on in the film, escapes and attacks Leiter and rapes and murders his wife. He has Leiter eaten by sharks and left for dead with a note identical to the one in the book 'Live and Let Die'. Bond decides he must avenge Leiter but, in a very well written scene, M (Robert Brown) takes away his licence to kill leading Bond to go on a personal vendetta against Sanchez. It's a very effective film. Dalton is amazing as Bond, Davi is an even superior villain than Telly Savalas, Carey Lowell is one of the best Bond girls in recent years, and Hedison is good in his role as Leiter besides his very over dramatic line I'll See You In Hell! which is a bit too over the top and which makes the other wise brilliant scene too comic. The only fault is the fact that the character of Felix Leiter has never been fully developed in the Bond films. Perhaps the least known recurring character, he has appeared in 7 films and has been played by 6 different actors, all of different age, weight and talent. Originally envisioned to always be played by Jack Lord, he demanded too much money after appearing in the first Bond film because he had just become a huge star on TV. In the books, Felix was sort of like Bond's CIA double but in the films was never fully developed. Although Rik Van Nutter probably portrayed him best in 'Thunderball', Hedison is a close second playing him in this film and 'Live and Let Die'. If the character had been played by the same actor more, his near death may be much more effective but it is done very well as it is. The stand out of this film has to be a young Benicio Del Toro as Sanchez' evil henchman Dario who is a close second to Odd Job as the perfect henchman. Unlike other henchman, he's very smart and lethal and can be quite vicious in many of his scenes. Speaking of viciousness, this film is probably most famous for it's violence. Although the violent bits are not continuous and are few and far between, they stand out for being very brutal but in the end, it only adds to this amazingly tense Bond thriller. However, two scenes that could have been the most violent were never depicted on screen. One was Dario's butchering of Lupe's lover and the other was Dario's rape of Della.

It was on TV again the other night so I thought I'd give it another try, as comedy is such a touch and go thing. Second viewing, the movie was even more tedious. Carrey as I say is a very funny guy with a gift for physical comedy, but the script for 'Me, Myself & Irene' just STINKS.

The repititious use of the same piece of drum music EVERY time Carrey transformed, his three overweight black sons' lame and unfunny schtick, these were irritating, not amusing. And seeing great actors like Chris Cooper, and especially Robert Forster getting involved with this garbage was just depressing.

When a friend hooks them both up on a date things go wrong from the start when Woo feels that Tim is only after one thing.  After that she drags him through a series of misadventures as he gradually loses patience.I must admit to have taped this because of the presence of the lovely Jada Pinkett Smith.  Ironically I watched this on the day that The Matrix Reloaded opened in the UK &#150; I wonder will she be boasting about her presence in this film now that she has real hits under her belt.  The plot here is almost an `urban' rehash of Blind Date, with Woo leading the mild mannered Tim to despair.  However the majority of the film is poor and not very funny.  The plot is very thin, so thin that it needs separate little subplots for the other characters just to sustain the running time.  Sadly neither of the two `friends' subplots are any good at all and are either stupid or obvious.The main `romance' between Woo and Tim is badly translated.  At no time did you wish for these two to be a couple, even the `slow music during a thoughtful taxi ride' moment seemed to come out of nowhere and indicate that the film would be ended soon.  To be honest other than Woo's body I could see no reason any man would want to be with her &#150; certainly Tim could do a lot better, which kinda goes against the point of the film.  Their episodic adventures raised a few small laughs for me but not enough to justify the time.Pinkett-Smith is OK.  Her looks are spoilt by a lipstick colour that doesn't suit her face and a general attitude that alienated her from an audience that she needed to keep.  Davidson is better despite playing the same sort of character as he did in Booty Call, he has more of a knack for comedy and his character was easier to emphasis with than Woo.  The support cast are all pretty poor whether it is Chappelle demanding his wife dress as a `chicken ho' or Martin, Heath etc being `dogs'.  Cameos from LL Cool J and Foxy Brown do nothing to liven it up.Overall I am not against urban comedies although many of them do tend to fall into lazy cliché that would border on the racist were they not produced for the very groups they stereotype.  Here I had low expectations but was still let down.,  Very few laughs, very basic plotting and such poor characterisation that it was hard to like anyone in the film.

In the time when National Lampoon had made the classic comedy 'Animal House', SNL decided to break into the game with the popular skit 'The Blues Brothers'. Although it wasn't a regular sketch, it would make great film material. The Blues Brothers are Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) Blues. Two musicians who are seperated when Jake is put in jail. The day he comes out, which is where our movie starts, Elwood insists on taking him to see The Penguin (Kathleen Freeman), the nun that raised them. When she informs them that the orphanage they grew up in will be shut down if they don't get money, The Blues Brothers decided to round up their old band and perform the gig to end all gigs and save the orphanage. What follows is a comedy of epic proportions. It's possibly the only epic comedy and it is sure to please many groups of people. Music lovers will love, car chase lovers will love it (Watch out for that mall!) and true 80's comedy lovers will love it. I find that 'Blues Brothers' truly improves with age.

The supporting cast is the stuff of dreams with the band making a big impression and very funny cameos by John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Twiggy, Paul Reubens, Steven Spielberg, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin.

The performances are spot on. Belushi proves what a talented actor he is and it's a shame he had to die when he did because he could have done really great stuff. Aykroyd has stayed with is and, although some of his more recent movies are less than impressive, he's still one of the funniest guys out there and I'd like to see him do a Blues Brothers 3 (Unlike most people, I enjoyed the second one). John Landis has always been a talented director and it's certainly on display here. Very nicely staged, shot and edited, the production crew are certainly to thank as well. The supporting cast is the stuff of dreams with the band making a big impression and very funny cameos by John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Twiggy, Paul Reubens, Steven Spielberg, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin. One last thing to note is that this film was originally going to run 3 hours and even have intermissions but all that stuff is sadly lost with the twenty minutes that remain have been crafted into the director's cut available on DVD. I could really go on about this movie. On the personal side, it's a family favorite and the whole family watches it about once a year while I use every chance I get to watch it. It's smart, crazy, loud and funny proving that a really good movie can come out of SNL. Congratulations to anyone that worked on this film because you have went down in comic history.
