The movie's about some stupid soldier guy who's looking for some Marlon Brando military about-to-be-general guy who fought too long in Vietnam (which, these liberals say that there WAS no enemy anyway) and got unrealistically insane because of fighting too much in the war (and confusing and pointless soul stuff) (as if a war general can get insane from a war with no enemies) and secured himself in some big ol' compound with nutty tribes people who sort of worship him. The soldier guy has to eliminate him because the Marlon Brando general guy is so crazy he's killing his own men and... doing stuff.The movie follows the journey of that soldier guy and virtually the whole film is just about him walking up and down talking to various unrealistically and ignorantly portrayed Vietnam soldiers who randomly kill off innocent Vietnamese villagers and being in a boat for a long time and making me get sleepy of boredom. Sometimes there are some other kinds of attacks&#133; and it makes American soldiers run (also unrealistically and ignorantly portrayed) like headless chickens with fear&#133; wow&#133; this is REALISTIC depictions of how the war REALLY was fought. There is a lot of US-bashing involved (funny how liberals call themselves real Americans). US forces mercilessly kill Vietnam villagers, and pridefully shoot and destroy stuff for no reason and at the brink of death, attempt to kill off their soldier partners as well!Yeah&#133; and the Viet-Cong probably uses flowers as ammunition and love as their only weapon&#133; and some spears that their poor country couldn't afford because of evil American imperialism no doubt; Oh wait! It could also be the Marlon Brando Kurtz dude! Right! How realistic is that!? Oscar-winning! Golly! Guys, seriously, tell me what was so freaking awe-inspiring and visionary about this film? Commando was better.The movie teaches us that war sucks; it will turn us into crazed demons of blood-lust and war. Right&#133; and letting gentle oppressors and dictators eliminate as many as 32 thousand of their own innocent civilians will teach us that peace is the answer&#133; what? Excuse me?

The message I received from this film review is never give up on dreams, also stay true to others. Once decided on what life may bring,just go for it and never give up. Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles), a regular student in high school, dreams of becoming a ballerina. While Sara is performing, her mother has a horrible car accident and dies. In that moment Sara's dream came crashing down, until she moved with her father (Terry Kinney) on the south side of Chicago. Sara's dream started to become true once again when she meets Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas) and his sister Chenille (Kerry Washington). Sara's impression is when things get rough she backs down. Derek was the real way of life. Those two characters came together as a couple who went through everything together, the good and bad. I really enjoyed the dancing at the club, the different moves people may come up with and the way they move their body. Having to go from one town to another would be difficult to do, but Sara did it really great. Going from a place where everybody was similar and then going to a town that was totally different form of style. Derek and Sara face their biggest challenges in life.This film is a very interesting, and director Thomas Carter cast the film towards the younger crowd. Carter was demonstrating to the general public, dreams may come true and some aren't meant to come true for that person. Experience the place, time, good, or bad thing do happen. Individuals may trust people in this world and then can't trust anybody for a second. Friends may also say things, right or wrong, that isn't meant to come out.

I had heard a lot about this movie before I ever saw it. People rubbed their chins and furrowed their brows, and spoke of interpretation and meaning. Oh, I thought, I must investigate this apparent brain-teaser of a movie for myself, and so I purchased the (non-directors cut) DVD, some years after its theatrical release and for a bargain-basement price.It is a thoroughly good watch, but where was this intellectual mystery I had heard so much about?? And so I watched it again, fearing that I had completely missed some deeper meaning. Alas, I still failed to find any existential depth. I searched the web, and found a great deal of fan material, all of which seemed to insist that there was some sort of ineffable and profound message hidden in DONNIE DARKO, that only repeated viewings, microscopic scrutiny and intense intellectual and spiritual interpretation would reveal.No. I'm afraid it was not to be. With Donnie Darko, what you see, is indeed, what you get; A bold, and actually quite effective effort, by a very young movie maker, to bring us a twisting sci-fi fable. Just because some areas of the movie appear veiled in ambiguity, doesn't mean they hide within them some incommunicable truth. It just means that its a work of fiction, and as such suffers from unavoidable inconsistencies, inherent in such flights of fancy. Its not the real world, its not factual, it doesn't obey the natural laws of physics.Instead, we are presented with a fleeting and very spurious stab at a scientific explanation of time-travel and parallel universes , i think intended to baffle and misdirect the lay-audience into crediting the story with more intellectual substance than it truly deserves. Dropping in key-phrases like Einstein-Rosen Bridge, (incidently, an inappropriate reference in the context of the movie plot), does not undo the utter gibberish contained within The Philosophy of Time-Travel; the book around which the plot is structured.(As an aside, I would like to point out that, although some respected physicists have theorised on the idea of time-travel, it really is little more than a romantic notion, that some scientists have had fun with over the years. Infinitely more exciting than visiting our ancestors in a DeLorean, is the simple and amazing fact that we all travel through time every moment of our lives!!)The only aspects of the movie that requires any interpretation is this; Is Donnie imagining the events, or is the spectre of Frank real within the fabric of the story? Either answer is a satisfactory explanation for a movie of this sort, and neither embellishes or detracts from Donnie's experiences, or our sympathy with him.There are a few, somewhat, clumsy and sweeping references made to spiritual truth. Such as questioning the concepts of free-will, and does a benevolent deity care about us, but these references are so brief and superficial, and are in no way discussed by the characters in any depth, so it would be wrong to suggest the movie is in the least bit soul-searching.Instead what we have, is a lovingly crafted Tale-To-Astonish, nicely written, shot with care and affection on a modest budget, and rather well acted too. Its easy to see why Jake Gylenhaal has become a hot-property of late, he exhibits craft and a screen presence beyond his years. I will go so far as to say, without his charming and eerie performance at its core, this movie would never have received the attention that it has.No. This movie is not essential source-material if you're after a PhD in philosophy, but what movie is? If you want soul-searching, try reading The Tao Of Physics by Fritjof Capra. But if you want a movie with a little more substance than the usual fare, try DONNIE DARKO. Its really rather good.

That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G.

Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is.

But there is something about this film which is extremely unsettling, and not just for its supremely dark subject-matter. On the other hand, a day after watching it for the first time, I cannot stop thinking about it. Perhaps that is the reason why I am so troubled by this film it is infectious, and the virus it carries is one of unabated bleakness and hopelessness.At this point, it's hard to imagine that there's anyone who still believes that suburbia is full of wholesomeness and well-adjusted people. The premise -- that the image of happiness is merely a veneer which hides a dark and desperate inner life -- is just not fresh enough to carry a whole movie. But it's not even a question of whether the premise can carry the movie. In spite of what some other reviewers have said, this is most certainly not a boring film. And it does stick with you like very little else I have seen, so there is definitely some power here which doesn't exist in similar, inferior, films like _Magnolia_.But I guess what bugs me about this film is that it seems to rely on the principal failing of postmodern thought -- that it is merely enough to point out the sheer arbitrariness and duplicitousness of contemporary existence and the values we extol. In a way, the exposing of this arbitrariness and duplicitiousness creates an even bigger problem than the problem it exposes. Life is bleak, life is meaningless. I get it. The question is not whether this is true; the question is what can be done about it. How does a film which thrives on bleakness and conveys only bleakness and ends in bleakness and exists only to paint a picture of absolute bleakness accomplish anything at all? Social satire's primary purpose is to do something in the social realm -- does this film accomplish anything except to depress its viewers? It certainly didn't for me.On a lesser note, but still noteworthy -- the gross-out stuff seems totally out of place (even given the film's subject matter) and really detracts from what it does do well.

It wants to be a tale about how violence affects our lives and how, once exposed to it, we find ourselves fundamentally changed. It might actually succeed if it wasn't busy confusing the audience and boring them to death at the same time.As the film opens, we are treated to a day in the life of Hollywood producer Mike Max (Bill Pullman), who is busy wheeling and dealing through multiple phones and computer connections, all the while ignoring his wife, Paige (Andie McDowell). While he is out during the day, he is kidnapped by two not quite bright hit men who are killed in a mysterious fashion and Mike Max manages to escape. He is found dazed by some Latino gardeners and Mike decides that he needs to hide from his old life to protect himself while discovering that violence, which he has peddled in action movies, is a bad thing. Meanwhile, Paige has taken over her husbands company in his absence and developed a relationship with a recording artist named Six (K. Todd Freeman) who provides the love she was lacking in her relationship with Mike. Also meanwhile, technical whiz Ray Bering (Gabriel Byrne) is busy putting the finishing touches on a high-tech surveillance system that the government hopes to use to bring violence in the city under control. However, Ray begins to suspect that the system is possibly being used for nefarious purposes and is trying to get someone to listen to him. And yet elsewhere still, stuntwoman turned actress Cat (Traci Lind) is getting her big acting break in Mike's latest film, and she finds herself somewhat smitten with detective Dean Brock (Loren Dean) who is investigating the disappearance of Mike.As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, The End of Violence has a lot going on. The problem is that little of it is compelling and because the film is busy juggling so many plot threads at the same time, several of them seem like afterthoughts. The subplot featuring Paige's involvement with Six, for instance, has absolutely no emotional resonance for the audience because we barely know these people. The film also takes a lot of side trips to inexplicable scenes where people gather at performance art sessions to get some bigger message across, I guess, but they just end up being pointless and drawing the film out even more.Wenders manages to suck the life out of most of the scenes in the film. The acting is uniformly wooden and unconvincing, the characters are little more than bodies going through the motions, and the plot is half-explained and developed. Take the plot thread of Ray trying to discover the truth about the surveillance system. It is revealed eventually that he has actually already been in contact with Mike about it with the hopes of revealing the system to the public, but the film has so many pieces moving around that it takes forever to make the connection between those two characters.The film also features dreaded voice-over monologues that are just silly and pretentious. The anti-violence message, what there is of it, is also heavy-handed, to say the least. In one scene, Six speaks to Mike on the phone and gives us a long explanation about why violence is good and people revel in it. You can practically see Wenders on his soapbox while this scene is going on.I suppose this movie is supposed to be a thriller to some degree, but there is little that is thrilling about The End of Violence. It is a monotonous bore of a film that comes to a rather abrupt ending without really dealing with all of the issues it seems to want to explore. Instead of an end of violence, I'll take an end to this particular mess.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"6 March 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Really, that one word says it all about the film that shows Gus Van Sant knows how to use his actors. Although I have not seen every film with Keanu Reeves in it, I have seen more than I care to admit, and so far, My Own Private Idaho (hereafter referred to as MOPI) is the only one where a scene actually benefits from Reeves' inability to change expression. It is also worth noting that while the makers of Brokeback Mountain attempt to promote their film as innovative for its gay themes, one viewing of MOPI is enough to highlight the fact that Hollywood is still firmly in the habit of recycling itself. While films that depict prostitution, the uglier realities of sexuality, and everyday life have to make an effort to get tired, MOPI manages to stay above the pack with a few twists and turns that keep the mix interesting. It is interesting to speculate on what today's Hollywood would look like had River Phoenix not died outside of a club just as his career was taking off. Would associated actors like Keanu Reeves been able to make as big a splash with his competition? I doubt it.At its heart, MOPI is a tale of a male prostitute with narcolepsy and his attempts to cope with his lot. As Keanu so elegantly puts it, viewers will be amazed that he can exist like this. At some point in the film, Phoenix's character becomes dedicated to finding his mother for purposes that are never completely established. One could call this a road movie, but the straight-up truth is that MOPI does not follow the standard structure of a road movie. Anyone who has sat in a car for more than two hours with persons they find less than enjoyable to be with for five minutes knows the fundamental problem inherent to all road movies. Simply put, they are boring. If riding along the road with people you do not want to be around is purgatory, watching other people do it is normally hell. Not so in MOPI, as Gus Van Sant shifts the focus from what happens on the road (unless it serves a good narrative or comedic purpose) to what happens after our characters get out of their cars.It also helps that Van Sant's film is full of quirky, three-dimensional, well-directed characters. Michael Balzary, or Flea as he is better known, is the kind of actor one has to carefully utilise in order to harness his strengths. He works best when playing an obnoxious man (Back To The Future II for instance) or a weird man. Under Van Sant's direction, he portrays a character that is little different from his past cameos, but somehow attains a rich third dimension. As said earlier, Van Sant also manages to put Keanu's plank-with-a-mean-face act to good use late in the film. The funeral scene in which the hustlers mourn the loss of one of their own while Reeves' character, having turned his back upon them, silently looks on as he is meant to be mourning his father, shows more diversity in two minutes than many supposed cross-cultural films show in two hours. All this scene needed was a cameo from Weird Al Yankovic, and it would be like a drug trip without the drugs.The powerhouse performance in MOPI would be that of William Richert, who plays the hustlers' surrogate father figure, a bloated, humorous man named Bob Pigeon. Unfortunate name aside, he gets many of the best lines in the film, including a comment on 1980s fashion that hovers on the tip of every tongue that was in the heads of those who lived through that august decade. Given that much of the dialogue in this film is based upon Shakespeare, it is a credit both to Van Sant and Richert that MOPI is able to deliver said dialogue to the effect of making me laugh rather than groan in pain. Thanks to MOPI, it does appear halfway believable that a human being ever actually spoke in the manner Shakespeare describes. Shakespeare references aside, Richert's performance helps cement a certain kind of message about loyalty and betrayal. If MOPI had a moral, one might be inclined to believe it is that one should be nice to those you meet on your way up, because you most likely will meet them on your way back down. Granted, we never see Reeves' character on his way down, but the film leaves us eagerly anticipating it.And that, friends and neighbours, is probably the best way I can sum up MOPI. Sure, it does weaken under repeat viewings due to the slow storytelling style, but that first viewing leaves one wanting more rather than less. It is somewhat like taking a trip to a world one has only read about in the pages of TIME magazine or the like, and making it seem almost welcoming. To quote a cartoon I once read in a more low-brow magazine, I half expect the hustlers to look at Reeves' character and say theirs is a world of respect or trust, but ours is not?. It is for that reason, as well as the funeral, that I gave MOPI eight out of ten. It should be seen at least once by everyone.Bob!

Yes, it is not perfect. Every movie has it's flaws.Let's start with the story. An alien from another world comes to Earth and lands in Washington D.C. Along he has brought a huge and scary looking robot. What exactly he want's no one knows. He claim he comes in peace and demands to speak with the leaders. All the leaders... Of the whole world... At once. His mission is to speak of peace and tell the leaders and the people of Earth that as long as they fight among themselves nobody cares, but if they should attempt to bring their war eager habits into space and thereby threaten other planets measures will be taken against Earth to ensure future peace in the rest of space.The script is good, but maybe a little less conversation and a little more action would have pleased. Almost the whole movie is basically talk and so it may be a little slow. Yet, this makes it a simple movie, a plot focused movie and it's this that makes this film stand out from most other sci-fi films at the time and even still to day. There are also a couple of other minor aspect of the script that could've been done different and perhaps better. However, the story and idea behind the movie was and still is original and good and you get caught up with it. All in all this makes a good result.One thing that stands out is the visual. First of all the cinematography with good lightning and nice shots and then there is the excellent special effects. The opening and closing of the spaceship is looking good and the disappearance of various items is really impressive. Then there is the design. The exterior and interior of the spaceship is really good looking and well made. The lightning in the corridor is really nice and it all joins forces and becomes a really good looking movie.The actors does a good job. Michael Rennie is memorable as Klaatu and Billy Gray is good as Bobby Benson. Also Patricia Neal is good as Helen Benson. Good believable acting in that good old style.Bernard Herrmann's score is good. It lifts the scenes to a whole new level, bringing a nice sci-fi feel to them. The all over sound editing is quite good.What makes this a must see is maybe not as much it's story although it is a good and classic one and has a very relevant message.

While at one of his favorite diners, he comes across a waitress whose luck is no better than his own. Leticia (Halle Berry) has also recently had to deal with the death of her husband who was on Hank's watch on death row.

Director Mark Forster did a wonderful job showing us how in every situation some good can come out and to never give up when it seems all is lost. The character choice was great, Billy Bob Thornton is a passionate actor along with Halle Berry's flare. Tragedies like these happen every day and it was good to see some of the struggles each character faced and the positive that came from this. Monster's Ball had little suspense but all of the tragedy made up for that. Seeing outside of the box is what made this movie so interesting. Hank's father was racist toward the African American race which made the plot a little more suspenseful. The interest that I had in this movie was that it showed a person's will to move on even after a life shattering experience. The story line was catchy but for me the movie started off kind of slow. Once the plot got going, it seemed to hold me in my seat and I didn't find myself wanting to leave the room. All in all, this was a good movie.

Some of them might have been old enough to remember the civil war or at least to have had a close family member killed in it. Many of them were clearly moved by it particularly the end with its archive footage. It is a moving film, but you have to be careful. One should never confuse history with entertainment and this is not a history lesson. All the major events are there, but there is a horrible bias from the director. I don't like DeValera or what he stood for, but what was hinted at the end in this movie is a travesty. If such a thing is true, you have to prove it, you can't slyly hint at it. There are other insidious things such as mortars and car-bombs which are clear reference to the 1970s-90s Northern conflict. Such weapons did not exist in 1916. To me this is an oblique way of implying that the Provos are somehow the legitimate heirs of the IRA in 1916 which of course they are not. Despite this I enjoyed the movie a lot. The production values and acting was so good, it really felt like a timewarp. Neil Jordan is a great director, Neeson and Rickman are superb in their parts. Rickman looks so much like DeValera it is uncanny. I even liked Julia Roberts. It looks like she made a fair attempt at a Dun Laoghaire accent and of course it sounded phony.

You can see a huge explosion and bits coming out portico. I actually felt scared that they had damaged this famous Dublin landmark. This won't mean much to someone from overseas, but anyone familiar with the Four Courts and the resident lawyers (sorry barristers) in their eighteenth century costumes would surely enjoy firing an artillery piece at the overpaid clowns.

I wish I had a howitzer like that. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Thriller"}]
