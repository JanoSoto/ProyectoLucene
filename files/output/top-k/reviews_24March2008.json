They don't want Price World because it would mean local businesses would lose money and be forced to close. I love Alaska, it's our largest state. It has more resources than all of our states put together. It is a beautiful place to live and Alaskans have pride in living there despite the cold weather, endless amounts of snow, and difficult weather conditions. They still live in one of the most incredible places on earth. The plot is pointless and it wasn't even filmed in Alaska which makes it worse.

Okay a heist film needs at least one massive big name to carry it while OCEANS ELEVEN contains four in the shape of Clooney , Damon , Pitt and Roberts who are ably supported by other well known names such as Gould and GarciaDepending upon how you look at it this film is either a failure or a success due to the cast . If you watch movies for the same reasons everyone used to watch classic Hollywood cinema then you will not be disappointed at all . Unfortunate if you're watching for any other reason then you'll notice failings such as the predictable plot or Don Cheadle's incomprehensible accent or the fact that Soderbergh has made a relatively shallow film . But it's another Hollywood Summer blockbuster so it's stupid to complain too much ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2008","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" When you've seen one heist film you have seen them all.
