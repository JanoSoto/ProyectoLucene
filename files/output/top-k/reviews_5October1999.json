One thing I can tell you is NOT to expect Jim Carrey to act like Ace Ventura, Fletcher Reede, or The Mask. In this movie he is not the silly, funny, Jim Carrey that we've all gotten used to. In this movie he acts a lot like Matthew Broderick. Notice that this movie is NOT a comedy. I made the mistake of assuming it was a comedy because Jim Carrey was in it. I can't decide whether its Good or Bad. I CAN say, however, what my experience was while I was watching it. This movie started off very slowly and I was getting very board for the first 30 minutes or so. I like movies that get to the point quickly and The Truman Show definitly takes a lot of time to really start off the story. The ending disappointed me a little bit because once Truman leaves the giant studio he is living in, the story ends instantly. I was hoping that I'd get to see Truman step into the outside world for the first time and react to it. But instead, Truman just walks through the door and that ends the story. Also, once he learned the truth about his whole life being a set up, the audience is never clear on his true feelings about this discovery. This movie is kind of like a hilly road when it comes to Interest. It starts off boring, gets interesting, then gets boring... The only reason I decided to see this movie was because I like Jim Carrey and I didn't have to pay to rent this film. Jim Carrey is a very emotional actor who shows his emotions well through his facial expressions. In all this movie is very DIFFERENT and in a way, kind of strange. I hope Jim Carrey's next movie is a comedy, because I think actors and actresses do best when they stick with parts they are GOOD at.

Then he goes out in the forest all the time, she's a wee bit sad, and everyone gets suspicious.  He defends her and wins, then goes out again; she goes after him, in their joy at seeing each other they can't control themselves, etc. etc.  ALso, it was unneccessary to give Arthur an Irsih-Scottish brogue.  The nudity is overdone; whenever Lancelot's in the forest, he takes off all that heavy armor (and absolutley everything under it, too), and something always makes him jump around so we can all see his bare fanny.  No real reason for it, wouldn't you agree?  That said, the rest of the movie was quite good.  Though the legends are rearranged, it doesn't detract from it at all, because it's well-acted and directed.  Nicol Williamson plays Merlin with a fiery intensity and just the right mixture of wisdom and madness.  Helen Mirren is also good (and very attractvie!) as Morgana.  In fact, there's not really a bad acting job, and it's also fun to see Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart in early roles as others noted.  I thought the editing was imaginitive; I'm not really an expert on stuff like that, it's just my opinion.  ALso, the music was good.  The film is lavish but in a quiet way; the wedding of Arthur and Guenivere is very striking and sticks out.  Very good aside from those mentioned flaws; I do recommend it.

This was before the movie JFK came out and before one of my best friends at the time told me to wake up and open my eyes. It was then that I started to investigate official versions of wars and political fiascos.  And it was then that I realized that there are always three sides to everything; the winners, the losers and then the truth. The truth is hardly ever revealed and it is left up to us to fill in the pieces and develop our own theories.  We'll probably never really know what happened to JFK.  It's probably somewhere in between the Warren report and what Jim Garrison believes.  World War II?  There are so many stories out there about official this and official that that no one really knows where to look anymore.  Take any conflict from Tianemen Square to Watergate or in my country things like the Meech Lake Accord to the fishing dispute that we'll always have with the U.S.  There will always be a shroud of mystery to any conflict.  Because we aren't supposed to know.  But why?  That is a question that I don't have an answer to.  All I know is that the government thinks that it's better if the public is given limited information on everything so that we stay safe, comfortable and free.  But what does all that mean?  Because if the truth is out there, I'd like to know it, just like I'm sure the rest of you would too.  Three Kings feels the same way and tries earnestly to shed some light on a few issues that certain people think that we would be better off not knowing about.  This is one of the best movies of the year and it should be remembered at Oscar time.  More on that in a minute.Three Kings is the story of four soldiers that discover there is gold to be hijacked from Saddam who hijacked it from the Kuwaiti's.  In the group are four very different personalities.  George Clooney is the take charge guy that takes no crap from anyone.  Ice Cube is a devout religious guy but he too is determined to live by his own rules.  Spike Jones plays a guy that is somewhat of a redneck.  He doesn't really understand what his role in the war is.  He really thinks that it is cool to kill with extreme prejudice. He doesn't know that his job is liberation, he thinks that they are there to kill every Arab that they can, not even taking into consideration that they are being helped by many Arabs.  Mark Wahlberg plays a family man that tries not to have a conscience about what he is doing but he can't help it. When they embark on their journey they are met with ample resistance from not only the Iraqi army but from their own military that doesn't want to stop them from getting the gold ( they have no idea that they are going for the gold ) but they want to prevent them from disobeying conduct that could jeopardize their reputation back home with the American people. Everything is kept hush hush and the media is only allowed to report what they are told they can report.  They can't tell the public about the real dangers or what is really happening, if they did, then Bush may look bad in front of his own people, so they are given fallacies and fairy tales to report.  That is one of the interesting sub plots to the film.What really stands out is the theme of unity.  Is an American life worth more than an Iraqi, Kuwaiti or Iranian life?  Are we really that sad of a people that we put our material needs above the welfare of a human being? And as easy as those questions may seem to answer, they really aren't. Not to the person that is honest with themself.  If you could get away with about 50 million in gold but knew that people were going to be slaughtered, would you stay and help them or would you go and live with your conscience? Really, what you do?  Three Kings asks tough questions and doesn't always give the right answer.  Three Kings is unflinching when it asks these questions and it doesn't duck anything.  It comes right out and tells us that perhaps we are not as noble and benevolent as we think we are.Three Kings is one picture that deserves to receive a slew of Oscar nominations.  I think that so far this is best picture material along with best director, supporting actor in Jones and especially in the cinematography department.  The shady and hazy look to the film works to perfection as you sense the confusion and feel the ambiance and the heat around you.  Having the camera look as though it has sand in the lense was a stroke of perfection.  Filming this in perfect wide screen 35mm film would take away from what it wanted us to feel.  After all, this isn't a feel good fantasy like Star Wars.Three Kings has so much to say and it is a film that should be seen by everyone.

The Rainmaker is no different, but in this it is more than just another thriller about a young lawyer fulfilling his materialistic dreams. In fact it's quite the opposite, here young Rudy Baylor is defending someone completely conquered by a corporation's quest for dollars. it is a wonderful ethical tale about corporate greed and its effects on people it has ridden roughshod over. It's chilling when you consider that modern society is mostly dominated now by corporations ,and that their reason for existence is ultimately for money. Of course we all know this, but this film highlights it in a brilliant way, and shows an excellent example of the injustice. So this tale of an evil insurance corporation preying on underprivileged folk trying to sell them 'streetsurance' becomes quite moving. Rudy Baylor takes up the case against 'Great Benefit' who will not pay up on a life insurance claim that would be the only form of survival for a teenager dying with leukemia. Matt Damon portrays accurately the young, rookie lawyer who still has ideals and is not too cynical yet as to not feel uncomfortable about being presented with blatant ambulance-chasing. Danny De Vito is perfect as the bar-exam flunking, wisecracking paralegal with questionable ethics. In addition to a moving storyline and quintessential characters, the film is shot very atmospherically with locations that are more than just background and comment as much on the situation as the dialogue. Also there are some excellent pieces of lawyer intrique and humour that of course can be attributed directly to Grisham. The soundtrack was also something worth commenting on, it was never invasive and had a great jazzy, murky feel which summed up the moviue and the legal profession in general. If you're looking for a good way to spend a Monday Night, then watch this intelligent legal thriller, the story being relatively simplistic and with an odd extra piece of storyline about a very clichéd battered girl.

They include an Irish beat cop, Jimmy Malone, played by Sean Connery, an FBI accountant, Oscar Wallace, played by Charles Martin Smith, and a recruit sharpshooter, George Stone, played by Andy Garcia.  They could not be bought.  They were The Untouchables.The acting in The Untouchables is great.  Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia are all good, Robert de Niro plays Al Capone well, and Sean Connery walked away with an Academy Award.  The Oscar-nominated music score by Ennio Morricone is great as well.  The film has plenty of action to satisfy action fans, and is a very interesting and thrilling story.  The only part that I didn't really enjoy was a scene that so many others loved.  The slow-motion baby\/shootout scene was highly praised, but I thought it was a bit awkward.

It is masterful in plot, story, character structure and development, dialogue, set-up and payoff.  The performances are the pinnacles of everyone's careers.  Hopefully, this will be next year's Oscar gem.Kevin Spacey deserves his second Oscar for his performance as Lester Burnham.  Spacey is an actor who lets his character's through-line carry him through the story and it works beautifully.  Spacey is one of the greatest actors of our generation and shows how he can preserve a role and let it develop the actor.Annette Bening is at the top of her form as Carolyn Burnham.  This is among her best work, including The American President and The Grifters.  She carries her own weight against powerful Spacey and they play their scenes well with the perfect amount of cynicism and malice.I remember the first film I saw 17-year-old Thora Birch was All I Want For Christmas back in 1991 when she was 9 years old.  She has done various supporting roles since in Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger and Now And Then, to name a few.  She has never made such an impression on me as she has as Jane Burnham.  She has developed immensely as an actress and her maturity, mentally and physically, works well for here in this part.  She seems to be one of those rare child actors, like Drew Barrymore, that's slowly making a transition from child-to-adult roles.Newcomer Wes Bentley, 21, plays next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts, n one of the film's most difficult and challenging roles.  Bentley makes a very sympathetic character, despite what he feels real beauty is (i.e., dead pigeon, plastic bag blowing in the wind).  We, the audience, feel for him because of his heated relationship with his father, his deep appreciation for Thora Birch's character and his loneliness, which lurks within all of us.  He has very nice chemistry with Thora Birch that's always interesting to watch; he's an intense star in the making and I hope to see more of him.Mena Suvari, 20, makes an intriguing and provocative career move as Angela Hayes soon after recently playing Choir Girl in this summer's hilarious teen comedy, American Pie.  At first, it appears all her character must do throughout is act bitchy and seductive, but her last scene in the film signifies how good she was.  She plays a cheerleader, who tries to seduce Spacey to reassure herself that she's attractive and above ordinary. I'm sure many of us, including myself, have felt that way before.Last, but not least, Chris Cooper rounds out this wonderful ensemble cast as the stern, militant father of Ricky who has a few hidden secrets of his own.  I have known Chris Cooper to be a great supporting character actor and here is no exception.  By the end, we understand the reasons for his actions, even though we, most certainly, don't agree with the resulting outcome.Every main character in this film is rather over-the-top, but they were played with such skill, style and finesse that it makes them believable all the same.  We sympathize with Lester because we sense his discomfort and rediscovery all the way to his inevitable downfall.  I understand why this 42-year-old man will fall for a 17-year-old girl.  Of course, there are many reasons why it's wrong, but Lester doesn't so much love her, but the idea of her.  There are no real villains in `American Beauty' and there doesn't have to be. It's not impossible to see Lester using Angela as an outlet to become more spiritually aware.This film has `psychology' written all over it.  Screenwriter Alan Ball has done a masterful job with his dialogue, character development and his view of `contemporary' American life and its `mask.'  These characters are definitely stuck in `The Matrix.'  Director Sam Mendes has an extraordinary visual style that translates to the screen with beautiful, vibrant colors and set design.  He, also, knows the irony and satirical tone each scene hints at and requires.The film has elements of other recent pictures, such as `Happiness,' `The Ice Storm' and a little bit of `Office Space.'  Those were three well-made films, yet `American Beauty' exceeds all three combined.  `American Beauty' is an exceptional exercise of the right actors with the right script at the right time.  It is the year's best film so far, passing `The Sixth Sense,' even though both films have very little in common.  The film's closing credits appeared and numerous couples sat in silence, staring at the screen and taking in the experience.  When I went into the theatre parking lot, I watched an empty styrofoam cup flailing about in the breeze.  Right then, I understood what Ricky Fitts meant by beauty.
