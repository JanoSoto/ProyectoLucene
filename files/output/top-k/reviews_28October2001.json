As I expected, the disturbing things reminded me of Kubrick, the sentimental elements are Spielberg's trademark. But this in favour of Spielberg all the emotional moments are well founded in the script and never have that manipulative touch that make some Spielberg films so utterly indigestable. Of course it would have been a better movie of Kubrick himself had made it, but Spielberg did a great job and he managed to give you the uncanny feeling at moments that you're watching a movie made by two directors one living, one dead. The story is divided into three parts the intimate scenes with David and his parents, the bombastic central part with Jude Law as the pimp-bot, and the mystical final part with the visitors from outer space. The first and last parts are the best. David's relationship to his mother is portrayed in a touching way. The scenes in which David is programmed to love his mother and the one in which he's abandoned show Spielberg at the top of his craft, enhanced by powerful acting. Then, unfortunately, the movie bogs down in an orgy of expensive sets and effects. The screenplay suddenly becomes garbled, with a dumb escape sequence, worthy of a B-movie. Then David meets his creator (a scene with reminds me of the one in The Truman Show, with Ed Harris). This bombastic middle part isn't completely without purpose, because its noise paves the way for the wonderful and silent third part, David's mystical encounter with the aliens. In this part, Spielberg's Close Encounters and Kubrick's 2001 meet. The resemblance to 2001 in particulary striking. It's as if we witness Dave Bowman's (yep, another David - coincidence???) rebirthing again. But the Mecha David doesn't become a Star-Child, Spielberg's approach is too much down-to-earth for that kind of mysticism. If Kubrick had directed this sequence, he wouldn't explain as much as Spielberg, he would leave the magic untouched. But as I said before, Spielberg didn't fail. It's one of his best movies, almost as good as ET and Schindler's List.

That is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer\/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with Christianity are twisted by Tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (Try watching some early Kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much originality Tarantino has.) I'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. Despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. It is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the Earth is from Neptune. Quentin Tarantino is NOT Orson Welles. And Pulp Fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. Make no mistake, I am more of an atheist than a Christian, but even I am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish Tony Minero would ice. If he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given Tim Roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. Off to a flawed start as a Christian. And the fact that Tarantino lets us see that Roth and Plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. Then there's the completely sickening LA underworld psycho scene (a personal Tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in Boorman's Deliverance. Does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? And if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving.Quentin Tarantino is truly one sick puppy. Sure, he DOES write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of MF and N words, but as far as talent for film-making goes he hasn't got an idea. He couldn't act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper (Spielberg gave a better performance in The Blues Brothers) and visually he has nothing to offer at all. If anyone knows his influences, and he speaks of them often, you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard (especially Howard Hawks) would phone the SWAT team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table.And to sum up my point, what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how GREAT a film Rio Bravo is.

I typically appreciate older movies, and I don't like the way that more contemporary films feel it is necessary to accompany what little plot they have to offer with constant action and a blaring soundtrack.  The art of dialogue and artful shots is fading quickly.  But this movie offered all of that and more.I have read all viewer comments IMDB has to offer about The Apostle, and a lot of folks complained that the film dragged.  Personally, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting for the inevitable (E.F.'s arrest) to happen.  In my opinion, Robert Duvall is one of the best actors of our time, and The Apostle is a beautiful showcase to display his talents. True, it focuses on him most of the time, but Duvall is such a wonderful actor and E.F. is such a powerful character that when the focus away from him, the movie loses momentum, but not by much.Plot and characters aside, this movie was stunning to look at.  The filming was done in Texas and Louisiana, which is fitting, because you cannot capture the beauty of the Deep South in a back lot in California.  All the actors looked perfect for their parts, and while some have commented that that of the elderly black fisherman was a demeaning character, he was realistic, as was every other character in the film.  They acted like real folks put into a certain situation.  As far as the plot and acting goes, this film moved me the way few other films have before.  The scene where E.F. telephones his buddy back home to check on his momma, who in reality is laid out in a funeral parlor, drove me to tears, as did the scene where E.F. is working at a crummy little diner to pay for his church and sees Toosie back with her husband.  But the climax of this movie was at the very end, when the law finally catches up with E.F., and they arrest him after he gives the sermon of his life, which had me crying up until the credits began to roll and we see E.F. on a chain gang, preaching as he always did, where I began to laugh with the film's moving message of hope and renewal.Another issue that has been brought up by both fans and critics of the movie alike is that the movie has holes.  Yet you also complain that it is too long.  The movie personally flew by for me, and I would welcome those extra scenes, even if they did lengthen the movie a bit.  I believe that it is a crime that Robert Duvall did not walk away with the Oscar for Best Actor for The Apostle and an even larger crime that Titanic (evil) won Best Picture instead of this lasting masterpiece.  In any case, if you have to have the latest pop or rock tunes blasting throughout, or a high-speed car chase, or a lot of sex to get through a movie, then don't see The Apostle.

Personally, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting for the inevitable (E.F.'s arrest) to happen.  In my opinion, Robert Duvall is one of the best actors of our time, and The Apostle is a beautiful showcase to display his talents. True, it focuses on him most of the time, but Duvall is such a wonderful actor and E.F. is such a powerful character that when the focus away from him, the movie loses momentum, but not by much.Plot and characters aside, this movie was stunning to look at.  The filming was done in Texas and Louisiana, which is fitting, because you cannot capture the beauty of the Deep South in a back lot in California.  All the actors looked perfect for their parts, and while some have commented that that of the elderly black fisherman was a demeaning character, he was realistic, as was every other character in the film.  They acted like real folks put into a certain situation.  As far as the plot and acting goes, this film moved me the way few other films have before.  The scene where E.F. telephones his buddy back home to check on his momma, who in reality is laid out in a funeral parlor, drove me to tears, as did the scene where E.F. is working at a crummy little diner to pay for his church and sees Toosie back with her husband.  But the climax of this movie was at the very end, when the law finally catches up with E.F., and they arrest him after he gives the sermon of his life, which had me crying up until the credits began to roll and we see E.F. on a chain gang, preaching as he always did, where I began to laugh with the film's moving message of hope and renewal.Another issue that has been brought up by both fans and critics of the movie alike is that the movie has holes.  Yet you also complain that it is too long.  The movie personally flew by for me, and I would welcome those extra scenes, even if they did lengthen the movie a bit.  I believe that it is a crime that Robert Duvall did not walk away with the Oscar for Best Actor for The Apostle and an even larger crime that Titanic (evil) won Best Picture instead of this lasting masterpiece.  In any case, if you have to have the latest pop or rock tunes blasting throughout, or a high-speed car chase, or a lot of sex to get through a movie, then don't see The Apostle. Or maybe you should, so you'll see what real film is all about.Holy Ghost Power!!!  -) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Well, Spielberg has done it again.

The film (and Donnie) bundles along toward an supposedly apocalytpic end, though without revealing anything deeper in the characters, their relationships to each other, or anything resembling an emotion which rings true, with the exception of self-sacrifice. Ridiculous (as in, inviting ridicule) elements of the film include bullies at the upper middle class private school who wield knives -- a past-time which would typically invite discipline in the real world. The teenage boys are all cruel for cruelty's sake -- as evidenced by their frequent verbal assaults on people such self- absorbed kids would otherwise not notice.   The interest in time- travel is gratuitous, and justifies itself circularly as a plot device, but has no deeper meaning for the film.   At best, Donnie realizes redemption by committing his ultimate act of destruction, which is the seed of a creation -- an element foreshadowed early in the film.

I feel very fortunate to have thus stumbled onto this remarkable little gem without any prior expectations, the pleasure of discovery adding even more to what would have been, in any event, a delightful experience.Vincent D'Onofrio is an amazingly gifted actor, completely different in every role but always intelligent, fascinating and compelling.  This film is no exception and may be his best work to date.  His performance is brilliant, filled with subtlety and nuance, fire and ice, joy and pain, madness, profundity and beauty.  It is utterly mesmerizing.  The depth and complexity of his portrayal is astonishing, from the flick of an eyebrow to the quiver in his voice to the awkward stride as he walks down a dusty street.  He creates a character so unforgettable and so unique that it is difficult to believe he was a real person.Renee Zellweger is a perfect balance to D'Onofrio.  Her talent is well known, but I liked her better in this film than in anything else I've seen. Again, her characterization was complex, full of intelligence, sensitivity and intensity.  The interplay of these two talented actors is a thing of beauty and a joy to watch.  The script is literate and intelligent, the direction is perfect and the cinematography is stunning.

Stripped of the pretense of Raging Bull and the stylized atmosphere of GoodFellas, Taxi Driver is a unashamedly honest look at New York city and its effects on a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran.  Often uneasy to watch but amazingly and utterly compelling, Taxi Driver launched Martin Scorsese into the pantheon of great directors.Set in modern day (1976) New York, the story centres around Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a 26 year-old ex Vietnam veteran.  He is shy, dispossesed and utterly alone.  He frequents porn theatres, yet is repulsed by the 'filth' he sees on the streets.  Unable to sleep at night, Travis becomes a taxi driver, working long shifts with little or no sleep.Through his nightly experiences as a cab driver, Travis becomes even more bitter and confused.  Bernard Herrmann's impecible theme aurates Travis' battle between what he thinks he should stand against and what actually arouses him.  In fact, the theme music is perhaps the second most important character in the film, acting as a metaphor for the daily downward spiral of Travis' mental state.In his solitude Travis lets the drudgery and depressive nature of his job burrow inside his mind.  He falls for an angelic WASP named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and even manages to take her out on a date.  But his complete lack of nuance for the real world ends up with any chance of a burgeoning romance left in tatters.What makes Travis' journey into madness even more compelling is the portrayl of the character by Robert De Niro.  As the film progresses, De Niro's fractured performance is so real, you almost feel he really is Travis Bickle, even now some 25 years since the film's release.  De Niro's best scenes are when he is trying to interact with 'normal' people, like his cab driver friends, or his confrontations with Tom (Albert Brooks) - a co-worker of Betsy.  The way De Niro is one step removed from these and all the other characters in the movie is a feat he has not matched since.The script by Paul Schrader is also superb.  The film shifts from centering on Travis' insecurity, to his misguidance and eventually to his role as a psychotic vigilante.  The dialogue is superb and each character is shaped perfectly.The film also makes use of its many smaller, but no less important roles, such as Sport the Pimp (Harvey Keitel), Wizard the cabbie (Peter Boyle), Tom and Iris (Jodie Foster).  All of these characters display an on screen presence that is rarely matched by other supporting cast members.Holding it altogether is Scorsese.  New York has never looked sleazier or grimier.  Taxi Driver works because Scorsese never lets the film slip in any way.  Movie buffs will recognise many small homages to different directors, but even the casual viewer will feel nailed to their seat as the walls within Travis' mind creep further and further in.A true feat of modern film making and a study in paranoia that may never be bettered, Taxi Driver is an important chapter in American film and one that requires repeat viewings despite its difficult and uneasy vibe.

I would have understood, if the attacks had been in England or the film would have been in release in the US, but this, NO. I mean it is not so much that I do not feel for the people that suffered and died due to those attacks (I do and I was as shocked as anyone), but I will not let terrorists or politicians take away my choices in entertainment. Furthermore, I do not think there will be less action movies in the next years or people will stop going to the cinema's for these kind of movies, simply because people forget. You'll see, wait another 5 to 15 years and they will make a film of the September 11th attacks.This film, controversial as it might have been on it's release in Europe, is a quality product. You might expect that too, when you see all those names of actors John Travolta (Face\/Off, Broken Arrow, Pulp Fiction, Phenomenon and so on&#133;), Halle Berry (The Flintstones, X &#150; Men), Hugh Jackman (X &#150; Men) and Vinnie Jones (Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Gone in 60 Seconds). But not only these people promise quality. The director, Dominic Sena, a fresh graduate of the Jerry Bruckheimer school of directing (Gone in 60 Seconds) and producer Joel Silver (The Matrix, Die hard 1 + 2, Leathal Weapon 1 &#150; 4, Conspiracy Theory Braveheart and so on&#133;) also stand for quality entertainment and action and I must say that these are the two things this film delivers. The story starts with the and most originally filmed and executed explosion I've ever seen in the beginning of a movie and then flashbacks to set you up with an explosive story that will lead you to an even bigger ending. The directing and action sequences are perfect as are the characters and the acting. In that last department there are three people that I think genuinely stand out. John Travolta (of course), Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry.John Travolta delivers the perfect bad guy, who has somehow understandable motives and is even colder than ice. He does not only seem to be enjoying his &#145;evil' part even more than in Broken Arrow and Face\/Off, but he also seems to have learned from his earlier &#145;bad guy' work in creating the coolest and most believable villain I've seen in new film lately. Not to say that the villains he played in Broken Arrow were not believable, but they only had either personal enrichment (Broken Arrow) or destruction (Face\/Off) on their minds. This character, however has an ideal he wants to realize. It must be accomplished by breaking the law, which in my mind makes him not only a better villain but a more dangerous one too.As in regard to Hugh Jackman, his role is to play the good &#145;bad guy'. He has an understandable motive to virtually every move he makes in his film and is totally believable in that. He actually is one of the few in this film to show any emotion of any kind which does not only make him (due to a good performance) sympathetic to the viewer, but also underscores his motives in going along with this terrorist act. Halle Berry's performance, in this film, differs so much from the other characters in her films in regard to her playing people with both her body and her words. She is excellently cast as Travolta sexy sidekick.I've complimented so many people in this review, I get the feeling I missed someone and I know exactly whom. You may as well compliment people on directing and acting, but where o where would they be without a decent script? NOWHERE!!! Well this script was delivered to us by someone whom I've already witnessed once in the movie business Skip Woods. And I must say his first effort (Thursday), which he both wrote and directed really stuck in my head. The film, was nothing short of this one, as far as quality goes. In my mind it was one of the best Pulp Fiction-esque films I've ever seen. I can assure you that it is as exciting, original and surprising as this one. It might be a bit more provocative than this one but if you liked this one you'll sure as hell like Thursday. Don't believe me?

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS I THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly awesome special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels around the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.

In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS I THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly awesome special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels around the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next.

Not Einstein, that's for sure.  6) If some ancient mystic designed this house, how do you account for modern appliances and why the unnecessary, extravagant, priceless furnishings?  7) Shop glasses that allow you to see the dead?  8) Why don't you need them to see the dead uncle?  If he's not really dead, why didn't he stitch that gash and change clothes, for crying out loud?  9) What's up with the cheap transparent raincoats everyone is wearing during the film's opening sequence?

The second robbery is equally well executed and filmed; however, from thence onwards the problems start.One problem is that there are too many red herrings which are never resolved; one might think the surveillance tape from the beginning will endanger the subsequent robbery, but it never resurfaces. A lot of loose strands in the plot are opened in several places without ever being resolved. What about the sale of the boat, for example? Add to that some serious plot improbabilities. How Jimmy tracked down Fran by merely writing down the license plate of a truck she stepped into seems rather strange.Fran is, by the way, the major plot hole in the movie. When and why she defected the gang and changed sides is never clear. Up to the end I was sure it was just another one of Moore's tricks to mislead Jimmy and Bergman -- turns out it wasn't, but the solution as it was was both unbelievable and rather weak.Similarly, the final shoot-out between Joe and Bergman's henchmen felt particularly out of place, as was the scene when Pincus was caught and shot -- both were such significant changes of mood and genre that the whole film felt terribly disrupted.One major problem was also that the ending was quite predictable -- it was obvious that Moore would get the gold in the end, so the question was not really if, but how he would be able to distract and mislead his opponents. No plot twist therefore seemed much of a surprise, even at the very end, when Jimmy and Fran reappear, I wasn't surprised much... except for Fran's betrayal, which, as I already pointed out, merely felt wrong.I'm not even mentioning the minor plot holes, which were there in abundance.As for acting, Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito were terrific, especially in the scenes where they are confronting each other. It's hard to ever imagine DeVito in comedy movies, given the intense portrayal of a criminal character in this movie. I have the usual problem with Rebecca Pidgeon I never know if she's not too much of an actress or if it's just Mamet's female characters which don't ring true; her character in this movie was definitely problematic in the latter respect.I give this 5 points for some decent acting from Hackman, DeVito and Delroy Lindo, plus two great robbery scenes. However, the script of the movie simply suffers from too many plot holes and problems to deserve a better rating. In Mamet terms, this is a major disappointment.

The second robbery is equally well executed and filmed; however, from thence onwards the problems start.One problem is that there are too many red herrings which are never resolved; one might think the surveillance tape from the beginning will endanger the subsequent robbery, but it never resurfaces. A lot of loose strands in the plot are opened in several places without ever being resolved. What about the sale of the boat, for example? Add to that some serious plot improbabilities.
