[{"date":"2 June 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Recently, Stephen Gaghan directed and Steven Soderbergh produced Syriana, about everything that has resulted from US involvement in the Middle East. We might say that they preceded that movie with Traffic, about the futility of the drug wars and how the whole trade affects various people.The movie starts off by showing Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro, who won Best Supporting Actor); he and his partner travel around the northern part of the country looking for drug smugglers. Then, we get introduced to Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), soon to get appointed drug czar of the United States, but unaware of something shocking. And then, San Diego feds Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) have to bust drug smuggler Carlos Ayala (Miguel Ferrer), leaving his pregnant wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) with no one.I will say that the movie isn't perfect. It misses the chance to focus on the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking over the years. Moreover, all the Mexico scenes are filmed in sepia; are we to infer that our southern neighbor is nothing but a drug-infested cesspool? But anyway, the movie does a very good job taking a grim look at everything associated with the drug wars. The aforementioned cast members do a very good job, as do Dennis Quaid, Amy Irving, Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (Sens. Don Nickles, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley also appear). I do recommend this movie, despite it's flaws.

I like Aniston as an actress; she is natural, sensitive and has a comic flare but to make it really big on the big screen and go further with her career she must get out of those fluffy Hollywood romantic comedies that she seems to get frequently cast it.She wisely accepted the role of Nina, a social worker in a deeply- troubled relationship who becomes best friends with her new flatmate, a recently dumped gay man. Emotional turmoil ensues, however, when she falls pregnant by her controlling boyfriend and falls in love with this gay man.Though the script takes itself a little too seriously at times and is riddled with typical US sentimentalism, it is a sensitive and very human piece where Aniston, who admitted to being stretched as an actress on this film, does a good job, demonstrating range.As far as I am aware, this film was not a box-office smash but it is enjoyable and did go down well with the critics. Aniston needs to do more films like this and more people need to be prepared to watch them. She's good.

I think it is a very clever film with many connotations. The storyline is original, it quickly unfolds capturing our attention, leading us from scene to scene as the story gathers danger. The film is particularly enhanced with symbolic interpretations that strongly feature throughout such as the mirrors, birds (and references to), lines, weather conditions and most renowned of all- the screeching discordant tones that warn it's audience that something gruesome is about to happen. This film is one of morals and lost opportunities. The ending is quiet an eye-opener and is a kind of summing-up or conclusion, giving the audience an explanation\/answer. Psycho is a thought evoking film that is very watchable.
