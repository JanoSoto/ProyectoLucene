Remember what he did to poor Diane (Chase), and he wasn't even mad at her. Cape Fear should have been named Cape Fear, Shudder and Sweat.This is about the last word in stalker movies. More importantly, it shows how using less often produces more. Mitchum underplays the stalker role, but he also knows how to imply unspeakable evil, which is really more effective than blood splatter. It's what's in your imagination that's really scary. Ditto Peck, (Sam) whose on-screen reserve speaks volumes in grim determination-- he's got to protect his family. Only Bergen as the terrified wife gets to really cut loose. What a first-rate cast, plus expert pacing from director Thompson.I guess the movie's moral is that if the law can't protect you, you've got to do it yourself. At that primitive level, there's no holds barred. So the tension really mounts as we discover Cady's animal cunning is too much for the law or even for hired thugs. In the end, then, it's going to have to be Cady vs. Sam, mano y mano. It's sort of like a modern morality tale of the nuclear family vs. a swamp beast.

This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is poor, and the direction is flat out lazy.The acting is terrible because the sarcasm used by Oliver and Jenny is tough to notice. Most people have some kind of joking tone, but Oliver and Jenny sound like two people in a heated debate. When Oliver makes Jenny angry and she runs out of the house, I don't feel the way Oliver is supposed to feel. His face is plain, but with an added gawk to add nervous tension to the scared husband that wants to apologize to his wife. Oliver's parents are the basic snotty rich people who have a son in love with a poor girl. Oliver, himself, isn't that interesting a character either. Jenny and her father are basic characters, the poor family with a small business that barely let them scrape by, and Jenny is the girl smart enough to get accepted to a good college.The story is generic as generic can be. It is simply a modern day Rome and Juliet story, but instead of Montagues and Capulets we have a rich Protestant and a poor Catholic. Dragging economic status and religious background shouldn't be a wedge between the characters because its not powerful enough, especially in this film. Romeo and Juliet is fine, we don't need to see its plot mindlessly abused by this film, among others. The only curse Shakespeare brought upon Romeo and Juliet was the simplicity of duplicating the story. What's even worse was that the novel was written by an English professor who was not satisfied with the romance genre of novels. A student then said that he should write one if he thought he could write a better story. The problem here This story is too basic. This film is basically the film student's guide to a quick buck, an easy plot, and how to go minimalist.On that Minimalist note, this film is incredibly lazy. This movie has a famous soundtrack, according to my Film Analysis professor. My complaint was that there is one song, and its used in the stupidest scenes. A scene where Jenny is riding her bike to her house that she owns with Oliver is accompanied by this abused song. When Jenny and Oliver are just playing in the snow the music plays. My point to my Film Analysis professor was how over used it was; my professor used an example like the Indiana Jones theme, my response was that when Indie is doing something heroic, we hear his signature theme. Love Story has a signature that is supposed to symbolize loneliness or being cast out, but it is played too often in unusual situations. Another lazy aspect of this film was the directing. In the scene where Oliver is running around town to apologize to Jenny, the camera hardly moves. It is right in front of Oliver, but when he goes into the laundromat the camera doesn't follow him inside. The camera doesn't had a sense of urgency. The rule with the camera was, Here's where I can see, so the actors walk within this one shot. Need more proof. The camera is lazy near the end after Jenny dies. Oliver is in the park and he's by himself, but the camera doesn't do much exploring, if you will.Avoid this film at all costs.

However, with that said, I'm never one to judge a film solely by the box office because many times great movies do poorly there while real trash makes millions. The basic story here takes place during the 1890s cattle wars in Wyoming as immigrants are forced off their land by rich businessmen who have hired a bunch of goons to kill off people named in a death book. Kris Kirstofferson and Christopher Walken play men on opposite sides of the fence but both are connected by the love for the same woman (Isabeele Huppert).Whenever people mention HEAVEN'S GATE it's always because of his disastrous box office results, which had the studio cutting the film down a week into its release. After viewing the 227-minute version I can't help but think that perhaps the studio did the best thing and I do wonder how much better the shorter cut is. I say that because this film is so deadly dull and boring from the word go that you can't help but think that cutting out over an hour would have to have helped. I mean, I can think of countless scenes that could have been chopped off and it wouldn't have effected the story any and that's the biggest problem. The fact that a nearly four-hour movie has no story is something that is just mind boggling. I'm really at a loss of words as to why Cimino thought that no story was a smart idea and this is what really kills everything.So many scenes just go on and on and on and yet they never really connect to one another. It really does feel as if the director was just filming stuff for the sake of wanting a long movie and he didn't care if it added up in the end. The entire prologue is a complete waste and could have been cut off. There's a long sequence with a violin player on skates that could have been axed. There's a follow up to this scene where Kristofferson and Huppert dance. Every single scene in this movie just goes on for no reason because the extended running time doesn't give anything to the story. Even scenes that are nothing but dialogue go into directions that add nothing to the story and when they're over you realize that more often than not they didn't have anything to do with stuff that preceded it. What's even stranger is the entire film is so ugly to look at that you can't help but wonder why the beautiful locations would be wasted by what appears to be dust and dirt over the print. This brownish tone (which comes and goes) just looks downright ugly and does nothing for the picture.It is rather shocking that the man who made THE DEER HUNTER would get an unlimited budget and an all-star cast yet turn out something this bad. It's strange but without its reputation of being a box office bomb there's really no other reason to watch this. There are countless bad movies out there that have been forgotten over time but this here will live on because of the money lost. I guess that's a bad thing because so many people are going to be intrigued by this and have the misfortune to sit through it.

Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today. He stole the film and the entire franchise.One thing that struck me this time round was how poor some of the acting was. Tara Reid is dreadful and Chris Klein even worse. Shannon Elizabeth's accent is ridiculous and the country she is supposed to be from didn't even exist in 1999! Another thing I noticed this time was how sweaty the whole cast looked. I'd never noticed it before but it looked like each actor had gone for a run immediately before reading their lines. I didn't particularly like the sentimentality towards the end and everything ended far too neatly but at least it wasn't a nasty or mean movie. I also really liked the film's soundtrack both in 1999 and now.Despite all its flaws I still have great affinity for this film. It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair. The film has stayed with me all these years and in a way I wish I hadn't revisited it. It's like that video game that you loved as a kid and you see in a shop for £2. You take it home, dig out and dust down your old console and then realise five minutes in that times have changed. Sure, it was great when you were a kid but you're not anymore. It's best to put it back in the box and remember the good times you had as a kid.www.attheback.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's the summer of 1999, I'm 13 and somehow myself and about eight friends get into our local two screen cinema one afternoon to see American Pie. 95 minutes and a lot of thrown popcorn later and we leave having seen the funniest film we think we'll ever see.

It reminded me of being in my teens, wearing the same overly baggy clothes and having the same overly gelled hair.

Now it's 2012, I'm 26, I have a beard and I've gone back to watch the film that my 13 year old self fell in love with before watching the forth instalment of the franchise next month.Towards the end of the senior year at High School four friends; jock Oz (Chris Klein), awkward geek Jim (Jason Biggs), quirky Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and regular guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are struggling to lose their virginity before they each embark for college. Having seen classmates like loud mouth Stifler (Seann William Scott) have success on this front and after one party believing that even the dorkiest guy in the class Chuck 'Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) has lost his virginity, the four friends make a pact that they will help each other to get laid by Prom Night.When I first watched this in 1999 the idea of hearing teenagers talk about and engage in sex during a movie was still novel and outrageous to me. Some of the jokes and more graphic or gross scenes were hilarious and like nothing I'd ever seen before. Now, 13 years later after the likes of The Hangover which have pushed the crude and discussing acts even further, the film feels a bit tame. It's still pretty gross to see Stifler drink from that cup or for Jim to enjoy that pie but sensitivities and audiences have changed a lot in the last decade or so. Much of the humour I liked 13 years ago now feels immature and I suppose this is because it isn't fresh and also because I've grown up. The humour in The Hangover didn't appeal to me either and the trailer for Project X put me off completely. I wonder how funny someone born in 1999 would find this film now. I expect they would find it funnier that I. One character who still remains funny to me is Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). His interactions with his son about sex are cringe worthy and embarrassing even today.

It is by far and away one of the few existential action movies ever made, and they only made a handful. Jack Arnold, the director and Richard Matheson make for quite a team. You can easily see Arnolds influence over great directors like Spielberg. There is some talk of remaking this movie, seems pointless, but if anybody would and could pull off a remake, it would be Spielberg. Jack Arniold was considered to be the king of the B movie monster movies and it is a title that is well earned. He always added a certain quality to his films that elevated them to a memorable status. Richard Matheson of course has always been one of the top sci fi writers, and the combination of talents here is staggering. I first saw this movie expecting a simple fantasy, but I never would have guessed that this movie had quite the psychological edge. I cannot begin to imagine that a B movie would take me out of myself and cause me to look at the world in a whole different way. It made me question life. It made me realize that one day I will die. It opened my eyes frankly, and caused me to enact the greatest theme of man Wonder. The action is relentless. The special effects are amazing for its time. The acting is very much above average. It moved right along with zero weak spots. But above all, it was the existentialism that blew my mind. I was so caught up with the plight of the main character. This movie did a wonderful job of putting me into his situation. And that ending!!! The studios must have wanted a happy ending, but from what I understand, Jack Arnold and Richard MAtheson fought them tooth and nail to the bitter end, and won the right to one of the best endings ever in a film of this caliber. This movie is an undisputed classic. For anyone to not think so, may I humble myself and say that perhaps it is a lack of sheer imagination that prohibits one from throughly enjoying this. All I can say is Wow! I ve since seen it many times, and it never gets old. I d go so far as to say it is easily one of the best movies from the 50s. Kudos to Jack Arnold, its his best movie. Richard Mateson was at the peak of his career. Its message is universal, figure it out for yourself. They don't come any more existential then this. Such a rare treat. Go to your public library and get this movie. I am an avid movie watcher because of films like this. I struck gold watching this.

This is the difference that distinguishes her from others, and develops a sexual identity crisis in her. Never does Teena as Brandon try to recognize her femininity; in fact, she tries to conceal it completely. Teena as Brandon is spunky, foul-mouthed, gutsy, amiable and sometimes reckless; Brandon as Teena (as the movie progresses we get to see shades of her) is delicate, vulnerable, pitiable and helpless; Brandon does not want Teena to weaken her, and she is emboldened when she is Brandon. Hilary Swank assumes the role of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry, a poignant drama on the life of Brandon Teena, a young human being who was raped and murdered by her close male friends after being exposed as a woman posing as a man. For Hilary, this role is extensively challenging because she has to make Brandon believable; Brandon does not come from rich surroundings, neither does he possess exquisite talent or intelligence or have a terrific story to tell. He is a young trans-gender who has faced years of abuse at the hands of his uncle (not covered in the movie) and who only wants the world to accept him. Sadly, he cannot undergo a sex-change operation because of financial troubles, and therefore he has to remain careful regarding his identity. In the second scene, Brandon cannot take his eyes off a young girl and manages to kiss her by the end of their first date; the girls themselves fall for Brandon easily. But immediately, a group of flaring men chase and pelt Brandon with stones until he finds shelter in his cousin's trailer. His cousin fears for his own life and cannot put up with Brandon's constant negative attention-grabbing behavior, and therefore evicts him from his trailer. Brandon then befriends two ex-convicts and their friends, which includes his future girlfriend Lana, and becomes bedazzled by his newfound companions. However, these same relations possess a potential threat for him when he and Lana fall in love and skeletons begin to tumble out eventually. Swank is a wonder here &#x96; she conveys Brandon's confusion, happiness, acceptance, hurt, grief and fear with such subtlety we never find a moment of falseness from her performance. I saw this movie about a week ago and so my review may seem slightly unpolished but I can tell you one thing, that when Brandon begins to whimper as he is, being raped, his screams hint a presence of Teena underneath him. Hillary's acting is so powerful is that it became difficult for me to watch the entire scene without pausing once to cry watching her helplessness. Then there is Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel, a hopeless drug addict whose life is as hollow as her karaoke performance in the bar. Lana's life changes after she meets Brandon who turns her from this confused and submissive wreck to an independent woman who stands by Brandon and is able to see her life more clearly. Chloe manages to give much more depth to her character and conveys her hopelessness, loss, love, confusion, and support through her beautiful eyes. Peter Sarsgaard plays John Lotter, a self-destructive man, whose only outlet for hiding his weakness is to do drugs, commit violence and lose impulse. His friend Tom Nissen, played by Brendan, is slightly more stable but in the same quagmire as his friend, cutting himself to calm his impulses. Sarsgaard makes Lotter intimidating and fearful, a highlight being when Lotter isn't able to accept his fault of encouraging Brandon to drag race and evade the police, and he brazenly tells the group, except Lana to get out of the car, leaving them stranded. Here, Nissen's reaction to Brandon's defense against Lotter is noteworthy as he tries to calm Brandon down to no avail.The technical aspects of the movie are also surprisingly unconventional; director Kimberley Pierce takes us extremely close to the characters' mental state, which is mostly spaced-out because of all the drugs. This works for most of the film, especially in case of Lana, and makes the confrontational scenes even more haunting, because that is when things begin losing their haziness. I was not very impressed with the slow-motion sequence towards the end of the movie and would've opted for a quicker, more shocking end for Brandon.Boys Don't Cry is a great film whose director (and writer) Kimberly is genuinely interested in its subject (unlike the recent failing of Ms. Phyllida Lloyd) and knows how to get emotional response from her characters and get the audience closer to the character's own perceptions. It may be putting-off for many because of the subject matter, the rape scene and the pace, but anyone who is ready to give the film a chance will be mesmerized by the performances, the story, the characters and the direction.My Rating 8.6 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 2012","score":"","review":" Teena Brandon masquerades as a boy by stuffing a sock under her pants and flattening her breasts by binding them; she does this not because she considers herself a lesbian but because she cannot identify herself as a girl.

For Hilary, this role is extensively challenging because she has to make Brandon believable; Brandon does not come from rich surroundings, neither does he possess exquisite talent or intelligence or have a terrific story to tell. He is a young trans-gender who has faced years of abuse at the hands of his uncle (not covered in the movie) and who only wants the world to accept him. Sadly, he cannot undergo a sex-change operation because of financial troubles, and therefore he has to remain careful regarding his identity. In the second scene, Brandon cannot take his eyes off a young girl and manages to kiss her by the end of their first date; the girls themselves fall for Brandon easily. But immediately, a group of flaring men chase and pelt Brandon with stones until he finds shelter in his cousin's trailer. His cousin fears for his own life and cannot put up with Brandon's constant negative attention-grabbing behavior, and therefore evicts him from his trailer. Brandon then befriends two ex-convicts and their friends, which includes his future girlfriend Lana, and becomes bedazzled by his newfound companions. However, these same relations possess a potential threat for him when he and Lana fall in love and skeletons begin to tumble out eventually. Swank is a wonder here &#x96; she conveys Brandon's confusion, happiness, acceptance, hurt, grief and fear with such subtlety we never find a moment of falseness from her performance. I saw this movie about a week ago and so my review may seem slightly unpolished but I can tell you one thing, that when Brandon begins to whimper as he is, being raped, his screams hint a presence of Teena underneath him. Hillary's acting is so powerful is that it became difficult for me to watch the entire scene without pausing once to cry watching her helplessness. Then there is Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel, a hopeless drug addict whose life is as hollow as her karaoke performance in the bar. Lana's life changes after she meets Brandon who turns her from this confused and submissive wreck to an independent woman who stands by Brandon and is able to see her life more clearly. Chloe manages to give much more depth to her character and conveys her hopelessness, loss, love, confusion, and support through her beautiful eyes. Peter Sarsgaard plays John Lotter, a self-destructive man, whose only outlet for hiding his weakness is to do drugs, commit violence and lose impulse. His friend Tom Nissen, played by Brendan, is slightly more stable but in the same quagmire as his friend, cutting himself to calm his impulses. Sarsgaard makes Lotter intimidating and fearful, a highlight being when Lotter isn't able to accept his fault of encouraging Brandon to drag race and evade the police, and he brazenly tells the group, except Lana to get out of the car, leaving them stranded. Here, Nissen's reaction to Brandon's defense against Lotter is noteworthy as he tries to calm Brandon down to no avail.The technical aspects of the movie are also surprisingly unconventional; director Kimberley Pierce takes us extremely close to the characters' mental state, which is mostly spaced-out because of all the drugs. This works for most of the film, especially in case of Lana, and makes the confrontational scenes even more haunting, because that is when things begin losing their haziness. I was not very impressed with the slow-motion sequence towards the end of the movie and would've opted for a quicker, more shocking end for Brandon.Boys Don't Cry is a great film whose director (and writer) Kimberly is genuinely interested in its subject (unlike the recent failing of Ms. Phyllida Lloyd) and knows how to get emotional response from her characters and get the audience closer to the character's own perceptions. It may be putting-off for many because of the subject matter, the rape scene and the pace, but anyone who is ready to give the film a chance will be mesmerized by the performances, the story, the characters and the direction.My Rating 8.6 out of 10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 April 2012","score":"","review":" Teena Brandon masquerades as a boy by stuffing a sock under her pants and flattening her breasts by binding them; she does this not because she considers herself a lesbian but because she cannot identify herself as a girl.

The tricks of 1933 may be easier to spot, but the more you look, the more you find to draw you in.There is the topsy-turvy emotional ride, of watching a gigantic beast inflict terrible carnage while finding yourself pulling for him. There is the sharp social commentary of civilization pushing its luck by imagining itself lord and master of what it doesn't understand. There's the meta-humor of the main human character, Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), who motivated not by greed or lust but a showman's pride, can't stop himself from pushing his luck, or that of others.Keep your chin up, he keeps telling the girl he brings along for a mysterious cruise, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). Before the show is over, her chin will be up alright - 102 stories up to be exact.Fay Wray would go down as one of filmdom's best screamers, but she's an even better writher, whether in a diaphanous gown or tied to a pair of posts. The horror sustains even better today than the sex appeal Scenes of Kong pulling off the limbs of captured sailors, or casually dropping a woman from a tall building, still retain their jaw-dropping power.Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack along with the main writer, Schoedsack's wife Ruth Rose, create a story that develops nicely, almost leisurely, and then bursts into a fast run once Denham makes landfall at Skull Island. At least that's how it's come to be known; no one calls it that in the movie. You get enough information to care about Denham despite his understandable reputation for recklessness, while Darrow's feisty charm and bravery presents us with a central character in such an economical fashion we hardly notice her being worked into the center of our notice.Then Kong enters the picture, and after that it's one big thrill scene after another, each seemingly starting before the last scene ends, all stitched together wonderfully by the perils of Ann and the way Kong, like Denham, takes a sudden, unnatural, but somehow heartening interest in her. If you are watching at home and plan on any bathroom breaks or food runs, you better not wait too long, or you won't find a spot to take your pause. The film moves so fast, and yet so assuredly, it's easy to forget how difficult it is to make it seem so natural.If there's one thing I'd change about this film, it's that the originally-cast Joel McCrea play the part of the first mate, Driscoll, instead of the game-but-dishwatery Bruce Cabot. Though to be fair to Cabot, he's got one heck of a romantic rival to play off of.Otherwise, Kong has everything you want A sonorous yet lush score by Max Steiner, set designs that recall the fantasy jungle-scapes of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard, a dazzling meshing of multiple special-effect types that become doubly impressive once we leave Skull Island for Manhattan. Watching this on Blu-Ray only makes the spectacle more outstanding Imagine being inside the cockpit of a biplane as it flies toward the Empire State Building, only now for the first time you notice the Chrysler Building reaching up at you nearly as fast.Is Kong a nostalgia trip, for those of us who want to imagine what it was like back when?

I remembered the movie tonight and got a hold of it. I think that had I watched the movie that young, ratings aside, I would probably have appreciated Rupert Graves' handsomeness more than the tale the movie was trying to tell me, so I'm glad I waited. The movie was horribly slow-paced at times. It could have used a rewrite and a tightening up of the script. However, the acting from everyone was wonderful and anyone else playing King George III might not have saved the movie from its script. I also felt moved by the predicament of having a nervous system condition that IMDb claims I'm misspelling when I'm not misspelling it in an age where modern medicine thinks that giving you boils will cure something and modern psychiatry is locking people (some of who aren't actually legitimately mentally ill) in an asylum.

No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal OK-kay? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. The Visitors begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI the Fat to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Valérie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. Only God can resurrect the dead, objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident.Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of The Visitors depends on a simple yet realistic promise any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in Back to the Future who was only thirty years too early he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel.The comparison with Back to the Future doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poiré doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture.And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Valérie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a César for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time.And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned La Grande Vadrouille in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine The Vistors set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse excessive sentimentalism like in Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis. I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's Ch'tis films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required.I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films.

William Mastrosimone's a good enough playwright but doesn't have a good grasp of screenplays.
