Everyone suspects that there's a stoolie in Barracks 4 passing information on to the Germans.

So the mystery revolves around who the stoolie actually is, and director Billy Wilder does a pretty good job of keeping us guessing. There's nothing that really gives it away until that mystery is finally revealed a little more than halfway through the movie with a rather devious question from Sefton (who's committed himself to finding out who the stoolie is) about Pearl Harbor, but the solution to one mystery leads to another - what are the POWs going to do with the real stoolie?This is a pretty decent movie.

Some see it as a generic Hollywood Sci-Fi\/Action film, a poorly acted and weakly scripted conversion of a popular, if controversial book. Others view as some sort of subtle satire on the US Military with some fascist overtones. I personally feel it's a mixture of both, and is without doubt Paul Verhoevens finest film (yes, even better than Total Recall). When I watch Starship Troopers, I get the feeling, more than with any other film, that the Studio Executive who green-lit it for a budget around $100,000,000, didn't know quite what he was getting himself into.The film tells the story of several young, impressionable students, who are members of a futuristic global society, drawn into a massive inter-planetary conflict in the 25th Century, against a species of giant insects known simply as 'the bugs' or 'the arachnids'.What you have here is a film that can be enjoyed purely as mindless popcorn entertainment, a piece of action-packed, blood-soaked, interstellar mayhem. This is achieved through the sheer scale of the battle scenes and the vast set-pieces. Every time I see the initial Klendathu drop-scene in this film, played out to Basil Pouledaris' epic score, it sends a shiver down my spine. The CGI in this movie is truly outstanding. Indeed, the effects still look impressive now, 12 years on. The aforementioned drop scene and the bug siege later in the film are both awesome to behold.You get the impression that a great deal of the money put into this film went on effects, and this also would help explain the group of B-list actors and actresses assembled to star in this movie. The only names who could really be considered 'familiar' are the excellent Michael Ironside, playing Lieutenant Radzcak, and the rather attractive Denise Richards (at the height of her fame). I often excused the sub-par acting, for the reason given above, but since watching the film a number of times, I now have an entirely different theory. The very reason this cast was selected is because they are 'adequate'. Take Casper Van Dien, appearing in his first, and to date, last true big-budget production. Van Dien is not a great actor. The scenes in which he speaks at times made me wince (partly because of the lines he is given), but you can't argue he is perfect as Johnny Rico, Squad Leader. He is a good looking guy. The same is true of Dina Meyer, she isn't a bad actress, but she is a beautiful woman. The same is true of all the other minor characters. They are not representative of the sort of diversity you would find if the Earth was ever to engage in an interstellar war. They are all young, very good looking, and intensely idealistic. If this were to occur for real, you would have poor people, ugly people, and convicted people. There is a scene where Rico, Carmen, and his best friend Carl are enrolling in the Military and they are speaking to a Veteran, who explains; Mobile infantry made me what I am today, before revealing he is missing an arm and both legs. Johnny Rico gives him an almost dismissive look, and this attitude is prevailant throughout the film. As yet more and more, able young people are mercilessly slaughtered by the bugs, they still carry on signing up believing it is for the greater good, when really the government is simply using them.The entire movie is really like a propaganda film for the military, complete with mindless media reels (a Verhoeven trademark, used in Robocop). Its ability to illustrate the impact media can have on a population during war is chilling. The bugs are completely demonised by the State News Network. Viewed only as the vicious, inherently evil creatures that they are, the more important point of the conflict is completely overlooked. This is the that the only reason the bugs sent the meteor to Buenos Aeries in the first place is because of human encroachment on their land. The attack was far from unprovoked.

Some see it as a generic Hollywood Sci-Fi\/Action film, a poorly acted and weakly scripted conversion of a popular, if controversial book. Others view as some sort of subtle satire on the US Military with some fascist overtones. I personally feel it's a mixture of both, and is without doubt Paul Verhoevens finest film (yes, even better than Total Recall). When I watch Starship Troopers, I get the feeling, more than with any other film, that the Studio Executive who green-lit it for a budget around $100,000,000, didn't know quite what he was getting himself into.The film tells the story of several young, impressionable students, who are members of a futuristic global society, drawn into a massive inter-planetary conflict in the 25th Century, against a species of giant insects known simply as 'the bugs' or 'the arachnids'.What you have here is a film that can be enjoyed purely as mindless popcorn entertainment, a piece of action-packed, blood-soaked, interstellar mayhem. This is achieved through the sheer scale of the battle scenes and the vast set-pieces. Every time I see the initial Klendathu drop-scene in this film, played out to Basil Pouledaris' epic score, it sends a shiver down my spine. The CGI in this movie is truly outstanding. Indeed, the effects still look impressive now, 12 years on. The aforementioned drop scene and the bug siege later in the film are both awesome to behold.You get the impression that a great deal of the money put into this film went on effects, and this also would help explain the group of B-list actors and actresses assembled to star in this movie. The only names who could really be considered 'familiar' are the excellent Michael Ironside, playing Lieutenant Radzcak, and the rather attractive Denise Richards (at the height of her fame). I often excused the sub-par acting, for the reason given above, but since watching the film a number of times, I now have an entirely different theory. The very reason this cast was selected is because they are 'adequate'. Take Casper Van Dien, appearing in his first, and to date, last true big-budget production. Van Dien is not a great actor. The scenes in which he speaks at times made me wince (partly because of the lines he is given), but you can't argue he is perfect as Johnny Rico, Squad Leader. He is a good looking guy. The same is true of Dina Meyer, she isn't a bad actress, but she is a beautiful woman. The same is true of all the other minor characters. They are not representative of the sort of diversity you would find if the Earth was ever to engage in an interstellar war. They are all young, very good looking, and intensely idealistic. If this were to occur for real, you would have poor people, ugly people, and convicted people. There is a scene where Rico, Carmen, and his best friend Carl are enrolling in the Military and they are speaking to a Veteran, who explains; Mobile infantry made me what I am today, before revealing he is missing an arm and both legs. Johnny Rico gives him an almost dismissive look, and this attitude is prevailant throughout the film. As yet more and more, able young people are mercilessly slaughtered by the bugs, they still carry on signing up believing it is for the greater good, when really the government is simply using them.The entire movie is really like a propaganda film for the military, complete with mindless media reels (a Verhoeven trademark, used in Robocop). Its ability to illustrate the impact media can have on a population during war is chilling. The bugs are completely demonised by the State News Network. Viewed only as the vicious, inherently evil creatures that they are, the more important point of the conflict is completely overlooked. This is the that the only reason the bugs sent the meteor to Buenos Aeries in the first place is because of human encroachment on their land. The attack was far from unprovoked.

Those who have read the book by Tom Wolfe, and those who have not. Some may know a little more about what the book is before seeing the movie, but in general at least the uninitiated have some idea. I read the book, and heard the backlash on the movie, and even began to read the book by Julie Salomon about the making of the movie, The Devil's Candy. It is a tremendous book, a razor-sharp satire and dark human tragic-comedy where everyone is unlikeable, and yet by a certain point the person who should be most unlikeable and unsympathetic, Sherman McCoy, the Wall-Street Bond Trader who is brought in on charges of reckless endangerment for his car running over a black honor student, ironically becomes a little more sympathetic (or just understandable and human, is perhaps the point).Seeing the movie with someone who hasn't read the book, however, is a valuable experience, and the friend I watched it with confirmed my own thoughts the movie isn't so terrible as to completely throw on the heap of directorial toxic-sludge (it doesn't come close to, say, Godard's King Lear as a cinematic cluster-f***), and some of the performances are actually good or at least decent- SOME being a key word here- but it's also confused and baffling, and not very funny most of the time. De Palma's inspiration in putting the characterizations forward was Dr. Strangelove, where characters are in a heightened reality and no one is really just a character but is larger-than-life. This was fine for Kubrick when taking his source material, which was quite serious as a Nuclear-war book, and making into a gaudy spectacle.De Palma should have asked himself something simple, which is why make something already so good into something else? Is The Bonfire of the Vanities, as a movie, a satire? Yes and no. Yes in that it takes on subjects like Wall Street bond traders and high society big shots and ne'er-do-wells and tabloid journalists and district attorneys (and assistant district attorneys) and an opportunistic reverend and gives them a skewering. It screams out YES, WE'RE SATIRE without going to an extreme like Spike Lee's Bamboozled did, though that's an apt comparison. But no in that De Palma, whether it was mostly himself second guessing in pre-production or by pressure of the studios, had to make things more 'likable' and 'sympathetic'. Mainstream was probably a key word between De Palma and the studio execs and people worried about such a controversial book as Wolfe's (one would like to think just the studio's fault but who knows the percentage of blame).And yet I would be lying if I said I thought it was a failure and totally horrible movie like so many other critics and viewers did. It's not, really. It's like an interesting fall on the face, and seeing the parts that are interesting get one through the running time. It's at least never boring; Tom Hanks, though just a few years shy young to play McCoy as written in the book, does have his moments where he gets to shine as an actor, and is even really funny a few times (my favorite scenes in the movie have him in it, one where he's interrogated by the detectives and bumbles it completely with the word 'routine', and the other when he unloads his twelve-gage rifle with total abandon around his bemused dinner guests, hilarious, perhaps, just seeing Hanks doing this). Other actors like Kim Cattral, (very sexy) Melanie Griffith, and Saul Rubinek do decently in supporting roles. F. Murray Abraham, for all of his over the top theatrics, actually gets perhaps most what De Palma's intention is with the material, and rolls with it (not to mention amazing bit parts for Andre Gregory and Richard Belzer).But the two big gaffs here, one of which a really huge one that brings the film down from interesting misfire to practical disaster, is the casting of the Judge and Peter Fallow. It's one thing to get a character totally wrong on paper, which does happen here, and it's another to cast it wrong. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, and has no real place here in the film. Even putting aside the intent of Wolfe with the Judge- that he was, by the way, and old Jewish man who, along with the D.A. Abe Weiss, meant to reflect the 'old guard' of judges from the Bronx- Freeman is given little to do except yell out like he's reprising the principal in Lean on Me, and give a totally ham-fisted, awfully written movie speech at the end. He does what he can with the material, but ultimately, for however few minutes he's on screen, it's a bust.And Peter Fallow. Holy hell this is a misfire on all counts. Watching Bruce Willis on screen one realizes the dark side of Hollywood, where casting a star for safety sake can completely backfire when it's not right. The writing by Michael Christofer doesn't do any favors, as the narration stinks mostly anyway, but Willis is a lump on screen, barely doing anything to make him interesting... and yet, unlike in the book, most egregiously, we're meant to side with him in some way, or find him kind of, you know, sympathetic in some way. The original choice for Peter Fallow- a sly, lackadaisical drunk- was John Cleese. The gulf between the two choices is wide enough to put a blue whale in. Even if everything else worked great in Bonfire of the Vanities, Willis, his acting and the character as a whole, would make the film flawed on its own. In other words What Were They Thinking?

This is the most gritty of them, has the best character development, the best shootout, the quintessential spaghetti western score, and is flat-out the most fun.It doesn't have Tuco running through the cemetery, but it has some astoundingly good scenes. For instance, the camera cutting back and forth between Van Cleef's eyes and the Wanted poster with intermittent gunshots heard; the duel for pride between Eastwood and Van Cleef; and, of course, the final showdown. This final showdown is hands-down the best of any Western. It's more interesting than GBU's because the characters mean more. The bad guy is a miserable wretch whose only comfort from his past is violence, Van Cleef's revenge motivation is far more compelling than Harmonica's in OUATITW, and Eastwood is just plain the most badass he's ever been. When Clint walks in with the watch playing the music, you just feel like standing up and applauding. Frankly, I find the duel in OUATITW rather underwhelming and I don't quite understand why some people call it the best ever. It's short, predictable, and nowhere close to this one.The ending is also very satisfying. It's sort of a happy ending, but not sappy because Clint is just way too badass driving away with all the bodies, on his way to becoming a super-rich badass.Overall, it's a close call with GBU, because I also love that movie for many reasons (and West isn't too shabby either). Now I don't want to be one of those guys complaining about a Leone movie being too long, and that's not what I'm doing, but FAFDM also has the advantage of being about 50 minutes shorter than GBU, and 30 shorter than West. This makes the movie more accessible and more practical to watch than the other 2. You can't really watch the other 2 without sort of planning beforehand, whereas with this one, you can watch it on a whim if your bored, without sacrificing 3 hours.Great movie -- the one I come back to again and again.

Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying everyone has a box which he put his personal things into. Also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great movies. There is a great twist in the end which I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long.

Katherine Hepburn is a hideously ugly beast, an annoying leading woman and her mouth belches out lines with a voice that would kill anything within earshot. How she is considered one of Hollywood's biggest star in this or any era is beyond me. Jimmy Stewart plays the redeeming character in this one, and it helps that at times he comes across as a rambling drunk. His drunkness is not as great as Doc Boone's from Stagecoach, but still notable.The actress who plays Dinah Lord, Virginia Weidler, is the hidden gem here. She appeared in 44 films over the course of her lifetime, but probably none you've ever seen (besides this one).

When the locals start getting axed, suspicions turn in one direction.This is probably one of William Castle's better known films, due mostly to the star power of Joan Crawford. Reviews at the time largely said the film was a failure, but Crawford's acting was superb. I'm not really convinced of that. I enjoyed the film, even with the cheesy fake heads that fall off with no blood. I didn't really care for Crawford. I guess maybe it's because she played her role of a nutcase well, but she was more irritating than anything.This film is considered part of the hagsploitation subgenre... popular in the 1960s after What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Some trace this trend to Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard. I'm not sure. I clearly see this film being in the trend of crazy old woman kills... and probably one of the better ones. If we have to give Crawford credit for anything, it's making a career out of a very unique subgenre.The gimmickry of William Castle is muted, which is unfortunate -- his influence is one of my favorite parts of the films. They handed out cardboard axes at the theater, but modern viewers don't get this luxury and Castle doesn't do one of his classic cigar-smoking introductions. I suppose we can be thankful the story was written by Robert Bloch. Rather than ripping off Psycho like he did with Homicidal, Castle went out and got the actual writer to work with.While not as enjoyable as Zotz or Mr. Sardonicus, with William Castle you can really do no wrong.

You might say that everybody loves The Godfather. However, I disagree. It's been 38 years since The Godfather was released in theaters. Although everybody has heard of it, and holds it in high regards, I think that the reason why people enjoy the film is not because of its artistic merits, but its themes and pop culture phenomenon. I also believe that this type of film-making has been lost. Every component of the film holds together well. Each individual aspect of it is finely tuned, and it is seamed together to as close to perfection as the medium allows, as far as we know it. However, it is not the sum of its parts that makes film or art, whatever medium it may be, great. It is not a group full of musicians that makes a record great. It is not great technical and artistic style that makes a painting great. It is not great dialogue, coupled with a good story that makes a novel great. I believe that when these components of an artistic medium are in harmony, it helps to allow for art to form. The Godfather has all of these components in spades and also becomes art.The post WWII atmosphere, set in the midst of Italian crime organizations is engraved into the film. The colors are brown, gold and black, perfectly matching the antique tone. The acting is exceptional, with some performances by young actors that acted as a stepping stone for their careers. The music, while used sparingly, comes in and out at just the right times, and matches the mood of the film well.The camera angles, cinematography and editing are why I used the term near- perfect. There are certain scenes in this film that are simply the best in all of film-making. One of the final scenes, interlaced with a baptism, is an amazing example of using the medium of film-making and its techniques such as editing and directing to inspire emotion and create art. Another scene, which simply just involves one person against a black background, and a single light source above them, is in my opinion one of the best shots of all time, not just in film-making, but photography as well. The Godfather's greatest feat is not that it is a cultural phenomenon. It is, by all definitions, art. You might call expression and aesthetic values by themselves art, but ultimately it is pieces like The Godfather that inspires artists. There is a reason as to why half of this review is talking about art and not The Godfather. The film deserves to be seen, regardless of what you all ready know or what you think you might know about it. Regardless of its theme and setting, the work that the men and women did during the production of this film and its final form deserve to be recognized. This style of film-making is far and few between nowadays, and if you enjoy cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.

The set decorations were well done and the film for the most part seamlessly blended physical sets with the GGI locations. The actors all did a fine job. I fail to understand why so many dislike this film.The story, while familiar to many, was still suspenseful and moved at a good pace. It's not an action film and so those expecting non-stop action may be disappointed. Still there is action and great special effects. Time travel is such an interesting concept and is something that most people have day dreamed about at one time or another. I'm sure there are things we all wish we could go back and change. The Morlock's are great and terrifying enemies.Of course there are some nitpicks to be had. Will people still be speaking English 800,000 years from now? Unlikely! Could a computer still be running and functioning 800,000 years from now? I can't imagine how!!! Finally, given the way the geography changed over 800,000 years, which was well visualized by CGI effects, is it likely that the Time Machine would not emerge buried underground or underwater? I didn't find it at all credible that the Time Machine, which does not move physically but only through time, would materialize on the surface after so many millennia.Still, this movie tells a good story and IMO is well worth watching. It may be a little scary for children under ten but in general is a good family film.
