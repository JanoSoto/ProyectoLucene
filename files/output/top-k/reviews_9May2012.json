They're not always as gruesome as the horror genre movies but the point is to create high tension. Unfortunately I barely felt any tension between scenes in this film. And that's only one part that could have been improved.To start off, Sylvester Stallone plays Deke DaSilva, a discharged soldier of the U.S. army who now is a cop in New York City. DaSilva cares about the safety of the innocent, yet he's too weak to pull a trigger on a villain. Why? He's nervous that he'll cause collateral damage. Well DaSilva, since you were apart of the army at one point, you should know then, that friendly fire isn't uncommon. Partnered up with Stallone is Billy Dee Williams or as everyone else knows him as, Lando Calrissian, plays a character called Matthew Fox. Both actors play their parts but I don't see any personal connection to them. Are they old pals? Or do they just work together really well? As for the antagonist of the plot, making a thriller requires one who has no conscious, and Rutger Hauer shows that perfectly. Hauer plays an international terrorist named Wulfgar and once the viewer sees how he acts, they will understand how he has no remorse. Wulfgar is a real jerk and he will make the audience hope that he dies a painful death. Thankfully, he does but I won't say how...obviously.The execution of the story, I wasn't pleased with. I know it can take time to build tension but look at The Mean Season (1985), no more than twenty minutes into the film, tensions begin to rise. It took almost half the film before Fox and DaSilva FINALLY run into Wulfgar. What's happening before this? Wulfgar is bombing other places in Europe, while DaSilva and Fox are busy learning in a class that teaches them how to fight terrorists. Seriously, how much slower could this thriller go? Maybe if Wulgar somehow slipped into the police station and started making a ruckus, then that would create some nice tension. But director Bruce Malmuth felt that featuring what's happening on two opposite ends of the world can create tension. How does that make any sense? When the movie approaches its second half, the audience will finally get to see SOME interesting scenes. Some parts, I'll admit, I've never seen happen in other films before but there weren't too many. For example, at one point, there was a long chase scene and it seemed to go on forever. The last thing I really could not grasp was the background music. Keith Emerson provides the music to this film and it lacks a lot of importance. It sounded more like it belonged to action scenes from the Television series of The A-Team. Music is supposed to help create feelings and I didn't feel anything.Paul Sylbert's story doesn't seem to make an effective transition onto the big screen. A callous music record, and slow moving scenes can make this thriller not very thrilling at all.

It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narratesThere's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crimeThere's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story.

Its follow up however has returned to a more formulaic Bond, not short of the regular constituents like gadgets, cars, stunts and thrills but neither Pierce Brosnan nor director Roger Spottiswoode have driven an elevation of James Bond to new heights, just as 'Goldeneye' did. The opening sequence for instance, which sets the tone for any Bond film, was not as groundbreaking as its predecessor. Dare I say I felt the two seemed quite similar. The ideas behind the film weren't at all bad, they just weren't exercised to potential. The patchiness though of the movie was its principal drawback, it was far from the most invigorating Bond story at the best of times although the premise behind it was reasonably original and Bond-worthy.Again, Pierce Brosnan shows why his perception of Bond is one of the best. Compared to his first shot at the coveted title, he was more cheeky, never without a cynical and sly comment and a touch more lighthearted. He retained the swagger and brashness as well as an admirable slickness. But then again, we've seen that all before, whether from him or even Sean Connery. All the same, even if he didn't add a great deal from Bond's last outing in 'Goldeneye', he has still made the James Bond persona his own.A Bond villain needs to be intimidating whether in demeanour or personality and Jonathon Pryce just did not fit the profile. He was very unthreatening on screen, a commercial villain in every sense of the world. But that's not to say his performance as Elliot Carver was poor. On the contrary, he performed exactly the role that was scripted, albeit the fact that his character was not formulated well. James Bond is not the only one who keeps eyes glued to the screen. The notorious Bond girls have the same responsibility although they probably wouldn't have been overly successful this time being bland, uninteresting and devoid of any really useful part. Being stunningly attractive was not the modus operandi for the casting directors it seems.

It seems to have fallen somewhat out of fashion in the subsequent years. I think the reason for this is simply that the ideas Jacob's Ladder played around with were very new at the time of release and have subsequently become old hat as many films have expanded upon them in the years that followed. But I think it's important to remember that this movie had a lot of originality about it when released. Apparently it didn't do all that well at the cinema and was a bit of a sleeper; it seems that it might even have been a little ahead of its time.It tells the story of a man called Jacob who is bayoneted while on service in Vietnam. We pick up his story when he is back in New York. But this is an NYC of demons and lizard-like monsters just below the surface. Jacob is then made aware that something terrible happened that fateful night in 'Nam.Once you know the secrets of Jacob's Ladder it becomes clear why the New York City of this film just feels so wrong. The fact that there is never any sense of time having moved forward is clear once you know what is actually happening. There is always a sense of strangeness about this world, a place replete with biblical references. True horror always seems to be just below the surface. When Jacob ends up in hospital, he is taken through a mental ward that is a surrealist nightmare of deformed monsters. This is a truly inspired sequence of the macabre. The film never truly matches this moment at any other point but that's not to say that there is no other striking imagery; there's a reptilian sex scene at a party, ghostly beings in passing cars and trains and a nurse with a demonic horn.It may not seem as ground breaking as it once was but Jacob's Ladder remains an imaginative dark fantasy.

The movie was made in 1999 when all the teen comedies like American Pie came out and goes by the same formula of a light, crude, silly comedy. My problem with this movie is that I really dislike the overacting. I don't blame it on the actors themselves, they are just doing what they were told to, but it kills the fun for me.

I won't say exactly what happened because I don't want to spoil the fun for the ones who didn't see it yet. Many famous faces in this movie. It is kind of sad to see Edward Furlong nowadays knowing that this was his last decent movie and he became a B action\/horror movie actor after. Too bad, he had so much potential and was great in American History X. A part of me wonders if this movie ruined it for him. It was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey in it.

This is in fact untrue. 'Forever' premiered in London on 30 December; it did not go on general release until the following day when it went on to outperform every other film in Britain in 1972. But I digress; the seventh 007 epic saw a brief return to the role for Sean Connery, who'd vacated Bond's shoes for 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ), now ( rightly ) regarded as one of the all-time great Bond films, but at the time it was deemed to have been a failure. David Picker, head of United Artists, lured the recalcitrant actor back with the offer of a huge pay cheque and the promise of funding for three movies of his choice. The new decade saw a change in style for the Bond movies. The 60's ones were tongue-in-cheek but mock-serious. The only one to adopt a lighter tone was 'Goldfinger' ( 1964 ). It was to recapture that tone that producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman brought back director Guy Hamilton. This is no more apparent than in the scene in Slumber's Funeral Parlour - 'Morton Slumber' ( the late David Bauer ) could have wandered out of an episode of 'The Avengers'. The Fleming novel had Bond going undercover ( impersonating one 'Peter Franks', whom British Intelligence have captured ) to infiltrate a gang of diamond smugglers, one of whom is the beautiful 'Tiffany Case'. Much action is centred around Las Vegas. Tom Mankiewicz and Richard Maibaum's script retained the early part of the novel, but then deviated from it with 'Ernst Stavro Blofeld' ( Charles Gray ) yet again planning to hold the world to ransom, this time with a laser-satellite ( full of diamonds ) orbiting the Earth.Connery gives one of his best performances as Bond, certainly better than the one he gave in 'You Only Live Twice' in which he was virtually on auto-pilot throughout. No wonder audiences cheered when he once again said that famous line  My name is Bond...James Bond!. Charles Gray makes for an elegantly caddish 'Blofeld', delivering wry quips through cigarette smoke like an evil Noel Coward. Before anyone says 'Blofeld should not be British!', look at it this way - would not a man on the run from the intelligence services try to throw them off the scent in some imaginative way? Pretending to be another nationality makes perfect sense. The pre-credits sequence has Bond hunting the world for Blofeld ( presumably to get revenge for wife Tracy's death, its never made clear ). In South America, he finds him experimenting with clones. After a fight, Blofeld is sent hurtling face-first into a mud pool, but of course, it isn't really him. Maurice Binder's title sequence kicks in to the welcome return of Shirley Bassey's vocals.'Forever' features Bond's first gay characters ( not counting 'Rosa Klebb' ) in the shape of killers 'Mr.Kidd' ( Putter Smith ) and 'Mr.Wint' ( Bruce Glover ), while 'Tiffany' ( the stunning Jill St.John ) is far more brash than previous Bond girls. Lana Wood shines briefly as the ill-fated 'Plenty O'Toole'. Those who dismiss the Roger Moore era for its wacky humour need to realise that the trend towards self parody in fact began here. The action sequences are a mixed bag; the fight in the lift between Bond and Peter Franks ( Joe Robinson ) is one of the very best to grace a 007 film, ditto the bruising encounter with 'Bambi' ( Lola Larson ) and 'Thumper' ( Trina Parks ), the moon buggy chase and Les Vegas car chase stunning ( remember Bond's car being driven on two wheels? ), but best of all is the scene where Bond ascends the Whyte House to break into reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte ( Jimmy Dean )'s sumptuous apartment. Some gorgeous sets by Ken Adam here. John Barry's score is one of his best ( my favourite track is '007 & Counting', heard as Blofeld's satellite goes about the globe causing havoc ).

But I digress; the seventh 007 epic saw a brief return to the role for Sean Connery, who'd vacated Bond's shoes for 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ), now ( rightly ) regarded as one of the all-time great Bond films, but at the time it was deemed to have been a failure. David Picker, head of United Artists, lured the recalcitrant actor back with the offer of a huge pay cheque and the promise of funding for three movies of his choice. The new decade saw a change in style for the Bond movies. The 60's ones were tongue-in-cheek but mock-serious. The only one to adopt a lighter tone was 'Goldfinger' ( 1964 ). It was to recapture that tone that producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman brought back director Guy Hamilton. This is no more apparent than in the scene in Slumber's Funeral Parlour - 'Morton Slumber' ( the late David Bauer ) could have wandered out of an episode of 'The Avengers'. The Fleming novel had Bond going undercover ( impersonating one 'Peter Franks', whom British Intelligence have captured ) to infiltrate a gang of diamond smugglers, one of whom is the beautiful 'Tiffany Case'. Much action is centred around Las Vegas.

No wonder audiences cheered when he once again said that famous line  My name is Bond...James Bond!. Charles Gray makes for an elegantly caddish 'Blofeld', delivering wry quips through cigarette smoke like an evil Noel Coward. Before anyone says 'Blofeld should not be British!', look at it this way - would not a man on the run from the intelligence services try to throw them off the scent in some imaginative way? Pretending to be another nationality makes perfect sense. The pre-credits sequence has Bond hunting the world for Blofeld ( presumably to get revenge for wife Tracy's death, its never made clear ). In South America, he finds him experimenting with clones. After a fight, Blofeld is sent hurtling face-first into a mud pool, but of course, it isn't really him. Maurice Binder's title sequence kicks in to the welcome return of Shirley Bassey's vocals.'Forever' features Bond's first gay characters ( not counting 'Rosa Klebb' ) in the shape of killers 'Mr.Kidd' ( Putter Smith ) and 'Mr.Wint' ( Bruce Glover ), while 'Tiffany' ( the stunning Jill St.John ) is far more brash than previous Bond girls. Lana Wood shines briefly as the ill-fated 'Plenty O'Toole'. Those who dismiss the Roger Moore era for its wacky humour need to realise that the trend towards self parody in fact began here. The action sequences are a mixed bag; the fight in the lift between Bond and Peter Franks ( Joe Robinson ) is one of the very best to grace a 007 film, ditto the bruising encounter with 'Bambi' ( Lola Larson ) and 'Thumper' ( Trina Parks ), the moon buggy chase and Les Vegas car chase stunning ( remember Bond's car being driven on two wheels? ), but best of all is the scene where Bond ascends the Whyte House to break into reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte ( Jimmy Dean )'s sumptuous apartment. Some gorgeous sets by Ken Adam here. John Barry's score is one of his best ( my favourite track is '007 & Counting', heard as Blofeld's satellite goes about the globe causing havoc ).

Father LaForgue is assigned to a distant Huron mission accompanied by a young quasi-believing assistant and a family of Algonquin Indians. The group faces challenges beyond the harsh realities of the river trek itself, including an attack by hostile Iroquois. Of course the Indians question the strange ways of the priest and his dark attire and wonder whether he is a demon. Instead of addressing him as Father they simply call him Black Robe. I've viewed Black Robe three times now and it never fails to capture my attention from beginning to end (the film runs 101 minutes), which is why I don't get the criticism that it's somehow unabsorbing. What strikes me most is the raw realism. Viewing Black Robe is the next best thing to going back in time and viewing the events firsthand.Other highlights include Lothaire Bluteau's solid performance as the missionary priest; LaForgue's assistant, well played by Aden Young, and his developing love for the daughter of the Algonquin leader, played by the beautiful Sandrine Holt; the Algonquins themselves, particular the patriarch; the freaky midget shaman of a band of Montagnais natives; the harrowing events at an Iroquois fort; the subtext on the truth or falsity of spiritual beliefs, both of the Jesuits and the Indians; and the spectacular cinematography of the Quebec wilderness (mostly the Saint Lawrence River, filmed on location). The film successfully shows the desolate, untamed nature of the NE before the mass encroachment of Europeans.Some may wonder How does it compare to Last of the Mohicans or Dances with Wolves, two contemporary films also featuring realistic portrayals of AmerIndians? Of the two, Black Robe is closer to Last of the Mohicans since the story takes place in the East and there aren't any cowboys & Indians, although the story takes place well over a century earlier. The film differs from both in that there aren't really any Hollywood contrivances, including conventional movie plotting. As great and generally believable as those other films are, Black Robe shows the harsher, bleaker reality, which some may translate as boring.However, as raw and realistic as Black Robe is, it could've been more so, considering that it fails to show one disturbing reality of Eastern AmerIndian culture, as detailed in Moore's book (pointed out by another reviewer) The film avoids depicting the native practice of ritual cannibalism on a dead infant, a custom that was common among the tribes of the Eastern woodlands. To consume an enemy's flesh was to absorb his power. The heart of an especially courageous foe (such as Jesuit martyr St. Jean Brebeuf) would be eaten by tribal leaders. But, don't get me wrong here, I'm kind of glad the movie left this aspect out.Black Robe has the same vibe as 2007's Mongol The Rise of Genghis Khan, so if you appreciate that style of raw-realism you'll likely value Black Robe.

Presumably, the financial success of recent genetic thrillers such as Jurassic Park and Species prompted producer Edward R. Pressmen to reanimate H.G. Wells' literary classic for its third rendition. Ironically, this deeply flawed but imaginatively updated version suffers a fate similar to that of the genetic mutants created by the titular villain on his remote island.The movie opens on three plane crash survivors who have been adrift in the Java Sea for days. Two of them are killed by a shark leaving our hero, Edward Douglas (David Thewlis of Naked), a United Nations peace negotiator. Douglas awakens to the sight of a sailing vessel hovering over him. He collapses from exhaustion and reawakens to find Montgomery (Val Kilmer of Tombstone) attending him. Douglas is too weak to do anything more than swoon. Eventually, the ship deposits them at an exotic island where the research center of Dr. Moreau is located. Montgomery persuades Douglas to join him, on the basis that they have a telecommunications system on the island that Douglas can use to contact the UN. As we soon learn, however, Montgomery is lying. The island is actually the home and refuge of Dr. Moreau, a brilliant geneticist who was forced into seclusion due to his controversial experiments on animals. Moreau has learned how to transform common animals into human beings, or almost human beings. Douglas finds himself trapped on the island, surrounded by Moreau's beastly creations. He tries to escape several times to no avail. First, he stumbles in on an ungodly birth scene, then finds himself in a half-man, half-animal zoo at an abandoned military airfield. Finally, Douglas meets Moreau. They argue about which way the scales of morality should tilt and dredge up Biblical passages to support their arguments. Moreau tries to explain how his experiments will help mankind. He reveals that he has discovered that the devil is a collection of genes. Moreau means to sort out those bad genes and produce an ideal human. He is even willing to accept a failure or two along the road to success, which accounts for the vast number of beast-men. Moreau keeps these ugly creatures under his thumb by means of implants which he uses to shock them into paralysis. Meanwhile, Montgomery keeps the creatures dazed and confused with narcotics.The inventive but predictable Richard Stanley & Ron Hutchinson screenplay updates the 1896 Wells novel and does a good job of establishing the action in the 1990s. The opening 40 minutes introduces audiences to everyone and everything they need to know about the plot. Sadly, the script packs no surprises. If you cannot figure out what's going to happen from one moment to the next in the film then you must be on horse tranquilizers. Suffice it to say, Moreau doesn't qualify as a date movie, (unless you never want to see your date again). Some of the gruesome looking creatures may even go on to inhabit the island of your dreams. Stan Winston's creature designs are impressive. His mutants look as convincing as mutants could possibly look. Sometimes, they are even nauseating. Typically, they retain the basic shape of the animal from which they were mutated so they have a beastly looking head, hands and feet, while the rest of them is hidden beneath their apparel to conserve on costs. The first grisly glimpse that Douglas gets is a multi-breasted beast mother siring an E.T. infant. The other animals are a hideous collection of mutants with claw hands and snaggled teeth. They gallery of beast men and women appears twice as grisly, gyrating their horrid bodies as Montgomery peddles narcotics to kill them happy. Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of Mutiny on the Bounty. He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's Northern Exposure. A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain.The Island of Dr. Moreau ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of Moreau can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

Marlon Brando treats moviegoers to another of his characteristically peculiar performances. There is nothing ordinary about Brando's brilliant but eccentric Dr. Moreau. Brando stages a dramatic entrance, swathed in white garments under a pagoda-style hat, resembling a Japanese Kabuki actor in sunglasses. He tolerates the steamy island heat and wears chalky make-up to preserve his delicate skin from the sun. Metaphorically, this sun allergy relates somehow to Moreau's moral infamy; he cannot stand up to the light of morality. He appears like the great white hope in the camp of the beast men. Brando adopts the same sissified voice that he used for his Fletcher Christian in the 1962 version of Mutiny on the Bounty. He also never appears twice in the same wardrobe. One scene finds him garbed like a nocturnal fridge raider while in another scene he appears bundled up like an Arab sultan. Audiences are meant to identify with the David Thewlis' narrator. Incidentally, Thewlis replaced Rob Morrow of CBS-TV's Northern Exposure. A similar air of mystery clouds Val Kilmer's Montgomery. Montgomery gravitates between moments of extreme clarity and apathetic zombie like drug dazes. Either the script is purposefully vague or (more realistically) the editors sheared Kilmer's performance to reduce the film's running time to 90 minutes so they could squeeze in more showings and parlay a quick profit. Ultimately, Montgomery assumes a Luifer-like character in his apparent rivalry with Moreau. Again, the script doesn't clarify this part of the story. Is Montgomery Moreau's rival? We never know for certain.The Island of Dr. Moreau ranks as an ambitious but flawed horror fantasy. Anybody who relishes Frankenheimer's version of Moreau can hope that someday New Line Cinema will release a director's cut that restores the lost parts of the film. This well-made but routine concludes with Douglas moralizing about how Moreau's island serves as a microcosm of the world and that we must all go in fear of man's unstable nature. The only thing that audiences can really go in fear of is the sequel that might lie over the horizon.

I do not understand how good actors like GH can lend themselves to such nonsense. HG was still relatively young and might have needed the money at this stage. And to see Sarah J P act - how on earth would anybody hire here after this - but we know they did. Woody Allen was almost right when he said that in Hollywood they don't throw their garbage away.

This could have made for an epic ending to a franchise which has won the hearts and admiration of many. It is impressed upon you that this was the film Sylvester Stallone has been building towards, where Rocky Balboa seemingly 'achieves the impossible'. His opponent, Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago is his most fearsome yet, made of steel like Mr T's Clubber Lang but a towering beast of a man, whose actions do much of the talking. Lundgren came across as authentic and true to the persona, Rocky's most formidable opponent and definitely his most notable after Apollo Creed. He made you believe that his brute force could kill.Tragedy and hardship is very much a recurring theme through the series and it returns to possess Rocky who Stallone portrays with a consistent progression but retaining the traits that made him the warm human being from the original 'Rocky'. This time through, tragedy and hardship drives Rocky even further. His 'training scenes' are a hallmark of Rocky movies but rather than watching him run up steps followed by hundreds of admirers, or working up a sweat in the gym, we see him alone, trudging through snow, climbing steep mountains and chopping wood in vicious conditions whilst his opponent trains with superior technology, comfort and assistance. What makes it so unforgettable is how true it is to Rocky's spirit and drive to 'go the distance', even more than running up 1000 steps or doing 1000 push ups, as well as depictive of the inspirational take away from the films. Much has been made of the political propaganda within the movie but it fails to sway Rocky. Ultimately, it doesn't take over the film as much as provide a fitting backdrop and concludes in a manner true to Rocky.Stallone is, as always, supported by the stellar talents of Talia Shire, Burt Young and Carl Weathers whilst even the Russian contingent led by Brigitte Nielson and Michael Pataki are extremely believable. The question on everyone's lips is, does it beat the original? I would say that they are two different films at two different junctures, the first created a revered character whilst this one fulfilled him.
