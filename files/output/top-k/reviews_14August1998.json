Saving Private Ryan, in all its brutal realism, should  make people think twice before saying something like that so nonchalantly.   Because the fact is, people go into battles and get their limbs blown off,  get shot five times in the chest, or, worst of all, get hit where they don't  die immediately and then just have to lie there, whimpering that they're  going to die.  People who haven't been in war can say it's terrible but if  you're called, it's your duty; but I imagine that most people who have  experienced war will only tell you that it's terrible.

For months, I argued that while Titanic  was a nice spectacle with great special effects, the script, the directing  and the acting was all rather mediocre. However, here we have L.A.  Confidential. Perfection in script. Perfection in directing. Perfection in  cast. Obviously, because Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all  gave Oscar worthy performances, the voting was split, and therefore, none  got enough votes for a nomination.    Crowe gave an invigorating performance and Bud White, a man who knows  that he is not very smart and has instead relied on pure brawn all his  life. But as the film progresses, you watch him yearn to put his strength  aside and become self-reliant, instead of being purely muscle for the cause  of justice, which has become obscured as he has had to resort to violent  and debatably immoral method to preserve peace in Los Angeles. And yet,  while he does make us question whether he is going to end up on the side of  good or evil by the end of the film uncertain, we do empathize enough with  him to hope that he does redeem himself by the end.    Pearce delivers Ed Exley as a man who is wholly set on the purest means  of justice. While he follows his father into the same profession, his goals  are unique; to uphold the law without having to bend or break it. And yet,  his good aspiration are certainly out of place in the corrupt organization  of the police of that time. He slowly becomes drawn into the graft. He  becomes glory-hungry, pulling whatever strings he has to in order to be  promoted or be seen in a good light by the press. And yet, he does begin to  find himself giving into exactly the cause he fought against. And so,  throughout the film, he struggles to overcome the instinctive nature of man  to achieve power and glory. He has to be a better man than that. And so,  the audience can quickly see the nobility in that. He is not perfect. But  at least he tries to be.   And probably the best performance in the film comes from Spacey. Here we  see what Exley might have become in a few years if he wasn't careful.  Jack  Vincennes has succumb to the call of money and celebrity status. He does  not care in the least about duty or about justice. It's all become simply a  matter of vanity. And yet, he begins to see through his own fault. Spacey's  performance is undoubtable the best, because he is one of those actors who  doesn't have to try to communicate his emotions in order to communicate  them (or, at least, he is good enough not to show the strings). I had to  watch this film several times to really take in the impact of his role, and  fully absorb his character. His key moments within the middle of the film  are absolutely unforgettable. When he stares into the mirror of the bar  after receiving the hundred dollar bill, that scene is a turning point for  the character. And he was able to convey the message of that scene without  saying a thing. And also, when asked why he became a cop, the delivery of  that next line, just that, was Oscar worthy on its own.   Even aside from those three performances, it would have been totally  respectable if James Cromwell or Danny DeVito  had received a nomination.

I can now rest assured.   This film is mediocre no matter when you watch it.  Strip away the hype  surrounding this exercise in hype generation and you have basic,  unchallenging fare.  And it's a shame because Barry Levinson has so much to  work with.  He even announces, through Robert DeNiro's character, his  sources early in the movie Reagan's attack of Grenada, the secrecy  surrounding the Gulf War, the symbolism without substance surrounding the  images of Iwo Jima, Vietnam and Latin America.  With heightened technology,  our world is more abstract.  We have very little tactile connection with  global events amid the talk of a smaller world.  However, this abstraction  is hardly new.  Theater has always presented the foreign in a tactile,  believable, but frequently misleading way.  Before television and even mass  printing methods, many people were insulated to their own villages, ripe to  believe that the world was flat, Jews had horns, and everyone else were barbaric buffoons.  Our myths are essential  in shaping our world and ourselves.With such an intimate issue, how could Barry Levinson go wrong? Perhaps his  producer Robert Evans mirrored the Dustin Hoffman creation in his weaselly  persona exuding a detached nonchalance while demanding ultimate control.  Either too many cooks were watering down  the broth or an inexperienced chef was given the ladle.

The President needs a popularity boost in time for re -election day after allegations surface regarding his private shenanigans  with an underage Firefly Girl.  Needing to respond quickly, the president's  closest advisors (Anne Heche, Andrea Martin and others) employ the services of strategist Conrad Brean (DeNiro), who calls  on a higher power in Hollywood producer and general superman Stanley Motss  (Hoffman).  They concoct and film scenes from a fictitious war in Albania,  and push America's collective buttons by evoking patriotism, resolve,  bravery and all things presidential.  To bolster the war effort, their  friend Johnny Green (Willie Nelson) writes and records a generically  patriotic war anthem and convicted felon Willie Schumann (Woody Harrelson) is recruited to pose as the P.O.W. left behind. A faceless populace provides  massive support for the war effort and for Schumann's rescue mission.  The joke here is that Hollywood is ultimately controlling America.  That's  why politicians frequently exhort filmmakers to clean up their act for the  children's sake.  Less than half of eligible American citizens vote in the  presidential race, but nearly everyone goes to the movies.  Movies dominate  our culture and shape public discourse.  Problem is, the joke's inaccurate  and not even that funny.  Democracy still reigns, as diluted and imperfect  as it is.  If you don't get enough popular support or make enough money,  you can't attain gain acceptance in  Washington or Hollywood, respectively.   Americans may be gullible and occasionally downright stupid, but we always  question authority.  Levinson apparently believes that no one would bring  up conspiracy theories (in this scenario, the conspiracy buffs would be  drooling), no one would contact anyone in Albania or Canada to verify facts,  no one would leak any information, no reporter would probe deeper for the full story and no one  would grow impatient with this spin team's stalling.

It was truly a new twist on  the series, although I wouldn't qualify AR as a REAL episode in the Alien  series but rather a new begining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a great job in  bringing his fantastic style to Hollywood. The creatures were cool and  scary although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the  horrific Newborn which was truly demonic. Anyway, despite it's flaws, it's  still a great film, although it will never be a classic like Alien and  Aliens are. Now if only there could be a fifth one with a better script,  more character development and more firepower.

I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember  this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went  to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my  friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it  to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real  interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe  Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and  everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you.   I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that  much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say  it is an obsession. A sick obsession.   The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the  shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we  care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close,  but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so  effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting  score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping  suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other  movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing.   And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not  top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is  that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs,  and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you  think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to  kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water?  I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't.   And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100  greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for  that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine.   Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you.

Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings  strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score.  Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as  well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD ! ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"}]
