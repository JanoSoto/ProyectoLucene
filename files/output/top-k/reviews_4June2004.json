I was shocked by the first few minutes where Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser) gets beaten up and such. I decided not to watch it at night time as I usually do with movies. The whole movie is shocking, with lots of swearing, drugs, alcohol... (and smoking, but I smoke so I am not complaining about that) But I think it's well played by Vincent Kartheiser and that girl, and I've seen better of James Woods and Melanie Griffith. It's a surprising movie. and well, I'm going to see it again! Sure, the camera work looks like it's done by an amateur... But it has a great story and nice environment.
