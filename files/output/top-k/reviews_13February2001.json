[{"date":"13 February 2001","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Normally my instinct-- on the few occasions I am exposed to utter tripe-- is to walk away without complaining. Let others see the film and make up their own minds.  Who knows, some might even like it.  Chacun a son gout.But this waste product is so puffed in its own conceit it begs me to comment.  It is the worst movie\/DVD experience of my life.  I was trapped by company or I would have walked out-- of my own house!  It purports to be a comedy.  It is not funny.  It purports to be a commentary on the turmoil of Northern Ireland.  It is nothing more than the typical cheapjack cynicism the British pass off as political insight.  It purports to star David Thewlis.  Unfortunately it does. The premise of this movie is so painfully weak that it falls apart like wet toilet paper even to describe it.  Let us just say that someone with a high school equivalency degree will guess the significance of the phrase divorcing jack long before the Thewlis character does-- and that the tedium of waiting for Thewlis's character to catch up is not enlivened by a succession of ridiculous characters such as the nun imposter (oh, haha, heehee), the unbelievable Boston Globe reporter or the overdrawn IRA gunman (Jason Isaacs, who should choose his roles better.) What really keynotes this as a bad movie for me is that the discovery of what the Big Secret is, the rationale behind all these deaths, takes place OFF SCREEN-- and then someone has to sit down in another scene and painfully tell Thewlis all about it. An anticlimax to an anticlimax, and so typical of the incompetence of this director!

Now I like brainless high school flicks as much as the next person, perhaps more, but the trailer for this movie just didn't do it for me.  However, I ended up seeing this with a friend because it was the last movie playing and we really didn't want to go home.  It was actually fairly decent.  I'm not saying it was great or even good, but it sneaked in as passable.  The acting is fairly decent and the script treated some issues that normally would be glossed over with respect.  If you like this genre of movie, it's worth a rental or maybe a matinee.
