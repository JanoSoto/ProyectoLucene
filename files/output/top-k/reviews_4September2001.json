I suppose I should have known better than to expect more from this film. Perhaps 'Rush Hour 3' could be all out-takes with the last few minutes containing the plot, if it pans out long enough.At least, like 'Jurassic Park 3', it's bound to be better than '2'.

My brother and I had real fun watching it. Fun of how horrible dialog, acting, plot were. Michael Madsen's character was the most laughable along with Mykelti Williamson's . Their lines, f*** words were so stupid that you simply couldn't not to laugh. Some lines reminded me of Alien Resurrection's Ron Perlman (few lines were just awful, though acting and the movie were just superb unlike the one we talk about now). After all, Michael Madsen couldn't resist playing leading role in big studio movie. Overall acting was as if I were watching some video game FMV intros. Well, don't blame the actors - blame the screenwriters. When dialog is horrible, I guess you can't make some scene out of it. Maybe it was the question of money for most actors who reprised original characters from the first movie. The concept of killing Species by spraying some human diseases cells is rather stupid I'd say. Also supposed bursting of women's stomachs who gave birth to little species strangely resembled accurate opening of the Aliens' eggs. I don't get it, why does astronaut woman have sex with his boyfriend dressed like 18th century maid after 10 months in space? And there are loads of funny stupidities in the movie that won't make you yawn. I think the movie even with such poor plot could be much better if the whole tone was darker and scarier, without unnecessary lame humor. There is certainly more facts about Species' life cycle which supposedly would set Species universe and make franchise popular (as Aliens, Predator). That will help comics for now. They should think of some decent screenplay if they will ever consider to do a sequel (it is welcome). FX at the end were OK. And yes, Natasha Henstridge... She is beautiful, who cares about acting?

Reveling in their crappy production values and atrocious acting is a wildly amusing way to spend a few hours. Although I wouldn't blink twice if the entire industry collapsed, I have certainly seen enough of this genre to know who Sir Ron Jeremy is. Plus, he is an alma madder of my New York High School, having graduated 20 years before I did. So he is like the school's dirty little secret. A would-be school teacher turned porn star who the boys adore and the teachers deplore. Like other porn stars asked to give interviews about their biz, I assumed a documentary on Ron Jeremy's (born 'Ron Jeremy Hyatt') life would reveal him to be a whacko who ridiculously believes the porn business is a legitimate industry that should be taken seriously. Of course, the billions of dollars is generates annually can't be ignored either.What a shock it was to learn that Ron Jermey, or 'the Hedgehog' as he is lovingly called, is 'in' on the joke with the rest of us. He knows that his whole celebrity is completely absurd, and even comments that he is so popular because the fans can relate to a 'schlub' like him. The film often follows Ron through his daily life and shows him to be, basically, a really nice guy who just fell into the porn world because a girlfriend submitted his nude photo Playgirl, without even telling him. From there, the adult-film industry basically pursued HIM!! Remember, at the time, he was thin, young, and while still average-looking, his porn star 'equipment' was undeniable. The documentary is intercut with interviews with others in the porn world discussing Ron Jeremy, the man apart from all the 'glamour.' We learn of his intense cheapness (he is the richest man in the business, but only flies coach, literally uses plastic garbage bags for luggage, wears clothing he purchased from thrift stores 20 years ago, and won't pick up a check if his life depends on it), his excessive living (he eats whatever\/whenever he wants, never exercises and indulges in sex - however he is adamantly anti-drug, including Viagra), and his desire to break into the 'real' acting world (he will do ANYTHING related to cinema - he once flew himself to Paris to film a movie where he appeared on screen for less than 2 seconds before being killed).We even meet his father, who like Ron, treats the whole situation like a huge practical joke. Listening to Ron's dad talk nonchalantly about Ron's abnormally large equipment, and laugh about the embarrassment his son has brought the Hyatt family, is precious. It takes all the 'dirtiness' out of it, and makes the whole idea of a guy having sex on film for a living just seem like a lot of fun.However, you are still left feeling a bit sorry for ol' Ron. His true life-long ambition is for Hollywood to take him seriosuly, and not use his name as the punchline for so-many bad jokes. Interestingly, he does have an impressive resume, but it's made pretty clear that he is already damaged goods in Hollywood. No matter what he does, or where he goes, he will always be Ron Jeremy, Porn Star. No matter how hard he tries, he will never leave that stigma behind - a victim of his own celebrity I suppose. Yet, it is a little difficult to feel TOO bad for a guy who's slept with over 2000 women, and gotten paid handsomely to boot.

We learn of his intense cheapness (he is the richest man in the business, but only flies coach, literally uses plastic garbage bags for luggage, wears clothing he purchased from thrift stores 20 years ago, and won't pick up a check if his life depends on it), his excessive living (he eats whatever\/whenever he wants, never exercises and indulges in sex - however he is adamantly anti-drug, including Viagra), and his desire to break into the 'real' acting world (he will do ANYTHING related to cinema - he once flew himself to Paris to film a movie where he appeared on screen for less than 2 seconds before being killed).We even meet his father, who like Ron, treats the whole situation like a huge practical joke. Listening to Ron's dad talk nonchalantly about Ron's abnormally large equipment, and laugh about the embarrassment his son has brought the Hyatt family, is precious. It takes all the 'dirtiness' out of it, and makes the whole idea of a guy having sex on film for a living just seem like a lot of fun.However, you are still left feeling a bit sorry for ol' Ron. His true life-long ambition is for Hollywood to take him seriosuly, and not use his name as the punchline for so-many bad jokes. Interestingly, he does have an impressive resume, but it's made pretty clear that he is already damaged goods in Hollywood. No matter what he does, or where he goes, he will always be Ron Jeremy, Porn Star. No matter how hard he tries, he will never leave that stigma behind - a victim of his own celebrity I suppose. Yet, it is a little difficult to feel TOO bad for a guy who's slept with over 2000 women, and gotten paid handsomely to boot. Fun movie, very revealing, my rating 9 ","genre":"Documentary, Biography"},{"date":"4 September 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is an adult film.

Seriously, I can watch the entire saga trilogy a thousand times and each time is like a new adventure for me.  I first watched Star Wars on a very poor quality VCR, but the interesting characters, colorful aliens and awesome starships keeped me glued to the TV set.Nowadays, I've asked people what is it about this movie that they love so much?  Some people told me they loved it because of the set designs, others told me they admired the special effects.  For all its entertainment value, I have to agree with all those points.  But the legacy of Star Wars for me goes beyond mere cinematic breakthroughs in technology and visual effects. Yes, American cinema was never the same again because of this classic, and its not just because it successfully resurrected the sci-fi genre, it was able to convey an epic story of good versus evil on a grand scale through a combination of many symbolic elements borrowed from such classic legends as King Arthur and the ancient Greek heroes, something which all of us in one way or another can relate to.  I don't think any space movie which came out before this flick was released could ever match its magic as an American cinematic saga.All of us at one point or another have felt a need to find out what is our true destiny and purpose in life, and the story of Luke Skywalker's quest to travel beyond the stars to become a Jedi has a universal appeal in this sense.  And that is exactly why I love this film and its sequels so much, its symbolic message to all of us to find our purpose and belonging in this world is a message of eternal relevance.  Being an admirer of Luke Skywalker, I feel even now that I am on a destined quest to find out my true destiny in life and to do good to make a difference in this world, just like Luke made a difference to help save the galaxy.  Whenever I've had moments where I've felt confused or hopeless as to which path I should take in my life, whether it be personal or professional, I've always looked to Star Wars as an inspirational guide.  Because if Luke Skywalker could determine his destiny, then so could I.For any of you who would like to be educated and entertained at the same time, you gotta watch Star Wars because it is science fiction at its very best.

I first watched Star Wars on a very poor quality VCR, but the interesting characters, colorful aliens and awesome starships keeped me glued to the TV set.Nowadays, I've asked people what is it about this movie that they love so much?  Some people told me they loved it because of the set designs, others told me they admired the special effects.  For all its entertainment value, I have to agree with all those points.  But the legacy of Star Wars for me goes beyond mere cinematic breakthroughs in technology and visual effects. Yes, American cinema was never the same again because of this classic, and its not just because it successfully resurrected the sci-fi genre, it was able to convey an epic story of good versus evil on a grand scale through a combination of many symbolic elements borrowed from such classic legends as King Arthur and the ancient Greek heroes, something which all of us in one way or another can relate to.  I don't think any space movie which came out before this flick was released could ever match its magic as an American cinematic saga.All of us at one point or another have felt a need to find out what is our true destiny and purpose in life, and the story of Luke Skywalker's quest to travel beyond the stars to become a Jedi has a universal appeal in this sense.  And that is exactly why I love this film and its sequels so much, its symbolic message to all of us to find our purpose and belonging in this world is a message of eternal relevance.  Being an admirer of Luke Skywalker, I feel even now that I am on a destined quest to find out my true destiny in life and to do good to make a difference in this world, just like Luke made a difference to help save the galaxy.  Whenever I've had moments where I've felt confused or hopeless as to which path I should take in my life, whether it be personal or professional, I've always looked to Star Wars as an inspirational guide.  Because if Luke Skywalker could determine his destiny, then so could I.For any of you who would like to be educated and entertained at the same time, you gotta watch Star Wars because it is science fiction at its very best.  Believe me, the experience of this movie saga will stay with you for a lifetime!

I more or less decided on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for a lack of anything else.  So, I went to the theatre, got my overpriced ticket along with my overpriced popcorn, softdrinks and whatnot, then settled into my seat to take the crazed rollercoaster ride thru the drug-addled mind of one Dr. Raoul Duke, circa 1971.Director Terry Gilliam, star Johnny Depp and everyone connected with the film brilliantly captured all the visceral energy and hallucinogenic vibrancy of Hunter S. Thompson's classic take on America's roll at the craps tables of history in an era when everything was on the line.From just about everything I'd heard or read, Gilliam always had a penchant for making movies that cost the studios a lot of bucks that they never recouped at the box office.  Yet, Hollywood keeps going back to him, hoping he'll turn out that one hit that'll make it all worthwhile.  But no matter how vividly he brought the primal essence of Thompson's words to the screen, I seriously doubt that Fear was the film the beancounters were banking on. Fact is, it was just too weird for Joe Sixpack.  It just wasn't the more mainstream shtick the summer crowd usually expects.  But no matter, I felt then and I feel now that the film will eventually have its own legion of fans.Every actor in Fear turned in unforgettable performances.  But the man of the hour was definitely Johnny Depp.  He played Thompson with perfect pitch. He had every maniacal nuance down in a amazingly accurate characterisation of the famed writer.  He tweaked every tic and mannerism from the man and recreated him for the larger than life unreality of the movie screen.And the film was incredibly honest in its depiction of the time and place. Gilliam and company could've taken the phony higher ground and offered a finger wagging revisionist 90s-style version of this tale of decadent excess, but chose instead to tell it unapologetically, merely chronicling the journey into debauched lunacy, letting you make up your own mind about it in the end.And it fairly captured the essence of the hyperbolic, hyperventilated prose of Thompson's source book.Of course, it couldn't fit in everything that appeared on the pages of the original missive.  For instance, of his first hegira out of Las Vegas - when he was on the lam from hotel officials - Thompson related, Rum will be absolutely necessary to get through this night - to polish these notes, this shameful diary ... keep the tape machine screaming all night long at top volume 'Allow me to introduce myself ... I'm a man of wealth and taste.'Sympathy?Not for me.  No mercy for a criminal freak in Las Vegas.  This place is like the Army the shark ethic prevails - eat the wounded.  In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught.  In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.But the real point of the film - and the book - was made during the flashback sequence of a scene at the old Fillmore Ballroom where these lines were extracted from the book and read verbatim into the movie's narrative Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas.  Five years later? Six?  It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era - the kind of peak that never comes again.  San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.  Maybe it meant something.  Maybe not, in the long run ... but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.  Whatever it meant ...So now ... five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.Even tho I hadn't laughed so hard at a film in years, in the final analysis, it wasn't really a ha-ha funny movie.  It was actually a very sad one.  It wasn't about the debacle of the 60s\/early 70s so much as it was about what's happened to us since.  Some of us became casualties of the madness, to be sure.  But somehow, most of us made it thru to the other side.  The boomers of the 60s are now the people who are calling all the shots.  Who knows what kind of long-term effects all those drugs had on the psyche of the nation?We've put on a few pounds to make up for all the brain cells we lost, and we've drifted uneasily into middle-age with many goals still unwon.But the point is still this for all the lunacy of our younger days, we came thru on the other side.  We donned the uniforms of convention and went back to work, seeking the affects of bourgeois gentility.

The performances are perfectly pitched - Osment & Law are both absolutely inhuman but you love them for it - and the story is compelling.  Yet you leave the cinema thinking... if... if... if...

Professor Hobby is selfish in his love for his work and his desire to create the ultimate mecha, despite the ethical implications.  Monica is selfish and self-absorbed in her grief.    Henry is selfish in the way he tries to assuage his wife's grief by bring her home a toy (how GOOD a scene would that have been if David had come in a box to be unwrapped??  Would that have restored his - presumably - missing conjugal rights?).  Martin is selfish in that he refuses to share his family with the needy newcomer.  But David is the most selfish of all (I WILL be a real boy and then you WILL love me), kicking and screaming and, in one instance, resorting to shocking violence when his desires are thwarted.  Perhaps Joe-the-gigolo is the only unselfish one among them, but he too shows an uncanny instinct for self-preservation.  Our whole society is built on selfishness, the Me.More.Now. principle, and this movie explores the damage we inflict on our species and on individuals.

That stupid bear brings one major continuity error to mind - when Joe & David flee through the turnstile after the riot at the Flesh Fair, they are not carrying the bear - it is still being clutched by the little girl.  Next scene, they are wandering through the woods with David hugging the bear close.  They should have left it behind, it's a continuing reminder that Spielberg is unsure of who his audience is - the bear is a sop to kids.  Whereas Osment is never less than terrifying, the bear is cute.  It makes you wince every time it appears onscreen.  And every time you wince, you lose the magic, and have to start building your belief all over again.  This was a movie that had so much else going for it, it never needed to be cute.

The depiction of the future makes a fascinating journey in itself - we see a multifaceted society which is more fully realised than the lazy uh... buildings are taller, people ride round in helicopters more and use their hands instead of keys blueprint beloved of so much recent science fiction.  The performances are perfectly pitched - Osment & Law are both absolutely inhuman but you love them for it - and the story is compelling.  Yet you leave the cinema thinking... if... if... if...  If only it were shorter.  If only there was no stupid talking teddy bear.  If only there had not been quite so many things with a glowing light behind them... If only Spielberg had not felt such a desire to explain explain explain.  But at least you leave the cinema thinking and feeling, which is more than can be said for almost any other movie I have seen in the last 6 months.The basic premise, that love is ultimately selfish (ie concerned with personal need, regardless of the detrimental effect that need might have on others), is explored through a variety of different relationships and situations.  Professor Hobby is selfish in his love for his work and his desire to create the ultimate mecha, despite the ethical implications.  Monica is selfish and self-absorbed in her grief.    Henry is selfish in the way he tries to assuage his wife's grief by bring her home a toy (how GOOD a scene would that have been if David had come in a box to be unwrapped??  Would that have restored his - presumably - missing conjugal rights?).  Martin is selfish in that he refuses to share his family with the needy newcomer.  But David is the most selfish of all (I WILL be a real boy and then you WILL love me), kicking and screaming and, in one instance, resorting to shocking violence when his desires are thwarted.  Perhaps Joe-the-gigolo is the only unselfish one among them, but he too shows an uncanny instinct for self-preservation.  Our whole society is built on selfishness, the Me.More.Now. principle, and this movie explores the damage we inflict on our species and on individuals.  Is the quest to be loved and love back such a great one after all?  How far are we prepared to go, or how long are we prepared to pointlessly wait for a happy ending?  Are the dreams Hollywood peddles us the ones we should really be desiring?  On all levels, visual, intellectual and spiritual, this movie challenges and stimulates.Yet... there's the aforementioned teddybear.  Damn those Ewoks, that directors have since been trying to ram cute furry things into respectable movies that patently don't need them.  That stupid bear brings one major continuity error to mind - when Joe & David flee through the turnstile after the riot at the Flesh Fair, they are not carrying the bear - it is still being clutched by the little girl.  Next scene, they are wandering through the woods with David hugging the bear close.  They should have left it behind, it's a continuing reminder that Spielberg is unsure of who his audience is - the bear is a sop to kids.  Whereas Osment is never less than terrifying, the bear is cute.  It makes you wince every time it appears onscreen.  And every time you wince, you lose the magic, and have to start building your belief all over again.  This was a movie that had so much else going for it, it never needed to be cute.   But the flaws only emphasise the genius behind it, and hey, the perfect movie doesn't exist, otherwise we'd be stuck watching perpetual re-runs of it on tv.  A.I. is a Blade Runner for the new century.

These two films may be worlds apart in content yet the talent of this man's writing and directing show clearly through both.As a side note...I'm so sick and tired of people harping on this mans background with the law. When Powder came out, some boycott the film due his crime. Hello?? What does film making have to do with his past history or personal life? The man did his time as prescribed by our laws, yet some still want to convict him. What happened to Justice for all? I believe this hurt 'Powder' as a film and the many that didnt see the touching work Mr. Salva created. I'm interested in the talent this man brings to the screen. I can separate his worth as a film maker and judge him solely on that because I'm going to see his movies which have no bearing on his past. If I were dealing with him in a personal sense, then possibly I would proceed with some caution in a specific area. Other then that, let him do what he does and does so well. And dont stifle someone for their past especially since they paid their dues. I look forward with anticipation to more of Victor Salva's work.

So few movies or TV shows treat music seriously, or show that it can be much more than mass-produced trivialized entertainment.

At some point during any given action movie, the audience will be asked to accept that the meek, mild-mannered accountant trapped in an elevator is really a former Green Beret demolitions specialist . . . or that a blonde stripper is fluent in six languages and can crack government computer codes . . . or that no matter how complicated a nuclear device may be, cutting the red wire will always successfully disarm such a weapon. It's part of the action movie territory. In most cases, the action movie rises above its implausibilities and moves forward into a realm of snappy one-liners and wicked, cool-looking violence that serves to entertain.Unfortunately, `Reindeer Games' is not one of those action films. Without wandering over into spoiler territory . . . let's just say that `Reindeer Games' is crippled from the very start by a vastly implausible concept that is so utterly massive, it nearly boggles the human mind. This concept is not only wildly unbelievable (and stupid), but it unfortunately also happens to be the lynchpin of the film. Each and every decision made by each and every character in `Reindeer Games' is based in some way, shape, or form upon this fatally flawed concept. As such, it's hard to believe anything that the characters do in the film, simply because their decisions are based entirely on some seriously bad ideas.  No normal or sane person would accept the things that all the characters in the movie so blindly accept at face value. . . so it's hard to even remotely connect with the events of the film. Even worse &#150; about halfway during `Reindeer Games', a glimmer of hope can be seen, as if some of the characters have some hidden motives that may help explain their idiotic acceptance of the main, flawed premise of the film . .. wrong.  The first flawed premise, in a supposedly surprising twist, is replaced by an equally awful and flawed premise, making the film no better than it was before.  Accepting flawed and often ludicrous ideas in an action movie is part of the action movie experience, but when the audience is not only asked to accept these hideously bad ideas throughout the entire film, but are bludgeoned over the head with them, as they most certainly are with `Reindeer Games' . . . it adds up to a bad, bad movie.For those of you still vaguely interested in seeing `Reindeer Games', here's the supposed plot Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck), a former car thief just released from prison, decides to impersonate his former cellmate Nick (James Frain) so that he can meet a beautiful woman named Ashley (Charlize Theron), whom Nick had been communicating with via a `prison pen pal' program. `Nick' and Ashley hit everything off just fine, until Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) shows up &#150; turns out he's a gun smuggler looking to pull a heist at a nearby casino that he knows `Nick' used to work at as a security guard.  Unable to successfully convince either Gabriel or Ashley that he's not really `Nick', Rudy is forced to become part of a major robbery &#150; and has to find a way out for himself and his new love Ashley before big brother Gabriel decides to `take care' of `Nick' with his semi-automatic assault rifle . . . .The cast of `Reindeer Games' is pretty good, but even an outstanding cast wouldn't have been able to save this heavily flawed film.  Ben Affleck is very good as the reluctant hero Rudy; Gary Sinise is a lot of fun as the scenery-chewing Gabriel; and the lovely Charlize Theron, who seems to be sleepwalking through the first half of the film, actually seems to wake up and redeem herself with some nice stuff in the second half.  The actors provide some neat little moments &#150; watch for Affleck's `Pecan Pie Diner' scene, it's excellent &#150; but none of these moments even come close to overcoming the film's very significant flaws.  What might've been able to save the film from its flaws is some heavy-duty, jaw-dropping action . . . and that action never materializes.  Not once.  Oh sure, there's action, but it's very bland and generic, nothing that hasn't already been done in a thousand other action films.  Even without the implausible concepts that mortally wound `Reindeer Games' from the very start . . . the film would've been average at best.  Throw the amazingly dumb and implausible concepts on top of this average film, and what's left is a disappointing, frustrating, and bland excuse for an action film.Decent characters, very weak action, and an incredibly stupid plot &#150; that's the best way to sum up `Reindeer Games'.  This is the sort of action film that should be collecting a lot of dust on the shelf of your local video store.  It provides one or two brief, decent moments . . . but that's it.
