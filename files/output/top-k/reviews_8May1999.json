[{"date":"8 May 1999","score":"","review":" Election This is what high school films should be  not about high school.Alexander Payne's new film is a real treat to watch - at times. A funny, but plausibly impaired, comedy that begs the audience to think for itself.Matthew Broderick might be a dream on the Broadway stage, but lately the film career seems to have been working against him.  With Election, Broderick proudly returns to the performances we all love him for.  As a sex-starved high school teacher, Broderick and Payne make sure to form the character about as real as cinematically possible.  This is a comedy, but Broderick does a great job showing the character's many colors. Reese Witherspoon is no favorite of mine.  Repeatedly, I have winced at her performances.  She's certainly one of the least talented of her peers. Yet this film actually asks Witherspoon to stay within the confines of a character.  She does a nice job as Tracy Flick - perpetual overachiever. She plays with Broderick well, and she creates a memorable performance. The real star is director Payne.  With Citizen Ruth, Payne displayed a rare gift for satire and originality.  Election continues this streak with inventive camerawork, bright performances, and a distinctly sour screenplay.It's nice to see typical characters like the high school jock (a wonderful Chris Klein) and the blossoming lesbian treated with a slight spin.  They turn out to be the two sweetest characters in the whole movie. It's also nice to see actors and extras with imperfect beauty.  Zits, bad teeth, scary hair, it's all delightfully here. What makes Election quickly turn ugly is the refusal to end.  The movie has about 19 climaxes, 18 more than it needs.  I wasn't fond of the resolution of the film, only for the movie to take forever to finish. I doubt we needed such a lengthy summation. It damages the film's final impact. Payne has a bright career ahead of him.  I look forward to his clear vision in the future.----------- 7  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 May 1999","score":"","review":" Election This is what high school films should be  not about high school.Alexander Payne's new film is a real treat to watch - at times.

A movie about teenagers that isn't focused on pre-graduation soulsearching, make-overs, or prom night.  It's hard to believe but MTV has backed up a movie with a real message to it.  Stranger things have happened.I recently saw 10 Things I Hate About You.  I didn't find 10 things to hate about it and it was a fun little romp.  The main character in that movie was supposed to be cynical, but this movie is downright blackhearted. I enjoyed the fact that this film skewers all sides it presents to us. Yet while it distances you from the four main players you can still see where they're coming from.  I loved the monologues that the four main characters give at different points in the movie.  That shows us that all of them are in such denial about what is really going on in their lives. The 1990s are the perfect target of this film.  No one seems to ever want to accept that something they have done is wrong.Matthew Broderick surprised me.  He turned 180 degrees from his Ferris character.  He plays a high school teacher, Mr. McAllister, living a smothering boring life.  His clothes are drab, his wife and even the woman he fantasizes about are all plain.  He drives a car not even four clowns could fit into.  Did any of my favorite high school teachers regret the life that they chose, seeing their students on to lives that they wish to have themselves?Reese Witherspoon steals the show as Tracy Flick.  A raging hurricane of ambition, resentment, and pride.  She even has her own jungle cry theme music whenever someone crosses her.  I thought I would dislike her character from reading the reviews but I understood her motivations better after seeing the movie.  It's hard not to resent people that get things easily in life while you have to struggle.  It's hard to not be truly appreciated for overachieving.  She even begins to question whether her goals are even worthwhile.  However, she plans to win the student body president election at all costs.The second candidate, the stereotypical dumb jock is the only character that is pure of heart.  You think you would dislike his character but he is just TOO nice of a guy.  He cynically shows us that nowadays, it seems you would have to be an idiot in order to have any scruples.  His sister Tammy, miffed that her girlfriend left her and  hooked up with her brother decides to become the third candidate.  She wants to abolish the student government, saying it truly has no purpose.  While there is no contest to that, her motivation is questionable.Just watch this movie to see how events turn out and you won't be disappointed.  So many subtle touches were put into this movie.  The principal after learning of Tammy's proposal from her speech labels her as a dangerous element and suspends her.  Thinking back I'm sure that similar things happened at my high school, corrupt officials manipulated things to suit themselves.Election deals perfectly with one of the greatest teenager themes of all, infatuation.  Infatuation makes the characters so blind that they can't even tell whether their actions are right or wrong.  They justify the things that they do under the pretense of love and don't realize there are consequences to their actions.
