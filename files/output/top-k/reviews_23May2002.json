And with this film, team Coen establishes their parameters for successfully conveying their often unique perspectives on life and the world in which we live, including casting the future Mrs. Joel Coen, Frances McDormand, as their leading lady; parameters in which the value of the constants are continually changing, offering variables on characters and story that makes each new outing by the Coens fresh, while creating the expectation of the unexpected.\tRay (John Getz) is a bartender in a small town in Texas; the owner of the place, Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) is a successful businessman, but not so successful when it comes to character.  He's a miscreant who, though able to give his wife, Abby (McDormand), a nice house and all the material benefits, is just too much of a creep to make any of it worthwhile.  And so Abby is leaving him.  On the night of her departure, Ray offers to drive her.  Why?  Because he's always liked her.\tHurricanes are born from gentle winds; winds that under normal circumstances are no more than gentle breezes, blowing over the land, rustling the leaves in the trees and passing on.  But given the right climate, conditions and currents, those same winds become deadly.  And so it is that from a gentle, innocuous situation, a storm develops.  In Ray's case, because `he always liked her,' it's a storm that's about to sweep him away to a place in his soul that's every bit as desolate as that empty stretch of Texas road upon which he embarks with Abby on a night of dark rain, the likes of which he has never known before, and will never know again.\tA stretch of dark, desolate, empty road; a metaphor the Coens first used in this film, and will use again-- and always effectively-- in films like `Fargo' (lonely, snow covered and cold) and `O Brother Where Art Thou?' (southern heat, empty, infinite).  And in retrospect, how apropos that their first film opens with a shot of that very same road; dark, rainy, a dead, unfortunate animal lying to one side of the straight white line, broken and illuminated by the headlights of a car.  Welcome to the world of the Brothers Coen.\tTheir success here, as well as in the films that follow, begins with their deep grasp and understanding of basic human nature.  That, as well as their innate ability to `think out of the box' and lend fresh perspectives to even the most mundane elements of everyday life.  In this film, as they would do later in `The Man Who Wasn't There,' the Coens take what on the surface appears to be a simple, straightforward situation, and proceed to weave a complex, intricate tapestry of events and emotions that cast a hypnotic spell over their audience.  And they do it, not by manipulating, but by taking that road less traveled.  In real life, it is common to extrapolate-- to consider an upcoming event and follow it through in the mind to a probable conclusion; and when it happens, the results rarely coincide with what had been projected, or if they do, the way in which those results are attained is more often than not quite different than expected.  The Coens understand this, and moreover-- and most importantly-- are able to convey it so succinctly and subtly to their audience, often with a startling, even jaw-dropping effect.  Cinematically, the Coens have the gift of magic; and they use it wisely.\tThe performances are solid from one and all, though with one exception none tend to stand out as worthy of any special acclaim.  As Ray, Getz convincingly achieves that `average guy' countenance that gives a real edge to the impact of the extraordinary situation in which he finds himself, as well as to the bizarre events as they gradually unfold and into which he is subsequently induced to participate.  McDormand also brings that same believability to Abby, establishing her character's state of mind and convincingly conveying her ignorance as to the true nature and extent of the events she has unwittingly provoked.  And Dan Hedaya is effectively contemptible as Marty.\tThe performance that really gives the film it's flavor, however, is turned in by M. Emmet Walsh, as Private Investigator Loren Visser.  Walsh, who for many years and in a countless number of films has been one of the best of those unsung heroes of the silver screen, the `character actor,' creates a character in whom he utterly captures the dark and smarmy side of the human condition.  Instead of offering a one-dimensional character, Walsh presents a complex individual predisposed to the foul side of life, who is able to overcome any spark of conscience, and do it without remorse.  Walsh shows us a man with an almost amoral disdain for `goodness,' who embraces the vile as the seemingly natural way of things.  And he does it with detail and nuance, from the almost imperceptible squint\/blink he affects, to a laugh that rivals Richard Widmark's in `Kiss of Death.'  It's a laugh that says nothing can touch him; leveled at the world and everyone in it, but most especially, at himself.  It's a memorable performance, arguably one of his best, and it should have earned him an Oscar nomination.\tThe supporting cast includes Samm-Art Williams (Meurice), Deborah Neumann (Debra), Raquel Gavia (Landlady) and Holly Hunter (uncredited as Helene).  A veritable harbinger of things to come, `Blood Simple' is the one that put the Coen Brothers on the map; an engrossing drama fraught with insights and indications as to the myriad twists and turns of life and where it all can lead, this one is magic-- the magic of the movies.

Given all the hype of the film though, I was a touch disappointed with this first part of a probable 3 episode series. It was entertaining stuff but at times the film seemed to fall between a romance\/drama flick (emphasised by the nature of the ending) and a superhero action flick. Throughout Peter Parker was portrayed way too nerdy and besotted with the girl. Another actor -less geeky would have been a better choice than Tobey Maguire. There were too many sentimental scenes for this genre of movie- Spiderman's famous sense of humour was completely discarded-hopefully this side of his character will be developed in the sequel. I'd prefer this any day to the blubbing Parker that was seen here. The character played by Kirsten Dunst was iffy- portrayed as a materialistic, boyfriend-changing, Broadway wannabe who by the end is deeply in love with the nerdy Parker. This didn't really work and seemed contrived. The pacing was erratic at times - a measured build-up to develop the characters and introduce Spiderman...good, but then within seconds of film-time he's well known by everybody in New York City (this worked well in Ghostbusters '84 -but not here!) Also the Green Goblin character was a bit of a mystery-and what was with the ridiculous mask?! The best moments were when Spidey was in action- kicking ass,swinging through the avenues of Manhattan, posturing athletically- basically being a superhero. The special effects were good and Spiderman's acrobatics-enthralling, along with a mix of some really humourous moments and some great action scenes. The best characters in the movie were the ones who had character -Parker's uncle, Willem Dafoe's Dr Osborne and the newspaper editor Jamison. Look forward to Spiderman II. Overall rating 7\/10.

There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the ki (or personal energy, emanating from a person's midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term ki is never used in the flick, but the term path, another word for Tao or Way, is).

I wanted to like it, really I did.  I grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy, and wanted so desperately to like Attack of the Clones, especially after I desperately tried to like The Phantom Menace.  But alas, I just could not.  There simply was not enough there for me to like.I recently watched The Phantom Menace again, to bring myself up to speed again (I guess) for Episode II.  The problem with that film was Jar Jar Binks' ability to irritate the most die-hard and optimistic of Star Wars fans, and an unconvincing little Anakin (played by Jake Lloyd).  Episode II is an improvement then, simply because there is no little kid, and Jar Jar's role is minimal.The film opens ten years after the events in Episode I; Anakin Skywalker (now played by Hayden Christiansen) is no longer a tyke, but in his late teens, filled with almost as much teen angst as he had in Life as a House. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is no longer Queen, but a senator and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) has grown a beard and needs a hair cut.  Much of the first act of the film is comprised of `what have you been up to?' dialogue.Anyway, there is an assassination attempt of Senator Amidala, and Obi-Wan and Anakin are dispatched by the Jedi Council to protect her and investigate.  We learn that Anakin has dreamed of Padme every day since he last saw her ten years ago, and is hopelessly in love with her.  Padme, though, hides her feelings.The plot thickens when Obi-Wan stumbles on a planet that is producing millions of Clone Troopers (which look suspiciously like Storm Troopers). At the same time, plagued by nightmares, Anakin returns to Tatooine in search of his mother.Now there is nothing really wrong with the story, just the execution of said story is extremely poor.  What Lucas really needed was to hire someone to touch up the screenplay (perhaps Lawrence Kasdan again?  He did co-write Empire and Jedi).  Some of the dialogue, especially between Christiansen and Portman is downright atrocious.  It has none of the wit or verve of anything in the original trilogy, and at times sounds remarkably like a bad high school play.  Their relationship feels awkward and decidedly forced (pun intended suckers!).  The romance is even more disappointing in comparison to the romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia, and how it developed with ease and effortless charm.Portman does her best with the material, but it is Christiansen who is the dead weight.  He plays Anakin like a grumpy 12 year-old in many scenes. In one scene particularly, feelings of remorse and fear would have been suitable and moving, instead he throws a temper tantrum.  Christiansen delivers his lines with such banality, there is little interest for, and not much to like about his character.  Perhaps though, he is not meant to be liked, after all he does become Darth Vader, the most notorious screen villain in history.  But at the same time how could he not be interesting? I mean he is Darth Vader!  Well, Christiansen and Lucas found a way.Most of the elements we've come to expect from the Star Wars franchise are here gorgeous special effects, light saber duels, grand battles, and John Williams' score.  What's missing, though, is a sense of fun; a sense of awe and wonder.  Perhaps it's because the story is mundane and sophomoric.  It feels tired, like everyone involved just wanted to get it done and over with; even Williams' score is sub par.To me it seems Lucas is more concerned with getting the story told, rather than relishing in telling the story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker.  Much of the film, despite its running time of 142 minutes, feels rushed, especially the final 15 minutes or so.The film does have some high points, though not enough.  There's a fun speeder chase (of sorts) through the towering city of Coruscant, there are some amusing moments with R2-D2 and C-3PO, and the final battle of clones, Jedi and droids is pure eye candy.  With the exception of the speeder chase (which occurs early), we have to sit through 80 minutes of clumsy exposition and set up, much of which for the next film.

A great thing happened to me when I watched it I found myself getting completely sucked into it and my comparisons to the old trilogy faded away.For 25 years, fans have clung to the classic characters of Luke, Leia, Han, etc. Now Lucas asks that you immerse yourself in the WHOLE STORY, the roots of young Skywalker and the Jedi, and the rise of the Empire. You simply cannot and will not enjoy this film (or the trilogy as a whole) if you're hell-bent on it being like the originals. IT'S NOT THE ORIGINALS and quite frankly, it's wonderful. The only true comparison of the original trilogy is that the story is TOLD like the originals, and that's what should satisfy fans.Enough of the commentary, here's the breakdown (SPOILERS AHEAD)This film is fun. So many elements that I was hoping to see more of in the first film, totally come to life in this installment.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT Unlike Menace, there is some emotional intensity in Clones. Despite most people's gripes about the romantic aspect (namely the clunky dialogue and pace of these scenes), Padme and Anakin's romance is important to the story. After all, they are Luke and Leia's parents, and Padme signifies Anakin's first step towards pulling away from the life of the Jedi. The slaughtering of the Tusken Raiders is a great demonstration of Anakin losing control and giving into hatred, the seed of the Dark Side of the Force.To address the barrage of complaints regarding the dialogue; yes, there are a few bad lines, but nothing detrimental. Additionally, if you're going to condemn Clones for dialogue breakdown, you may as well condemn the whole franchise, because it's never been a strong suit of the series.Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan is much more relaxed and settled than in Menace. The struggle between him and Anakin in terms of discipline is well executed and comes off much like a father\/son relationship. It also illustrates Kenobi's shortcomings as a mentor and justifies his eagerness to train Luke in Episode IV. In watching Episode IV now, it's apparent that Kenobi feels an obligation of 'righting a wrong' and feels a great deal of guilt for his training and failure of Anakin\/Vader.We get to see a lot more of both Yoda and Mace Windu, though Sam Jackson never seems overly comfortable, or maybe he's trying too hard. Still, he gets in a few classic Samuel Jackson trademark 'bad ass' lines when he confronts Dooku. Portman as Padme is much deeper than Episode I and is very 'Leia-like' when all hell starts to break loose. Like Kenobi, her character definitely emerges stronger by the end of the film.It's also great to Boba Fett as a youth, and we now understand what drives him to wear the Mandilorian armor and follow his father's bounty hunter footsteps. SETTING This film features the most breathtaking of settings of all the movies, hands down. Thanks heavens Lucas gives us more of Coruscant, a place all fans have craved since the end of the digitally re-mastered version of Return of the Jedi. We get more in Episode I, but a full dose in Clones. Lucas also takes us to 2 new planets; the rain and ocean swept Kamino and the barren Geonosis. There's also a plethora of new species; the Kaminoans, the lanky aliens of Kamino are both strange and fascinating. Bottom line, this movie is GORGEOUS. PLOT Having known the back-story of the original films, I found the plot both compelling and easy to follow. Casual fans may think otherwise. But you can't argue with a plot that unfolds the beginnings of the Empire and rise of Palpatine.EFFECTS There have been an alarming number of complaints regarding the amount of CG used in the movie. I thought the use of it was flawless, in both setting and the alien races. For those of you who want to bring back the Yoda puppet, consider the duel with Dooku; not possible with a puppet and I don't think there's a soul out there who would trade in that scene for anything. The effects are spectacular, especially in the (almost) finale scene where the clones and droids are fighting in the dust clouds left in the wake of the fallen starship. Beautiful.ACTION Need I bother? Again, action is abundant and some of the best cinema I have ever seen. People complain it's 'too slow' in the middle, but it's important that we get somewhat of a feel for Anakin's\/Padme's relationship. I found the pacing just fine and completely acceptable.CLIFFHANGER The ending is almost a mirror of Empire, much like Menace was to A New Hope. I won't give away specifics, but my appetite is plenty whet for Episode III.To summarize, like Empire, Clones is a compelling installment to the trilogy and very exciting. It will most definitely please fans WHO LOVE STAR WARS. For those who are still whining about Phantom Menace and plan to scrutinize every move that Lucas makes, don't bother. You're only setting yourself up for disappointment; not because Clones is a bad movie, but because you're still clinging to the originals as a point of reference. Comparison of both trilogy's is inevitable and reasonable, TO A POINT. But one needs to let go and just enjoy them as they are, much like we did back then. Episode II gives the new trilogy shape and depth. To me, it is now it's own franchise, as it should be.

My version of SUPERMAN III picked up where the last film left off, with the relationship between Lois and Clark\/Superman dead and gone. In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army. Spurned on the basis that such an army would violate human rights, the scientists use the Bizarros to wreak havoc upon Washington and end up in direct conflict with Superman.Why am I telling you this? Because what I came up with was way better than the actual SUPERMAN III. It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film. Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the masterminds behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up. With SUPERMAN III, Donner and Mankiewicz's influence is completely absent, and we finally see what the Salkinds intended the SUPERMAN series to be all along. And what we get is a campy, dumb, and unfunny insult to the mythos. Not even the superb FX work, a good rescue scene at a chemical plant, and Robert Paynter's comic book-panel photography can make this film feel like genuine Superman.It's not the idea of having Richard Pryor in a Superman film that makes this film bad, or using Lana Lang. It's not even the idea of using new villains. What makes this film bad is the sheer carelessness and idiocy of it all. For a film that revolves around computers as a menace, the villain should have been Brainiac, the genocidal AI of the comic books. Instead we get Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross as greedy tycoons who sucker a computer wiz into helping them corner the commodities market. Not very exciting. Instead of giving Pryor a meaty, serious role that would have tested him as an actor and have fit into the tone of the Superman mythos, we get Pryor as Gus Gorman doing standard Pryor shtick and not being funny at all. Instead of Lana Lang having some zest and excitement to her, we get a very bland and dull character played by a very boring Annette O'Toole. It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful. Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the Superman goes evil and fights himself scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere (probably because he realizes the film sucks). And let's not forget the horrible slapstick gags, which are totally out of place here. And why does Metropolis have such a strongly British feel to it in the opening sequence? Shouldn't it be more American? Shades of SUPERMAN II's Idaho residents with British accents....I can't say that this is as low as the SUPERMAN films can sink; the upcoming Jon Peters-produced SUPERMAN movie promises to be even worse. But of the Christopher Reeve cycle, this is by far the worst of the four. To those who assert that this film is truer to the comic books than the first two, I beg to differ. The first two films are kin to the best Superman comic stories. III is kin to the absolute worst.

My version of SUPERMAN III picked up where the last film left off, with the relationship between Lois and Clark\/Superman dead and gone. In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army. Spurned on the basis that such an army would violate human rights, the scientists use the Bizarros to wreak havoc upon Washington and end up in direct conflict with Superman.Why am I telling you this? Because what I came up with was way better than the actual SUPERMAN III. It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film. Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the masterminds behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up. With SUPERMAN III, Donner and Mankiewicz's influence is completely absent, and we finally see what the Salkinds intended the SUPERMAN series to be all along. And what we get is a campy, dumb, and unfunny insult to the mythos. Not even the superb FX work, a good rescue scene at a chemical plant, and Robert Paynter's comic book-panel photography can make this film feel like genuine Superman.It's not the idea of having Richard Pryor in a Superman film that makes this film bad, or using Lana Lang. It's not even the idea of using new villains. What makes this film bad is the sheer carelessness and idiocy of it all. For a film that revolves around computers as a menace, the villain should have been Brainiac, the genocidal AI of the comic books. Instead we get Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross as greedy tycoons who sucker a computer wiz into helping them corner the commodities market. Not very exciting. Instead of giving Pryor a meaty, serious role that would have tested him as an actor and have fit into the tone of the Superman mythos, we get Pryor as Gus Gorman doing standard Pryor shtick and not being funny at all. Instead of Lana Lang having some zest and excitement to her, we get a very bland and dull character played by a very boring Annette O'Toole. It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful.

Some of them looked super cheesy in the previews, but you hardly notice them in the movie.  I'll never understand why so many people are against CG effects, especially with this movie and Attack of the Clones.

I'm amazed at what can be done in movies today and CG is the only way to achieve certain things. The characters were excellent, especially Tobey.  I had doubts about him playing such a physical character, but he really fit the role.

By the end of it, you'll be totally exhausted and emotionally drained, but I've seen it a few times and I think the only way to even begin to understand it is by seeing at least twice. The setting is deceptively simple a middle-aged couple, George (a history professor) and his wife Martha (who's father is head of the college George teaches at) invite Nick and Honey (a couple in their thirties who have just moved to the area because Nick has got a job teaching Biology at the college) round to their house for a drink after a party. What ensues is completely mind-boggling, as it turns out that George and Martha are locked into a distructive marriage, and the whole night turns into a war between the two.  Almost from the word go, George and Martha (played brilliantly by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are flinging caustic insults at each other and although their words are shocking and brutal, I actually found some of their exchanges extremely funny. Richard Burton is especially masterful with his sarcastic comebacks to his wife's verbal body blows, and in my opinion he deserved the Oscar he was nominated for, but failed to win. As the film develops you are dragged deeper and deeper into the conflict, just as Nick and Honey are. George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey are excellent support for the mighty Burton and Taylor, who eventually turn on their guests and use them as pawns in their twisted mind-games. The end scene is where the 'truth' (if it is indeed the truth - for the viewer is never sure - like George and Martha - what is true and what isn't) comes out, and then the film ends with George and Martha seemingly making peace, with her clutching at his hand, probably because they've knocked every ounce of fight out of each other during the course of the movie. Truth and illusion, George, you don't know the difference, Martha tells her husband scornfully in one scene, and by the end of the movie, neither did I. The almost constant dialogue is so cleverly woven that you can never tell when George and Martha are being serious or not, and I think the whole point of the film is that the audience never really know the truth. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good drama, and although I admit it is a hard movie to watch simply because of the depths it reaches into, it is also compulsive viewing - I didn't move for the whole two hours the first time I watched it. The acting is superb, and Elizabeth Taylor gives the best performance of her entire career as the loud, embittered and yet somehow tragic character of Martha. This is a movie that definitely stays with you, and one of my many after-thoughts was this I wonder how much of Burton and Taylor's real relationship came through when they were playing George and Martha. My guess is that their publicised verbal battles had nothing on those of George and Martha, although it certainly makes you wonder!

By the end of it, you'll be totally exhausted and emotionally drained, but I've seen it a few times and I think the only way to even begin to understand it is by seeing at least twice. The setting is deceptively simple a middle-aged couple, George (a history professor) and his wife Martha (who's father is head of the college George teaches at) invite Nick and Honey (a couple in their thirties who have just moved to the area because Nick has got a job teaching Biology at the college) round to their house for a drink after a party. What ensues is completely mind-boggling, as it turns out that George and Martha are locked into a distructive marriage, and the whole night turns into a war between the two.  Almost from the word go, George and Martha (played brilliantly by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are flinging caustic insults at each other and although their words are shocking and brutal, I actually found some of their exchanges extremely funny. Richard Burton is especially masterful with his sarcastic comebacks to his wife's verbal body blows, and in my opinion he deserved the Oscar he was nominated for, but failed to win. As the film develops you are dragged deeper and deeper into the conflict, just as Nick and Honey are.

Having blown well over 1\/4 billion dollars on THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and the infamous CUTTHROAT ISLAND, which studio bosses  observed failing to recoup barely 50% of production costs, one might wonder what contacts Harlin has in the industry that saw him back at the helm of another $100 million plus box-office wannabe.Okayish in the plot development department - a marine scientist, Dr Susan McCallister (irritatingly played by charmless Saffron Burrows)  uses government funding to tamper with a few big fishes to come up with, what one character in the movie refers to as a shark with the brain the size of a V8 engine!  Little wonder then the sharks are a little miffed at their constricted living quarters in the multi billion dollar underwater research laboratory complex. Quite understandably, they begin to kill people.  This is where the wheels irredeemably fall off! The shark attacks are so laughably digitised that the average viewer will fall about laughing. Equally as bad as the unintentionally hysterical swimming aliens in ALIEN RESURRESTION, the demise of Samuel L. Jackson in particular is awesomely stupid. I take nothing away here since every second reviewer on average has made mention of this particular character's exit! Great water effects one has to admit, but how much flooding of corridors can one viewer take during any two hour period?Were this not enough, we witness another character chomped up in a sharks jaw for some minutes, his guts turning the water red only to find him casually extricating himself from his indelicate position and a short time later taking it up to the shark with a an assault rifle, wearing a few band-aids and a small bandage! This is crap!One could be generous and say that DEEP BLUE SEA offers a degree of entertainment value. One could be equally astute and declare the film a thinking person's nightmare and a technical person's insult to intelligence. Still, JAWS 3 and IV were no better!

Angelina Jolie plays a bumbling reporter who is informed by a bum prophet that she has one week to live.
