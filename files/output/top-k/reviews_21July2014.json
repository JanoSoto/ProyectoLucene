[{"date":"21 July 2014","score":"","review":" Charlie Chaplin's the Gold Rush is the best of all silent comedies because it is just so funny thanks to Chaplin's comedic genius. The movie reminds me of comedy classics such as Dr. Strangelove, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, It Happened One Night, The Kid, Steamboat Bill Jr., Bruce Almighty etc., The movie tells the story of a prospector\/tramp who goes to Alaska on a gold mining mission in order to become a multi-millionaire (played by Chaplin himself.) This movie makes me think back to the worst animated movie ever which was the beginning of Frozen when there is prospectors mining for ice which I was pretty sure it was on the polar ice caps (during the arctic scenes.). Not only the movie works as a dramatic comedy but it also works as a romantic love story. Chaplin's masterpiece to me was a comedy masterwork.

The developed story and screenplay is really very nice. They show at first how Charlie is perceivable as a bit inhumane to Raymond. But later as the movie progresses, it shows how Charlie slowly grows affection to his distanced brother. From acting point of view, it's one of the definition work that puts Tom Cruise acting abilities on the map for recognition. on the other side, Dustin Hoffman is also worthy of praise to have been able to portray, quite realistically, an autistic person.
