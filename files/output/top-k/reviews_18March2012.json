Okay, so that last character isn't so predictable. As a matter of fact, Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a villain. Instead, Riddick is a cold, calculating man who carefully reads the people around him. Radha Mitchell is excellent in her role, letting the inexperience of command shake her confidence while she attempts to lead the group into the right decisions. Keith David is the man of God, the man who always finds the hope in the situation and tries to encourage others to do the same. Cole Hauser is a perfect sociopath, coldly deciding who should be sacrificed as long as he survives. The film moves at a good pace, makes one or two logical flaws in the plot, but overall entertains and apparently creates a memorable character in the form of Riddick, who we see next in The Chronicles of Riddick, our next review. Rated R for violence and gore, and language, this film is collectible for Vin Diesel fans and anyone who likes good science fiction.

In a time and era where this film is perceived the dramatization and overall appearance is true to form. It takes a great collaboration of all mind sets and skill sets to piece together what the film means and needs to be. Irving and Hallstrom mesh well together in this Academy Award winning film to cast the best actors, who play true to the characters in the book. Michael Caine is an amazing actor in his portrayal of Dr. Wilbur Larch. Caine brings to the film such a precedence that will bring the viewers to laughter, love, and tears. Caine with his ability to give such a character, as Dr. Wilbur Larch a sense of reality that you can actually feel more than just see. The love that he shares for all of the orphan children stands out true in his relationship with Homer Wells portrayed by Tobey Maguire. Homer Wells, be it his resistance to his destiny viewers see another well casted mesh between director and other actors. The relationship that Homer Wells shares for love of a better meaning is shiny and brilliant. Lasse Hallstrom and his relationship to every actor in this film The Cider House Rules can be seen in every part of the film. Be it when he catches the right moments in the expressions and subtle differences of an actor's face or when the certain verbiage and accents in the characters voices. Lasse Hallstrom gives life to John Irving's work and gives it a sense of the true meaning of the novel. I particularly love his direction with the character Candy played by Charlize Theron , he puts her into such an incandescent beauty. Just the accents and colorization of her can make any man melt. Her portrayal of a true New England beauty would make any man want to run away to the east coast, to find his own lobsterman's daughter. In closing, I believe that everyone should see this film. It is a great representation of the irony of life. The actors and the actresses give new meaning to a new representation of what a novel that is made into a film should be. From beginning to end, this film made me want to be a part of it and to be a character in it too as well.

I regret to say that I have not read the book (don't worry, I intend to), but having seen both films, I safely have something to base my opinions on. The 1963 film is described, both by IMDb reviewers and the film's description, as a faithful and brilliant adaptation of the book. Certainly, it was powerful, bold, disturbing and contemplative, offering a range of great acting and filmmaking. If it is any reflection of the book -- and my upcoming opinion applies anyway in terms of film -- then the 1990 film I am (finally) reviewing is utter tacky garbage.I am not going to complain about the contorting of the plot into all sorts of odd shapes, for that is perfectly acceptable if the end result is mildly worthwhile, but in the case of this Lord of the Flies (LotF) it turns out a mess which puts a sour taste in your mouth. Completely it is destroyed, so that even the crucial underlying themes in the film and, for sure, the book are replaced with brash, overspoken, meaningless messages. Nor am I going to be deliberately obtuse and moan about the inappropriate use of profanity in the film. Rather, I will (rightly) point out the quaint Britishness of the original's characters, which gave the film a timely, sophisticated film and underlined the transformation into savages, and then ask you to look at the new LotF's bratty American tweens, who from the outset behave like the kids even kids want to shout at.Instead of the above We're not savages! and other well-written dialogue, we get a half dozen f-words thrown at each of the cast, dated teen gobbledygook that comes out as annoying and the failing attempts of the writers\/directors to give the kids that never-get-it-right badass look, instead heartlessly Americanising poignant characters with such crude lines as Shove his d**k in the conch! and Shut up, s**thead!, which culminate in two things. One, the savage state of the kids not being too different from their normal demeanour, except for violence too over-the-top for kids in a movie which was ignored by adults for starring nothing but kids. Two, mere minutes after the film begins you silently pray to yourselves that these idiots will starve to death as soon as possible.The child actors in this film, unlike those of the 1963 version who acted well and were nicely sympathetic, are plain unlikable and untalented. Although the people who played Jack and Ralph can more or less pass on this front, Piggy in particular has been portrayed as a snivelling, annoying, useless fool who, really, has come out as a crude and over-the-top caricature of the, well, real Piggy. The majority of the rest of the cast are typical plucked-from-in-front-of-the-TV brats (sorry for repeated use of this word). They sit around and their main function in the film is to serve as friction between the leads -- the actors pull this off well, but with a vicious arrogance, playing the role almost as if they are sneering at the people who do fall into this situation, and acting as if they are bullies in a schoolyard (refer to Shove his d**k in the conch! for an example of this).In the end, it is clear that the badly put out themes are only second to the all-powerful studio machine, which has blatantly tried to run an aged, classic novel through Hollywood and spit out a streetwise, teen-friendly money grabber (again, see Shove his d**k in the conch!) However, the dark themes are constantly at odds with this crude method, dragging it down until the two juxtapose violently upon watching.

The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious.

During their initial conversation about taking the Anthill, General Mireau (George Macready) emphatically states that the safety of the men under his command is more important than sending them to certain death on an impossible suicide mission. Yet in virtually the very next scene he's shown making his rounds in the trenches determined to stiffen the men for the very same engagement he railed against earlier. He seemed to disregard an opportunity for a promotion while disagreeing with General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), but the only thing that seems to make sense is that he changed his mind about that.The other point has to do with the consequence of failing to take the Anthill. What was it? The bitter history of World War I was that the opposing French and German forces waged a virtually immobile war with dug in positions that resulted in the deaths of millions. So by not taking the Anthill, an impossibility demonstrated in the story, nothing changed to influence this battle or the larger War, except to serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobeying orders.There's one more thing. The premise of the picture began with that conversation between Broulard and Mireau. When all was said and done, General Broulard comes out unfazed and unaffected by the very circumstances he set in motion. Possibly the most damning indictment of military intelligence to ever be portrayed on film, though virtually all of that nuance is lost if I were to rely on the handful of reviews I read before setting down my own.With all of that considered, Paths of Glory is a remarkable film illustrating the bitter irony of war when it's circumstantial victims boil down to real soldiers and not a faceless army. There's a considered ambiguity in the selection of three men to face a charge of cowardice based on relationships and circumstances that had gone before. Which makes Colonel Dax's (Kirk Douglas) choice of Lt. Roget (Wayne Morris) to command the firing squad a somewhat fitting decision in the midst of all the insanity otherwise.There are reasons nations go to war, sometimes for noble reasons and sometimes not. Soldiers know their duty in the chain of command, but I don't know if I've ever heard it expressed any better about how a soldier faces his mortality under battle conditions than in this film.

Norma Rae is a slightly fictionalized retelling of a real-life series of events (among other things, the names have been changed). It's set in a textile town in North Carolina. When a union organizer comes to town, the workers are very leery about talking with him or joining the union. However, eventually Norma Rae and a few others join. However, they face intimidation, job loss and perhaps worse if they join--even though this is a violation of the law. It seems in this town, what the mill owners want, the mill owners get. Can Norma Rae survive and win against a huge machine bent on crushing the union? This is a very compelling story--especially since these places were terrible places to work--with low wages, brown lung (a fatal disease caused by inhaling cotton fibers) and bosses who have a 'take it or leave it' attitude about the employees. Ironically, in real life, after the mill workers eventually unionized, slowly the mills began to close and jobs were sent abroad. Today you'd barely know that North Carolina was once a huge textile producing state.Overall, a very good film with a nice performance by Field and was her breakout movie role. I liked how the leading character was, at the beginning, a complete screw-up in life. But, as the film progressed, she grew up and became so much more. The plot was compelling, interesting and, at times, exciting. Not a great film but a very, very good one--and well worth your time.It's funny, but my wife seemed to have no interest in watching this film. Because her family comes from North Carolina and practically all of them worked in the mills decades ago she'd be interested...but she wasn't. Perhaps it's too depressing for her to think of her parents and grandparents working such a low paying and thankless job. Regardless, when she saw I was watching Norma Rae, she left to find something else to do!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 March 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the first film that earned Sally Field an Oscar--in the title role. Norma Rae is a slightly fictionalized retelling of a real-life series of events (among other things, the names have been changed). It's set in a textile town in North Carolina. When a union organizer comes to town, the workers are very leery about talking with him or joining the union. However, eventually Norma Rae and a few others join. However, they face intimidation, job loss and perhaps worse if they join--even though this is a violation of the law. It seems in this town, what the mill owners want, the mill owners get. Can Norma Rae survive and win against a huge machine bent on crushing the union? This is a very compelling story--especially since these places were terrible places to work--with low wages, brown lung (a fatal disease caused by inhaling cotton fibers) and bosses who have a 'take it or leave it' attitude about the employees. Ironically, in real life, after the mill workers eventually unionized, slowly the mills began to close and jobs were sent abroad. Today you'd barely know that North Carolina was once a huge textile producing state.Overall, a very good film with a nice performance by Field and was her breakout movie role. I liked how the leading character was, at the beginning, a complete screw-up in life. But, as the film progressed, she grew up and became so much more. The plot was compelling, interesting and, at times, exciting. Not a great film but a very, very good one--and well worth your time.It's funny, but my wife seemed to have no interest in watching this film. Because her family comes from North Carolina and practically all of them worked in the mills decades ago she'd be interested...but she wasn't. Perhaps it's too depressing for her to think of her parents and grandparents working such a low paying and thankless job. Regardless, when she saw I was watching Norma Rae, she left to find something else to do! By the way, this movie repeats an often repeated line as the Sheriff tells Norma Rae (after she's arrested) You got one phone call.... You CAN and do have more than one phone call--it's just a movie\/TV myth that it's only one.

It says things on many different levels, I will tell you what I read from itPenguin is a character as disgusting on the inside as he is on the outside (he is evil but we feel for him because of his tragic past and maybe think he is not the one to blame or that he might have good in him (don't judge book by its covers). We are actually manipulated like the people of Gotham that bought into his sad story from the newspapers. Here is the statement about what power the media and appearances have over us. The truth of the matter is, penguin has no morality in him as he is truly selfish and wants only to satisfy his own needs. Those are revenge, power, lust, etc. while violating the rights of others, so the definition of what we call evil. Some would say these are animal like tendencies and animals are generally more oriented towards themselves rather than being altruistic. Penguin at the end actually denounces his humanity and claims he wants to be an animal (a penguin).But at the end before he dies, we feel sorry for him because he is suffering. He was a human being after all and we feel compassion for another human being. Not because he was good, but because he was - human just like us. And we understand him, his lust for power or just lust or revenge are emotions understandable to us humans and we can relate to that and so we feel sorry for a fellow human. And the actual penguins at the end...maybe there is more to animals than we humans give them credit for? Maybe they feel and know things we only think humans could feel or know?So the Penguin character represents more than one thing like appearances are misguiding, humans and animals are not so different, and all that leads to us questioning our knowledge about this world of ours in general which leads us to admit how great mysteries of life are unknown to us.I also feel this movie establishes good and evil as actual forces of universe where Penquin abides by the laws of evil and Batman by the laws of good and so they clash in an inevitable battle. Because one Tim Burton's freak (Edward the Scissorhands) was good, but the other freak (Penguin)was evil. So being a freak has no actual say on whether you are good or evil, it is who you are inside that counts.I wouldn't do this movie justice without mentioning the title character, the Catwoman or Shreck or saying something about the music or the way Tim Burton tells the story visually by showing it in short scenes or frames where the music score follows perfectly - but now I did mention it.

She, in turn, is recruited as a spy to work alongside Cary Grant (Devlin) in Rio de Janeiro to uncover the plottings of Nazi Claude Rains (Alexander) and his gang. Her mission is to get close to Rains and report back. She marries him but Rains discovers what she is up to and colludes with his mother Leopoldine Konstatin (Mme Sebastian) to dispose of his new wife. Can Cary Grant save Bergman from what has been planned for her...? This film ends up as being worth the watch, despite a bad beginning. The story takes a while to get going as we are subjected to a rather dull romance played out between an unlikeable Cary Grant and a miscast Ingrid Bergman. This is not the first time I have seen Bergman miscast as a street girl - see Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde (1941). She has a vulnerable, feminine face that is very good at registering certain expressions, ie, realizing that something is wrong, paranoid glances, etc but she is totally inappropriate as a wild, drunk, party-going type. She does, however, come into her element once Claude Rains is introduced and her performance becomes credible as she is vital to all the scenes of suspense, a mood that she is expert at playing. Cary Grant, however, is just unlikeable. He becomes likable at the end when he goes in to save Bergman but this is only because we know he is Cary Grant who is likable in all his other films. His character has an attitude problem and given that he is a spy and schooled in the ways of being a spy, his treatment of Bergman is totally unconvincing when she is given the assignment of getting close to Rains.My two favourite of the cast are Leopoldine Konstatin and Claude Rains. They stand out for me as they manage to let the audience know that they have a few more layers of nastiness up their sleeve and you don't quite know what they are capable of. Konstatin, in particular, is good at being evil.Get past the beginning nonsense and the film gets it's act together with some tense scenes and at the end of the film, you feel that it has been worth the watch.

The hybrid result is the 95 minute eyesore known as Flashdance.Alex(Jennifer Beals) is a welder at a steel mill, complete with hard hat for authenticity, during the daytime and at night she is a dancer of yet undiscovered natural grace and ability. She lives alone with her dog, Grunt; I am not making this up. Oh, and by the way, she has been accepted into a prestigious dance academy, how could I forget. It only gets worse. Here comes the father figure, Nick(Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel plant, happens to see her performing what looks like a semi erotic number on stage at a local club. Nick gets horny for his young employee. He and his ex wife fight over his new youthful trophy girlfriend, Alex. More stupidity follows and my only advice is to avoid this long form video and read a book instead.

M topped off all the other foreign films I've seen and showed me what a master Fritz Lang is and how Peter Lorre is a brilliant actor!Fritz Lang's M is one of cinema's great achievements. An unmistakable classic, this heavy German thriller was highly criticized upon its original release, whereas today it's never looked, sounded and been more exciting than ever. Fritz Lang's famous name is most often associated with Metropolis, hailed as one of the greatest silent films ever made, but M is equally enthralling and brilliant, if not better. Directing with an unmistakable style and outstanding effort, Lang smartly sets up the thrilling story and shows the script through unforgettable visuals, terrific psychological suspense and brilliant staging of the murders, the police effort and the thrilling chase and trial scenes.In his finest performance, Peter Lorre proved to me that he is one of the great actors of the classic film era. Portraying such a complex psychopath, Lorre makes the audience hate, as well as feel pity for his character, which is an incredibly difficult task. Performing silent for most of the film, Lorre finally speaks in the outstanding closing Trial scene, where he unforgettably pleads insanity in a speechless moment. Lang and his wife Thea Von Harbou collaborated on the thrilling script, and used both sound and silent moments to tell the horrifying psychological story of Franz Becker, (the beginning of Lorre's great villain roles) a psychopathic serial child-killer who causes a frightening uproar in Germany. He is wanted by the police and citizens, yet the police can't get much further in their case. Becker's killing doesn't only disturb the large police force and four and a half million citizens, but disrupts the city's criminals at a point where they decide they must find the killer and eventually suspect Becker.A true achievement by all means, Lang's M is one of my favourite psychological thrillers. The brilliant staging, terrific use of sound, (despite there being no musical score) and inspiring camera, acting and writing techniques all help shape this thriller as a cult-classic. An unusual piece of storytelling, M is presented through a series of montage like techniques that add up to the portrait of a German city in terror before being converted into a true mystery-thriller in the second half.The film's oddities can get picture down and make it too slow and boring to comprehend, yet there hardly worth criticizing. The lighting and use of shadows make the film look like a foreign noir, and the social-drama and satire help the film remain entertaining even when it seems to drag on. The screenplay is entirely unforgettable, as it takes a risky story and makes that into a creative emphasize of Becker's psychosis and has the murders and chases all the more entertaining. Lang and his wife's work makes you both hate and feel sorry for the villain which is a hard task to do. Their work has some terrific lines of dialogue and features some brilliant scenes (especially the final courtroom sequence) which allows Lang to give outstanding camera work.Like I said at the beginning of my review, Lorre is brilliant and gives his finest work. His portrayal of Becker never gets boring and leaves you speechless right after his brilliant trial finale. He is superb as a villain and floats hauntingly through the various psychological scenes. His bug-eyes make him all the more frightening and his expressionistic style of his performance make him horribly remarkable.Fritz Lang's unique work may be his greatest. The picture is a heck of a thriller and his directing perfectly compliments the film's darkness. His strange thrilling style is best-shown here as he gives some of his most famous haunting angles and shows great movement in scenes with multiple characters. He also uses the lighting, shadows and sounds to express the film's horrifying reality and help stage the film brilliantly. Altogether, Lang's M is one of foreign cinemas greatest and a frighteningly real psychological treat!

Well it wouldn't be a shock if the director of Sunny was influenced by this movie. The dialogue however didn't seem as natural sometimes and seemed like watching some southern novel that isn't really down to earth. It just didn't seem like what a group of women would be saying to each other, but than again the story switches back from the 70's to 90's when it comes to the characters. The dialogue just seemed too safe to be natural despite the sexual stuff and it's a girly movie. Since the 4 main character are 4 girls in the 70's and women in the 90's. Anyways the story is about 4 women getting together after spending there childhood together and reminisce of the past and adventures they had together. Although most of it takes place during a summer. Now I am not a fan of Rosie O'Donnell, to be honest I think she is irritating to watch sometimes. Her character is like the main character or leader of the pack and I thought it was ridiculous her younger version would be played by Christina Ricci. Not that I am a fan of Ricci either, but the comparison is too big to the point you can get confused who is who sometimes when it comes to the younger version with the older version or visa versa. So yeah I don't know if Rosie picked her younger version but it's just absurd. Overall this is a touching movie that most girls and maybe some boys will probably enjoy watching and parents will probably enjoy it as well. It really does give off a nostalgic feel because of the friendship, even if you didn't go through the same things the girls did in the movie. I give this movie a 6.8 because the development of the characters aren't done all that great and somethings are not explained and not for good reasons. Some say this is a female version of Stand By Me and I agree to certain extent.6.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2012","score":"","review":" Watching this reminded me of the Korean movie Sunny although this came out first.
