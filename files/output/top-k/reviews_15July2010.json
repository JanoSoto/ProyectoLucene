That is not the case for Bride of Chucky, its a fresh start over after the last miserable mess. Its got great voice acting by the dolls once again and it revisits some scary moments that made the first two memorable. Though it still takes the dreaded Comedy factor in Horror a little too far, there are still enough jumps and catchy one liners that make the film good (the air bag scene and the Martha Stewart insult).The plot involves Tiffany (Tilly) a women interested in voodoo and talking to the dead, try to revive the old Chucky doll after, of course, being killed in CP3. She believe she failed, but sooner than later is killed by Chucky and puts her soul in a female doll. Now Chucky has a girlfriend, which then, like the title suggests, later becomes a beloved butchering bride. Chucky and his new bride begin going on a killing rampage traveling with two rebellious dating teens which leads to all sorts of slaughterings and gory fun. This film can be a little cliché, but its satisfying, scary, and hilarious to see two dolls run around killing people. What fun Bride of Chucky can be.Part of the prize that stems from this movie's greatness is the Honk Kong director Ronny Yu. He worked on several Honk Kong movies before starting working on American movies in 1991 with Rapid Fire. He would later become famous for directing the ultimate Horror match-up between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees in the iconic Freddy vs. Jason, direct a Jet Li film three years later, and even do an episode for the NBC series Fear Itself which is definitely a must see. He is a great, underrated director, but it seems that the movies he does gets more recognition than himself. Bride of Chucky is one of my favorite movies to mix the Satire\/Horror but use it in a limited form, so we're not just saying c'mon gimmie come scares. Still being succeeded in the best department by the first two, its hard not to call Bride of Chucky a fun Horror film and the best of it's kind.Starring Jennifer Tilly, Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile, John Ritter, Alexis Arquette, and Brad Dourif.

Its proponents claim it's an absolute masterpiece and the greatest thing since canned beer, while its detractors say it's boring, pretentious, and not scary in the slightest. Where do I fall? Somewhere in the middle I'd say.First the good news from a technical standpoint, Suspiria is lovely to look at. The European locations are elaborate and interesting, the set pieces are creepy as hell, the film is beautifully photographed, and Argento's choice of color palette (lots of reds and blues) give it an otherworldly look all its own. I was less enthused by the constant pulsing, throbbing electronic music score by frequent Argento collaborators Goblin, which starts out suitably creepy but becomes more intrusive and eventually annoying as the film rolls on.The bad news story-wise Suspiria isn't very interesting and falls rather flat. An American girl (Jessica Harper) enrolls at an exclusive Ballet academy in Germany as a student. When she arrives at the school in a howling wind and rain storm, a girl rushes out of the building past her, and the camera follows this girl until she is eventually killed by an unseen murderer (in a fabulously brutal scene involving a knife, a rope and a stained glass skylight).As Harper settles into life at the Academy, strange things begin to happen, a few more bodies turn up, maggots fall from the ceiling, and eventually she figures out that All Is Not Right Here. When her closest friend at the school disappears (the viewer already knows that she fell into a room full of razor wire - OUCH!) she begins to investigate the odd goings-on, and eventually finds out that the Academy is actually a front for a hidden coven of witches, and that she's scheduled to be their next innocent victim. The last fifteen minutes or so are the best part of the movie, as she frantically tries to escape her fate.So is Suspiria worth a watch? I guess it depends on your tolerance for the artsy fartsy. Pacing is frustratingly mid-tempo; Suspiria is a fairly short film (just over 90 minutes) but I found myself wishing someone would just step on the gas pedal and speed things up more than once during its run time. The dialogue is mostly awkward and unrealistic, due to the fact that like most Italian horror films, it was recorded in a multitude of languages by the international cast and then dubbed into English (by people whose native language is not English) in post production. Gorehounds will, of course, enjoy the murder sequences (which are presented in lovingly gooey detail) but they are so few and far between that most of that crowd will be bored stiff while waiting for the next body to fall.In the end I'd say I enjoyed Suspiria to a certain extent but wasn't as impressed or blown away as I'd hoped I would be. I can definitely dig Argento's visual style but I can't say I'm as enamored with his storytelling ability.It was recently announced that an Americanized remake of Suspiria is in the works, and of course the horror community is tearing out its collective hair at the idea of remaking this classic. I'm probably one of the few who thinks that the Suspiria saga could benefit from a few modern tweaks and it could end up being a pretty damn good movie. I guess we'll see.

If anybody has the art of terror flawlessly mastered, it's Stephen King. The man can make even the most hokey concept terrifying, through his mastery of word use and his deeply intricate characterizations which make the horror feel more close to home. One of the finest examples of this is Pet Sematary. On page, it's as scary as can be. Naturally, it would be quite difficult to fully capture the novel's full terror in a film, but with the help of Stephen King's faithful screenplay and competent direction and acting, Pet Sematary is as scary an adaptation as we could possibly want.Pet Sematary is a relentlessly brutal horror story about a close, loving family whose world is gradually torn apart in the most devastating and horrible manner imaginable. King spares none of his characters the worst possible fates, even fates worse than death. I won't spoil anything for those who don't know what that entails. Suffice to say, you may want to sleep with the lights on for a few nights after this one. It's rough, bleak, unforgiving stuff.As a fan of the book, all I can say is, well done. It's as realistically faithful to the book in all the ways it needs to be, and some of the scares translate very well to the screen. The character Zelda, for example. Terrifying in the book, just as scary in the film. And the story's most tragically horrible event is as shocking and upsetting as it was in the book. As in the book, death is dealt with in a disturbingly frank manner. Psychologically, this is as harsh as it gets.Naturally, the film does pale in comparison to the book and isn't without its flaws. Stephen King's style isn't easy to translate to the screen as a lot of his plots are driven by what the characters are thinking, and King taps directly into their minds and tells us how they rationalize some very bad decisions. Since this isn't nearly as easy to accomplish on film, the characterization suffers. The acting makes up for it for the most part. It's nothing spectacular, but the actors are competent and as likable as they should be.Overall, despite the flaws, I highly recommend Pet Sematary, though I'd read the book first. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't handle extreme grimness or a little graphic gore. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2010","score":"","review":" Few horror experiences can compare with reading Stephen King's Pet Sematary for the first time.

Naturally, it would be quite difficult to fully capture the novel's full terror in a film, but with the help of Stephen King's faithful screenplay and competent direction and acting, Pet Sematary is as scary an adaptation as we could possibly want.Pet Sematary is a relentlessly brutal horror story about a close, loving family whose world is gradually torn apart in the most devastating and horrible manner imaginable. King spares none of his characters the worst possible fates, even fates worse than death. I won't spoil anything for those who don't know what that entails. Suffice to say, you may want to sleep with the lights on for a few nights after this one. It's rough, bleak, unforgiving stuff.As a fan of the book, all I can say is, well done. It's as realistically faithful to the book in all the ways it needs to be, and some of the scares translate very well to the screen. The character Zelda, for example. Terrifying in the book, just as scary in the film. And the story's most tragically horrible event is as shocking and upsetting as it was in the book. As in the book, death is dealt with in a disturbingly frank manner. Psychologically, this is as harsh as it gets.Naturally, the film does pale in comparison to the book and isn't without its flaws. Stephen King's style isn't easy to translate to the screen as a lot of his plots are driven by what the characters are thinking, and King taps directly into their minds and tells us how they rationalize some very bad decisions. Since this isn't nearly as easy to accomplish on film, the characterization suffers. The acting makes up for it for the most part. It's nothing spectacular, but the actors are competent and as likable as they should be.Overall, despite the flaws, I highly recommend Pet Sematary, though I'd read the book first. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't handle extreme grimness or a little graphic gore. 8\/10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"15 July 2010","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Its almost unbelievable that a franchise can go from two close to masterpiece Horror films to one film that just spits on the entire franchise. Childs Play 3 is the obvious third installment to the doll killer franchise and its undoubtedly the worst to come. Its a poorly acted, odd Horror film that you consider yourself lucky to see because of the awful darkness of the movie itself. Screenwriter Don Mancini confessed to completely and totally running out of ideas for the series which is no doubt why after this one there was a seven year gap until Bride of Chucky, and then a six year gap until Seed of Chucky was made. Seems like ideas for killer dolls that need to find a human soul were hard to come by.This is a weird one to explain, The Good Guy Doll Factory has reopened and reassembled Chucky which still has the soul of Charles Lee Ray in the doll. Andy is now 16 and has been shipped off to Military School and apparently has been in more foster homes then just the Simpsons', and has failed in all of them. Ronald Tyler, a younger recruit takes the Chucky doll to Andy, but in a failed attempt to get possessed, goes on a killing spree again to find Andy and try to transfer his soul. Its the same movie in a different environment, but just unrealistically stupid.What bothers me is two things. One, its so dark in this carnival, military camp, trying to see whats going on is harder than understanding it. Most of the time, Im clueless and just assuming what is happening. Another thing, is we get no mention to what happens to Kyle (Andy's foster sister in CP2). We get zero information. At least in the second one they say that the mother is in psychiatric therapy. So overall, this is shockingly the worst Horror film I've ever seen. There's no adrenaline pumping scenes, and everything is just dark (quite literally). This still amazes me that a franchise can go from excellent to awful in just three movies. If a franchise makes it the third film they should put a lot of effort into it, not just throw some back ass movie together with almost no sense made. Maybe around 1991 they were learning movie sequels attract a lot of money no matter the plot. At very least we get Brad Dourif's excellent voice talents.Starring Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves, Jeremy Sylvers, Peter Haskell, Dakin Matthews, Travis Fine, Dean Jacobson, and Brad Dourif.

It was only natural he would make this film in which his awe and admiration for what became his playground is captured in vivid images which only could come from one of the most important masters of the Italian cinema of all times. The film is both a comedy and a sort of documentary in which we watch the director, himself, performing the role of what he did behind the camera, for our benefit.The film is autobiographical in many aspects. We watch as the young Federico, an aspiring journalist arrives in Rome from his native Rimini. His new home is in an apartment where he has been recommended to stay by relatives. The place was pure chaos with the many different Roman characters he found there. The heat of the summer brought everyone to the streets where dining was an art. The food in great proportions in spite of a war going on. Fellini is an observer of his new surroundings. The woman street singer that goes through the tables, reminds us a little bit of Gelsomina, an immortal character created by the director, and also of Cabiria, the fun loving prostitute.Rome, being a the chaotic place it was, is presented at a dizzying speed by the director who has taken his camera outside along a busy highway as fans from Naples arrive to attend a soccer match against the local team. The autostrada is some is a metaphor that emphasizes the confusion and the chaos anyone feels when arriving to Rome. Fellini ends it all in a massive car tie up in the street around the Colosseum. Fellini renders homage to his city in the last sequence as well taking the viewer through a night ride by motorcyclists that passes by all the best known monuments of the city.We are also taken to a neighborhood music hall that presents vaudeville acts. The atmosphere was typical of the one found in such places where everyone went to have a good time with their friends and neighbors. These places attracted a rough crowd that made a tough place for performers in which to act. Theater in Italy, although not remotely close to the scene Fellini shows, is a place where the real drama is not presented on stage; the real show is given by all the people that go to be seen without shame of behaving in strange ways.The subway excavation sequence offers an interesting aside in which the present day and the olden times come together when the workers discover a Roman home underground. The magnificence of the images that are discovered reveal the proud past of one of the oldest and most artistic civilizations of all times. Alas, it is only short lived because of the air that penetrates the hidden frescoes found under the rubble make them disappear.The brothel also played a big part in the sentimental education of the maestro. We have seen prostitutes in all of of Fellini's films in one way, or another. He wants to take us to two different kinds of pleasure houses, one for the common citizen and a high class one that closes up when important celebrities decide to have private fun. Fellini juxtaposes the scenes at the brothels with a gathering of the Catholic Church higher ups that have come to Princess Domitilla's palace for an ornate fashion show for ecclesiastical fashion that is decadent in the excesses presented. Like with other Italian creators, Fellini had an ongoing love-hatred by the institution that has ruled the lives of Italians for centuries.Fellini's Roma was a great creation by Federico Fellini. It is as important as some of the other films because it captured the soul of the city Fellini loved so much. This was possible because of the images cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno, a amazing photographer of many of the director's work. Nino Rota's musical score is also an asset in the film.

Three lawless gunslingers are after it. They continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours.So much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.Director Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel.

There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion.

Enough with that, lets discuss the film. Its what every TV show movie adaptation is. Just an extended episode of the series. Though the sequel is something that is a step in the right direction to be different from the series. With this though, it's fitting to be a full length movie because to chop this down to a thirty minute film would be impossible. Though, this is a favorable TV show adaptation in many ways.The plot is basic, but may be complex to a kid age five or six who this is targeted for. Parents may need to explain somethings about babies after the hospital scene. Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil are our protagonists in this ride and Tommy's mother Didi is having a baby. When welcoming what was thought to be a baby girl, is now a baby boy. They go with the name Dillon Prescott Pickles and now Tommy has a baby brother.Instead of being a nice companion he becomes a big nightmare for the whole Pickles family because Dil will not stop crying. Both parents Didi and Stu are too focused on Dil to pay attention to Tommy which is how every family gets when a new child is born. Phil, Lil, and Chuckie get tired of the crying and put Dil in the new Reptarmobile which Tommy's dad made in an effort to take him back to the hospital because he's broked. Tommy does the adult thing of trying to resist, but after some odd results, the four wind up lost in the forest with no one to help them.The movie gets heartbreaking in a few sequences and tends to squeeze a tear out of audiences. Some of the humor and references will possibly be way over young kids' heads which is basically how every kids' movie can be sometimes. Watching this for the first time in about eight years I pointed out a lot more and understood more and more of it.

If a 500 year old vampire count existed, he would almost surely have spoken the way Lugosi speaks in the movie (though in Stoker's book his diction is precise and not noticeably regional). The first half of Dracula is brilliant; it's everything following his arrival in London that brings the movie to a screeching halt. Once it becomes slow and stagey, it loses much of the effectiveness of the early scenes. For this, blame must be laid with director Browning; Lugosi holds up his end of things well enough- it's the man behind the camera who drops the ball.

From his work on the original Twilight Zone series to The Omega Man (a screenplay of his I am Legend) and his many wonderful, claustrophobic novels I was hooked. There are few modern (ish) ghost stories that are worthy to be included with the works of Dickens, Henry James and Shirley Jackson; perhaps King and Ann Rivers Siddons The House Next Door, but before them Matheson with this novel and certainly A Stir of Echos. It was from Matheson that I learned to love the Horror Novel and through him became a fan of Poe and all the other wonderful works in that genre.The film, itself, is visually produced in the style of the Hammer Films that had become so popular in the United Kingdom and the United States. With many establishing shots of an English manor house, Gothic looking scenery and large cavernous sets. The sets themselves are masterfully decorated with many easter eggs if one was to look for them (pay attention to the titles of the books on the books shelves). At the time the Major American film distributors were crying our for pictures like the Dracula Series from Hammer and it provided a chance for independents to get in on the Horror wave of the 1960's and early 1970's. Even Hammer, was never, quite able to catch the nuance of the ghost story, but here, television director John Hough, shows some style and pathos ( I have to admit thought that at times it resembles a television production instead of a film, similar to the Dark Shadows films, which were also directed by a television veteran Dan Curtis, that were released during the same time period). It doesn't quite achieve the claustrophobia of the novel, even Matheson himself is not able to translate his visual descriptions to screenplays (except perhaps in his teleplay for the Twilight Zone episode Nightmare at 2000 Feet), but there is a certain feeling of dread that builds up throughout the film and has a fine pay off in the end. Roddy McDowall was in the post period of his Planet of the Apes films and was giving some pretty desperate performances at the time (mostly on television), but gives a wonderful performance here. As corny as the ending may appear now, with Mr. McDowall confronting the evil spirit of Emeric Belasco, it was thrilling at its time.I hope you give the film a chance and enjoy it for its place in cinema history and take a chance to read the Matheson works.

It was unknown and neglected when in theaters in 1975. But now cherished, loved, and welcomed by a heap of cult and film fanatics around the globe. It's now being sung and danced to in the theaters by people dressed and resembling the characters in the movie, like Tim Curry's famous role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter. I was lucky enough to see it with a close filmmaker friend, Brian Patrick O'Toole (screenwriter for film Atlas Shrugged and producer for Dog Soldiers) who basically made comments and remarks throughout the film. Hes seen the film over 200 times and has to be the biggest fan I know. I've caught his disease.A criminologist tells the story of a newly engaged couple by the names of Brad Majors and Janet Weiss who become lost with a flat tire on a rainy night. They find a castle, asking for help, but are soon victims of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania who's minions are his sister Magenta, servant Riff Raff, and a fan named Columbia. Numerous twists and turns go along with this film, but the fun comes from the enjoyment had by the musical numbers and bizarre acting.

This movie has made $139.8 million dollars and probably didn't even make $20,000 back in 1975. This is true beauty film-making, even with a weird premise. This is a movie that I can say, I have never seen as many soundtracks for. There's the original, the Say it! Karaoke CD, the audience participation CD, the re-release CD, the instrumental, etc. DVDs are a little less. The 25th anniversary tape in 1990, the new DVD, and a future Blu-Ray this year. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sequel....well there is.The sequel is called Shock Treatment that was released in 1981. It wasn't a strong sequel from what I hear. Tim Curry originally planned to cast in it, singing all the songs written for him, but refused last minute, and then the singers were replaced and they got new ones. It only made $2 million dollars which is dirt compared to the money the first film made. It even performed worse than RHPS's first run which is hysterical because it seemed if anything, Shock Treatment's gross would have been larger than biblical proportions compared to RHPS. But, it flopped, miserably, end of story.Now to be fair, critics hate this movie, and my parents aren't to fond of it. But this is the ultimate test. If you can sit through this film, hating it, and still having the nerve to shut it off or walk out, but make it through, that proves you can make it through any film. But I for one enjoyed the film and hope MTV Films reconsiders with the remake.A remake of The Neverending Story is also in the works, and though I haven't seen it, I heard its a flawless film. Same goes with RHPS, remakes never do the goal they should, make the original film better. No remake is better than the original, except for maybe Scarface. But 99% of the time, remakes fail. So since The Rocky Horror Picture Show is such an overwhelming success, MTV Films thinks they can get a piece of the pie by making a remake of it.
