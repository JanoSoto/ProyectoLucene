Not because I was sick from the gross-out gags, but because I was sore from laughing so hard and so often.  Yes, the humor is, in most cases, rather crass, but this is easy to forgive because the parody is so well done.  The Wayans' intelligently capture the shallow spirit of teen horror flicks like the Scream trilogy and lampoon them perfectly.  Mainstream (non-teen) films are also thrown into the mix, resulting in hilarious parodies of movies like The Sixth Sense and The Matrix.  I'm not normally a fan of shock humor, but the reason it works so well here is that the Wayans brothers do not *rely* on it alone, but use it  as spice only.  Beneath the gross-out gags is a foundation of intelligent parody. The humor is non-stop.  If you can take the crude adult jokes, I highly recommend this very funny movie.  Be prepared to laugh loud, and laugh hard.  And, maybe even feel a little guilty about what you're laughing at.  My rating 9 out of 10 stars.

Meanwhile, he's saying, It was just a booty call!!  That was kinda funny.  2) The Save the Last Dance parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves.  But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags.  Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone.  For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay.  This was hilarious.  But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny.  This is the pattern of the whole film.

Like clockwork they bring egghead, elitist critics out of the woodwork and send them into tizzies about logic, acting and depth as it they expected something Shakespearian out of a Joel Silver action movie about computer hacking and terrorism.  It's one of those movies that sends critics on tirades about the state of movies today as if every movie released now is mindless, ultra-violent trash and every movie made in the past was modest and sensible art.  In actuality, the reason I like Swordfish so much is because it is so rare.  At the time of it's release the reverse is actually true- MOST action movies nowadays homogenize themselves into a commercially friendly PG-13. Movies like XXX, The Fast and the Furious, Armageddon and Sena's own Gone and Sixty Seconds would have been much more interesting had they been sectioned off as adults only flicks and allowed to do what they want instead of sticking a bunch of sex and violence under the radar of a teenagers PG-13 movie.  However, Swordfish is none of these things. It is visceral entertainment- nothing more. It is more of a throwback to sensational, hyper-violent action movies of the 60s and 70s. It doesn't want to hear your story. It is not in competition with any Oscar contenders, it is mindless, intentionally ridiculous, sensational and proud of it.  It is a top-notch guilty pleasure. Take it for what it is, not what you want it to be. If you took this movie seriously the joke is on you.  The opening scene features a well written monologue by John Travolta complaining about the lack of realism in today's movies.  From that moment on Swordfish goes on to be one of the most convoluted and absurd things I've seen in a long time.  It seems to be having a lot of fun throwing one extreme and nonsensical idea after another at the audience- as a result the fun is infectious.  Much of the fun of this movie is laughing along with it as to how silly it is.  It hits all the points crucial to making a great guilty pleasure. There are plenty of explosions (the slow motion opening is an eye-popper), bloody shootouts, sex and nudity without any false dramatic pretense.  Skip Woods dialogue is served best when pointing out the films absurdities (I just watched that madman murder 8 men in the street). The visuals are stunning. The cinematography is glossy and the whole film is washed out in this retro yellow palette. Paul Oakenfield's music (featuring Lapdance and the end credit Get out of My Life Now) and the rest of the soundtrack (50,000 Watts of F---ing) is absolutely perfect.  The pace is slick and quick and the story cycles around in a nifty non-linear format.  Obviously, the acting is nothing that was Oscar snubbed, but everybody is on the same page with the director's vision.  Travolta hams it up fantastically (rescuing himself form  recent bombs) and Hugh Jackman (who finds himself running around in a suit and tie with a rocket launcher before it's all over) is a likeable reluctant hero.  I rented it expecting trash and got exactly what I expected. But it is superior to a lot of other guilty pleasures because it does have an imagination.  Yes, in all the madness and mayhem there is some gruesome creativity at work.  Obviously not for all tastes, if you want a truly good movie you can intellectually discuss with your friends go search in the Independent Films section- there are plenty of great one's out there.

I wish I could recommend this movie more ethusiastically.  It has Peter Sellers during his best period, Blake Edwards in his metier, a properly comic setting, symbols of its times such as painted elephants. Painted elephants???Well, that's the sort of thing that dampens my enthusiasm.  One painted elephant in a comedy like this is one painted elephant too many.There is only enough dialogue to link the episodes together.  There are only a few verbal gags, most of the comedy is physical, so one thinks of Jacques Tati immediately and the association is justified.  Sellers is a clumsy Auslander invited by error to a Hollywood party attended mostly by rather stuffy people.  (He's an Indian for no discernible reason except that it gives Sellers a chance to show us he can do a Hindi accent.)  Like Tati he blunders all over the place, meaning no harm.  He slides off pebbled roofs, falls into swimming pools, sticks his hand into a container of caviar, messes with the electronic controls and causes a pissing mannequin to drench the back of a lady's expensive dress, flips a roast squab onto another woman's elegantly piled hair, and so forth.  Come to think of it, the movie owes a lot to The Pink Panther too.  Inspector Clouseau goes to a party.All or most of these episodes ought to be hilarious but somehow they seem more silly than anything else.  In The Pink Panther Clouseau hangs his trench coat out of sight in a closet and we hear it slide to the floor. It's amusing, since it's consistent with the other things that happen to him.  Most of the jokes in The Party reach that level.  Amusing.  But nothing as outrageous as the scene in Panther in which Clouseau asks his sleepless wife if she'd like him to do that special thing for her that always relaxes her -- then in the darkness we hear him begin to play a squeaky violin.  Or the scene in which R. J. Wagner hides in the bathtub and emerges wearing a sweater that now droops down around his ankles.  It's as if The Party is made up of a list of weaker gags that had been left out of Panther.  When the host's gawky girl shows up with her hippie friends and a juvenile elephant painted with flower power slogans, which must then be washed off in the swimming pool so that everyone can jump in and splash around in the foam, things get stretched pretty far.  And the arrival of the Russian band seems like desperation, a chance to play frantic Russian music.But if it's silly it's also distracting and has its moments.  These are aided by the performances.  The cigar-smoking host -- Clutterbuck? -- is perfect as Sellers tries to formally apologize to him for some gaffe. Clutterbuck is engaged in a polite conversation with another guest while being pestered from behind by Sellers.  He repeatedly turns to Sellers trying to dismiss him -- Pefectly all right.  Happens all the time. Forget about it.  Just have a good time.  And Clutterbuck does all this in a gruff, matter-of-fact voice, without expression, one hundred percent straight, while puffing his pre-Castro cigar.  Carol Wayne, a bouffant blonde, looks like a living Barbie doll.  (What a shame.)  Claudine Longet has the wispy voice and equally wispy manner of a gamine.  (Ditto.)  Most of the other actors are more important because of the way they look than because of anything they do.  The monstrous cowboy figure looks great but doesn't do or say anything amusing.  The drunken waiter has his moments. I enjoyed Hank Mancini's music though, a simple quartet led by a velvety tenor saxophone.  Oh, I know it's not jazz in any pure sense, but who cares?  It sounds relatively sophisticated and is fun to listen to, as opposed, say, to a pianist playing Liebestraum over and over.You know the most outrageously funny moment in the film?  Perhaps the only outrageously funny moment in the film?  At the very beginning, Sellers is playing the lazarooshian beggar in a remake of Gunga Din.  The scene being filmed is the one in which Din saves the regiment by blowing the charge on his bugle and warning the British soldiers of the ambush awaiting them. In the original, Din is shot by the Thugees and dies, his goal achieved. Here, Sellers begins to blow his bugle and is shot.  The call trails off on a feathery note as Sellers collapses.  However, he's down but not yet out. Like the masked killer in a slasher movie he rises again and again, each time his calls becoming less coherent, turning to little spurts and weak random zephyrs, like farts finally, and still he rises and blows as the Thugs continue to shoot him.  It's a moment of monumental and hilarious excess.  A shame the rest of the film didn't live up to those few opening minutes.

Boy was I wrong. The first 15 minutes were awesome, edge of your seat thrills, and scary. The rest was just as scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. My favorite Halloween movies are now Halloween the original, Halloween H2O, and now Halloween Resurrection. The rest of them aren't that great. The music was creepy like usual. The acting was good. I although had a little trouble with Sean Patrick, and the guy off of American Pie. I would watch them and think of Save the Last dance, and American Pie. But other than that this was such a great movie. I understand why people would be upset about what happen to Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie, but honestly if her brother can live through all the sequels why can't she. And plus the ending of Resurrection has an opening for another Halloween film. It would be so cool if Michael and Laurie Strode were in another Halloween Film and this time they duke it out one last time. You never know. it could happen. But moving on. This was an excellent sequel. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the whole Michael Myers movies, or a good horror movie.

(I've always felt the first was one everyone likes because on some level they know they have to; B2 is one you can like even though you know you shouldn't.)When people review this film, there's always the requisite mention of Michelle Pfieffer's sexiness as Catwoman.  But I think one reason she worked so well was because she was truly SCARY as well.  The Penguin, hard as he tries, is too gross to be scary.  With Catwoman, any dime-a-dozen actress could've done the oversexed dominatrix act (see Uma Thurman's crash-and-burn Poison Ivy in the later 4th film).  Michelle somehow made Selina (post-mortem) truly eerie.  Her wish for revenge against her murderer boss Max Shreck, feels completely justified, as opposed to the Penguin's vengeful act against the haves of Gotham, with their happy families. That's a nice idea, but too oblique to really identify with.  Selina is completely relatable as a working stiff, shoved over the edge, turned bloodthirsty hellcat.A mention must be made here of the creepy subtext that seems to go on between Selina and Max-- both before, during, and after he tries to kill her.  The writers were probably trying to give Selina more of an abused wife facet.  This hint is impossible to ignore in the office scene, when Max catches Selina going through his files, and slowly manuvers her over to the window he's going to drop her out of, quietly scaring the crap out of her the whole while.  When he leans in, we wonder if he's going to kiss her or bite her (a direct allusion to the other Max Shreck-- the actor who played the vampire Nosferatu in silent films).  It's a skin-crawly scene-- perfect amounts dread and shock as the inevitable comes to pass, yet full of weird chemistry between Michelle and (the awesome) Christopher Walken-- almost more than in any of the later scenes with Catwoman\/Selina and Batman\/Bruce.Bottom line one of my favorites from that era.  A stranger Batman than the first, and definitely better than any since.

It has great moments of comedy which slip quickly into tremendous moments of horror. That novel as it is could never feasibly be addapted into a live action anything.However, upon viewing the film, I was quite impressed and happy with it. I'm not an unrealistic person, so I understand that they had to cut out scenes and characters and subplots to condense it for the film. Overall, of course, it lost some of its greatest moments which are in the ironic humor of the narrative style of the book. But it was not a bad film at all. In fact, I thought it was one of the best adaptations I have seen. I think almost everything you see on screen happens in the book.   Apart from that, it was extremely well casted. The characters were just as I have envisioned them in my head while reading the novel (except that Major Major shrank about a foot... but that's not matter, because Bob Newhart was great anyway). The cinematography was beautiful, the acting was awesome (Alan Arkin was perfect), and the flashbacks to Snowden were done stylishly and surrealistically. Basically, it's a good movie. But it's an even better movie if you've read the book, and you know exactly what is going on in some of the characters' heads and what is going on outside of the scenes we see in the film. Overall, I think this is the best anyone could have done with this adaptation, and I applaud the filmmakers for that.
