Lyle Lovett is awful -- why does Altman continue to hire him?  He only worked in THE PLAYER, and that was just at times.The camerawork here is shoddy, and some scenes are staged as badly as a high school play.  Other times, a camera cuts quickly to an inappropriate close-up, giving a weak line (or line reading) too much weight for its own good.Liv Tyler, however, does very well.  The one moment of authenticity throughout the film is the scene with Dutton on the police station's stairs. Something very real happens here, and it makes the viewer long for when an entire Altman movie hit such emotional honesty -- McCABE AND MRS. MILLER, NASHVILLE, even THE LONG GOODBYE.  Sorry.  This film is as fake as the stupid bit Tyler's character has to do with her truck -- parking on the sidewalk, getting a ticket, crumpling it. Hogwash.
