In the movie, Mr. Jones starts off by convincing a construction manager to hire him for the day, and during that conversation he shows signs of being bipolar. He is very keen on picking up on small signals, and also he talks very rapidly and energetically. Once he started to work, it became clearer that he had a problem. He started to walk tight rope style on top of a building stating that he was going to fly off the top of the house and gently land on the street. After that situation he was admitted to a psychiatric ward and was misdiagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was then medicated with 10 mg. of Haldol, and kept for 72 hours because of the mandatory 5150 hold. For the next couple of scenes he showed what manic episodes look like. Towards the middle of the movie he started to show signs of major depressive disorder, which is part of bipolar. He was lethargic and very agitated with everyone and everything that was going on around him. Like most people with bipolar, he enjoyed and embraced his manic episodes (his highs), and that is why he refused to take his lithium. When Mr. Jones was going through his therapy with Dr. Elizabeth, he told her that he couldn't go on taking his medications, because he missed his highs. It seemed that it put him in a state of depression because he wasn't able to be as sharp as he once was. I believed that Richard Gere played the role of an individual with bipolar to a tee, and this movie also did a great job showing the ethical issues of psychiatry (even if they didn't mean to).Dr. Elizabeth did many unethical things throughout this movie. The first thing that she did wrong was, when she was talking to Mr. Jones she put her hand on his shoulder, and gave him a telephone number to reach her at. This is inappropriate, because there should be no physical contact between a psychiatrist and their patient. Another example of her unethical behavior was when she gave him a ride home, and then took him out for something to eat. I know that Hollywood wanted to make this a love story, but no psychiatrist in their right mind would take a patient out to eat and give them a ride home. That type of interaction is too personal, and is considered very unethical by most psychiatrists. Another situation that stands out in my mind is when she started to investigate the past of Mr. Jones. As a therapist you need consent in order to be able to dig into your patients past records. Toward the end of the movie Dr. Elizabeth kept getting closer and closer to Mr. Jones, until finally they ended up having relations with one another. To me this was the most unethical thing that she did throughout the whole movie.This movie in my opinion did a great job in showing what a person with bipolar deals with everyday, and how their lives are affected by medications, and hospitalization. I think this movie made psychiatrists look really bad and unprofessional, which is a shame because most psychiatrists aren't that way. This movie made female psychiatrists look especially bad, because it gave off the impression that they sleep with their patients and get to emotionally attached to them as well. If this was real life Dr. Elizabeth would have lost her psychiatrist license, and most likely gotten sued by the hospital and possibly the patient.

On the one hand you get all the gloss but on the other you have to put up with 'stars' being shoehorned into the picture to satisfy the bean counters. Now most of the time the later isn't too much of a problem. I mean, sure it can be a little frustrating to have the same few people pop up in blockbuster after blockbuster, but despite what some snobs may say, a reasonable proportion of stars are stars for a reason &#150; whether it be raw acting talent or mere charisma. But while Johnny Depp is a fine actor as well as a bankable star, he just isn't very good in From Hell.I don't know what went wrong, but Depp just doesn't seem all that comfortable in his role. Maybe he had to concentrate too much on the accent &#150; if he did, then he still did a pretty bad job on that front &#150; but even if he didn't, he still seems uncertain of himself. It's as if he doesn't know whether to play the role tongue in cheek or dead serious, and instead falls into some unsatisfactory middle ground.Not helping him too much is the fact that he didn't sell the whole tortured detective thing to me. Abberline is supposed to be a man with a past &#150; like nearly 99% of detectives in films &#150; but there was no real weight to the character. Yeah he may smoke opium and he may drink Absinthe, but it felt like style rather than substance. And while that may be the fault of the script or the direction, Depp still felt lightweight in this film. (Lightweight reminds me; I think the heavyweight Robbie Coltrane would have been excellent as Abberline. Or, alternatively, Robert Carlyle.) Then there's Heather Graham. Now Johnny Depp is fully deserving of his status as a star. Heather Graham, though, isn't. Therefore it's rather excruciating listening to her trying to deliver dialogue in a badly contrived accent and rather painful watching her try and play the hooker with a heart of gold. Such a stock character needs someone with a lot of acting talent to make it believable and interesting (maybe Samantha Morton or Emily Watson?). As it is, her character is incredibly dull to watch (and, annoyingly, the film denies us the pleasure of her brutal murder). Plus she looks silly alongside the other prostitutes. You go from believably haggard streetwalker to believably haggard streetwalker to Heather Graham, who's supposed to look the part because she doesn't quite have as much eye make-up as she usually does and because her hair isn't quite combed through. She's not at all convincing, and it's frustrating that the Hughes brothers had to cast her as a concession to the studio.But despite the two main stars being miscast, there's a lot of good stuff in the film. I especially like some of the comments on Victorian society. You've got the brutality of the medicine of the time (the woman being lobotomised and then swept under the carpet in the workhouse), sexual hypocrisy (a blind eye is turned to men using prostitutes but the prostitutes themselves are despised), class (the upper class police chief refers to a middle class doctor as having 'a cheap sort of intelligence') and prejudice. And it's the prejudice that produces one of the best scenes. There's a scene where the police chief is talking to Abberline about who they're looking for. Here are some of the chief's quotes One thing's for sure, an Englishman didn't do it. An educated man? That's preposterous. No well-bred man would do this. What about the Jews? At the time, when I was watching the scene, I got a kick out of it because it seemed like a Victorian twist on the 'stupid chief' scenes that you always see in 80s cop films. But after you see the ending, you realise that the stupid chief wasn't quite so stupid. Yet even though, or maybe because, the chief was part of the Masonic conspiracy (damn those Masons!), the scene works even better in retrospect. Not only does it expose the prejudice of the upper classes, but it exposes the hypocrisy too &#150; a man who kills for an apparently noble cause can be looked down upon and disposed of, but a man who takes part by covering it up is honourably doing his duty.Stylistically, too, the film is excellent. There are loads of wonderful shots. My favourite is the one where you go from high up, down to street level and then underground to the Masons who are secretly running the show. I also like the blood red skies and the shots of Parliament. And the 'visions' are excellent as well. Oh, and I love the time-lapse shot after Jack kills one of his victims &#150; and before that I like the way that The Ripper just vanishes from the scene like a phantom.And it's Ian Holm who delivers the best performance (although the whole supporting cast does a fine job). He's entirely charming as the kindly doctor and completely bonkers as Jack the Ripper &#150; the heart scene is great, especially the fantasy element where his fellow doctors are applauding his work. And although Holm doesn't really seem physically big enough to play Jack, it doesn't become an issue because Holm is so great in the role. But I do have to say that the mystery element of the story was misjudged. The 'disguised' Ripper voice is obviously a hushed Holm. But it really doesn't matter. The mystery is revealed with quite a bit of time to go (I dig the creepy black eyes) and the fun is in the bloody carnage &#150; the murders are suitably nasty.But one thing remains the film would have been a lot better if Jack would have been allowed to dice Heather Graham.

He may in fact be, and his mere presence here (solid, noble, and pure) is reassuring, but even Freeman can't overcome the usual cat-&-mouse\/killer-toying-with-detectives stew that Se7en serves up. There's a serial killer loose in rainy New York City, and as he mounts his seven grisly crime scenes--modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins--he quickly becomes aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and is enamored of their drive and determination. Most of this is left vague and unexplained; we learn precious little about the psychopath involved except that he's highly literate, educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. The film mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of deja vu (I thought mostly of The Silence of the Lambs). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The grimy, lust-and-death soaked atmosphere is wallowed in (it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell), and certainly it is palpable and captured successfully, but completely off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like real-life crime scenes, and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker isn't clever enough to distract us or cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible--it's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger sick-making scale.

Josh Hartnett is Jasper, the local boy who wants nothing more than to keep things the way they are, including his relationship with Samantha.

I saw it for the first time on Comedy Central earlier this year, and had to go buy the DVD. I'm not really into the teen movies, so I was surprised I enjoyed it so much. Breakfast Club wasn't bad, but it was a little too cut and dry for me. You had the freak, the geek, the bad boy, the jock, and the princess. But I didn't like how each character fit so perfectly into their little slot. Nobody had any layers or any characteristics of any of the other groups. Sure they found ways to identify with each other based on outside occurrences, but no person is all jock or all geek or all freak. As for the modern teen movies, they're all too raunchy for me. They're less about the characters and more about stereotypical teens doing stereotypical teen things with no real substance. Just one disgusting joke after another. Drive Me Crazy, was a fun and fresh teen movie. It showed many different teen characters, but many of the characters had different facets. Very few of the characters were stereotypical in my opinion. De Vine was the sweet popular girl who used to be unpopular but got thin and became popular but is not so sure she likes popularity any better than unpopularity (how often do we see that girl in teen movies?). Nicole was the popular girl who was perky and smart, but also seemed to care about other people. Brad was the top jock, but he fell in love and had his heart broken (how often does that happen to the top jock in teen movies?). Ray is the freak who is really the coolest character in the movie. All of the acting was above average for a teen movie. There are some great lines in the movie. The two main characters had excellent chemistry. I found the storyline believable. But I fell in love with and married the boy next door myself. He was the rebel and the jock rolled into one, and I was the freak and the smart girl rolled into one. We were friends growing up, had some problems in our early teens and didn't speak for years, then got back together a little later on and have been happily married for 8 years. So the storyline isn't that hard for me to believe, and reminds me of my own teen years. That being said I do think the writers dropped the ball in a few places. The ending was pitiful. Having the parents hook up was repulsive to say the least. Then they walk off in the sunrise to the tree house. That was ridiculous. What seniors spend the morning after their prom night in their tree house? It's like the writers didn't know how to end the movie. I didn't really like how they just left us hanging as to how Chase felt about Nicole until he left Dilcey hanging and showed up at the dance. Did he have feelings for her when he went back to Dilcey, did he not and realized it the night of the dance? I didn't like how Ray was just left out at the dance once Chase showed up. So I do have some complaints with the way the movie ended, but that doesn't take away from the storyline up to that point, the enjoyable multi-faceted characters, the chemistry between the two major characters, and the excellent writing up to the final few scenes of the movie.

For it's kind of film, Gods and Monsters comes as close to perfection as it is possible to get.First of all, what this film is not It is not an Ian McKellen vehicle. If you want to see Ian McKellen pwn everyone else, choose Richard III or something else.It is not a gay or queer film. If you want to see a gay melodrama, in which innocent gays are oppressed, choose Torch Song Trilogy. If you want to see a gay comic book film, in which Mr. Gay defeats the oppressive forces of Dr. Hetero with his Gay Ray, choose something else. If you want gay erotica, find something yet instead.It is not a boffo Hollywood production. If you want a plot-driven movie, find something else.It is not a biography of James Whale, nor a tribute to his films.It is a serious character study of deep human emotion. It is about loneliness and death. It is about loss. It is about power. It is about people as they are. There are no heroes and no villains. There are only people. Deeply flawed, and deeply human.Given the kind of film it is, it is hard to find a flaw.The acting of the ensemble cast is superlative. Even minor characters and actors play into the ensemble perfectly. While it is tempting to respect Ian McKellen's acting, all the actors contribute equally well to the ensemble.The direction and sets are superb and amazing for such a small budget. The studio of James Whale (Ian McKellen) even contains original paintings by James Whale. The direction and cinematography flit between a modern, natural style and the direction of Whale, always appropriately. Every frame of every flashback and fantasy has a meaning. We see the body of Whale's old, probably chaste love, embedded in barbed wire, long before we know it is he.The score is haunting and provides a perfect accompaniment.The flashbacks to Whale's all-male parties may seem too much or not enough for some, yet this is part of the whole. It is part of a love, sometimes tender and poignant, sometimes brutal and full of betrayal, full of despair and death and lost eroticism, and full of healing and completion, that Whale ultimately shares with Boone.This is a story as much about Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser) as it is about Whale. At first, we see Boone as a collection of parts, not yet assembled. The final scene, much maligned here, completes his transformation as a whole person. Yet he plays the monster in the rain, as a tribute to the monster he might have become, fondly remembering the sometimes brutal friendship that made him whole.It should have won Best Picture. It is the best picture that I have seen in a long, long time.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the original Grease, but Grease 2 is not as bad as people make it out to be.The songs may not be as catchy as songs from the first film, but ones like Score Tonight and Reproduction were certainly fun. The vehicles, motorcycles in this film, do not play as much of an important part to the film as the cars did in the original either, which is neither good nor bad in my opinion.The cast are a mixed-bag too. Hottie Maxwell Caulfield is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but while I normally like Michelle Pfeiffer, she seemed terribly distracted in this film, like she wanted to be somewhere else. Adrian Zmed was good as the leader of the T-Birds, but the others, particularly the guy that played Goose, were annoying, as was Lorna Luft who played Paulette. Alison Price and Pamela Segall were great to watch, though they didn't get a lot of screen time. Didi Conn was rather wasted as Frenchy however, and Eve Arden and Dody Goodman both graciously returned as the school principal and her assistant, and both gave terrific performances.So when watching Grease 2, try not to think of the original Grease, and maybe you will like it a little bit more.

Tina, a teen who can move things with her mind, accidentally frees Jason. Teens throwing a birthday bash are promptly picked off by Jason. Even though the murders and gore in this entry, much like in Part 6, are basically cut-out, this is a good entry, one of my favorites, and I feel this is the last good Friday The 13th film made (so far). Jason is at his best here. He looked menacing in Part 4, but here he looks his best. The mask and costume are much creepier than ever before, and he doesn't come off hokey as he did in Part 6. The location of filming is more atmospheric and unsettling then before also. Too bad many of the murder scenes had to be trimmed. With them in place, this could have been one top-notch sequel. Some of the murders are still good, though. The sleeping bag murder, even though it's trimmed, is one of the best kills in the series. The cast is fine, the story moves fluidly, and there is a big body count. Too bad there are plot holes rampant through the story (did Tina really think her dead dad's body would still be floating around Crystal Lake after a decade? I thought Crystal Lake was now named Forest Green?). A worthy sequel. Features an axe to the head, axe to the face, knife in the gut (Jason finally dropped that machete!), crushed head, etc., etc. Three stars.

If you look at the comments and the vote rating on the IMDb, you will figure out that. Obviously there are a lot of people who think it is some kind of a banal romantic story, and as they are tough guys, they have voted negatively, bringing it from the second place that it deserves, to some regrettably low position, so it is not even in the first 250 TOP MOVIES on the IMDb.For the fact that it has earned more money than any other movie I will not speak - Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, and Spiderman also earned comparable sums, and they are IDIOTIC. But on the romantic issue I have to speak a lot. And here I begin. No, you infinite idiots! It is not a movie about love! Love is a great thing, one of the greatest things humans have (tragically not all of them, not even half of them), but love is 10% of what the movie is about. Love is only a contributing factor here.This is a movie about the irreversibly lost things in life. It is a movie about memories and old age, and lost happiness. Not only it is about these things, but with all its contributing factors - the plot, the script, the music, the greatest director of all times - it turned into an exceptionally strong movie. So strong, that if your heart is not made of stone, and your brain - of interstellar vacuum, this film will make something horrible with you it will break your heart, and it will burn your brain. And you will suffer from it. And if you are too emotional, or if you are alone in this moment, I tell you with a good intention don't watch it!SPOILERSYou have to watch three hours, till you get to the point. All of it was made for the last minute, and whoever has slept through it, will not get it. Happiness had passed, tragedy had passed and suffering had passed. And then... Oh, dear god, this broke me. Oh, how she threw it! It cut me through my heart, through my brain, through my soul... My whole face started to ache, like if it has been put in a hydraulic press.A lot of time after I watched it, after many months had passed, after many hours of thinking, I understood what made my face ache. She didn't throw just a valuable diamond, searched by so many people, in the bottomless waters of the cold ocean. She didn't throw just a memory (although it was a kind of a memory, that was reminding her dear moments, lived so many years ago - moments that she had passed so many times through her head). What she threw were hundreds of trillions of dollars, and all the computers in the world, and the combined natural resources of Asia, and 150 million square kilometers of inhabitable land, and the whole Earth, and solar systems, and galaxies, and universes... Cause none of these things could return what she had lost - as time is OMNIPOTENT and IRREVERSIBLE.But she didn't look suffering, when she threw it. And I know why. She was old. She was at the end of her journey. She longed for oblivion. When she threw it, she smiled, as if she threw a burden. At this moment she was saying Goodbye to the life. For her it was a relief. For me it was painfully sad. I saw the whole tragedy of mortality, of transience, of evanescence, of forgetfulness. I saw how the old memories dwell only in the minds of the old people, how they fade and how they disappear with them, like falling yellow leaves in the autumn. I saw her story, I realized that there were billions more stories like that, of billions old people - stories better or worse, shorter or longer, more or less interesting and intriguing - which eventually would fade together with the old, and would turn into rotting leaves on the ground, and people would step on them, and nobody would neither know, nor imagine what treasure they were.I think now at least I saw her story. She redeemed the people from Titanic to life again and now they are here, in front of me, though for a while. Living, with reddish faces from the wine, straightly brought from the dark, cold ocean bottom - not that it makes me feel better. They laugh, they drink from the glasses and stare at me, and laugh even higher; and then, in an instant, their faces turn pale, turn grey, and their smiles disappear. And they begin looking cold and sad, and serious. And they say to me, with a frozen cup in their hands LIVE! Live now, fully! Take everything and remember everything, cause one day you will have only memories! We are dead and cannot live, but you live as much as you can. And please, remember us! We were not bad people, were we? And all this - from her memory...And then - she was dreaming. She was RETURNING IMAGES, she was REFRESHING MEMORIES, as this was the only thing she could do to beat the time; to fight with it, before it defeats her too. She was dreaming about the so insultingly short moments of true happiness she had in her life. She was dreaming of what she never had, and never would have. She was dreaming in frightful tranquility, in her last years, in the twilight of her life...Achingly sad.

I liked it a lot, and because of it, I started to watch Ed Wood's movies as well.This movie is kind of funny, and I would almost consider it as a comedy, if it wasn't a Biography; the fact about it being black and white didn't bother me as I expected,and Johnny Depp was great in the role of Ed Wood.Besides the bad fame Ed Wood took, because of his low quality's movies and his lack of techniques and good sense, I found beautiful to see how dreamer he was ,and how he tried to reach his goals besides all the problems and difficulties. I think that one of the most important things in the life of a person,is to never give up of what you really believes,having the power to always carry on in your life.

What's the point? At what point do you get rid of it and get an older one?) and nothing that happens over the course of the film makes it any more feasible. The plot draws out with painful predictability a few scenes of the mother bonding with her robot son, then her real-life son coming out of the coma he began the movie in. Conflicts between the human and robot child result, which eventually prompt the mother to release the robot into the woods (with much melodrama and the typical Spielberg tear-jerking tactics) so he won't be deactivated as a threat to her real son. Next we get an annoyingly forced and obvious Holocaust metaphor. One robot even drags out the history repeats itself adage, so utterly threadbare and rendered absolutely meaningless by this point. Pointless and unfunny slapstick abounds, mostly in the form of Jude Law playing a foppish prancing gigolo robot. If your intelligence is not insulted at any point in this movie, then the insult is richly deserved. Robin Williams and Chris Rock get enlisted as bit voice-actors, solely to draw the viewers out of the story, I would assume--certainly there is no other reason to put famous actors in such roles. Meanwhile John Williams phones in yet another generic and forgettable score.Finally the movie plods far enough along for Spielberg to drop the Big Shocker on us the robot child is only one of many identical ones that are being mass-produced from the public. The droid freaks out, and as final damning evidence of how emotionally unstable and potentially dangerous he is, he destroys one of the other robots. The robot company decides to release thousands more of the model anyway. I guess lawsuits are a thing of the past in the this brave new world. Just in case you managed to take some of what proceeded in the movie seriously, the final act seems designed to destroy any plausibility it had. I won't spoil it for you. However, it's so poorly-written and incongruous with the rest of the film that I'd be remiss to not mention it. It reminds me of creative writing assignments I used to get in middle school, where the teacher would ask me to write another chapter to the end of an assigned book and I'd come up with something like Chapter 27 Holden Caulfield Solves A Murder Mystery.Utter crap with a veneer of phony sophistication.

There are some magical moments, Judy Garland's heart felt singing of Over the Rainbow (never equaled by others), and the early monochrome scenes in Kansas with the approaching tornado, the first view of Oz in colour, the Witches feet rolling up under the house, the walk through the enchanted forest and the field of poppies, the initial meetings with the Scarecrow, Tinman, and the Wizard, the Bad Witch melting under the water, and the farewell to Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch, remains one of the screens most frightening characters. Perhaps the Munchkins are allowed too much screen time, but once Dorothy starts her journey along the yellow brick road, and meets her strange companions, it's a joy to behold. A film that both enchanted and frightened me at a very early age, as indeed did Walt Disney's Snow White a couple of years earlier.

As is best for most movies, he is not an interesting character, but interesting things are always happening around him. He began his life as emperor of China at only three years of age before being overthrown by the nationalists two years later. After being forced to hide away in the Forbidden City for thirteen years, he and his two wives flee from the warlords to Tianjin (Tientsin) and he ends up working for the Japanese. His ancestors came from Manchuria, so when the Japanese offered for him to become puppet emperor of the state when they occupied it, he accepted. However, he did not like the Japanese policies and they immediately began to torment him, first by taking his wife away and tampering with her brain and then by locking him in his small palace. In the end, he is caught by the Russians and taken back to the PRC, where he spends nine years in prison.The entire movie is well done - flashbacks are used effectively throughout the whole movie, and the use of the Forbidden City and the Puppet Emperor's Palace as sets was greatly effective also.

In the end, he is caught by the Russians and taken back to the PRC, where he spends nine years in prison.The entire movie is well done - flashbacks are used effectively throughout the whole movie, and the use of the Forbidden City and the Puppet Emperor's Palace as sets was greatly effective also. For a non-fiction biography, it is surprisingly well structured and amazing dramatics are used. Final ratings - Acting, 8\/10. Cinematography, 10\/10. Soundtrack, 9\/10. Costumes, 10\/10 (very realistic). ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"}]
