While I prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. However, it also has one or two flaws that, if I am going to be fair, I have to mention. Since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, I'll get them out of the way first. The first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. As the story goes from one part of America to Cuba to Sicily to another part of America, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. The other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow Mario Puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. The big conspiracy with a Jewish smuggler and unnamed Italian rivals in the New York or Nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. Both stories, the historical story of Vito Corleone and the present-day story of Michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. It is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the Godfather Legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film.The acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from Al Pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. Robert Duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. I think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with Duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. The real surprise here is John Cazale, who fleshes out Fredo Corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. It is unsurprising that all of the films Cazale has been in have been nominated for Best Picture. He portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. But these are just the highlights. The entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds.The best thing about a Godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. The bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. Francis Ford Coppola has previously stated that he saw The Godfather as a (relatively) modern King Lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. Michael is in essence the new King of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. This is the film in which we learn why this is not what Vito Corleone wanted for his youngest son. Sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in Diane Keaton's dialogue. Some of her speech to Al Pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films.Like the other Godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the Corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. The montage shown in Part II is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. Lee Strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from Israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. Unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates I cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means I cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. Being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among Godfather fans, I am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. In spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of Michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. But that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. With the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside.I gave The Godfather, Part II a nine out of ten. In contrast to the original, I noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. Still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first Godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. If every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as Francis Ford Coppola had here, then the world would be a better place.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 May 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" First as a father of 2 girls and a boy, it was fascinating to me to see a beautiful little girl interacting so warmly with her daddy. Patricia McCormack, who played 8 year old Rhoda Penmark, was simply as perfect a vision as God has ever put on this earth, complete with long blonde hair, a beautiful face, ever-sweet ever-ready smile and a lovely winsome demeanor that would cause the heart of any dad anywhere to skip a beat with moments of blustery pride and joy.The underlying and pervasive theme of this tragic movie is death...stalking the family from place to place, ever present. Nancy Kelly playing Christine Penmark the mother of Rhoda, becomes consumed by her own birth misfortune and subsequently that of her daughter's. Christine discovers her own origin was of a woman diagnosed as a bad (genetic)seed, who was an unapologetic mass murderer who killed for specious reasons without a grain of remorse. As if being stuck in the realms of a nightmare, Christine assembles an evidentiary puzzle leading her to believe that precious, angelic Rhoda is actually genetically predisposed to be a 'bad seed' and as well, a mass murderer who will wield her motus-fatale without the restraints of conscience.That in a nutshell is the framework of this marvelous movie. Now for the verdicts...The Bad Seed's theme is awesome and I dearly hope someone with the skills of Stephen King will produce a remake, circa the modern era.Nancy Kelly was allowed too much reign to overact. Her part was a run-on that never quite let the audience have an area of safety...a calm time. As Christine she seemed to too quickly jump to the conclusion that Rhoda was a murderer. It didn't quite seem that she struggled with the unbelievability of it enough, though she did visually struggle on and on and on. Her acting is good in much smaller doses. I can't really see this movie as being so much about the mother, rather than the daughter Rhoda, who I found to be infinitely more fascinating. Kelly's role was so omnipresent I actually began to avoid looking at her during those excessive monologues.I think it was unfortunate that in the end of filming, Kelly's name was first on the marque, when that notable position should have been reserved in Patricia McCormack's honor.Eileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the mother of the deceased little boy played her role with consummate artistry. She was convincing as someone wanting to derive every essence of her precious son's death. So successful at suffering her soulful pain was she, that I found it very uncomfortable viewing any scene in which she appeared. Like Kelly, Heckart's performance was a bit over-dramatic and prolonged for a movie audience and would have been more fitting for a live theatre audience, where every syllable of every utterance must be LOUD enough for all to hear. The nuances that usually add ambiance to a movie, were gone completely from her character.Henry Jones as Leroy Jessup, the retarded gardener played his part in a more timely fashion. His dialogue was much shorter and more to the point and in some sense that left me wanting to hear more from him. Repartee's between he and Rhoda were the essential elements that brought my interest to rapt attention. He was the second most interesting character in this play\/movie for me, personally, and was the one I feel most viewers would have wanted to see interacting more often with the angel child from hell. A nice touch would have been for Leroy to have successfully bribed Rhoda to an extent that we viewers would have wanted very much to see her do away with him. William Hopper as Col. Kenneth Penmark was a perfect choice for the part of Rhoda's daddy handsome, gorgeously blond like his blonde daughter, loving, strong and seemingly influential in his daughter's life. When the movie started I felt he would have been more involved in the discoveries regarding his daughter...yet to the very end of the movie, he was oblivious to Rhoda's satanic side. In a reality by any other name I think daddy Penmark appears to have been too much out of the loop. In the Stephen King remake Village of the Damned (1995), where children who were conceived by unknown origins virtually take over a town, both mothers and fathers become aware of all those precious children's inner indifference to humanity very quickly. That was realistic even in a short piece of fiction.Here in The Bad Seed, I think daddy Penmark was a bit too oblivious, though as they say nowadays I could still suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie.Patricia McCormack was the perfect casting for Rhoda. She was immaculately beautiful with her long blonde pigtails, her beguiling femininity and her perfect face and handsome stature. As if all that weren't enough she was suave, articulate, willfully unrepentant and incorrigible. I found that unconflicted combination to be incredibly interesting.This movie was about Rhoda. The director and writers should have lessened the 'ham-time' spent 'on-stage' by Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart, and then perhaps Patricia McCormack's own nomination would have led to the actual Oscar prize.Patricia was the only '10' in this fascinating movie. Except for the minor matter of serial killing and fatal cunning, I'd love to have a daughter just like her.

Christine discovers her own origin was of a woman diagnosed as a bad (genetic)seed, who was an unapologetic mass murderer who killed for specious reasons without a grain of remorse. As if being stuck in the realms of a nightmare, Christine assembles an evidentiary puzzle leading her to believe that precious, angelic Rhoda is actually genetically predisposed to be a 'bad seed' and as well, a mass murderer who will wield her motus-fatale without the restraints of conscience.That in a nutshell is the framework of this marvelous movie. Now for the verdicts...The Bad Seed's theme is awesome and I dearly hope someone with the skills of Stephen King will produce a remake, circa the modern era.Nancy Kelly was allowed too much reign to overact. Her part was a run-on that never quite let the audience have an area of safety...a calm time. As Christine she seemed to too quickly jump to the conclusion that Rhoda was a murderer. It didn't quite seem that she struggled with the unbelievability of it enough, though she did visually struggle on and on and on. Her acting is good in much smaller doses. I can't really see this movie as being so much about the mother, rather than the daughter Rhoda, who I found to be infinitely more fascinating. Kelly's role was so omnipresent I actually began to avoid looking at her during those excessive monologues.I think it was unfortunate that in the end of filming, Kelly's name was first on the marque, when that notable position should have been reserved in Patricia McCormack's honor.Eileen Heckart as Hortense Daigle, the mother of the deceased little boy played her role with consummate artistry. She was convincing as someone wanting to derive every essence of her precious son's death. So successful at suffering her soulful pain was she, that I found it very uncomfortable viewing any scene in which she appeared. Like Kelly, Heckart's performance was a bit over-dramatic and prolonged for a movie audience and would have been more fitting for a live theatre audience, where every syllable of every utterance must be LOUD enough for all to hear. The nuances that usually add ambiance to a movie, were gone completely from her character.Henry Jones as Leroy Jessup, the retarded gardener played his part in a more timely fashion. His dialogue was much shorter and more to the point and in some sense that left me wanting to hear more from him. Repartee's between he and Rhoda were the essential elements that brought my interest to rapt attention. He was the second most interesting character in this play\/movie for me, personally, and was the one I feel most viewers would have wanted to see interacting more often with the angel child from hell. A nice touch would have been for Leroy to have successfully bribed Rhoda to an extent that we viewers would have wanted very much to see her do away with him. William Hopper as Col. Kenneth Penmark was a perfect choice for the part of Rhoda's daddy handsome, gorgeously blond like his blonde daughter, loving, strong and seemingly influential in his daughter's life. When the movie started I felt he would have been more involved in the discoveries regarding his daughter...yet to the very end of the movie, he was oblivious to Rhoda's satanic side. In a reality by any other name I think daddy Penmark appears to have been too much out of the loop. In the Stephen King remake Village of the Damned (1995), where children who were conceived by unknown origins virtually take over a town, both mothers and fathers become aware of all those precious children's inner indifference to humanity very quickly. That was realistic even in a short piece of fiction.Here in The Bad Seed, I think daddy Penmark was a bit too oblivious, though as they say nowadays I could still suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie.Patricia McCormack was the perfect casting for Rhoda. She was immaculately beautiful with her long blonde pigtails, her beguiling femininity and her perfect face and handsome stature. As if all that weren't enough she was suave, articulate, willfully unrepentant and incorrigible. I found that unconflicted combination to be incredibly interesting.This movie was about Rhoda. The director and writers should have lessened the 'ham-time' spent 'on-stage' by Nancy Kelly and Eileen Heckart, and then perhaps Patricia McCormack's own nomination would have led to the actual Oscar prize.Patricia was the only '10' in this fascinating movie.

Kharosho is Russian for good. And this movie is real horrorshow. There is a mixture of Russian, English slang and just made up words but easy to understand because of the contents in each sentence as the author Anthony Burgess was a linguist and must have had a ton of fun writing this masterpiece. McDowell's Character Alex is a murderous thug of a malchick (young man) and a rapist who likes a bit of Ludwig van - especially the glorious 9th Symphony - with which to get off on. In the book he masturbated to Beethoven's 5th Symphony but in this movie he was turned on by the 9th. Alex liked to have sex and with two young devochke he seduced he seemed organic yet it was to a very fast William Tell Overture that was very mechanical. He was also a rapist who indeed only went through the motions of sex mechanically. Alex was mechanical in his idea of sex yet appeared to be organic as any normal man would enjoy sex hence he was a clockwork orange. This movie has so much more violence than I realized upon the second time I viddied it (the weepy devochke that I viddied it with slid down her chair and closed her glassies during all of the ultra violence as my rasoodoc understood how much violence there really was) however the comedy just made me giggle through most of it after a while. The prison chief's (Michael Bates who played Field Marshal Montgomery in Patton) expressions and histrionics had me rolling in the aisles from laughter. Every scene if you can get by the violence is so funny that you will get a hernia from laughter. It's very weird that way like when Alex is kicking Patrick Magee he is singing Singing in the Rain just before he gets set to perform the old in\/out in\/out on a weepy devochke or his It's a sin! speech while his eyelids are clamped open or while he and his droogs (friends) are rumbling with Billy Boy and his droogs the rumble is choreographed to Rossini's The Thieving Magpie - ultra-violent but will tickle your guttywuts. After Alex pretends to smash some eggiwegs yet wasn't affected by the Ludoviko technique in that outburst you start to realize that just after he was unsuccessful at snuffing it he was on the road to recovery. I could write a book on A Clockwork Orange about all the myelenky (small) things that went into this movie that took Stanley Kubric at least two years to make. Suffice it to say that in its way it is every bit as good as 2001 A Space Odyssey and in some ways a little better though it's hard to compare. This movie received the most votes from an award that is arguably more prestigious than the Academy Awards - The New York Film Critics Award - ten out of fifteen votes makes it real savage!!

Every scene if you can get by the violence is so funny that you will get a hernia from laughter. It's very weird that way like when Alex is kicking Patrick Magee he is singing Singing in the Rain just before he gets set to perform the old in\/out in\/out on a weepy devochke or his It's a sin! speech while his eyelids are clamped open or while he and his droogs (friends) are rumbling with Billy Boy and his droogs the rumble is choreographed to Rossini's The Thieving Magpie - ultra-violent but will tickle your guttywuts. After Alex pretends to smash some eggiwegs yet wasn't affected by the Ludoviko technique in that outburst you start to realize that just after he was unsuccessful at snuffing it he was on the road to recovery. I could write a book on A Clockwork Orange about all the myelenky (small) things that went into this movie that took Stanley Kubric at least two years to make. Suffice it to say that in its way it is every bit as good as 2001 A Space Odyssey and in some ways a little better though it's hard to compare. This movie received the most votes from an award that is arguably more prestigious than the Academy Awards - The New York Film Critics Award - ten out of fifteen votes makes it real savage!! Make up your rasoodoc now to viddie A Clockwork Orange. Viddie well oh my brothers. Viddie well.

When Julie (Cameron Diaz), one of David's latest conquests who has been developing an unhealthy obsession with him, crashes her car with him in the passenger's seat, it leaves David horribly disfigured. Feeling his life is essentially over, David becomes withdrawn and angry, but his relationship with Sofia helps him to see the world in a new light. He cheers up even more when he learns of the possibility that doctors may be able to reconstruct his facial features, but everything changes when a face from the past comes back to haunt him.It's great that Channel Four broadcast the 1997 Spanish original 'Open Your Eyes' the night before this Hollywood remake, 'Vanilla Sky' (which is also good, but suffers from the same problems), was broadcast. Problems, you say? Well, writer\/director Cameron Crowe has made a very interesting, involving film, but like Alejandro Amenábar before him, he can't really balance the romance\/drama and mystery\/thriller elements too well. 'Sky' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising. However, the performances are good, and I can see why Cameron Crowe decided to rehire Penélope Cruz for the remake, as she really is a radiant presence. Just a note, though this film is more of a romance, while 'Open Your Eyes' is more of a thriller, so I guess your preference depends on which genre you like more, I suppose.

There are many deviations from the text as is usual with Hollywood, although some were necessitated by differences in the art forms. More significantly however is the treatment itself which is very different from the way Chandler handled the story. Philip Marlowe's character in particular is not nearly as world-weary as he is in the book, and the Los Angeles depicted is not nearly as sleazy as Chandler saw it. Furthermore the ending here with the prospect of a future romance for Marlowe is nothing like the cynicism that Raymond Chandler had in mind. Yet, I understand Chandler liked this film, perhaps because of its popularity.Comparing this to the remake, Farewell, My Lovely (1975) starring Robert Mitchum as Marlowe and based on the same material, I have to say that this is a more agreeable and entertaining movie, although not nearly as veracious. Both movies really skirt around the racial prejudices of the times. Here in Murder, My Sweet the bar Florian's isn't even a black bar as it was in the novel and in Farewell, My Lovely. There is also no good cop\/bad cop angle and nary a hint of police corruption--which is certainly anti-historical since Los Angeles in those days had one of the most corrupt police forces in the country.But none of this bothered me--partly because I expected it, and partly because the movie stands by itself as an entertaining example of the mystery\/murder genre done with an emphasis on a crime doesn't pay treatment and an upbeat ending--which is the way Hollywood used to play these things until film noir caught hold in the forties. Although this is a forties film and clearly within the film noir genre, it is best seen, I believe, as an example of a genre in transition.Claire Trevor plays Helen Grayle, scheming wife of a multimillionaire (and young enough to be his daughter), a woman who freely admits to having affairs as she tries to put the make on Marlowe. No such luck since Marlowe usually prefers his whiskey to his women (at least that is way Chandler wrote the novels). Here too Marlowe seems more interested in Helen's stepdaughter, played by Anne Shirley.Mike Mazurki, who played the heavy in a score of films around mid-century, plays Moose Malloy, the big, dumb guy who is forever looking for his lost Velma (cute as lace pants). Esther Howard has a small part as the alcoholic Jessie Florian, just one scene which she does very well. In the Robert Mitchum film, the part was expanded for Sylvia Miles who got a supporting actress Oscar nomination for her work. As for Anne Shirley, who was known as Dawn O'Day until she played Anne Shirley in the first Anne of Green Gables in 1934, she retired after doing this film and never returned to the silver screen.What I think makes Murder, My Sweet (intriguing title, of course, but not really descriptive or accurate) work is the fine direction by Edward Dmytryk (best known for directing the splendid The Caine Mutiny (1954) which starred Humphrey Bogart as the deranged Captain Queeg)--that and the engaging performance by Dick Powell. It's clear that the former song and dance star had a great time playing the tough guy gumshoe. I think he loved the jaunty fedora he wore and the terse tough guy dialogue. He fit the part (and somewhat rearranged it) like a hen settling on a nest. (Okay, that's a bit of a metaphorical reach, but never mind.) See this for Dick Powell, one of the mainstays of Hollywood during the thirties and forties, a fine actor with charm and a crisp style who made his first splash in the period musicals The Golddiggers of 1933 and The Golddiggers of 1935.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

But once the story moves onto the boat(s), it looks like it was filmed yesterday.One thing that I liked about this film is, like all great thrillers...just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. It gets much worse.But of course this film has it's share of minor questionable actions, particularly by Sam Neill's character, who gets stranded on a sinking ship. Instead of wasting time trying to pump the water out of the room he's trapped inside, why not just break through the weak bottom like he ends up doing anyway? Oh well, I can forgive that. A character in a life and death situation like that probably won't be thinking as clearly as someone who is sitting in the comfortable safety of their living room, so it's easy to forget about.I almost was going to complain about the friday the 13th ending (see Fatal Attraction), but when I saw how the situation was dealt with, I instantly forgave them. Very shocking way of disposing of a character if I do say so myself.I highly recommend this film for all thriller fans. This is one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in a very long time. It's a shame that they don't make them like this any more.

After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back, I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this film was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.

Now he is a hospital back on a tropical island in the Pacific. Joe goes back into service a few weeks later and is assigned two Navajo code talkers Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) and Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie) to whom he must protect. Suddenly the battalion find's themselves in engagement after engagement which go on way to long. It seemed to me that during the battle Nicholas Cage was the only one doing any shooting and killing and is always leaping in front of an enemy machine gun nest but never being hit. The overall goal of the movie was to show the story of the 'Windtalkers' on the field of battle but that is quickly sucked up with Cage's character. Cage's character is made out to be this elite, troubled solider who is so much better at fighting than everyone else. In fact Cage's character could give Rambo a good fight if pitted against one another. The story is slow, it's boring, and it tries to work in a point of overcoming racism when there is none really present. The battles are mediocre at best and the plot is nonexistent.Windtalkers.

Of coarse that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining, I was most definitely entertained-hence the 6 rating. Original Sin is a movie that should have come out in the eighties, it's got a kind of lush, glamorous, larger then life, feel to it and since the eighties were full of these type of movies, it feels more suited to that time period. I actually moderately enjoyed this movie at times, though, at other times I wanted to go to sleep. It probably should have been a bit shorter.Original Sin stars two of the best looking movie stars in the world-Antonio Banderus and Angelina Jolie. Yet strangely, their chemistry together was not strong. Not to me anyway. They were almost to good looking, their looks detracted from the storyline, instead of seeing a female con artist and her hapless husband, at times I saw-two larger then life, gorgeous Hollywood movie stars. And it REALLY didn't help that the Banderus character was given so little to do. Except follow Jolie around that is. Banderus is an incredibly talented actor and his character should have been a bit more multi dimensional, this role didn't play to his strengths. The general acting however was fine by all. It was the way the story progressed that I had trouble with.Firstly, all of the plot twists were dizzying and rather then being edge of your seat exciting it was, at times, a bit to melodramatic. I like psychological thrillers where the suspense seems natural and not force fed and it didn't here. You always know your watching a movie although the sumptuous visuals and just the general sultry, balmy quality of the movie keep you moderately involved all the same which is why I still gave it a 6. It wasn't BAD at all, just over the top and took itself way to seriously. I liked the premise, love psychological thrillers and like and admire the performers featured in this. I just thought the movie seemed to be playing more for outrageousness then for slow tension building excitement which it really didn't have so much. And there is such a thing as a movie having to many twists and turns.I was however interested in seeing how it all played out and it did get way more interesting toward the end(the romance starts to gain in intensity and intrigue) and I could see even watching it again if I'm in a certain mood as it's one of those guilty pleasure type movies.
