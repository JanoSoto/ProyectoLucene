All the elements are in here that make a movie great, acting, writing, direction, etc. I haven't read through other comments, so I do not yet know what other people think about it, but I know that critical response was mixed and that it did not do well at theaters.What I look for most in a film is not writing or acting or even direction. Sure, if a film contains any of those three elements, it could potentially be great. I myself consider a film's mood and tone to be the single most important element, and, if a film produces a powerful mood of any sort, then that film is particularly special. Snow Falling on Cedars produces a powerful mood indeed.SPOILERSThe overall premise is intriguing in itself a white boy falls in love with a Japanese girl shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor (and, thus, the placement of Japanese-Americans in internment camps). During her stay at an internment camp, the girl falls in love with a Japanese man who is staying there. Meanwhile, the white boy goes to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After the war, the Japanese man is accused of killing a local white man. Most of this film consists of the courtroom drama. I normally dislike them, finding them boring and annoying. This film does it well. I was intrigued and never bothered, even if it contained several cliches, especially where the attorneys were concerned (I do have to give credit to Max von Sydow, one of the most godly actors the cinema has ever known; he plays the defense attorney).All of this rather simple plot (what the film does have to say about racism is worthy, even if it has been done plenty of times before; we can never express the notions enough) is imbued in some of the most heavenly cinematography and music that I've ever experienced. Especially the music, for which, I believe, it was actually nominated for an Oscar, it's only nomination (unfortunately). Also, Scott Hicks shows an enormous amount of the scenes in slow motion to add to the film's melancholy and dreamlike mood. Although the plot is what most people will pay attention to, and thus they will criticize it, I assume, this film is much more successful with its style. It made me fall in love, and it captured my emotions tightly. I would compare it mostly (and favorably, of course) with the masterful The Sweet Hereafter. That is a study in grief, and this is a study in lost love. I give the film a 10\/10. It will be one of those films that I will try to push onto other film enthusiasts.

Second, to outline a few theories I have on various aspects of the film.  And third, to point out (what I perceive as) errors in judgment of this film that others who have commented have made.First off, this is a magnificent piece of work.  Through the first thirty or so minutes of this film (which I have only seen once thus far), I was mesmerized by the technical\/editing magnificence of this film.  The editing of this movie is like no other I have ever seen.  Others have compared this movie to films like The Usual Suspects (which I agree is a great film, too), Fight Club (which is one of my all-time favourites), Pulp Fiction (great), Clean Slate (have not seen), and The Third Man (have not seen). Another film (which I haven't noticed anyone mention) that plays around with ambiguities\/timelines\/etc. in a similarly-masterful way is the little-seen Schizopolis by Steven Soderbergh.  And then there's Clean, Shaven, which also tries to put us in the shoes of a highly unusual character (Memento - person with anteriograde amnesia; Clean, Shaven - person with schizophrenia).Even if this movie only had the technical\/editing aspects going for it, I'd still be a big fan of it - but it does have much more going for it. Contrary to what some of said, I find this film to have quite a well-constructed storyline and group of characters.  The fact that this film is told in pseudo-reverse adds to the quality of the film - but it still would have been great told in the correct order.  One reason I say this the killing of Teddy at the end  (beginning of movie) would have had much more of an impact if we knew what came before that incident.  As it is, the killing of Jimmy at the beginning (end of movie) has a greater impact due to the order in which the story is told.  Also, contrary to what some have said, I enjoy a film with ambiguities some may view that as a cop-out by the writer, but I view it as an opportunity for discussion to ensue.Now, a few points.  There's one main theory that I have about this movie that I have not read in any other review.  Most - if not all - reviews of this movie make a point of there being some length-of-time significance to Leonard's memory problems; his short-term memory lasts 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 8 minutes, whatever.  I disagree that his memory problem has anything to do with time at all; look to the scene where Natalie shows herself to be manipulating him.  As she goes outside to her car, Leonard searches frantically for a pen to write down the fact that Natalie is manipulating him.  In the process of searching for a pen, he forgets that Natalie was manipulating him - because the focus of his memory shifted from WHAT he was trying to remember to the mere act OF remembering; he was trying so hard to remember that Natalie had manipulated him that he lost track of what he was trying to remember.  Another instance of this occurs when Leonard meets with Natalie at Natalie's bar.  So it isn't a matter of time that determines whether or not he can remember something - it's how well he is able to maintain his focus on an idea.  So long as he's able to stay focused on an idea, his recollection of that idea is intact.  Given the frantic nature of the human mind, however, it's nearly impossible for anyone to stay completely focused on one idea for any siginicant length of time; thus, Leonard loses track of what he's doing.  (As Sean Penn says in Hurlyburly, You know what's my biggest distraction?  Me.  I am my own biggest distraction.)  Thus, his problem doesn't have anything to do with the passage of time, but rather his brain's ability to record information prior to his forgetting it.  I'm not sure if this corresponds to true anteriograde amnesia, but in any case, that's how I view *Leonard's* condition.Secondly, some have mentioned being suspicious of Leonard's previous job - whether or not he was an insurance investigator, since it's odd for an insurance investigator to drive a truck.  I'm not going to touch on whether or not he had that job, but I will say this - recall early in the movie when he takes Teddy out to the remote building?  The truck that Leonard uses to drive out there earlier (later) to kill Jimmy is still there.  Leonard does not recognize it.  If the truck was his before the incident, he would remember it (of course, he may be faking..)And finally, the biggest problem people have with this movie - how can he remember his condition?  Evidently, those with anteriograde amnesia DO know that they suffer from the condition (somehow).Definitely one of the most unique films ever crafted; it's uniqueness is due to the nature of film itself, as this film is a great demonstration of the power and flexibility that is inherant in this unique genre of entertainment.  When the capabilities of this genre are used to their full potential (as so few films do), beautifully-unique things can be crafted - things that cannot be crafted in any other form of entertainment.

Rather than some off the cuff comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the filmIt was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film.

Naturally, since the picture is based on Erich Maria Remarque's marvelous novel, the screenwriter was given quite a powerful story to begin with.  The three main reasons why I consider this movie so forceful are the acting, the cinematography, and simply the sincerity.Lew Ayres, the man who plays Paul Baumer, convincingly portrays the main character in many ways.  First of all, the sheer innocence of his facial appearance adds a poignant touch to the film, because the overwhelming theme of the story is how the war effects all young people of each nation, whether that person dies in the trenches or survives only to lament his days in the war.  Ironically, when the film was initially being put together, Remarque, the novelist who won critical acclaim for writing the book, was asked to play the role of Paul.  Having seen time in the war the producers must have thought him aptly prepared to play the role.  But he declined because he had other commitments and because he felt he was not such a great actor.  Lucky for us, because Ayres gives a powerful performance.  Other characters with relatively minor roles have major importance in the film because they portray touching, heart wrenching scene s of death.  These peripheral characters all help add to the general tone of the film (and the book) because they show how dark and terrible the war can be; and they in turn show how propaganda can be so harmful, because most of the soldiers in Paul's regiment are volunteers who receive a very rude awakening when they discover what the war is really all about.  The acting is simply superb, and perhaps this is due to the fact that the famous director George Cukor was an assistant who, although uncredited, came onto the set to help supervise the actors (possibly because director Lewis Milestone's English was not too good).The cinematography of this film is absolutely magnificent.  The film rarely has gory sequences because the director finds other ways to imply death and still have the same emotional effect.  One way in which he does this is by showing single body parts (such as a hand or a leg) and allowing these appendages to show the death of the soldier as a whole.  Also, the cameraman uses overhead angles at times with great skill and also focuses on the trenches at times as the soldiers fall back into them after being shot (which implies that the trenches are a symbol of hell, because soldiers fall into them to die).  In short, the cinematographer Arthur Edeson allows the camera to do the talking and to drive the film, rather than the dialogue (speaking of which, there is relatively little; the actors' facial expressions do the bulk of the talking in the film).When I say this film is sincere I really can't give you any tangible evidence to prove the point; all I can tell you is to see the film.  The film at times overwhelmed me with emotion to the extent that I got goose bumps from watching some of the more agonizing scenes.  In a way, this movie is much like a silent film.  This stands to reason because it came at the very beginning of the 'talkie' age, only three years after The Jazz Singer (1927).  Also, Milestone directed silent films before this one, and he seemed to know that less focus on dialogue and more focus on acting would bring about an overwhelmingly emotional and well, sincere, film.  The film obviously had an effect on its star, Mr. Ayres, because once World War II began and he was drafted into the war, he conscientiously protested serving in the army because of his opinions towards war.  I believe he admits that his opinions stem from his work in this movie.  Certainly this is a powerful admission, because his protest caused him and his films to be blacklisted in Hollywood, and his career suffered greatly because of his ideals.  So if you don't believe my words about the power of this film, believe his.

However, after the first 40 minutes or so the story takes a big detour and becomes primarily a love story, and that was my big disappointment.CAUTION -- SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW --The very first scene shows Mr Simonet (Kevin Spacy) ironing his own shirts, to establish his simple, non-pretentious approach to life. The very next scene establishes the initial theme of the story, when a reporter's (Jay Mohr) car is totaled by an escaping crook, on a rainy night, and a stranger shows up to give him a new Jaguar, no strings attached. This intrigues the reporter, and a sub-theme becomes his search for the story behind this extraordinary generosity.Cut to 4 months earlier, Mr Simonet, the new teacher, the first day of his 7th grade class in LasVegas. Year-long assignment? Propose a plan to change the world, and put it into action.  On the way home, Trevor (Haley Joel Osment) sees a homeless man, brings him home, feeds him, gives him money,lets him sleep in the bed of the non-running pickup.

Later in the story we see the same man encountering a woman contemplating jumping off a bridge, and he talks her down.  Eventually we find that the pay it forward movement has spread to various parts of the country, and we extrapolate to it changing the world.It would have been an order of magnitude more difficult to write and film a whole 2 hours with a primary focus on how the pay it forward propagated itself, and some of the success stories.

Instead, the screenplay diverged into the development of a romance between Arlene, who had always made bad choices in relationships, and kept allowing her abusive husband back periodically, and Mr Simonet, who grew up abused and burned about the face and torso by his father, and as a result kept a fairly secluded existence.The director, Mimi Leder, has a lot of TV credits, including LA Law, ER, and several TV movies.
