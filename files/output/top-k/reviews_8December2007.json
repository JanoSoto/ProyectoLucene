But that doesn't mean that the story is not a well written one. Often though of course most elements in it are generic and predictable, it is still all brought in a fresh way, which makes the movie still original enough in its genre and definitely for its time. The dialog is especially well written, as you would expect from a '40's movie, when writers understood their craft. It even in the end has a great Christmas spirit in it, which adds all the more to the pleasant warm feeling of the movie.To me it seemed pretty redundant though that the movie was set in Hungary. It added nothing to the story or characters and worked only confusing, since the characters all had Hungarian names but of course were all talking in plain English. I understand they let this movie take place in Hungary because it was based on an Hungarian play but movie-wise it didn't added anything. This was something the later movie versions of the play In the Good Old Summertime and You've Got Mail understood.James Stewart wasn't really known for his leading comical or romantic roles, so his role in this movie is quite surprising and he does a good job at it as well. He still looked so very young in this and in his first scene I didn't even realized it was him, simply because I didn't recognized him.

If you read my review of The Mummy, you know that I love it... It was an action treat with some great scenes, memorable characters and fantastic action.The Mummy Returns is definitely what I would call a 'solid summer sequel', and that implies several things firstly, it manages to continue the storyline created in the original, maintaining what made the first movie good, whilst taking the story in new directions; secondly, it was smart enough to not abandon too much (ex. we don't mysteriously have characters disappearing between films, as happens in some sequels); and thirdly, it steps up the action and adventurous aspects of the original.I will say, it does fulfill those three requirements, which I feel are necessary for a sequel's success (with few exceptions), though at the same time, I think that writer\/director Sommers (who returns, along with most of the cast and crew) could have done a lot more. Mummy Returns is ultimately what I call a dumb-fun movie... It is ludicrous, and blatantly stupid at times, but still good in a way.The story also seems a bit more silly and overly-fast-paced this time, only there to serve the often-overdone CG and action. However, Sommers is able to save it from being 'just another bad sequel' by working some of his quirky magic into the story and characters. I will give Sommers that... He can make the most cliché, mundane characters and situations into something special.Rick O'Connell and Evie are back, now married nine years after the original, with a young son, whom is the typical trouble-making young hero you often see in these films. After they discover an ancient bracelet worn by the legendary warrior known only as 'The Scorpion King' (played briefly in a flashback by wrestling superstar The Rock), in a well-done opening action sequence that involves collapsing pillars and flooding water, the story is set in motion.As it turns out, Imhotep, the evil mummy with a grudge against the O'Connells, is back, having been resurrected by some sort of oddball cult that want him to use the bracelet of the Scorpion King to bring the warrior back from the underworld. Once reawakened, Imhotep must slay him, in order to gain control of the unstoppable army of the god Anubis... the army which the Scoprion King once led thousands of years ago after striking a bargain with the Deity. With this army, nothing will be able to stop Imhotep.Along the way, Imhotep kidnaps Alex (the O'Connell's son), after the bracelet permanently latches itself to him to act as a map to a pyramid of gold, where the Scorpion King lies... etc. It is all convoluted to a remarkable degree, yet, somehow still absorbing to an extent. Perhaps it is because we spent so much time with the characters in the original movie and already care about them... Maybe that is why fans were able to let go of the fact it is all so silly, and just enjoy the ride.We get other returning characters, including Evie's brother Johnathan (who has some great moments) and the still cool-as-ever Magi Ardeth Bay. We also get new faces, including a silly blimp-pilot (yes, I said blimp pilot), and the reincarnated Anck-Su-Namoon (the love Imhotep died for so many years ago), whom hopes Imhotep can restore her to her former self.But let me just skip all the story and character stuff, and get to the real meat of the movie... the action! This movie is definitely a step-up from the original in terms of sheer volume and velocity of action. From the opening flashback where we see hundreds of warriors battling with a ferocity that would make Peter Jackson blush; to a great Soldier-Mummy battle on a double decker bus; to a fiendishly funny and creepy scene involving two-and-a-half-foot-tall Pygmy Mummies, pretty much anything you could even conceive of for a Mummy movie is covered, and pulled off near-perfectly.There are a few scenes that feel thrown in just for the heck-of-it, though, including a new riff on the 'sandstorm' sequence from the original (this time with a wall of water) and a flashback to an ancient 'sparring session' between Anck-Su-Namoon and the Pharoh's daughter, but they aren't really bad... Just a little flat when compared to the other sequences.Also, I must make one comment regarding the final battle... Without giving away too much, I will say that while most of it is fantastic, it also has some exceptionally poor CG work... Though I have since heard this was due to money\/time issues. But other than that one knit-pick, it was great.Overall, I would say Mummy Returns is worth seeing to any fan of action or adventure. While not as good as the original, it is certainly a fun roller-coaster ride that will entertain you...

What is great, then? American History X boasts a sleek, crystal clear filming job and top-notch, through the roof acting, and it's obvious that this one wasn't let out of the gate until everything was just picture perfect all around. Yet, at the same time, this is not always good, with a few blemishes adorning its polished-to-perfection exterior. Yes, this is surely a giant of a film, but it does tend to stumble over its own feet a bit. Just a bit.Not modest or afraid at all, American History X is chock full of lengthly, rather rotund exhibits of preaching - and it is even mentioned once in the film - which is not a bad thing in itself. I hear lots of people crowing about how that's what's wrong with this movie, but no, it isn't. I don't mind it at all, and it mostly just serves as food for thought and a way of carrying the story along. But yes, there it is - this preaching, as it is so dubbed, carries the story far too much, overwhelming the movie like a blanket. The problem with this movie is that it's incomplete. Come on, are we really supposed to believe that all of this - the party, the talk, the flashbacks, the death - happened in one night? Are we honestly expected to believe that this white supremacist teenager changed his outlook in life in one single night while writing an essay? The ending, too...while touching, it left me feeling cold overall. Nothing here was elaborated upon properly - we didn't see near enough of Derek's transformation to a new man in prison; just the bare minimum of it. There were less than 3 scenes with this Cameron character, who had been built up as quite important, and the whole party speeds by like a blur to the point where you wonder what just hit you. Give us more, dammit, this barely scrapes the surface of the potential this movie had. It tries to fool us by throwing in a lot of preaching and whatnot, but that won't fool me.Regardless, I did enjoy this quite a bit. American History X grabbed me by the throat and went full-throttle for damn near two hours. The characters are believable, and the plot is thick and quite juicy. It's a thoughtful, pensive film that will force you to really sink your teeth in and think; this isn't a summer blockbuster or a popcorn flick of any kind. For fans of intelligent, creative, introspective films, this is a winner, but be warned, it is not as good as people say. A rather tragic complex; a great film that just doesn't live up to expectations. The potential is there, though, and all in all this is an enjoyable film, so go get it if this sounds like your thing.

Come on, are we really supposed to believe that all of this - the party, the talk, the flashbacks, the death - happened in one night? Are we honestly expected to believe that this white supremacist teenager changed his outlook in life in one single night while writing an essay? The ending, too...while touching, it left me feeling cold overall. Nothing here was elaborated upon properly - we didn't see near enough of Derek's transformation to a new man in prison; just the bare minimum of it. There were less than 3 scenes with this Cameron character, who had been built up as quite important, and the whole party speeds by like a blur to the point where you wonder what just hit you. Give us more, dammit, this barely scrapes the surface of the potential this movie had. It tries to fool us by throwing in a lot of preaching and whatnot, but that won't fool me.Regardless, I did enjoy this quite a bit. American History X grabbed me by the throat and went full-throttle for damn near two hours. The characters are believable, and the plot is thick and quite juicy. It's a thoughtful, pensive film that will force you to really sink your teeth in and think; this isn't a summer blockbuster or a popcorn flick of any kind. For fans of intelligent, creative, introspective films, this is a winner, but be warned, it is not as good as people say. A rather tragic complex; a great film that just doesn't live up to expectations. The potential is there, though, and all in all this is an enjoyable film, so go get it if this sounds like your thing.

Oh well, I got to watch it like a new movie. I'm a big fan of Charlie Sheen, and love his works from Platoon to Wall Street, from Good Advice to 2.5 Good Men. I decided to rent this one after reading some reviews that compared it to Top Gun, one of my all-time favorite classics. Unfortunately it was VERY wide off the mark, but that didn't stop me from moderately enjoying this film.Navy Seals could only be compared to Top Gun in the way that there's a very thin storyline, lots of mindless action scenes, and an in-your-face cast of characters. It is, however, extremely wise to compare head to head with Top Gun because it is severely devoid of the style and class that Bruckheimer adds to his movies. The first scene in Navy Seals (not the marriage scene, the action scene) kind of disappointed me because it wasn't very well choreographed, and did not wow me at all. Some reviews of Top Gun were spot on, it was like an hour and a half of MTV. Navy Seals tries to include a bit of storyline and there's too much talking, too little rock songs, and insufficient testosterone. Sheen is great but instead of cocky, he's reckless. A bit different, which isn't bad, but I guess I love Top Gun too much to have fully enjoyed Seals. Another minor gripe is the stereotype cast here might've been alright for the 90's, but made me cringe. I can understand Sheen shooting arabs because they're just a type of bad guy, it could easily have been Germans, Chinese, Japanese, North Koreans, Filipinos, Thais, or even crazy extremist Americans. But what I do have a problem with, is the racial slurs he blurted about the middle eastern people, totally unnecessary and doesn't really build his character, rather it just showed his lack of class. I blame the scriptwriters for this.All in all a decent movie for its time, I would've given a 6 as I found myself a bit bored in between the missions, but it gets an extra point for the tow truck chase and insertion scenes. Not quite as breathtaking as watching an F14 Tomcat taking off, but still very good and I liked how each mission was a bit different.

Thirteen years later, I remain just as impressed and the film continues to be one of my favorites. What could have been just another cheesy dangerous-animals-run-amok flick was instead a suspense filled, exciting, scary movie that also carried the important theme of showing humility before nature and having a respect for living things, as well as what the consequences can be when you don't.I won't go on and on about the brilliance of the special effects or how amazing the dinosaurs were, because there's not much disagreement about that. The T-Rex is one of the coolest things you will ever see, and the raptors are absolutely chilling in their intelligence and agility. Your heart will definitely pound if you've never seen it before. It'll probably pound if you have too.I have seen some complaints about the script\/characters\/acting however, and disagree with them for the most part. There's a truly interesting array of characters in this film. Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleontologist and paleobotanist bring so much heart to this movie. The scene where they see the real live brachiasaurus for the first time after dedicating their lives to digging up fossils and making interpretations about their behavior blows me away every time. Their awe and academic excitement is very touching, and combined with John Williams' perfect score, this scene truly is my favorite.The way Grant is unable to even stand up because of the shock is very endearing. And later on in the movie, after witnessing deaths due to these creatures, the change seen in Grant as he throws away the raptor claw he always kept with him is powerful. His relationship with the two children visiting the park develops in a sweet way as well as he goes from being highly annoyed by their presence to risking his life to protect them when no one else can.In contrast to the paleontologists, Jeff Goldblum gives a great performance as Dr. Ian Malcolm, an arrogant, sarcastic and very amusing mathematician who studies Chaos Theory, and believes from the start that Jurassic Park is doomed to fail. He's highly opinionated, a little on the rude side and a blatant flirt but he brings a lot of life to the film and despite his quirks is the voice of reason.John Hammond, the millionaire responsible for creating Jurassic Park also gives a fascinating performance. For those of you who've read the novel, he is a somewhat more sympathetic character than the money hungry Hammond of the book. He is definitely stubborn and infuriating as he refuses to see the horrible danger of what he's doing, but he is doing it with a kindness and desire to bring joy to people's lives, and displays an eventual humility that makes him likable.Overall, this movie is one of the most fun rides I've ever had with cinema, and even though I've probably seen it over 50 times, it never gets old.

As awful as that sounds as I describe it, it's not quite as bad in execution.The movie opens with an extended credit sequence featuring Pamela Anderson Lee being splashed with water while exposing her breasts. We find out that she's really on a mission to rescue a schoolgirl from some pervs at a strip joint. But she isn't all heart, she demands full payment from the kid's parents, even taking their car and leaving them stranded in a bad neighborhood.Okay, it's 2019, the Second American Civil War, where a Nazi-like government has taken over the country. (Hey, isn't that going to happen in 2012, when Trump becomes President?) Steel City, like Casablanca, if a free port where people can get out of the country. Barb Wire, who is supposedly famous there (but not to pervs in a strip joint, it seems)runs a bar called the Hammerhead. A Government scientist named Cora D is fleeing to Canada to prove that the Congressional Directorate unleashed a deadly plague upon the people. Her ticket out is some specially made contact lenses that confuse retinal scanners. Hot on her trail are fascist officers of the Government.So what you have is Casablanca with reversed genders, lots of car chases and explosions, and some incredibly bad acting. Oh, yeah, and Pamela gets upset when people call her Babe.If there is one thing I am grateful for, it is that even though they plagiarized all the major characters from Casablanca, they didn't feel the need to plagiarize the dialog. That really would have been too much. What made Casablanca a great movie was its subtly, something lost on modern filmmakers. I suspect if it were ever remade in full, it would look more like Barb Wire than the original.Overall, it is not the horrible movie everyone made it out to be. It isn't good, but it isn't horrible.

His kind of film. The comic book roots are still visible, but the touch of the man definitely shines through. The Gothic visuals are a definite plus, and really work well with the characters(whom Burton treats with the right amount of screen-time each... it's note-worthy that the first character seen who links this to the first film *isn't* the title character). The grotesque villains and imagery works as well as it did in the first film, although it may at times become silly. The development is quite good, and this manages to provide motivation for several main characters. It also keeps to a quite high pace, without being overwhelming or hurried. The acting is great. For almost all of the film, I wasn't thinking that I was watching Danny DeVito portray The Penguin... I was watching The Penguin. He disappeared into that role. Michelle Pfeiffer does marvelous as both Kyle and Catwoman(and this one actually uses a *real* whip), and also shines in all her scenes(and her on-screen growth and transformation is an accomplishment). Keaton brings the Bat alive again, and does well as Bruce Wayne, too. Walken is creepy as usual, and he really adds to the film. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered, throughout. The humor is just about perfect, it never goes too far, and never tries too hard, but the film definitely delivers some (intentional) laughs. The plot, while it does perhaps suffer from what appears to be interference by the studio to keep the character of Harvey Dent out of the film, is magnificent. It all comes together and works. The production design is excellent. The sets, the costumes, props, everything. The film is dark, the tone and feel, throughout. It is most definitely *not* for children. The sexuality and violence alone should tell anyone that. The special effects are expertly done throughout. The direction, cinematography and editing are excellent. This may not be quite as much of an achievement as the first, and have fewer iconic shots and details, but it is definitely a worthy sequel. You may also want to give the commentary track, by Burton, a listen. I recommend this to any fan of the first, the characters, and the people involved in putting this on the big screen. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2007","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" What got Tim Burton to come back to the Batman franchise as a director was, at least in part, being offered doing a Burton film.

My memory of the first viewing is fairly vague (proving how forgettable the movie is), and as it turns out, my second viewing wasn't much different, if at all.Mitch Preston has been a hardworking LAPD detective for twenty years.

After this, the network plans to sue the department, unless Preston participates in a reality TV show about cops! The detective is forced by his boss to reluctantly do so, and it doesn't help when Officer Trey Sellars, who takes his job as a cop a lot less seriously than Preston does, and is just hungry for fame, becomes his partner on the show! These two are to track down a criminal with a highly destructive weapon, but working together will obviously be difficult for them! As a comedy, Showtime didn't do it for me.

You figure that Mark Rutland became president of his family's business because he had a fair amount of business acumen and a semblance of common sense. Once he realizes that Mary Taylor has robbed his safe and has a history of aliases in other cities doing the same, how is it he keeps the romance going? Especially when Marnie makes every effort to dissuade him at every turn. They say love is blind and marriage is an eye opener, but it seems to me that Rutland had his eyes sewn shut.With that off my chest, director Hitchcock does a decent enough job of maintaining intrigue and suspense in the story; the aforementioned safe robbery scene with the cleaning lady was particularly noteworthy. Yet at the same time, I have to wonder why Hitch resorted to such almost comical techniques as used in the riding sequence of the fox hunt scene and the rapid zoom in and out of the money in the safe. The latter reminded me of some of those 1940's Warner Brothers cartoons that employ a similar device. It had the feel of a fledgling director who might still be searching for his own vision in making a picture instead of someone with a whole pile of them under his belt already. I have to tell you though, the scene that made me wince was Marnie's horse taking that fall over the jump.You know what the biggest surprise for me was? Finding out that actress Louise Latham played the parts of both the elder Mrs. Edgar and the young mother of Marnie in the scene with the sailor. The makeup job was so good for both characterizations that it even fooled Hitchcock's assistant director on the set, who asked who the actress was to show up for the flash back filming.Coming off of Hitchcock's suspense thriller The Birds, I thought Tippi Hedren did more than a competent job as the conflicted title character, bringing a range of emotion to a role that could have wound up a caricature if not done as well. Opposite Sean Connery, Hedren wondered how she could pull it off. Credit director Hitchcock with a firm but insightful bit of advice - It's called acting.

The makeup job was so good for both characterizations that it even fooled Hitchcock's assistant director on the set, who asked who the actress was to show up for the flash back filming.Coming off of Hitchcock's suspense thriller The Birds, I thought Tippi Hedren did more than a competent job as the conflicted title character, bringing a range of emotion to a role that could have wound up a caricature if not done as well. Opposite Sean Connery, Hedren wondered how she could pull it off. Credit director Hitchcock with a firm but insightful bit of advice - It's called acting.

The biggest insult as of date has been the editing of the cartoons of yester-year, due to the smoking and racial depictions that were seen in those masterpieces. Animated series today lack the daring of those programmes and thus children are introduced to juvenile feel-goodery rather than the comic violence provided by the Looney Tunes. Even Sesame Street's Cookie Monster has been put on a diet, due to angry letters from parent's groups. The only cartoon out there that is not afraid to be blunt, satirical and downright naughty is South Park, the crudely animated adventures of four boys in a Colorado mountain town. Each week, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring forth what can be referred to as a warped, politically-charged and happily vulgar version of Peanuts. Yet, looking beyond the construction paper animation and constant swearing, South Park proves to be a witty and funny blend of intelligent, take-no-prisoners humour and even some heart and sweetness thrown in as well. The feature film version of the animated series, appropriately and comically titled Bigger, Longer & Uncut, has a message which Parker and Stone manage to successfully swing it in along with a bunch of side-splitting funny sight gags, musical numbers and flatulence humour.Free from the restraints of television, Parker and Stone are free to enter possibilities that have not been explored before in the series. Yet, they oddly decide to keep it low-key by centering on the four main boys. Kyle and Stan are the straight men and the eight-year-old altar egos of Matt and Trey. Simply put, they may be vulgar and the comments spewing out of their mouths may not be the most friendly, but they're likable and the characters the audience is most able to relate. Even the bigoted slimeball that is Cartman has a sweet side to him, as he is all for the fight against censorship. In a situation almost akin to A Clockwork Orange, once he has been forced to no longer swear, the audience is waiting for him to get his beloved powers back. And finally, there's Kenny the un-sung hero of the story. While his death is used by the parents as a way to exploit their cause, Kenny attempts to stop the war once he learns of Hussein's intentions. The South Park gang have been around for a decade now and yet it's this film that's them at their all-time best.Plenty of what makes the film more than just a longer episode of the series is the way in which Trey Parker and Broadway composer Marc Shaiman turn Bigger, Longer & Uncut into a Disney-style musical. The songs are clever and creative and best of all, they help move the plot along and do not feel like they're just adding to the running time. The opening number Mountain Town, a parody of Beauty and the Beast's beginning, fools the audience into believing that they're about to watch a feel-good family comedy by giving it a tone different from what appears after those first four minutes. After that, the music goes in all sorts of directions. The audience is treated to a profane and flatulence filled homage to Oklahoma!, a march declaring the evils of America's neighbour to the north, a song of admiration towards a figure skater and finally, a combination of the film's best tunes done in the style of Les Miserables. There is even a love ballad played during the end credits, spoofing the typical melodramatic songs that Oscar usually awards (and South Park would, not surprisingly, lose to). Parker understands the musical genre perfectly, as previously evidenced in his student film Cannibal! The Musical and Bigger, Longer & Uncut stands as one of the best the art of cinema has offered.One of the most notable aspects of South Park, along with the humour, is the political satire. In Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Parker and Stone go up against their biggest enemy since going on the air humourless parent's groups. Along with Stan and Kyle, the two foul-mouthed Colorodians are also represented by the two foul-mouthed Canadians Terrance and Philip. The two characters are not necessarily a parody of South Park, but more-so how easily offended parents view South Park a badly animated cartoon filled with low brow toilet humour consisting of flatulence jokes and swear words. It may have all of those things, but if people judge it without actually watching it, it's hard to get behind them. If they actually view it, they will find that South Park is satirical and not after all targets, but only those who deserve it. If they actually become offended by what they see, at least they are shown as less intolerant due to actually giving it a chance. Another aspect of parent's groups that Bigger, Longer & Uncut so wonderfully shows is its ability to blame others for their own mistakes. South Park is not intended for children, yet they still manage to find a way to watch it. Instead of blaming Parker and Stone, they should sit down, switch off the television and talk to their children. Sending angry letters to networks and studios that don't read them or waging war with a country which is just providing innocent entertainment isn't going to do any good. Instead, these people are actually giving Parker and Stone more publicity and more targets to make fun of.Then again, if it weren't for the parent's groups, there wouldn't be this marvelous film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the two most brave comedians in the television and film business and their magnum opus is the delightful, but meaningful Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This is not just an animated comedy. It's a musical, a message film and an attack on judgmental adults everywhere.

The director wants to make sure there is more there than even the sharpest minds can grab in the first viewing. There are subtle references to Curry's famous role of Dr. Frankenfurter in Rocky Horror Picture Show. That is the undertone. There is also a layer of more overt corny humour.What bothered me about the show was the stellar cast spent much of its time just standing around, running from room to room or screaming.I'd love to see this movie again just for the few scenes where Madelaine Kahn got to do her thing. Tim Curry is a hoot, and pulls off some amazing physical humour as well.It is set in the 1940s when the FBI and J.
