John Dahl, who made his mark making neo-noir cult classics like Red Rock West and The Last Seduction, shows a sure hand and an insight into the world of poker. The two lead actors, Matt Damon and Edward Norton, are absolutely perfect in their roles.

He ends up getting a delivery job for long time rounder Knish (John Turtorro) and settles into life in law school with his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol). Its not a bad life, but deep inside we know that Mike still craves the life of a gambler.

He also gets in debt to a local gambling hall, who he instructed to loan money to Worm. Worm takes full advantage of course, as you would expect by this point. As I watched this character develop my first thought was...I know someone just like this! My second thought was of what a great performance Ed Norton gives here. I can't even put into words just how perfect he is as the Worm; it has to experienced.This film is something of a mood-piece, as well as a sort of character study.

You dig.¨ I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous ¨Dollars¨ movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.The plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, ¨When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.¨ Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 September 2010","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" ¨You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig.

High school friends, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard), cruise their favorite hometown strip the evening before they are to leave for college. They spend their last night looking for new and exciting adventures, while hanging out with their childhood friends. The film's theme revolves around how Steve and Curt are faced with tough decisions as they are forced to come to grips with the fact they are going to leave their family and friends the following morning. They become more self-aware and begin to understand the decisions they make on this night will change the course of the rest of their lives. The events of this single night force them to face the fear and anxiety they have about growing up and the uncertainty of life after high school.John (Paul LeMat) was the character who seemed to add to the angst Curt and Steve were feeling about leaving their hometown. He stuck out as the, coolest, toughest and fastest, yet he seemed to be the example the others kids pointed to as to why they should leave town and go to college. John reveled in his status as the cool, elder of the group and some of the other kids placed him on a pedestal. In one scene, Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who was younger than John, exclaimed John's coolness, after a John won a car race, by telling himYou'll always be number one. You're the greatest. (American Graffiti, 1973, Lucas, G. (Director)) In contrast to this attitude, in another scene Curt had just told Steve he was not leaving town to go to school, when John pulled up in his hot rod. Steve was annoyed by this pronouncement, pointed to John and told CurtDo you want to end up like John? You just can't stay 17 forever! (American Graffiti, 1973, Lucas, G. (Director))John stuck around his hometown and did not see a need to move away or do anything different. He was happy feeling like a big fish in a small pond. His attitude added confusion to what Steve and Curt were dealing with throughout the movie.Another difficulty Steve was facing was the relationship he had with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams). Laurie was having a hard time accepting with the fact Steve was going to be leaving town and going off to college. They were trying to enjoy their last night with their friends, but the fact Steve was leaving kept introducing negative emotions into their interactions. This lead Steve to reconsider his own decision to leave his hometown and go to college.As the American Graffiti story unfolded, I could see an Ironic twist developing. Steve, who in the beginning of the film wanted to get out of his hometown, began to realize the extent of the feelings he had for Laurie. Ultimately Steve promises Laurie he will not leave her and decides to stay home.Conversely, in the beginning of the film Curt was unsure if he wanted to go away to college. As American Graffiti unfolds, he begins to see the world differently when a series of events forces him to step outside of his comfort zone. Curt spots a girl he has never seen before and decides he has to meet her. He pursues her all night long, sees her several more times, but never gets to meet her in person. Finally, just hours before he is scheduled to leave, he speaks to the girl over the phone. The girl offers to meet Curt if he stays in town and does not leave for college. He declines this invitation and decides to leave for school that morning. This interaction outside of his normal social circle allowed Curt to see there was a whole new world waiting for, however, he needed to leave his comfort zone to find it. He ends up flying to college that morning without Steve. This one night changed the way both Steve and Curt viewed the world. Music and lighting are the 2 most prominent techniques used to support the theme of the film. Music from the time period is present in almost every scene. Even when the characters are speaking to one another, the music is ever present in the back ground. The music of this particular period is when rock and roll was beginning to defining itself. This specific genre of rock and roll represents youthfulness and was very prevalent in the lives of teenagers in the early 60's.Lighting in American Graffiti is very dark. Given the movie takes place over the course of a single night, this lighting technique is very effective. The dark lighting never lets the viewer forget the time frame the film takes place in. The fact the teenagers in this film stay out all night points to the youth of the characters. In reality, there is not a single reason the events of this film could not have taken place from 700 A.M. to 700 P.M. However, that time frame does not speak to the youthfulness that goes along with staying out until the sun comes up.The story of Steve and Curt is universal. American Graffiti has the ability to take baby boomer viewers back to a simpler time of their own youth when they were on the cusp of becoming an adult. All high school graduates are faced with the difficult decision to either stay or leave their hometown. This decision will dictate the path they take as an adult.

High school friends, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard), cruise their favorite hometown strip the evening before they are to leave for college. They spend their last night looking for new and exciting adventures, while hanging out with their childhood friends. The film's theme revolves around how Steve and Curt are faced with tough decisions as they are forced to come to grips with the fact they are going to leave their family and friends the following morning. They become more self-aware and begin to understand the decisions they make on this night will change the course of the rest of their lives. The events of this single night force them to face the fear and anxiety they have about growing up and the uncertainty of life after high school.John (Paul LeMat) was the character who seemed to add to the angst Curt and Steve were feeling about leaving their hometown. He stuck out as the, coolest, toughest and fastest, yet he seemed to be the example the others kids pointed to as to why they should leave town and go to college. John reveled in his status as the cool, elder of the group and some of the other kids placed him on a pedestal. In one scene, Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who was younger than John, exclaimed John's coolness, after a John won a car race, by telling himYou'll always be number one. You're the greatest.

Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson have a summer affair when at the request of his parents he goes on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine Robinson played by Katherine Ross, and soon falls in love with her putting Benjamin in the middle of a love triangle. This film is a comedy, drama, romance that's theme is a combination of love, sex, relationships, deception, and insecurity.The movie starts out with Benjamin Braddock recently graduates from college and returns home. His parents have a party at their house in his honor. When the party is about over Mrs. Robinson asks Benjamin to give her a ride home. Once they are at her house she invites him in for a drink. Before the evening is over Mrs. Robinson propositions him, she is straight forward about what she wants from him she wants to have a love affair. Benjamin is very nervous and is soon able to leave the house, but Mrs. Robinson's proposal of a love affair has him thinking about it. It doesn't take him long before he calls her and takes her up on the affair. Mrs. Robinson is quite forward about wanting to seduce him. Benjamin is a young inexperienced man trying to find his way in the world. Since he is young and inexperienced with sex he has some insecurities about himself and his life. At first for Benjamin he was flattered by Mrs. Robinson's seduction, but soon becomes ashamed of what he was doing. When they got together there was no talking they just jumped in bed to have sex. Benjamin wanted more than sex he wanted a relationship to go along with the sex. Although not talking bothered Benjamin it didn't bother Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson is clearly comfortable with just having sex with Benjamin and is all right with the deception in what she is doing.The secret love affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson goes on all summer when Benjamin's father Mr. Braddock, played by William Daniels, encourages Benjamin to go on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. On their date Benjamin is sure he doesn't like Elaine and at first tries to make the date miserable for her. After he succeeds at making the date a mess he feels bad when she starts crying. Something feels bad about the way he behaves and apologies to her and then they start the date over again. They end up having a great time and begin to like each other. Benjamin soon falls in love with Elaine and wants to marry her. He is determined to put his affair with her mother behind him and marry Elaine. When Elaine finds out about the affair, at first she wants nothing to do with him. Benjamin doesn't give up on her wanting to be with him. He starts following her around starting with going to the college she attends. Elaine resists him for a while even after Benjamin asks her to marry him. Elaine eventually gives into her own feelings when Benjamin comes to get her on her wedding day, she is about to marry someone else. Benjamin and Elaine run away together just before she is to be married to someone else.The movie The Graduate directed Mike Nichols has won an Oscar, 19 other awards, and was nominated for 13 other awards. I can certainly see why this film won the awards and is considered a classic today. I'm not sure it is the story that makes this film so great or the editing of the film. The filming, editing, and the music all contribute greatly to the effects of the film. This film is wonderfully edited, the scenes flow smoothly from one scene to another. This film is full of great scenes. The film draws you in from the beginning and keeps your interest to the end of the movie. There are many wonderful scenes in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when Benjamin walks out of his house, he is thinking about Mrs. Robinson, he dives into his pool and comes out of the water to slide up onto his raft. The scene shows him coming out of the water and starts sliding up on the raft and the next scene he is on top Mrs. Robinson. The next scene he is back on his raft and his father is talking to him. This is a great scene that shows illusions of what he is thinking or dreaming about. All the shots are put together to where the transitions of one shot to another flow together. The music in this film is very fitting to the movie's theme. Simon & Garfunkel's song The Sounds of Silence is a perfect song for this film. This song goes along with the mood of the characters in the film. The other of Simon and Garfunkel's songs Here's to you Mrs. Robinson is another song that goes along with the movie.I think Mike Nichols 1967 film The Graduate is a true classic and one that will be watched for generations to come. In the movie the filming, music, and acting all worked wonderfully together to make this film a huge success. This film is more than a good movie especially when you look at the time era in which it was made. This film being made in 1967 when the technology is not what it is today, there is no doubt about it this film is a work of art.

While many people would claim this is the best Star Wars movie, it really isn't&#x85;and it isn't even close.Which doesn't mean Empire isn't a great film. The last 25 minutes or so are as good as anything in Star Wars and there's plenty before that to keep you entertained. But I think folks get caught up in how much bigger, bolder and darker this sequel is compared to the first movie and don't notice the little cracks that run throughout the story.Empire picks up the story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the rebellion against the Empire at least a few years after the events of Star Wars. The rebels have just settled in to a new secret base when Luke gets bushwacked by a snow monster and sees an image of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Dagobah system and be trained by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). A probe droid leads the Empire to the Rebel base and after a big battle, Luke sets off for Dagobah while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and company get trapped by the Empire and eventually have to flee to Cloud City, where Han's old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) will help them repair the Millennium Falcon and hide from the Empire. As Luke trains, we learn that Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones) is desperate to find Luke and considers his Jedi potential to be extremely valuable or extremely dangerous to the Empire. Vader eventually lures Luke to Cloud City, where we get one of the all time great revelations in movie history, and witness our heroes battle to survive.Empire is definitely a bigger film than Star Wars. There's far more action on a much grander scale with more speed and thrills. But a lot of the big effects in Empire have not aged that well. Watching Empire, you can sort of understand how George Lucas became obsessed with going back and fixing things in the original trilogy.This is also one of the boldest movie blockbusters ever. The story is basically about how our heroes fail over and over and over again and barely escape by the skin of their teeth. And these are real failures, where Luke and Han aren't smart enough or strong enough or good enough to succeed, not flukes or situations where winning is impossible. Empire is very much about how the characters we loved from the first movie fall short and get beaten down.Which is one of the things that make it much darker than Star Wars or any other SW movie, except perhaps Revenge of the Sith. But that's not all. Star Wars was largely the story of Luke Skywalker growing from a boy to a man, but in a triumphant, cheerful, fairy tale sort of way. It's a hero's story. Empire is also about a boy becoming a man, but not in triumph. This is a story about Luke becoming an adult and learning that the world doesn't work the way children think it does. This is a story of lost innocence.Empire is a great movie and I don't want to overly criticize it, but you can see some basic problems compared to Star Wars. It doesn't really have a central plot propelling things along. For a big budget sci-fi spectacle, Empire is rather like one of those art house films where stuff just happens to the characters. The story also breaks up the Luke\/Leia\/Han triangle suggested in Star Wars and leaves Leia with little to do in this film other than be the foil for Han's amorous advances. And while the story is more adult in some ways, it's also simpler. There was a lot of stuff in Star Wars that suggested a wider universe in which that particular story was only a part. Empire shrinks everything down and links everything together in a much less sophisticated way. Darth Vader also becomes almost cartoonishly evil in Empire after having a core of believability in Star Wars. Although, the story does do a good job of illustrating how being that evil is ultimately self-defeating. And there's a lot of little comedic bits crammed into the story, with most of it C-3PO related. It's not as bad a Jar Jar Binks, but it's a step down that road.One of the other striking things about Empire is seeing puppet Yoda again after getting used to CGI created characters. There's no denying that while puppet Yoda looked great in 1980, now he really looks fake. But puppet Yoda actually seems more alive than the CGI Yoda of the prequels. Puppet Yoda looks fake but feels real, while CGI Yoda looks real but feels fake. It think it must be because puppet Yoda was mostly the creation of a single artist, allowing his talent and personality to shine through, while CGI Yoda was a product that was sort of manufactured by a large team.A lot of people say Empire was as good as it was because people other than George Lucas played such a big role in making it. But noticing the weaknesses in Empire really only emphasizes how great a job Lucas did in Star Wars&#x85;which also emphasizes how poorly he did when it came to making the prequels.

While many people would claim this is the best Star Wars movie, it really isn't&#x85;and it isn't even close.Which doesn't mean Empire isn't a great film. The last 25 minutes or so are as good as anything in Star Wars and there's plenty before that to keep you entertained. But I think folks get caught up in how much bigger, bolder and darker this sequel is compared to the first movie and don't notice the little cracks that run throughout the story.Empire picks up the story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the rebellion against the Empire at least a few years after the events of Star Wars. The rebels have just settled in to a new secret base when Luke gets bushwacked by a snow monster and sees an image of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Dagobah system and be trained by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). A probe droid leads the Empire to the Rebel base and after a big battle, Luke sets off for Dagobah while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and company get trapped by the Empire and eventually have to flee to Cloud City, where Han's old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) will help them repair the Millennium Falcon and hide from the Empire. As Luke trains, we learn that Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones) is desperate to find Luke and considers his Jedi potential to be extremely valuable or extremely dangerous to the Empire. Vader eventually lures Luke to Cloud City, where we get one of the all time great revelations in movie history, and witness our heroes battle to survive.Empire is definitely a bigger film than Star Wars. There's far more action on a much grander scale with more speed and thrills. But a lot of the big effects in Empire have not aged that well. Watching Empire, you can sort of understand how George Lucas became obsessed with going back and fixing things in the original trilogy.This is also one of the boldest movie blockbusters ever. The story is basically about how our heroes fail over and over and over again and barely escape by the skin of their teeth. And these are real failures, where Luke and Han aren't smart enough or strong enough or good enough to succeed, not flukes or situations where winning is impossible. Empire is very much about how the characters we loved from the first movie fall short and get beaten down.Which is one of the things that make it much darker than Star Wars or any other SW movie, except perhaps Revenge of the Sith. But that's not all. Star Wars was largely the story of Luke Skywalker growing from a boy to a man, but in a triumphant, cheerful, fairy tale sort of way. It's a hero's story. Empire is also about a boy becoming a man, but not in triumph. This is a story about Luke becoming an adult and learning that the world doesn't work the way children think it does. This is a story of lost innocence.Empire is a great movie and I don't want to overly criticize it, but you can see some basic problems compared to Star Wars. It doesn't really have a central plot propelling things along. For a big budget sci-fi spectacle, Empire is rather like one of those art house films where stuff just happens to the characters. The story also breaks up the Luke\/Leia\/Han triangle suggested in Star Wars and leaves Leia with little to do in this film other than be the foil for Han's amorous advances. And while the story is more adult in some ways, it's also simpler. There was a lot of stuff in Star Wars that suggested a wider universe in which that particular story was only a part. Empire shrinks everything down and links everything together in a much less sophisticated way. Darth Vader also becomes almost cartoonishly evil in Empire after having a core of believability in Star Wars. Although, the story does do a good job of illustrating how being that evil is ultimately self-defeating. And there's a lot of little comedic bits crammed into the story, with most of it C-3PO related. It's not as bad a Jar Jar Binks, but it's a step down that road.One of the other striking things about Empire is seeing puppet Yoda again after getting used to CGI created characters. There's no denying that while puppet Yoda looked great in 1980, now he really looks fake. But puppet Yoda actually seems more alive than the CGI Yoda of the prequels. Puppet Yoda looks fake but feels real, while CGI Yoda looks real but feels fake. It think it must be because puppet Yoda was mostly the creation of a single artist, allowing his talent and personality to shine through, while CGI Yoda was a product that was sort of manufactured by a large team.A lot of people say Empire was as good as it was because people other than George Lucas played such a big role in making it. But noticing the weaknesses in Empire really only emphasizes how great a job Lucas did in Star Wars&#x85;which also emphasizes how poorly he did when it came to making the prequels.

It's a great film, and it plays better now than it did when I first saw it. The virtuoso Wagner scene with the helicopter attack has actually improved over time, in part because it's so startling to see a complicated, beautifully organized battle sequence that's not done with any CGI. And a lot of the things that bored me or annoyed me the first time I watched the movie now add interesting depths and detours to the film. The storyline is about as straightforward as possible an assassin goes upriver on a mission to kill a renegade colonel. But the film keeps veering off from the mission to asides that are much more enjoyable on a second viewing the weird interlude with the Playboy bunny performance (a great satire on all those old sugary USO shows from the past), the jungle conversation about sauces, the search of the local boat that ends in a bloodbath, the walk along the trenches around the bridge that keeps getting built back up every night, just so the VC can tear it down again. I also found myself enjoying the Brando scenes much more than I did before. They actually follow Conrad pretty closely, both in spirit and in action, and a lot of thought has gone into them -- enough to make you realize how little thought goes into most war movies nowadays, how satisfied they are with not even bothering to ask any troubling or difficult questions. Apocalypse Now doesn't have any answers to those questions, but neither did Conrad, and the movie is actually better than the novel in one sense Conrad, because of the era he was writing in, couldn't really show us what Kurtz meant at the end when he talked about the horror, the horror. Apocalypse Now shows us, and does it so well that Kurtz's last words hold more meaning for us at the end of the film than they do at the end of the book.

In a little down time &#x96; as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie revenge against women.Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeah&#x85;there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf.They do what they set out to.

The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors.I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns.

'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is a wonderful, powerful piece of cinema that after 35 years of sitting in video store selves still manages to set the standards for all other movies.Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of a fierce rivalry that takes place inside a mental institution that will ultimately change how the patients view the world as well as themselves. Randle McMurphy, played by the iconic Jack Nicholson, is an incredibly high spirited former prison inmate who has been sent to the mental hospital for examination due to suspicion of being psychotically ill. After noticing that the patients don't seem to have any sense of life enjoyment he attempts to raise their spirits and lighten up the tone deaf building by introducing new games, new places, and new perspectives. However this does not compute with Ms Ratched, the head nurse of the institution, and of one the greatest movie villains of all time.Played by the talented Louise Fletcher, Ms Ratched is the authority of the institution, she runs the house and she calls the shots, and while she doesn't really show it, she enjoys being queen. That's why only when Randle McMurphy came along and started to mess with her schedule did things really begin to heat up.At the very start of the movie when you are given a brief look into what the institution is like (the bleak colour, the haunting music, and the sound of the words over the monitor medication time), when Ms Ratched walks down the hall way, with every person she passes saying good morning Ms Ratched, you can tell that this is her sanctuary and that she likes it. So when Randle McMuprhy stepped out of the car and expressed his loud, excitingly enthusiastic attitude for the first time, great interest arose into how this very disruptive man was going to react to the institution and Ms Ratched's policies about routine and schedule, obviously not yell.The whole foundation of this movie is based on the negative energy portrayed between these two very different figures. It creates pretty much all of the drama and beauty of the film. Some of the most powerful moments found in this movie were the example of the fierce difference in opinion between Ms Ratchet and McMurphy. Take for example when McMurphy requested changing the schedule to watch the World Series and Ms Ratched refused. He angrily sat down on the couch in front of the TV, and started to mime a commentary on an imaginary baseball game. All of the patients then sat down with him and also began to chime in, screaming and chanting as if they were watching the real thing. That was one of my most favourite scenes out of the whole movie.The role of Randle McMurphy is a career defining part for Jack Nicholson. Over the years I have seen him play many great characters in many great movies. Detective Gittes in Chinatown, Jack Torrance in The Shining, Melvin Udall in As Good as it Gets are all great examples of Nicholson's amazing acting talent. However his portrayal of the high spirited simpleton trying to get a group of given up patients to embrace life is a heart-warming performance unlike any other. His character is so lovable that when you get to the part of where they(the crew at the institution) have finally taken down McMurphy, you can't help but feel for him.It's hard not to give focus to the lead performances, because let's face it, who really cares about those faceless extra's in the background. But the supporting roles in this movie are undeniable. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and Brad Dourif are all absolutely breathtaking.

The major character in the film is Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who seduces Ben who is initially mortified and confused but after literally months of meeting with her actually wishes to have intellectual conversations with her that backfire. Eventually, his father convinces him to take Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) out on a date which for him is humiliating because he's sleeping with her mother and dating her was forbidden by Mrs. Robinson.After the first date however, Ben realizes he really likes Elaine and wants to continue dating her. However, as soon as Elaine finds out about Ben and her mother she breaks off the relationship and returns to college. After a short amount of time Ben follows her up to Berkeley and begins pursuing her. If you don't like stalker kind of films, you may not like this movie, even though it's not a violent stalking, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

From here would spawn the likes of George Lucas's Star Wars and later Tarantino's Kill Bill, each generation of Leone devotees increasingly flat and weightless.Leone's own work would become increasingly suffused with postmodernism's undertow of nostalgia and regret, films like West and America less about plot than they are a film nerd's feverish dreams, all the tropes of the gangster and the western genre fetishized and mourned, a series of melancholic referrals to Ford, Hawks, Boetticher, Anthony Mann, Raoul Walsh, George Stevens and the hard boiled literature of Chandler and Hammett (the first two dollars movies are essentially film noirs with horses). These films aren't about the passage of time, but the passage of cinema, a child's attempt to hold on to the images of his past. No surprise that Leone's cites John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence as his favourite Western, as it's Ford's most melancholic and nostalgic film.Leone's films are thus primarily concerned about living with the image of America, and never being American. His films revolve around a vision of America as an all pervading presence always seen from a distance, through the image. In this regard, many of his films rely on flashbacks and memory. Think the nostalgia, longing and melancholy of Colonel Mortimer in For a Few Dollars More, of Harmonica and Cheyenne in West, and the protagonists of Dynamite and America, all of whom reflect Leone's own nostalgic feelings towards an America which he imagined, discovered, idealised, desired and naively longed for as a child (and latter as an artist). Paradoxically, however, Leone's nostalgia doesn't owe itself to distance from or homesickness for real things and places; his is a purely artistic, and so dangerous, nostalgia. What he misses are signifiers, artistic representations, and so the constant in Leone's films is therefore not subversion (that's Altman), like many claim, but rather infatuation; in the end, myths remains myths and at most they can be restated and updated, but not overturned.French philosopher Jean Baudrillard dubbed The Good the Bad and The Ugly the moment when modernism died and cinema began its crawl toward postmodernism. Baudrillard uses this term in a negative sense, speaking of a cultural obsession with lost objects, referrals and went on to predict art's progression toward a kind of weightlessness (eg Kill Bill) or reliance on resurrection and pastiche. While this is true for Leone's later films, TGTBATU belongs more to that sweet spot in world cinema (the late 60s and early 70s) in which iconoclasts like Antonioni, Altman, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Godard etc were thriving.And so while TGTBATU pulls from everywhere, both stylistically (the opening credits are modelled on the James Bond franchise, a series which Leone loved) and logistically (the film had financial backers in Germany, Spain and America, the cast were from all over the world and all spoke different languages etc), it's far more than a celluloid mash-up. It retains a certain weight typical of the 60s, more akin to the violent works of Siegel and Arthur Penn or the revisionist westerns of Altman, Peckinpah and late career Huston and Ford. Of course during this period you also had other extremely important but less known directors like Monte Hellman, Sydney Pollack, Robert Benton, Abraham Polonsky, George Hill, William Wiard, Elliot Silverstein and Ralph Nelson all making different kinds of interesting westerns (Tom Horn, A Man Called Horse, Soldier Blue etc).The point is, Leone didn't shatter the myth of the Old West. Everyone during this period was doing that. Everyone was working against traditional concepts of heroism and justice. No, what Leone did was re-mythologise the West using the iconoclastic techniques of 60s and 70s cinema. He dirtied things up and then put these larger than life men back up on pedestals.Of course what TGTBATU is really known for is its wonderful comic book style. Bob Dylan crossed from folk to electric in 1965, and here was Leone making the same transition, serving up a rock and roll Western with electric guitars. And so we have masterful widescreen Techniscope compositions, powerful juxtapositions between wide shots and extreme close ups, Ennio Morricone's innovative score, a cast of slimy, dirty heroes (the film's sloppy sound dubbing works in its grimy favour) and a tale that is flippant, ironic and playfully told.Though thin like a comicbook, the film also has a very primordial undertow, a certain weight, with its dreamlike terrain of bombed out ghost towns and a soundtrack which mimics rattlesnakes, coyotes and horses. Its plot may simply consists of sweaty scroungers navigating a landscape perpetually covered in war, death and suffering, but there's nevertheless something very human, existential even, about the film. Leone distills human nature down to simple elements and then injects a tone of regret such that the film seems to mourn the very archetypal humanity it revels in. Seems to mourn the very greed, violence and death that orbits around and within its small cast of characters. According to Leone, there's a little bit of good, bad and ugliness in everybody.

While this is true for Leone's later films, TGTBATU belongs more to that sweet spot in world cinema (the late 60s and early 70s) in which iconoclasts like Antonioni, Altman, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Godard etc were thriving.And so while TGTBATU pulls from everywhere, both stylistically (the opening credits are modelled on the James Bond franchise, a series which Leone loved) and logistically (the film had financial backers in Germany, Spain and America, the cast were from all over the world and all spoke different languages etc), it's far more than a celluloid mash-up. It retains a certain weight typical of the 60s, more akin to the violent works of Siegel and Arthur Penn or the revisionist westerns of Altman, Peckinpah and late career Huston and Ford. Of course during this period you also had other extremely important but less known directors like Monte Hellman, Sydney Pollack, Robert Benton, Abraham Polonsky, George Hill, William Wiard, Elliot Silverstein and Ralph Nelson all making different kinds of interesting westerns (Tom Horn, A Man Called Horse, Soldier Blue etc).The point is, Leone didn't shatter the myth of the Old West. Everyone during this period was doing that. Everyone was working against traditional concepts of heroism and justice. No, what Leone did was re-mythologise the West using the iconoclastic techniques of 60s and 70s cinema. He dirtied things up and then put these larger than life men back up on pedestals.Of course what TGTBATU is really known for is its wonderful comic book style. Bob Dylan crossed from folk to electric in 1965, and here was Leone making the same transition, serving up a rock and roll Western with electric guitars. And so we have masterful widescreen Techniscope compositions, powerful juxtapositions between wide shots and extreme close ups, Ennio Morricone's innovative score, a cast of slimy, dirty heroes (the film's sloppy sound dubbing works in its grimy favour) and a tale that is flippant, ironic and playfully told.Though thin like a comicbook, the film also has a very primordial undertow, a certain weight, with its dreamlike terrain of bombed out ghost towns and a soundtrack which mimics rattlesnakes, coyotes and horses. Its plot may simply consists of sweaty scroungers navigating a landscape perpetually covered in war, death and suffering, but there's nevertheless something very human, existential even, about the film. Leone distills human nature down to simple elements and then injects a tone of regret such that the film seems to mourn the very archetypal humanity it revels in. Seems to mourn the very greed, violence and death that orbits around and within its small cast of characters. According to Leone, there's a little bit of good, bad and ugliness in everybody. Every bastard in this film earns our sympathy, even if we know they'd be the first to stab us in the backs.9.5\/10 &#x96; (TGTBATU) 8.5\/10 &#x96; (FAFDM), 8\/10 &#x96; (DYS, OUATIA, AFOD), 7.9\/10 - (OUATITW) ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"17 September 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Metropolis has just been re-released in a brand new expanded version that includes material just re-discovered in 2008.

It totes a fantastic music score. It really is quality movie making. It has a nice theme and identity. A Few Good Men is easily top 50, more like top 25 for me, one of the all-time greats.

I saw it nearly 30 years ago. I went after midnight with a roommate and found the experience quite interesting. I don't criticize people for enjoying life and having fun with something like this. God knows, life can be boring at times and whatever puts a smile on your face and gets you through another day is OK with me. The movie itself is unlike anything I've seen. The songs are clever and over the top. From Tim Curry on down it is one strange kick after another. It is, of course, filled with every representative of what came to be the GLBT experience. It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later.

The Story of it you probably now from the trailer so i'm not gonna explain it. But also if you have seen the trailer it still has a few plot-twists and an very interesting story.The movie itself is totally awesome, its great to see Sam Neill again and they figured out a very intelligent plot to go back to the island. Special Effects of this movie are fantastic they took everything from the previous movies and evolved it to Level 300. I like the new dinosaurs Espacilly Spinosaurus and the remodeled Raptors. The Characters are very cool as well. Sam Neill is nice to come back ,he is a lot different that from JP1. The Soldiars and pretty much the entire cast you don't want to see dying, what is something a lot of Adventure\/Action movies fail to do.So thats pretty much it i could sit here and prays the movie for another hour. It has pretty much everything a movie of that kind should have OUTSTANDING Special Effects OUTSTANDING Scary moments OUTSTANDING CastSo yeah you should see it.
