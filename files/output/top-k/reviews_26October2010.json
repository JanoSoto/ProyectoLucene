Hell, I saw some of the documentary Making of Anaconda films and I was like Can't wait to see it. Never heard of any of actors, at that time, well J-Lo and Ice Cube were known and of course Jon Voight. OK, now... this film is usually for movie fans who loves those films where people are chased, or eaten by (impossibly) giant animals. Take example of Grizzly (1976), or Jaws (1975), or other Anaconda films. I must say that I am one of them, not a big fan, but I enjoy it a lot. This time, or perhaps for the first time, we have a giant snake that devours everything in the way... well almost everything.Let's start Story is typical, a group of people shots a documentary about tribes in Amazon jungle, and they helped out a snake hunter (Jon Voight) who used the crew as a help to hunt down a giant snake. Actually, he took them hostage... one man, took more than five people hostage, and no one can touch him. Why? I don't know. He is not armed. That is one weird part... In these movies, our walking meat does not think much critically. Script is also typical for these kind of films. Actors J- Lo, no talk here, I don't like her acting at all, although she give her best... Jon Voight... he steals the entire film, he was great! Calm, cold-blooded, insane snake hunter... he took the role and had a good fun with it. Eric Stolz, not too much from him... Owen Willson, a naive camera man... nothing special in that time, no future in comedy there at first, Ice Cube, a standard Brooklyn resident. Others... well... no comment, but I found it surprising to see Danny Trejo (Machete) on the beginning of the film.The snake was solid in few scenes, as a giant robot or puppet in some scenes, those were realistic, but CGI, damn that sucks. There's a lot of explanations about Anacondas, and some of them were showed in the film. But, are they valid?I say disgusting because I can't take out some of the ugly scenes from my head, but I say never mind, forget it and enjoy the film. Music stars are taking over? Yeah, the 90s were a memorable time for seeing some of the greatest music stars on screen. They are heroes. Yeah, heroes for attracting audience. Sit down relax and enjoy this popcorn film.

It is so obviously shot on studio sets. Actors are so obviously wearing make up. During the hilarious German magic salesman bit, whatever the German sprays in the spy's face makes the spy's make-up smear more and more. I can't quite figure out if Val Kilmer is just all-around wooden or if the Zuckers just don't tend to use his better takes. The musical sequences are truly boring, except for the rug sequence which is pretty cool. What it ends up boiling down to is an unending stream of puns and coarse visual gags one must wade through hopeless production values to take pleasure in.Regardless, if one can, there is one sequence that's such a unique example of expressly cinematic humor that I'm surprised to find it here rather than an early Woody Allen comedy. The hero visits a Swedish bookshop. The scene relies not on why, but on English played in reverse, which sounds Scandinavian. The entire scene does this, with English subtitles. This is funny enough at the outset, before we even get it, but it becomes exceptional at the end of the scene, when it finally gives itself away. This is a level of filmic wit so far beyond comparison the surrounding movie that it's almost a contradiction splattered in the middle of it.Nevertheless, like a Mel Brooks film, this movie will readily go for a laugh wherever one is even distantly liable to be found. It has political jokes and boob jokes, dog poop gags, and ballet jokes. It teases two utterly divergent Hollywood genres the spy thriller and the Elvis Presley musical. It concerns an expatriate who escaped America by balloon during the Carter administration, an associate of the French underground named Escargot, and Omar Sharif contained in a flattened automobile.Unlike Airplane!, which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of recognizables whose careers were secured by such films, Top Secret! is based on no directly familiar forebear. It's by and large a lampoon of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to go with a star like Elvis Presley or Frankie Avalon, something that no East-West espionage film ever remotely came close to doing. But now that I think about a lot of the shameless WWII propaganda using A-list dramatic talent, why not go all the way and put Paul Anka and Fabian on the frontlines with the dirty Japs and crouts? The foreseeably threadbare story in Top Secret! has something to do with an East German plot to bring Germany back together, ostensibly by containing the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean.

The male choruses, often sung in Welsh, are truly beautiful. The story - there is no plot - is at best episodic. The only thing that gives it any coherence is the choral music, and that is very beautiful.On the other hand, a lot of the background music is far too sentimental, and takes the movie over the edge. Had there been no music whatsoever, some of those scenes would have been far more powerful. The music, frankly, trivializes them.The thing that most struck me with this movie, however, were the differences from Germinal, Zola's novel about miners not far from Wales, in northeastern France. Zola could find no nobility in their suffering; he depicted them over and over as bestial animals. This movie gives their suffering a nobility that no amount of sentimental music can lessen.Men and women such as these are not perfect. Who among us is? But their suffering deserves respectful treatment. Zola did not believe that; John Ford, the director of this movie, did. The difference is telling, and it is what makes this such a moving movie.Postscript written after having read the novelI read the novel after writing the above review and then watched the movie again. Frankly, I don't recommend that to anyone. The novel is long, 500 pages, and the movie, of necessity, condenses some of it and simply omits other parts. After you have read the novel, you see just how hastily some things are condensed and what is left out or, in some few instances, changed. I would not say it is a particularly good condensation.The most striking change is the end. In the movie there is another mine cave-in and a party of miners, led by the preacher, finds the elder Morgan, who dies in the still very young Huw's arms. It is, of course, moving, but since the movie closes on the images from his past that Huw subsequently recollects we are left, at the end, not with the dying father but with Maureen O'Hara smiling and waiving at a smiling Walter Pidgeon. A romantic end.The novel's end is far more somber. During a particularly bitter strike Huw's father goes down in the mines to see if they are starting to flood. Cyfartha is also down there working. Both men get caught in a cave-in. Dai Bando, almost blind, goes down with Huw to find them. (The preacher has by then left for South America and is no longer in the picture, so to speak.) After much digging they first find Cyfartha, whom Dai Bando, weeping, carries to the surface. (We are left to wonder if the very deep bond between these two men had been more than just a deep friendship, but the text never says more.) Then Huw finds his father, and holds him until he, too, dies. It is a very painful scene.Other than that, the chronology is sometimes changed from the novel to the movie, prompted in part, perhaps, by the fact that since Huw is always played by the young Roddy McDowall, he never grows into the very adult man that Huw becomes in the novel. The two brothers who leave for America do so much earlier in the movie than in the novel, for example.Huw's one sexual encounter, with Ceinwein up on the mountain, never takes place in the movie, perhaps because Roddy McDowall doesn't look old enough for sex, perhaps just for the morals code of the time. In the same sense, Huw's subsequent unrealized desires for Bron are never introduced.The preacher never leaves for South America, probably because he is played by the lead actor. It is also hard to understand why the town condemns him and Angharad, as in the movie he does not visit her every evening at her home. More morals code, no doubt.The disputes between the minors and the owners are played down in the movie, perhaps because, during the war, unions were expected not to strike for the war effort. Llewellyn's efforts to convey the Welsh his characters are speaking by using a similar syntax in English are almost completely erased in the movie. Indeed, the very fact that these characters are usually speaking Welsh and not English is largely ignored. It's a very important part of the novel and the world that Llewellyn described, which saw itself very much put upon by outsiders=Englishmen, so it is a shame all that is lost. Some of the Celtic folklore is also lost. Beth's claim that Ivor came to speak to her, very much a part of the Celtic belief in visitations from spirits of the dead (présignes, in French) is completely changed in the movie.A movie should be not judged on how well it adapts the material from which it derives, unless it is some sort of documentary. Taken as is, this is a good movie. But once you have read the novel, you see that its story is more somber, and it is hard not to regret that some of that was lost in the conversion.

It's a very important part of the novel and the world that Llewellyn described, which saw itself very much put upon by outsiders=Englishmen, so it is a shame all that is lost. Some of the Celtic folklore is also lost. Beth's claim that Ivor came to speak to her, very much a part of the Celtic belief in visitations from spirits of the dead (présignes, in French) is completely changed in the movie.A movie should be not judged on how well it adapts the material from which it derives, unless it is some sort of documentary. Taken as is, this is a good movie. But once you have read the novel, you see that its story is more somber, and it is hard not to regret that some of that was lost in the conversion.

The film stars the biggest star of Hollywood, Marilyn Monroe with the talented Joseph Cotten - co-starring Jean Peters who starred in another film-noir at the same year, Pickup on South Street by Samuel Fuller. Niagara is a very interesting film, for many reasons; it might just be Marilyn's greatest performance and the most different one. It's also quite odd to see a film-noir by a 'western' director and Niagara might just be, if not the first, one of the first film-noirs in color.Film-noir is one of the most controversial issues in the history of cinema. Some state it's a genre of its own, for some it's a sub genre, a movement or just a word to describe a certain era (40's) or style of cinematography and narrative. The very first film-noir was made in 1940 Stranger of the 3rd Floor by Boris Ingster starring Peter Lorre. Film-noir was a very short-term era of cinema, it's usually considered to have lasted one decade the 40's. But obviously they still kept making them in the early 50's; Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. (1950), Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street (1953), Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951) and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958). Niagara most certainly is not a genre-film, it's not pure film-noir and that's why I'd like to categorize it as post-noir. But it does too have some of the common features of noir; femme fatale, moral complexity, stripes of shadows and exotic milieus.Film-noirs were usually in black-and-white, only a few people dared to shoot them in color. The expressionistic cinematography brilliantly achieved the cynicism and dark atmosphere. But I think that Niagara quite well succeed in the expressionistic style - the murder scene is the greatest example. Expressionism in cinema is usually considered to be black-and-white, but it can just as easily be in color - as Roger Corman has proved in The Masque of Red Death (1964).The plot of Niagara is very easy and typical for its genre. A crooked woman is planning to get rid of her husband in hope of a better man. When she becomes acquainted with a recently married couple, things start getting mixed up. The role of the femme fatale was a very untypical one for Marilyn. Today she is most well known for her silly, cute, naive blonde roles (Some Like It Hot, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire etc.) but in Niagara she plays this immoral, scheming, evil woman - the typical film-noir femme fatale! I thought Niagara was a very good film. It's a post-noir, romantic adventure thriller. It doesn't have much depth in it, but it works very well as an entertaining film. For all of us interested into the history of cinema Niagara is of course also a treat. It's a landmark in Marilyn Monroe's career, an interesting choice for Hathaway and a different kind of post-noir. The landscapes of Niagara are breathtaking and the scenes shot near the falls are gorgeous - it adds a documentary-like emotion to the film.

Said by well all horror fans to be the most blood filled film ever, period (can't say for sure, haven't seen Tokyo Gore Police yet), it was made in the 90s and was directed by Peter Jackson, that's right, the guy that made The Lord Of the Rings.Do to how blood filled this movie is, it was going to become a cult classic no matter what, weather it was good or bad. Lucky for me it was good, actually one of the most enjoyable horror films I've seen in years and in many ways comparable to the Evil Dead films, which is one of the best horror series there is.Anyways, the plot is Lionel is shy, nervous, and a tad dumb. His mom is over powering and given the amount of work she has him do, he doesn't have a life of his own. Do to him being, well, a push over, he doesn't have the guts to stand up to his mom or set his life straight. When his mom is bit by a rat monkey(ya, I'm not making that up) she becomes a zombie. Lionel though, being one to always ignore his problems, simply tries to ignore the fact that she is a zombie and tries to have a normal life. Things get more and more out of control though as zombie mom starts turning other towns' people into zombies and before Lionel knows it, he's got a basement full of the undead.This is what's called a splatter comedy. Pretty much they have a tone of blood and slap stick comedy and the idea is the film is supposed to be so over the top with its violence and random ball plot that you can't help but find it funny. You'll laugh at a lot of parts not cause they are funny per say, but because they are downright so odd. Like, this has a zombie baby running around, and I don't know why, but that's really funny! What's interesting about this film though is despite the tones of blood and gore, it actually still has a theme and a message to the story. Don't ignore your problems in life. If you ignore your problems they are only going to get worse until one day you wake up surrounded by flesh eating zombies! The most interesting scenes in this by far are the ones where Lionel helplessly tries to ignore the zombie issue and have a normal life. There's one scene where he has all the zombies at the dinner table and is trying to have a normal meal with them. It's just odd.Another interesting thing about the film is it tries really hard to change the zombie mythology and make zombies its own. Ever since Night of The Living Dead zombies have pretty much always been done the same way. It's not like with vampires where the film can do whatever it wants with them. Zombies have become very ridged in film. So, it's pretty uncommon to see a film play around with them as this one does.The zombies in this spread by bites, and by cutting your skin. So if one gets its nails in you, you'll still become a zombie. Also, these zombies don't die if you shoot them in the head. Each body part of theirs can live on its own. If you cut off a hand, that hand will get up and come after you. So, they are next to unstoppable.Lastly they don't kill to feed. Their attacks are emotion based. When someone first becomes a zombie in the film they will likely kill anything in site, but if you tie them down and try to calm them down, they'll actually become nice after awhile. There are a few scenes where Lionel walks around them and they just ignore him. They only really become violent again near the end.This is an interesting idea because it's not like in other zombie films where when someone you love has become a zombie they are nothing like what they used to be. In this, they are still who they used to be, they're just also dead and are very violent. This makes it a lot harder for Lionel to except that his mom is dead, and actually adds a lot to the story.Lastly, one of the coolest things about this movie is its filming style and set design. It REALLY feels like you are watching Bugs Bunny. This is as cartoon like as a film with live actors can become. The playful camera movement, the colourful set designs, and the crazy violence just makes it feel like an animated movie. If Bugs Bunny did pop up mid way in the movie, he would blend in and you wouldn't even notice the guy.As such the camera work and set design are both amazing. It is painfully funny, the hero is actually a really nice guy you can't help but love, and over all its just a really creative and fun little movie.I give it a 10 out of 10. It's a must for anyone that likes splatter comedy. If you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Evil Dead 2, you MUST see this film.

I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again.

The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions.

It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. Hello, McFly! was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too.

Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. Hello, McFly! was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!

Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.In order for this film to work the actor portraying the brilliant but troubled Nash would have to be rather brilliant himself. And Russell Crowe is definitely up to the task. He hits all the right notes, capturing the tremendous highs and terrifying lows of Nash's life. From the young man we first meet at Princeton to the old man who has accomplished and overcome so much it is an incredible journey for John Nash. And Crowe is dead-on perfect throughout. He makes you believe in John Nash and makes you understand what is going on inside his mind. What exactly is going on inside that mind? A very complicated question that but the film portrays Nash in a way that draws you in and makes you pull for him as he battles his own inner demons.Nash himself is obviously the film's most important character and thus Crowe's performance the most important and ultimately the most memorable. But this is a film in which the acting is uniformly terrific. After Crowe it is Jennifer Connelly who would be the next real standout with her portrayal of Nash's wife Alicia. Through all the ups and downs Alicia is right there with John and Connelly turns in a powerful, highly charged, emotional performance. The strength of both the actress and the character she portrays adds so much to the film. Also noteworthy is Ed Harris who gets to portray a mysterious, menacing character around whom much of the film's drama swirls. And the list of fine performances goes on and on. Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Josh Lucas...every performer plays their part so well. All the performances combine with a great, fascinating story to make this a film which captivates throughout. Not every great story makes for a great movie. This one does.

I thought the film kicked all kinds of butt, and I remember filling out the little comment card at the end of the show (What did you like about the movie? What didn't you like?) raving about the makeup and gore effects, and I probably told them that the blonde who played China was freakin' hot or words to that effect. (I have always wondered if that comment got back to her. Some geek in Jersey thought you were hot, babe.) I don't recall if Waxwork ever got a legitimate theatrical release after that test screening, but when I rented it on VHS some time later, I was dismayed to find out that much of the kick ass blood and gore shots that I'd grooved on at the free preview had been edited. I am, however, happy to report that the version of Waxwork on the double feature DVD released by Artisan Entertainment appears to be that original, uncut version that I saw many years ago. (Though both films are in fullscreen, not widescreen...SIGH! I guess you can't have everything...) End of commercial. Okay then!! Waxwork is a mostly forgotten lil' gem of '80s horror comedy. The plot is pretty simplistic in a nutshell, Zach Galligan of Gremlins fame and a bunch of his fellow spoiled, rich California friends get invited to a preview showing at a soon-to-be opened wax museum in their town, only to find when they arrive that they're destined to become part of the various sculptures. The waxworks of such famed evil doers as the Marquis De Sade, Jack the Ripper, Dracula, etc., etc. are actually portals to other dimensions, where the young cannon fodder becomes trapped as part of some sorta convoluted voodoo worshipping plot to unleash Evil on Earth and bring around the End of All Things, or something like that. So the story's ridiculous, but the various set pieces and segments featuring the Waxwork characters are like a sampler platter of some of horror's greatest moments, particularly the Werewolf segment and the scene set in a den of vampires (where blood literally paints the walls!!!). All Galligan cares about is rescuing his virginal, never-had-it-but-really-wants-to love interest from the grip of the Marquis De Sade, and by the time his godfather (Patrick MacNee of The Avengers no less!) and his merry band of British supernatural fighters arrive to save the day, you're either gonna be laughing your head off or you're going to be saying I hate this movie. I personally would've preferred it to lean harder on the horror end and less on the comedy but when Waxwork gets nasty (as in the aforementioned Werewolf and Vampire scenes), it provides a decent amount of shocks and some killer old-school creature and gore FX. First time writer\/director Anthony Hickox has become a genre veteran, having gone from Waxwork to films like the underrated Full Eclipse, Hellraiser III Hell on Earth, and Warlock The Armageddon to name just a few. Perhaps Waxwork is still a little rough around the edges but it shows that even at this early stage in his directing career, Hickox already had an eye for cool set pieces, interesting staging, and of course plenty of bloody action. Waxwork is an entertaining little time capsule that should bring a smile to the face of any '80s horror fan. They really don't make'em like this anymore.

Firstly the slight matters  The Beauty School Drop-Out number was so unrelated to the main story. (Stockard Channing) was 34 year old, so how BY ANY MEAN she was casted as a teen girl in a high school ?! The comic situations were uncomic. And the end, oh the end, it can't be weaker where everything gets solved so damn easily (it's like the writer had no time to write !).Now, the important matters. It's another love story between 2 teenagers. OK. He tries to satisfy her by imitating who she pretends that she cares about (a footballer for instance). And she doesn't find a solution to get close to him but turning her character from well-dressed well-mannered girl into an experienced vamp. So both of them allege something else their nature ?!Is it a study of the teen love, or adolescence itself; as a phase of instability where the character doesn't ride at specific anchor unless after many alterations first? Or is it America which was having a phase of adolescence at the time, the 1950s, amongst the changes of post- ww2, and before other changes that would make it more serious and rough? To grasp things rightly; watch carefully the success of the love story here then its total breakdown at the start of the sequel (Grease 2 &#x96; 1982) when (Sandy) leaves (Zuko) for that bright diligent kid (who, also, would undergo a phase where he alleges a personality else his to attract the girl he likes!). Hence, don't get excited dear viewer with the flashy and dreamy happy ending in (Grease &#x96; 1978) because it's mainly a movie about changes, the age of changes and the time of changes as well, and it's, as a movie, so glad and proud of what it talks about.The thing is it comes with (Animal House), produced in the same year, to triumph for the lazy kids, who study nothing. And, on the other hand, glorify giving up your own self to be the formed type, agreeing with the known figure, even if you're not content with it, just to be a la mode ! So, accordingly, (Grease) could be the most colorful and loud anti-individualism movie ever made! And that's why I don't feel comfortable with it, specifically while the 2 leads at the end surrendering to satisfy the people, instead of facing all of these people with their true nature. It's where the movie itself surrenders to this adolescent thinking to the extent of asking yourself, after the end of part 2, does the heroine love that bright kid indeed? Or she'll going to leave him for any other later?! (You can ask the same question about him too!).

All characters here, with few exceptions--air controllers, technicians--are failures, have no life and are dumb too. The real hero here is Barry; his is the only story worth telling. The only smart character also. From the beginning, all he wants is to get away from that bore and loner he got as a mom and he finally gets some attention, this time from ET. What the heck, you take whatever you can. So he gladly elopes. But at the end ET returns him and you can see the disappointment in his eyes so, they are no better than us. Left to choose between losers he already knows and new ones...But, boy, he isn't a happy camper. That's the story. Because these aliens are as dumb as humans they got all those war pilots for 23 years and what did they do? Nothing! No wonder Barry is resigned to return. And what ET brings to mankind? Nothing! Only a cheap lights show and an annoying keyboard--tuba rendition of Dueling Banjos. As one reviewer put it well, you can get that and better at a Pink Floyd concert (BTW, I didn't know ETs. were tuba enthusiasts).I said losers. There are two kinds of folks here, ordinary and big shots. Roy is both ordinary and a loser. He got a hell of a family life and a miserable job, which forces him to be ready 24\/7 and from which he's fired for no reason. He has no friends; neither his kids--that slap in the butt routine was just tacked in--and his proverbial next door neighbor is an older lady with much time in her hands. And when Ronnie leaves, all his neighbours just stand there, showing no reaction at all, no sympathy. I have seen more warmth in a mob of hungry zombies. So, would you blame the guy for wanting to go away? Problem is, he's stupid--remember how well his Lacombe interview went--and the fact that aliens would want anything to do with him prove their own stupidity. Why any self-respecting alien would want this bush-throwing wacko aboard? If I was one, I wouldn't want him anywhere near my UFO! His stupidity is further proved when he doesn't even bother to ask any of the returned humans how their trip was, what to expect of it etc. Instead, all what's needed is a bunch of ET pygmies to mob him and carry him inside the ship in a Christ-like body position--in one of the worst, most embarrassing, bits in movie History--to make him happy. And to see poor Truffault there, watching the weird scene with that dumb, cherubic expression in his face-what he's doing there, anyway? How did they get him aboard this clunker? Did they have pictures; was his bank about to foreclose his home? Now, concerning Ronnie--what flavor?--no proof is needed. Ditto for (Halloween for grown-ups) Jillian. No job, no friends, no life. Any mom with half a brain would have immediately rushed her boy to the nearest ER, checking him all over, on the way, for any missing parts; but what she does? She stops paying attention to him two second after retrieval and embarks then in her favorite Japanese tourist impersonation! But big shots are no better than small fry here. See, they are all looking up, waiting for some savior from outer space. There is Lacombe, a guy who has spent his entire life trying to make believers out of everyone and all what he gets at the end is a impromptus pop concert. There is Mayor Walsh and his subordinates, who are still licking the wounds of a lost war and who see a good occasion to get even, kind of, pushing people around and scaring them with them choppers. There's also the usual mixed bag of miscasts--bums, migrants, a proverbial elderly couple&#x97;and a crowd of scientists, UFO researchers, who don't have anything better to do than to chase sky lights (BTW, I believe in ETs too, but not in wasting my life chasing after them). But most, we got there those who better embody the pathos of the situation--the U.S. astronauts.

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford Mad Dog Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive. This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy. The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements. This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message. My rating *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.

This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy. The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements. This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message. My rating *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford Mad Dog Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive.

When I finally got around to seeing Once Upon A Time In The West I figured I would love it, that it would become an instant favorite, but I was sadly disappointed. This is a movie with all of the right ingredients that tries to do much, and takes way too long to do it.Clearly, Sergio Leone was ready to graduate from his spaghetti westerns and tackle more complex stories, with richer characters and deeper emotions. The problem is his greatest strength as a director is his eye, his sense for visuals and panorama, the masterful filling of the frame and his use of editing to convey story and character. He forgets that here and what we're left with is a soggy melodrama stretched to its limits in order to fill Leone's massive canvas. And it becomes pretty clear after three hours that there was not enough story or character to warrant the movie's epic size.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was driven by action amoral characters in a violent world who faced death and betrayal at every turn and used a gun as their primary form of communication. Once Upon A Time focuses on a mail-order bride, who spends most of the movie staring silently while men play the harmonica and order coffee. The story unfurls itself so slowly- and so confusingly- that by the time you grasp it's themes of revenge and industrial progress you might simply not care. Charles Bronson- who was born to star in a Leone picture- is wasted here as a man so patient and controlled that his eventual outbursts of violence are anti-climactic. Jason Robards is so sleepy and sluggish that I found it ironic- and sad- that his character's main identifying feature was that he was a lover of coffee. Completely wasted are Jack Elam and Woody Strode who- after being beautifully introduced in the movie's brilliant opening sequence- are dropped from the film entirely. And Henry Fonda, dirty-faced and unshaven, gives the best performance of his career as the black-hearted gunman Frank- until he opens his mouth and his earnest mid-western warble ruins the illusion.Had the movie begun with the railroad storyline and proceeded to follow the adventures of the men who would do anything to acquire and protect the lucrative plot of land we might have had a better film. Like The Good & The Bad there would have been heroes and villains, each with their own sense of morality (or lack thereof), and assorted motives for their extreme actions. Since this plot point is concealed until late in the film, the characters and their deeds lack clear motivation. And there's just no excuse for the languid pacing here, in which full minutes tick by without any action or story beats.Now, with all this said, the film is still beautifully shot and photographed, with every frame gracefully composed and full of detail. The opening sequence is spectacular, with the buzzing of the fly and the dripping of the water adding unbelievable tension to the simple act of men waiting for a train, and Harmonica on the roof of the train taking out gunman from above is also fantastic. Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous and magnetic as Jill, and the Ennio Morricone score is at times both menacing and sweet.Still, three hours is too long to tell a story that's much less complicated than the movie would have you believe. I applaud Leone taking on a movie with more complex themes, but that's no excuse for abandoning the simplicity and impact of the gunfight or the power of a man with no name who is defined not by what he thinks or the emotions that he feels but by what he Does, and how he does it. These are the characters that Leone understands, and the types of films he should make. I guess he didn't realize that he didn't have to make this grab towards artistic respectability&#x85; he had already proved himself a brilliant and timeless filmmaker.GRADE C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2010","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I LOVE Sergio Leone.

That he adds a handful of filmic jaunts, however, doesn't do much good or add any punch. The movie opens on a montage about peculiar and random Brooklyn, and fosters the chuckle along with a riot scene at Ebbets Field, a scene which has no perceptible basis for being in the movie at all. From there it switches to a high-octane schmaltz sequence in the marriage license bureau, where above all things, people are getting marriage licenses, Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane among them. Then there's another sequence of elaborate chasing and necking in a Brooklyn cemetery, and, at last, guess what, the story of Arsenic and Old Lace. All the same, in the long run, these filmic additions give impact to the farce with Aunts Abby and Martha in the house, because beginning so schmaltzy and mawkish makes such ink-black humor so much more unexpected.This unconventional patchwork is distinct from most of the other reform-minded Capra-corn films with social principles that became his brand, like It's a Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe, or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's more similar in tone to his screwball romantic comedy It Happened One Night and to Capra's other adaptation from a Broadway play You Can't Take It With You. Playing theatre critic Mortimer Brewster---frankly it doesn't matter, it's fine just viewing him for his star power the whole time---Cary Grant accomplishes a stunning mission of overstated acting with remarkable double-takes, slapstick and overall bewilderment. What makes his performance so effective is that in essence he plays the straight man in a house crammed with eccentrics, yet it is his relentless mugging and other facial agility that make you laugh. Naturally it's all exaggerated from top to bottom, but that's what the role demands and he succeeds in peddling the motor for all the farce happening around him.Not that Grant is the lone one to get laughs in this combination of slapstick and fast-paced jousting. Played impeccably by veteran stage actress Josephine Hull and Canadian vaudevillian Jean Adair, the doting aunts' account of how they routinely murder gentleman visitors is really my favorite part, by far. After telling Grant how they add Arsenic, Strychnine, and just a pinch of Cyanide to Elderberry wine because it makes tea taste bitter, they smugly add that one of the gentlemen even found time to say how nice it tasted before he died. John Alexander is hilarious in his unquestionably most memorable performance as Grant's brother Teddy, who believes he's Teddy Roosevelt to the extent that his behavior, dress and perception of his surroundings all correspond with defining aspects of the vividly inimitable American president. Another of my favorite elements is how old Abby and Martha delight in using Teddy's belief that he's digging the Panama Canal to bury their shocking amount of dead bodies in the basement.Ahead of its time? OK, but it is also markedly of its time, and has stood the test of time to stay as witty today as anything Hollywood is producing now. Our reactions to inconsistencies, oddities, unanticipated discrepancies with normalcy and established ranks will differ in terms of particular circumstances. The established rule we hear vintage comedians talk about is that if the incongruity works in a context where it's foreboding, it'll dispose us toward a fearful response, but if the framework is one that's marked as non-threatening, where the prospect of harm and dread has been denied, the circumstances are apt for humor. I've rarely found this notion better substantiated than in the characters of Aunt Martha and Aunt Abby, whose descriptions of their serial murders are so sweet and innocent that they couldn't be less congruous.
