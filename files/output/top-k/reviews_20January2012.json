The posters and the advertising impressed me, and it promised to be a rather thrilling movie. Unfortunately it turns out to be much less so. The effects and the action sequences are literally what one would expect in an Arnie movie. Like Terminator II he is going up against something which simply cannot die, so in the end of the movie the heavy weaponry comes out. Unlike Terminator II, the movie is not constantly on the go and you become somewhat agitated as you have to put up with a rather contrived plot in between the action sequences.The movie is about the end of the world and how Swartzenegger stops it. The precept is that a girl is born who will give birth to the child that will destroy the world. Every thousand years, Satan is released to mate with the girl, and if he succeeds then the world will end. So humanity is responsible for stopping him and giving them another 1000 years to develop until he comes again. Of course this is all stupid, and the way they explain it, such as 666 being upside-down (especially since the Greeks did not use Arabic numbers like we did, and that is what John, the author of revelation, wrote in), was just plain stupid. It would have been just as good if they had left that out.The plot is the typical good verses bad idea. The good guys are the church while the bad guys are the satanists. I liked the whole secret society aspect to the film where there are disparate factions in the church with all of their own goals while the satanists are one huge underground faction bent on following their master's will. Satan is the big bad guy, and I feel that Gabrial Byrne plays him exceptionally well. What is impressive is that Satan is played as his manipulative, deceitful and betraying self. He is actually shown as not the cool person to follow, and that the promises that he makes are inevitably destructive.God, on the otherhand, is misportrayed. He is described as a distant figure who lets humanity fight its own battles. It is the Catholic Church (rife with its traditions and such) that is portrayed as the proper church, not the evangelical, bible believing church. In fact the claim that the end of the world can be predicted is unbiblical as we are told that we will not know the hour or the day. Still, the movie redeems itself slightly at the end when Arnie puts his trust in God by asking him to give him strength, and then goes on to defeat Satan. I guess in the end, Satan is a powerful being not to be trifled with, but God is supremely more powerful.

The End of Violence is a very good movie which has quite a lot within its frame work. It is somewhat slow and when watching it for the first time it seems that there are scenes in the movie that could have been left out, they did not seem to add to the overall plot of the movie, and that tends to put me off. These scenes though, namely the poetry reading scenes, do indeed add to the plot in a very subtle way and are very important in the development of the characters, two of whom are minor characters in the movie. Even then, the poetry that is read out depicts the major theme of the movie, and that is the enemy that is within, not the enemy without, and the realisation of the characters that the enemy is not out there, but in amongst us.When watching the movie we must constantly remember the title because that helps us understand what the movie is about. It works in two levels though, in a social level and in a psychological level. The social level of the movie is about a new security system which can monitor all the city of Los Angeles. A man can sit in one room and see almost anywhere in Los Angeles. He watches crimes happen and he watches criminals get caught. The problem with this is that congress does not know about the system and if they found out about it then big problems would happen. They must keep it secret at all costs it will end violence but at the cost of people's privacy. This seems to reflect Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four where big brother knows everything.The psychological aspect of the movie deals with a film producer name Micheal Max. Everybody knows and loves this guy, but he is not loved by all as he is abducted by a couple of hit men and was about to be executed. Micheal Max has an obsession with violence, he says that when he was a kid he was scared of the movies and then he became a film producer. This suggests that he desires to master violence by controlling it in the forms of movies. Though he tries to master violence, he cannot master his life. His relationship with his wife is falling apart as he just does not spend anytime with her. She begins by just wanting to leave and ends by taking everything.The plot of the movie comes out when he receives an email from somebody containing confidential FBI information. Then he is abducted and one assumes that it is because of the FBI document. This is someway true, but the killers are nothing more than idiots. The film does not reveal who attempted to kill him, or why, but this document remains somewhat important, though we are never told what it is. This movie never really wants us to be sure. It lets us make up our minds about things but does not tell us if we are wrong or not. What we are really doing is watching Micheal Max come to understand and conquer his fear of violence.There are three main male characters, Doc, a forensic scientist who is investigating Mike Max's disappearance, Mike Max, and Ray, the operator of the surveillance system. The characters have little contact in the movie but are connected. There are three women that are directly connected with each of these characters, and two of these women interact with one of the other males characters. Max's wife, the first one, speaks with Doc, but her role is that she drifts further away from Max. The actress is loved by Mike as a friend, but her role is that she builds a relationship with Doc. Then there is Sue, the Mexican cleaner, who works under Ray. They fall in love, but at the end of the movie she exits with Mike Max, after both have given up violence. The casting of the three male characters was done in a way that they all were similar in appearance. These characters were linked in this way and also in a way that they were trying to bring an end to violence. Mike Max has been discussed, Ray is trying to bring an end through the surveillance system, while Doc is a police officer trying to uncover the truth. It is interesting that the police are not interested in the truth, they have their theory and are not at all interested in the truth.There is a lot more in this movie, but to bring it up would mean watching it again and studying it closer. This movie is very good for those who like movies which make you think. The ending isn't conclusive and you don't realise it is there until you get there. It comes as a bit of a shock because there seems to be a lot of things unresolved, but when you look back over the movie you realise that they have been resolved, but not in the way you expect it to be. The movie tells you numerous times that it is not a typical Hollywood ending, such as Mike Max's comment, I hate those conspiracy movies where the beautiful woman gets killed. This is not a typical Hollywood movie and thus does not have a satisfying ending for those who want one.

Sly plays Frank Leone, a man who's been locked up for a while due to aggravated assault (although, once one hears the details later, they'll realize he got a raw deal). He's due to be released in a few months, but an old nemesis, Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland), is still mighty peeved that Frank was actually able to escape his clutches once, so he has Frank transferred to his own hellhole of a prison. And he does everything humanly possible to make Frank's stay a rough, ROUGH one. Lock Up certainly does have its good ingredients a score by Bill Conti who'd composed that iconic Rocky music, an incredible look to it - the prison used was the East Jersey State Prison in Rahway, New Jersey (and actual inmates are used as extras), and the director was the accomplished John Flynn, a man who'd specialized in action fare and whose resume also included Out for Justice, Best Seller, Defiance, and Rolling Thunder. Importantly, Sly's Frank is a guy you do want to root for, and the villains, while never exactly subtle, do serve their purpose by all being quite vile, especially the creep who's been hired to rape Frank's loyal girlfriend Melissa (Darlanne Fluegel). The actors are fun to watch, especially Sutherland as the domineering, crazed warden (Drumgoole is such an amusing name). It's also cool to see the young Tom Sizemore already strutting his stuff quite effectively in a very early role as Dallas. John Amos is great as the prison guard who may be a tough guy but unlike Sutherland is not exactly unreasonable. Fluegel is lovely (of course), but she really has little to do. Also appearing are the engaging Frank McRae, William Allen Young, an utterly spooky Sonny Landham, Jordan Lund, David Anthony Marshall, Tony Munafo, and Frank Pesce. You'll also notice a bit by Danny Trejo in one of HIS earlier screen appearances. Some viewers may experience a lack of true satisfaction with the ending, but for the most part Lock Up is good entertainment that does its job well. Never mind the bottom of the world dismissal in the annual paperback guide to movies by Leonard Maltin and company; if this viewer can say one thing, it is most assuredly NOT as bad as all that.

In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us. One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style &#x96; he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's square is literally drawn on the screen.

This is quite a effort as this film is much cheaper than Clerks and in a way is far superior. This film also launched David Lynch's career and he went on to make The Elephant Man, Dune, and Twin Peaks.The movie is very bleak and the synopsis is very strange. Des Managan did not bother to describe it, while a cult movie book wrote only a single line talking about its bleakness. It is not that the movie is not worth talking about though, rather the incredible intricacies of this movie leave it to the viewer to make his or her own interpretation. Des Mangan speaks of pointy headed intellectuals who try to push across a view point and says that he chooses not to go into a deep analysis as everybody is to make of this movie what they can. I will give a brief description of what I got from the movie, though I will touch upon aspects of another interpretation. I have included a link to a more detailed interpretation. I will simply look at what I see as the various themes in the movie One of the major themes in this movie seems to deal with relationship. Relationships form a major foundation of a lot of movies, and existentialist movies, such as this, show how fragile, or even impossible, they are. The main character, Henry, is alone in the movie. The impression you get from the first scene where he enters his flat is that he has no friends, and no true relationship. He is forced into a relationship through a pregnancy but this marriage is cold and emotionless, quite quickly it collapses with the wife walking out. It is not the attitude of Henry that destroys the marriage, but rather the baby that was spawned from the pregnancy. The baby plays a very major part of the movie; in fact it is the object upon which the whole movie revolves.To me, the spawn that is the baby symbolises the lose morality that destroys relationships. Though Henry at first does not admit it, we assume that he had sex with Mary and it is from this that the baby came. This seems to be a reaction against the loose morals from the sixties. The baby is thus a result of the destruction of the sanctity marriage. It is a baby born out of wedlock and thus is a freak, as such people are considered &#x96; the term bastard comes to mind. The baby itself is not evil, but it does drive Mary and Henry apart. Mary cannot take any more of it so she leaves, thus thrusting the responsibility upon Henry.This is another reaction against what the lose morals has created. Unwanted pregnancies burden people with unwanted babies, but generally only one person lands up with the baby, and that is usually the woman. Here the woman walks out leaving Henry with the baby, a corruption of what this world brings. Henry is the passive partner here where as Mary is the active. The roles of men and women are changing bringing a shift in the social order, and this is another idea that comes through. In this movie, the shift is complete, whereas in the 70's, when the movie was made, the shift was only beginning.Time has no meaning within this movie. Linear time does not exist and all the important events, such as the marriage, are squeezed out. In this movie, marriage no longer has any meaning, as such the wedding is ignored. The vowels mean nothing because Mary easily breaks them. The movie itself is not linear as we travel to a point where the marriage collapses, but after the marriage is still together. Further into the movie, Henry dies, only later to be alive. As such, linear time is not an important point in the movie and we are not to see it as such, rather the movie flows along a line of events. The importance of each of the events are put in order and thus the collapse of the marriage takes an earlier important, where a scene that occurs within the marriage takes its importance later. Thus the movie is like a retrospect, Henry looks back over his life and pulls the events into this order.The movie is also about the balance, one that can easily be over turned. A simple act of sex destroys the life of Henry. While Henry removes the baby's bandages at the end to discover that he has destroyed the delicate balance that held the baby together. Inside the baby is a living chicken, the same chicken seen during the dinner party at Mary's house. There the chicken was touched and it began spewing endless streams of blood; a similar thing happens with the baby at the end.Thus the idea of deceptions, and things not being what they seem, appears. The chicken appears dead, but is alive. The girl singer appears to be a girl, but really is a hideous man. She sings of heaven, a place you go at death, being a fine place, but the tone is dry and bleak, as if she does not really believe what she sings. Death does not bring happiness to Henry, instead he becomes an eraser. The meaning of life is nothing, but at least he makes a good eraser.

This movie isn't (much of the time anyway) unpleasant; it's just not pleasant. I didn't for the most part find it enjoyable to watch. It has a few scenes in it which are somewhat humorous, but overall I found this a heavy kind of movie. Yes, it's hopeful - in a way. It brings lonely, sad and even depressed people together and lets them build a sort of family connection with one another so that by the end there's a sort of heartwarming scene of a very diverse and eclectic group of people gathering to celebrate Christmas with an extended-family feel, but that quasi-hopeful ending struck me as empty to be honest. There was no sense that any of this was going to last; no sense of permanence. These folks for this point in time were together. Yeah - there's something to be said for that, but for me at least it didn't overcome the overall sombre feel to this comedy.Hugh Grant has never really overwhelmed me. I've never quite understood the appeal he has for many people. His movies are usually pleasant in an understated, silly sort of way, and generally he plays variations on the same character - either the lost, lovelorn single guy or the guy who wants to avoid any serious commitments. He's the same here; although less likable than many of his characters lazy, shallow, manipulative. Here his character of Will latches on the the idea of pretending to be a single father so that he can meet single mothers. In the course of the deception, he connects with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) - a sad, lonely, bullied 12 year old boy with a suicidal mother (Fiona, played by Toni Collette.) In fact, what really causes the bond in the relationship between Will and Marcus is when they discover Fiona after her suicide attempt. Marcus bonds afterward with the at first less than enthusiastic Will, and the two of them have to sort their way through life and their own relationship - all the while trying to build new relationships with those around them.I have to confess that this just didn't capture me. Yes, there were a few funny scenes, but I never really got the sense of what this was trying to accomplish, and after Fiona's suicide attempt I was puzzled.

There is not much of gore but the little there is, is very...impressive.I was delighted to see how dynamically he got the entire point of the story and every crucial element into the first five minutes of the film. All of it happening during a sunny day in a relatively happy atmosphere, sets a fine mood to the movie; we get the feeling that this idyllic happy family is going to go through hell in an unusual way. And because it and the scene, crucially involves an innocent little baby, most people get emotionally drawn in immediately.Although it made it impossible to portray Wendigo even nearly the way it is in the novel while possessing the bodies, I was glad that they cast a 2-year old child as Gage. Because it is highly important for emotional effect that the child was a baby. And I consider that more important for a movie than having a full-blown Wendigo portrayed, even for horror. The only thing that bothers me is that Gage looks like he died quickly of some inner cause instead of an ugly death by a high-speeding truck. There is no way anyone could repair a toddler's body that perfectly after such a death. To have it come off even semi-believable, they should not have shown the full grown man so horribly mangled by a truck and thus create an illogical contrast.But, because showing Victor Pascow is crucial to the story and there is no way you could stuff the needed make-up on a toddler without torturing him and making it impossible for him to have patience to play nice, the beautiful baby body is excusable and doesn't distract too much. And what Wendigo-Gage did to the old guy was disturbing enough anyway, perhaps even more so with the angelic baby looks than it would've been if he'd looked like the zombie he was.The creepiest movie character ever; Zelda. In the novel she's actually a 10-year old child but here they had her be a full-grown woman although portrayed by a man...Anyway, I hated the Zelda-bits even in the novel, so I really did not enjoy them in a visual form in a movie. She's just TOO creepy in all fate, looks and the insane mentality and the things she says. Be warned; she is VERY disturbing and scary in this movie. Not as much in the novel.The story's point of how far a human being may go in his\/her deepest and most immense grief, and how much horror a human mind can take before it goes insane...and most importantly the lesson of how sometimes dead is better...are the reasons why this story is worth knowing to anyone who can stand horror at all. Because I don't think there is any better way to make those matters clear, than this story's way is. It all just hits home perfectly well and memorably. Those basic points and the lesson this story tries to teach, are the reason why this is worth watching over and over again and isn't as disturbing and sick as this otherwise might be. Of course also the great actors add to the worthiness of watching. Especially Gage's, Louis' and Pascow's actors are spot-on. But Ellie's is rather awful...but bearable.The basic points and the lesson are brought up relatively well in this movie adaptation, but I think could've been done better if they'd dug more into the minds of the characters, at least by voice-over narrating or something.I'm not gonna spoil the ending but just want to say that the ending is hands down the most important part of a story because if the ending is utterly changed, the very essence of the story utterly changes, and therefore if you're not going to respect the ending of an author's story, there is no point in adapting the story into a movie at all. In most adaptations of King's novels, they change the ending. But not this time! This script was written by King himself. Thus, not only is this movie respectfully novel-faithful all in all but indeed the ending is what it should be; just like it is in the novel apart from one addition. But since it was by the same author, it doesn't count as a change of that kind. (And minus Gage's character who is much tamer in this movie than in the novel, but it's excusable because you can ask only so much of an actor who's at toddler age.) Sooo, this movie including the ending ought to be delightful for the fans of the novel and should creep the ever-loving crap out of also those who don't know the novel.Denise Crosby, (Rachel Creed's actress), has an interesting idea about the ending, which she revealed in the 20th Anniversary Reunion. After you hear that, you might enjoy this movie even more because it changes the way you look at its horror aspect, into a quite fascinating point of view. (Her idea is only her personal interpretation, NOT necessarily Stephen King's vision.)Hence the intense and in some sense disturbing horror aspect of this brilliant and deep story, you'll be happier if you don't watch this or even read the novel.

Politics is the control of the economy. History, when accurately and fully recorded, is that story. In most textbooks and classrooms, not only are these three fields of study separated, but they are further compartmentalised into separate subfields, obscuring the close interconnections between them. - J.W. Smith Most films supposedly about racism are covertly racist or promote racial stereotypes (Monster's Ball, Color Purple, Sayonara, The Blind Side, Sidney Poitier vehicles etc etc). Alan Parker's Missisippi Burning is no different (Parker directed the equally dubious Midnight Express a decade earlier).Loosely based on the real life murders of civil rights workers in Mississippi, the film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as a pair of FBI agents who journey to Jessup County. Here they interrogate, investigate and trade blows with the local townsfolk, most of whom are KKK members, racist, or believe in a form of white exceptionalism typical of 1960s America. The film takes place in 1964, a year before steps were taken to dismantle America's Jim Crow Laws, which promoted racial segregation and white supremacy.Like most of these films, black characters are marginalised, a white character is our entryway into the tale, the black experience is ignored and white racism is caricatured or treated as a personal belief rather than a systemic\/structural phenomenon. This being Hollywood, racism is also understood entirely as an issue of race rather than class (racism is a key mechanism for the stabilisation of capitalism and the legitimisation of inequality). Indeed, as the economic forces which cause such things continue to exist today, contemporary society is every bit as racist as it was in the 1960s. Minorities face tougher court sentences, are overwhelmingly sent to wars, there are more black men in prison than were used as slaves at the height of chattel slavery, and minorities dominate homeless\/poverty\/mental-ill-health\/incarceration statistics. And as the core of the system stabilises, new forms of racism are pushed outward, other country's and cultures demonized to foster further accumulation. Ironically, the end result of this is an increased persecution of whites and the middle classes capitalism has to come for them next. Racism is itself more than an ideology, a belief system or a negative attitude towards others arising out of prejudice. If that alone were the case then racism would be reduced to something which takes place inside human heads. But such an understanding ignores a chief factor behind racism (as well as sexism) Power and the capacity to act. Or as the old civil rights mantra went, racism equals prejudice plus power.In our era, though, the most important factor in reinvigorating a whole new round of global racism is the resurgence of a certain brand of Reaganite conservatism (or neoliberalism), whose hallmark was the reinstatement of laissez-faire economic policies and rhetoric. Subject to such unchecked capitalism, the poor got poorer, the middle class was destroyed, debts exponentially increased, and the great big national Ponzi scheme was forced to go abroad, often violently with wars, Uncle Sam's Mickey Mouse Club desperately sucking up new members for life support. But beyond this, the Reaganite doctrine of inequality gave the official seal of approval to ideas of racial superiority that right-wing extremists had used for years to rationalise the exploitation of minorities. If the economic gap between whites and non-whites was growing, if most non-whites live below the poverty line - well, that just proved that there was a racial component in the free-market's Social-Darwinian selection process; minorities deserved their poverty because they were less fit and winners deserved their gains because of personal merit, hard work and intelligence.

Indeed, in the period depicted in the film, the FBI would routinely sit back and watch while local mobs or police patrols beat down on gays and blacks, just as after the Civil War blacks were left at the mercy of Southern power\/plantation owners by Northern politicians who made deals with the South. Unsurprisingly, one of the first acts of the FBI, which was actually tentatively set up by the grand nephew of Napoleon in 1908, was to prosecute Jack Johnson, a black man, for a now banned law that was both sexist and racist. Parker is so steadfast in his attempts to white-wash this history that he creates a black FBI agent. But there were NO black persons in the FBI in 1964, unless they were doing janitorial or chauffeur work. No surprise then that the film omits one large fact the FBI and Federal Government were warned in advance that killings in Mississippi would happen, and activists and law experts explained to the federal government weeks in advance that it was their constitutional obligation to send protection down to Mississippi prior to and during several planned civil rights protests.

Here they interrogate, investigate and trade blows with the local townsfolk, most of whom are KKK members, racist, or believe in a form of white exceptionalism typical of 1960s America. The film takes place in 1964, a year before steps were taken to dismantle America's Jim Crow Laws, which promoted racial segregation and white supremacy.Like most of these films, black characters are marginalised, a white character is our entryway into the tale, the black experience is ignored and white racism is caricatured or treated as a personal belief rather than a systemic\/structural phenomenon. This being Hollywood, racism is also understood entirely as an issue of race rather than class (racism is a key mechanism for the stabilisation of capitalism and the legitimisation of inequality). Indeed, as the economic forces which cause such things continue to exist today, contemporary society is every bit as racist as it was in the 1960s. Minorities face tougher court sentences, are overwhelmingly sent to wars, there are more black men in prison than were used as slaves at the height of chattel slavery, and minorities dominate homeless\/poverty\/mental-ill-health\/incarceration statistics. And as the core of the system stabilises, new forms of racism are pushed outward, other country's and cultures demonized to foster further accumulation. Ironically, the end result of this is an increased persecution of whites and the middle classes capitalism has to come for them next. Racism is itself more than an ideology, a belief system or a negative attitude towards others arising out of prejudice. If that alone were the case then racism would be reduced to something which takes place inside human heads. But such an understanding ignores a chief factor behind racism (as well as sexism) Power and the capacity to act. Or as the old civil rights mantra went, racism equals prejudice plus power.In our era, though, the most important factor in reinvigorating a whole new round of global racism is the resurgence of a certain brand of Reaganite conservatism (or neoliberalism), whose hallmark was the reinstatement of laissez-faire economic policies and rhetoric. Subject to such unchecked capitalism, the poor got poorer, the middle class was destroyed, debts exponentially increased, and the great big national Ponzi scheme was forced to go abroad, often violently with wars, Uncle Sam's Mickey Mouse Club desperately sucking up new members for life support.

This is the case with Pretty Woman. I watched it quite some time ago, and still remember that it is about a lonely business man on a trip to Los Angeles, picks up a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard, and then falls in love with her.This is a typical Cinderella story in a sense. Okay Cinderella was imprisoned in her castle as a scullery maid by her ugly step sisters, but is rescued by her fairy godmother, given a wonderful night with Prince Charming, and then flees before midnight only to have Prince Charming track her down and marry her. This is not necessarily the plot of this film, but it is a story of a less than ordinary woman (she is a hooker) who is found by a wealthy individual who then falls in love with her. Thus while it is rags to riches, it is through marriage that the heroine goes from being a hooker to being a princess.This was a very popular movie, but it was not one of the great movies in that it came out, flew high, and then returned to obscurity. However it is one that sits on my mother's shelf, despite me cringing at the idea of creating a romantic movie round a prostitute. I can see that there would have been a lot of criticism regarding making a woman of the night the heroine, and raising her up to a new lifestyle. There are many that would cringe at that and claim that such a woman does not deserve a chance to succeed. She doesn't really succeed though, she is in the right place at the right time, and is picked up by the right man.I would not recommend that people go out and become prostitutes simply so that they might meet the man of their dreams, it simply does not happen. In some countries prostitution is legal (such as Germany and the Netherlands) however that is not the case in the US. It is still illegal and while those who hire the services may not necessarily be thugs, it is a culture that is permeated with drugs and violence.The final thing I wish to mention is the kissing. Throughout the movie we are told that prostitutes do not kiss and suggest that is because kissing brings about a more intimate relationship, which is not what prostitution is about. This is rubbish since sex in and of itself creates an intimate relationship. The best reason I found out about the reason behind the non-kissing rule is more to prevent the transmission of disease than about anything somewhat to do with intimate relationships.
