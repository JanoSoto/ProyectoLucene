Incorporating a story that will warm the coldest hearts of any age or gender with a subtle underlying commentary on the prejudiced world in which we live, Burton delivers the film in such a way that anyone from the casual film-goer to the knowledgeable filmbuff can appreciate the film.Johnny Depp's performance is masterful, using very little speech (apparently he only says 169 words in the entire film) he relies mainly on mannerisms and his obvious feel for the character. Without Johnny Depp there would be no Edward Scissorhands, he makes the character almost iconic, also without Edward Scissorhands there would probably be no Johnny Depp, seeing as this film catapulted him into near superstar status. Also worth a mention, the performances of other actors such as Dianne Wiest are well played and engaging and although you may have to suspend your disbelief on various occasions during the film i.e. in the ending sequence with the ice in the attic this is not the case with any of the acting.Finally, the sets in the film that represent a stereotypical American suburb are beautiful as a comparison to Edward's Gothic retreat, and even though they are colourfully painted, Burtons darkness still shines through as they seem ominous and almost carnival like.

Sometimes I wish IMDb would create a sort of tag which allows people to categorize their comments. (this would save me time having to read through a whole bunch of comments which are basically fans saying yes I really like this movie too...) There is definitely a time and place for that, and room too, but as I said,and I would imagine I am not alone, in that there are those of us who are interested in reading more unbiased critiques rather than either blatantly positive or overtly negative views. That said, I found a few very enjoyable moments and images in HPATSS, I can see for sure why children are drawn to it. Maybe it is in some ways a gateway narrative to the more dense Tolkein works. My impression is that this movie is geared toward kids in elementary school and through junior high.The issue of the CGI is highly debatable, some reviewers propose that the movie should be somehow shot with lower-tech (Jim Henson) techniques. I agree with this but I am also aware of the nostalgic factor and I wonder if somehow since many of us grew up on the original Star Wars and (Henson) styled Sesame Street, we link his work with our youth and then interpret that style to be superior. This could be. Will our children, once fully grown, interpret CGI to be superior since they will associate it with their youth? And what will replace CGI? - this is the stuff of science fiction. But to thwart that whole debate, personally I really find an affinity toward the more analog (puppets) and Disney's hand drawn animation, rather than a mesh of CGI and digital film. - note - such films as Toy Story and Sharks Tale, and the (to be seen) Polar Express, which are completely CGI are better views. Compare Potter with another children's protagonist - Fievel Mousekewitz, from An American Tale. While both are special, and stumble through their stories almost destined like trains on rails to their climax and endings, it is Fievel who comes across as the better developed character. Potter on the other hand is constantly told almost from the beginning of the movie that he is famous, that he is special, so he must live up to this. It is somewhat surprising how this is done. Unlike Luke Skywalker, or Fievel, or the majority of major motion picture protagonists, Potter is somewhat blase', and is guided along though the whole film by a giant, the heads of the school, and his smart female and comic relief honcho sidekicks. The surprise is of course that what this is all building to is a fight scene which ends in a most bizarre manner, the villain crumbling at themere touch of Harry Potter, to which he cries in agony, what magic is this? This is a most unusual confrontation and defeat. What is even more awkward is, (and m aybe i missed this), but I didn't really know why this happen. To which the very next scene explains. The fact that they needed to tell us why it happened ill ustrates that there is something major wrong with the narrative. In a good mov ie we would have known why this villain is crumbling. Did I miss that part, please fill me in, was there any foreshadowing there? Oh, one more thing that was kind of annoying was the portrayal of the chess match near the end. Now understood, that it is difficult (extremely difficult) to communicate the complexities of ches s to the age group this movie is gear toward, but cutting from shot to shot of random chess pieces being destroyed was rather pointless, and it came across t o me as rather hollow. There could have been an attempt to maybe at least demons trate some of the very basic moves in chess. And I also didn't understand exac tly why Potter's buddy HAD to hold tight to the knight, how come Harry was able to walk on the chess board? It lost me. However as positives, there are bunch, such as the presentation of the villain in the climax scene, the whole thing about unicorns blood and drinking unicorns blood, that resonated with me somehow, and how it was all silvery and such, this seemed very 2001, yeah, and what else. Harry Potter looks a lot like my friend David Fishel, so that made me feel good, (even though Dave is like 6'8) - maybe it's those Gandhi \/ Lennon spectacles, who knows... It was also refreshing to see the presentation of all the witchcraft and magic in such a matter of fact way, I think that is actually the motivating charisma of the venture is that it's a relatively subdued presentation of the eccentric, bizarre, and out and out balderdash. Somehow in the vein of the Reiner's Princess Bride, (sorta, maybe a stretch) - but what i am trying to say is that i appreciated the frankness with which the cast displayed in their performances. For what it's worth.Overall some what enjoyable, not on any top tens at this writing in my book, i give it a 6.5\/10 mostly for the chess blunder and questions concerning story and character development.

Unlike Luke Skywalker, or Fievel, or the majority of major motion picture protagonists, Potter is somewhat blase', and is guided along though the whole film by a giant, the heads of the school, and his smart female and comic relief honcho sidekicks.

They are two completely different animals, and in some ways, this dichotomy is unravelling the authenticity of storytelling in general. (If you haven't enjoyed some human to human oral storytelling, please give it a shot, whether it is folklore, fiction, fantasy, reading bedtime stories to you kids, or going to your house of worship.) In many cultures traditions are passed down orally and this was the main method of communication (and entertainment) prior to the development of written text. yadda yadda - Having said this, I just watched HP&tSorcerer's Stone on television (and i have not read the books, maybe someday I will?) As for the film. It seems many people are just overall fans of the Harry Potter phenomenon. No different from anyone who posts 10\/10 comments on any other movie which happens to be their favorites. Sometimes I wish IMDb would create a sort of tag which allows people to categorize their comments. (this would save me time having to read through a whole bunch of comments which are basically fans saying yes I really like this movie too...) There is definitely a time and place for that, and room too, but as I said,and I would imagine I am not alone, in that there are those of us who are interested in reading more unbiased critiques rather than either blatantly positive or overtly negative views. That said, I found a few very enjoyable moments and images in HPATSS, I can see for sure why children are drawn to it. Maybe it is in some ways a gateway narrative to the more dense Tolkein works. My impression is that this movie is geared toward kids in elementary school and through junior high.The issue of the CGI is highly debatable, some reviewers propose that the movie should be somehow shot with lower-tech (Jim Henson) techniques. I agree with this but I am also aware of the nostalgic factor and I wonder if somehow since many of us grew up on the original Star Wars and (Henson) styled Sesame Street, we link his work with our youth and then interpret that style to be superior. This could be. Will our children, once fully grown, interpret CGI to be superior since they will associate it with their youth? And what will replace CGI? - this is the stuff of science fiction. But to thwart that whole debate, personally I really find an affinity toward the more analog (puppets) and Disney's hand drawn animation, rather than a mesh of CGI and digital film. - note - such films as Toy Story and Sharks Tale, and the (to be seen) Polar Express, which are completely CGI are better views. Compare Potter with another children's protagonist - Fievel Mousekewitz, from An American Tale. While both are special, and stumble through their stories almost destined like trains on rails to their climax and endings, it is Fievel who comes across as the better developed character.

I decided to rate it a 5, since that seems to be the sensible thing to do in this situation. Like a few others have said, Tarantino's style is hip and makes you, the audience, feel hip. The dialog, the editing, the violence... the problem is, it's empty. The dialog is entirely superficial, which is OK if there's not too much of it or what there is there to be superficial. But here it carries half of the scenes. The dialog scenes(as pretty much everything else in the film) is very dull, visually. The camera doesn't move and rarely changes angle, and it's something that'll make you fall asleep, if the pointless, shallow dialogs don't do so first. The editing is daft as well. The violence is so over the top that you almost have to be mentally disturbed not to be affected(read repulsed) by it... is that why it's there? Does Tarantino want to gross out his audience? Is that what it's about? The length and pace is horrible. I don't believe I've ever managed to sit through the entire thing attentively. The problem is not the length itself as much as what appears to be Tarantino yelling at his audience You want to see my movie? Well, you better prepare to sit there for what feels like 10 hours straight! Just to ensure that there are no misunderstandings; that was a metaphor.

The movie was meant to be a homage to the popular Halloween and I don't think the producers had more expectations. To these days, Halloween 4 is one of the best slasher flicks of the past 20 years and deserves a special mention for being a stand alone movie from the franchise. Sure, this is by no means better or equally good as John Carpenter's 1978 classic but it has it's own elements to be considered as a great slasher flick that could easily be watched by fans of the horror genre. Ten years have passed since Michael Myers escaped from the mental asylum and murdered three people on Halloween Night. After the terrible explosion at the local hospital that night, Michael Myers ended severely damaged and hasn't been able to wake up from a ten year old comma. It's Halloween night 1988, and after hearing about the existence of her niece Michael Myers wakes up from the comma and kills two paramedic while he was being driven to the maximum security prison. Myers once again heads to Haddonfield in order to kill his niece. Dr. Loomis also survived the explosion and he's aware of Michael's return.*SPOILERS!!!*It's hard for me to decide on which Halloween sequel is better. Part 2 was creepy and is one of the best slashers from the 80's. The Return is a solid slasher and surprisingly it handles perfectly the famous Halloween plot. The opening scene is great. The raining, the maximum security area, the man in charge of the place; the creepiness is in the atmosphere. After Michael brutally kills the two paramedics, you can feel that the movie is going in the right direction. The original Halloween was successful because it didn't need gore to shock the audience. The settings, situations, and Michael were the basic elements to create the (probably) most famous slasher from all time. The Return of Michael Myers has the basic elements from the original plus a good amount of gore, and a dark setting that fits perfect with the movie's tone. The plot keeps you interested and you never get bored. Dr. Loomis is on the hunt for Myers again but this time his mission is harder mainly because Myers proved to have some sort of supernatural force and nobody seems to stop him. In my opinion, the most important scene in the movie is when Dr. Loomis finds Michael at the gas station. Both know each other very well and after ten years, their first encounter promised a lot. The scene is shocking and sends a message to the audience towards the importance that Loomis gives to Myers return. That scene is to me one of the best moments in the series.ACTING Donald Pleasence delivers a great performance and what I like it most about it is that he gives it a special importance as if it was the role of his life. Pleasence was very involved in the series and after Myers, he's the most important character in the series. Danielle Harris also shines in the screen. Her extremely cute face makes you worry about her. The girl can act and her performance is one of the best from any child actor int he genre. GORE There are plenty of gory scenes that may please the audience. The paramedics scene is pretty gory and makes you ask for more. There's a rifle impalement, a head crushing, and some other violent scenes that make me miss the 80's slashers more. DIRECTION\/SCORE\/CINEMATOGRAPHY -Dwight H. Little's direction is top notch even for an 80's slasher. The man knew how to create scenes of tension and creepiness. The movie looks like a solid horror movie. After the master Carpenter, Little's direction is the best in the series. -The score is very effective. The 80's version of the classic Halloween tune is excellent! I love it. The music used in important scenes also delivered very well. When Loomis faces Myers at the gas station the score plays an important role as it starts dramatic and ends with the Halloween tune. Excellent. -The cinematography deserves a special mention because the movie is set 90% at night. There's a lot of darkness that totally sets up a very intimidating setting while Myers wanders searching for victims. When the town's electrical system is messed up by Myers; there is no more light in the movie! The darkness of the cinematography is brilliantly used in the final setting, the old house. Halloween 4 is a creepy movie mainly because it's dark cinematography. Nice one.IMPORTANT SCENES -Michael's return after the comma. -Loomis encounter with Myers at the gas station. -The shocking ending (Danielle Harris wearing THAT mask...) -The infamous rifle impalement. -Myers falling to his underground grave.8\/10. Scary, intense, well directed, good acted, 80's horror movie.

The two characters are presented as far out from an identifiable character as possible that they can't be reached by the audience. Sure, you can identify with a few aspects of their character, but they definitely stop being real.The character of Will is very close to being identifiable with, and so the audience can believe in him and feel emotion for him at the right times. Yet not for the boy or the mother, I mean when the boy declares to Will how recent events have upset him and really affected him, I felt sad and some empathy, but connection with my past or the character just didn't come. If only they'd injected a small part of reality into them then it would have.There's also a slight trouble with the clunkiness of some of the dialogue and choices that Will makes.

Needless to say I was disappointed.I think where this movie started failing for me, for it does start off very well, is in the uniqueness of the boy and his mother. The two characters are presented as far out from an identifiable character as possible that they can't be reached by the audience. Sure, you can identify with a few aspects of their character, but they definitely stop being real.The character of Will is very close to being identifiable with, and so the audience can believe in him and feel emotion for him at the right times. Yet not for the boy or the mother, I mean when the boy declares to Will how recent events have upset him and really affected him, I felt sad and some empathy, but connection with my past or the character just didn't come. If only they'd injected a small part of reality into them then it would have.There's also a slight trouble with the clunkiness of some of the dialogue and choices that Will makes. His character is one that believes that a man can be an island...I'm bloody Ibiza!, yet he makes some absurd against character choices and statements. For example when he says he really enjoys Christmas with the most bizarre bunch of people, yet he's clearly not. His character could have come to the same conclusions and the story taken the same journey, just with a bit more of a real view.Still, there are some excellent moments, the argument in the bar over Marcus coming to his house when his mother suggests he's been interfering with him is both awkward and funny, an excellently built scene.One good thing for Grant out of all this is that the movie does a good job of dispelling his previous movie parts, and he really does do a good job of what he's given.However, the poor moments did make me roll my eyes and took me straight out of the movie. Light entertainment, and not much more.

Morality be damned, it's all just fun. But there is so much more to this movie that is serious and compelling, it's hard to rate this movie as a comedy. Perhaps it's the shockingly promiscuous behavior of the characters that prompted laughter in the theaters. I admit that I was shocked by some of the behavior in the movie watching it in 2004! I can only imagine how 1975's average movie-goer saw it! But it was more scathing character study than social satire, and much of it very serious.You can't help but wonder if Warren Beatty (with legendary screenwriter Robert Towne co-scripting) wrote a character to explain himself to the world. Yes, I've been with lots of women in Hollywood, including Julie Christie, Diane Keaton and even Madonna before settling down with Annette Bening, but there's more to me!!!! And more IS told in this film than tawdry exploits. It examines the emptiness of the lives of baby-boomers during the late 60s who were outright rebelling against, or trying very unsuccessfully to live within, the confines of what was right and moral.Lee Grant was effective and entertaining as an unhappy older woman (but not much older) having a fling with Beatty and cheating on her cheating husband Jack Warden. But was it Oscar-worthy? Methinks not. It was good, not great. Give that Oscar to Goldie Hawn or Julie Christie instead! And Jack Warden was robbed of an Oscar, infusing so much pathos into the persona of a man simply too old to live like the kids do, but trying way too hard to keep up anyway. Despite his riches and establishment stuffiness, Warden gives a performance that makes you feel for him and understand the man he's trying to grow up and be. Seeing him in a party of hippies was so sad, you just wanted him to go home and get a good night's sleep. In the hands of a less gifted actor, the role would have been seen as merely clownish or cold.All in all, Shampoo was a great, biting criticism of how life was going for the confused masses who shook their heads in disbelief as Tricky Dick was elected TWICE, and were trying to update the book of morality for a far more open generation. You can definitely see how today's 20 or 30-somethings might have grown up to be misguided and lost with parents like these!
