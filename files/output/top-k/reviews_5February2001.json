The movie begins by picking up the story in 1974, with a news report of the death of one Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), then flashes back to 1972, when Sarah and Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) first met.

I watched the series backwards, so Army of Darkness was the film I saw first, then Evil Dead II. While Evil Dead II is probably still my favorite, it was interesting to see where it all started.The camera work is incredibly good, and the fast motion sequences showing the demon's approach was pretty well done, if not completely original. Though also interesting, and kinda funny to note is that we see the characters running away, but when the camera switches away from the demon's view, we don't see the demon, and that seems like a touch of genius...we know it's there, but we can't see it, and while it probably was a limitation of the budget, it actually proved to be a great method of suspense.The special effects are as laughable as they were in the rest of the series, but there's something to be said for a film that takes its chances and goes to the extreme in lieu of lacking resources. People complain about this a lot, but I have to say to them get a sense of humor. The whole point of the Evil Dead series was to mock horror films and show how campy they were and that they could get even worse. It's humor is in that the film tries to take itself seriously, but the lack of a big budget makes this not only impossible, but even funny in spite of the fact that it could conceivable be a serious film.The acting is also terrible, but again in that way that it's so obviously bad that it's hard to tell were the actors just plain bad or were they doing that deliberately to serve the purpose of mocking the genre. Bruce Campbell's introduction into the world of abused heroes is interesting since his character is actually less of a chauvinist in this one than he ultimately became famous for. But it works, and the horror on his face when his friend has no reservations about chopping up his possessed girlfriend is actually believable.Overall, this movie is a great piece of cinema. It's humorous, but serious as well, and its greatest strength is its ability to draw the line between being part of the genre and mocking it. There are plenty of moments of original horror (I don't think anybody could keep their composure during the Tree Rape scene, which they repeated to lesser effect in Evil Dead II, but let's face it that movie was supposed to be a rehash and extension). Give the film a chance and don't take it too seriously. Otherwise you're missing the point.

Sisters was okay, a little rough around the edges. Carrie, while not Hitchcockian in the sense of an homage, like the others, was absolutely amazing, and is one of the best films made in the 70s. I also sort of liked Blow Out, though I had to see it on FX, and the commercials were a constant interruption. I even saw some of Cult Movies....God, was that bad. But anyway, what I really wanted to see was Dressed to Kill. I had heard constant rave reviews, and it seemed like a great film.We all know the Psycho-like plot A woman (Angie Dickinson) breaks from her reality into seemingly another world, meeting a mysterious man in a museum, and subsequently going home with him. As she leaves that evening, she is murdered violently in the elevator, and found by another woman (Nancy Allen). Blah blah, you've heard the rest, and what a terrible synopsis this is, anyway. I wanna get down to the review, though, so let's move on.Dressed to Kill is an amazing film. I saw the uncut version, with all the nifty extras mentioned in the Alternate Versions section. The opening shower scene is REALLY shocking, and the violent murder in the elevator is ruthless. Unlike the shower murder in Psycho the scene is so often compared to, this one is not as brutally quick. It takes its time, and while at first it's a little disappointing, as it progresses and the DePalma style sets in, the whole scene is terrific. In the uncut version, there are very close shots of Bobbi slashing the knife down Kate's face and I think slashing her throat as well. I'm not saying I like this sort of stuff, just that it's that much more horrific. I love when Liz (Nancy Allen) sees Bobbi's reflection as she stands in the corner, waiting for her, and, of course, everything is in perfect slow motion, pulling you right onto the edge of your seat. Unlike Psycho, after Part One (when the star is killed) the movie keeps up the pace and the tension. The scenes where Liz is pursued in the subway are tense, and a less-raw version of the horrifying scenes in Maniac. (A sleazy, but oftentimes very scary movie!) Sure, the gang that Liz angers gets a little silly after a while, but DePalma seemed to be showing that there are other dangers in this world other than the central issue, and it's a creative idea.The greatest scene, though, is the Vertigo-like scene in the museum. No dialogue, all music...yet so much is said, just in facial expressions and changes in the soundtrack. Pino Donaggio has a way of using very calm, beautiful music in such a way that it terrifies the audience. (Note the pre-pig's blood prom scenes in Carrie for more of this.) The scene is like poetry, and moves along beautifully well. I liked how Kate was wearing white, and the mysterious stranger was in dark sunglasses and clothes. Hitch did the same thing with Marion's lingerie in Psycho.The climax is a little cheesy (don't miss Liz's line about assistance--hysterical!) and throughout the movie, the killer is painfully obvious. Also, how did Dennis Franz find out so much information about Kate and her soiree with the man in the museum? *shrugs* I can suspend my disbelief. The acting is all-around pretty good. Michael Caine is great, as always. I loved Angie Dickinson--she deserved an Oscar for this very realistic, wonderful performance. She's not in the film much more than forty minutes, but she steals the show. Nancy Allen has her moments, but she's usually pretty weak in delivering her lines. Still, I liked her. Keith Gordon, as Kate's vengeful son, was very likable, but needed a haircut. Dennis Franz once again plays a detective, but he does it well, as always. The rest of the cast is barely in the movie, and Kate's second husband (can't even remember his name) is, I think, a purposely inaccessible character, perhaps to feel the way she does. He's even cast really low on the list. (By the way, Mary Davenport, also seen as Jennifer Salt's quirky mother in Sisters, is cast here as Woman in Restaurant--where was she?!)DePalma is an excellent director, and I wish he'd go back to making films like this, even though Dressed to Kill could only be made in the early 80s. He can master quiet horror (ie the strangely horrifying discovery Kate makes from what she finds in the drawer of the mystery man's desk) and can pull off a full-blown scene of terror (ie the elevator murder) equally well. He always puts together great casts of characters, and has a lot of great tricks up his sleeve. This is definitely one of his best films, and one of the best thrillers made in the 80s.

The unimaginative plot?  The lame special effects?I won't be using any character names to discuss the film because I didn't care enough about any of the characters to remember their names.  Kim Basinger was horrible, even considering the role she was given.  She begins the movie as your random, everyday person.  Then her junkie sister shows up with her child.  Now what do you suppose happens next?  Of course.  Junkie takes money from sister and leaves child behind, because we all know that junkies care more about their next fix than their kids.  The dialogue between Kim and Junkie is predictableKim You should take better care of your kid.  Don't do drugs.Junkie Who cares?  I like drugs.Kim That's just wrong!Junkie You're just jealous because you can't have kids!(paraphrased)And so the truth is out, as if it wasn't apparent by the fact that Kim is mid to late 30's, lonely, and not dating, something which was made clear in the first minute of the film.  Kim can't have kids.  So now she has one she can raise as her own... until she's taken away from Kim (which MUST happen, you know).Urgh!  I just get all disgusted thinking about it, and this was just the first 10 minutes of the movie!!!

The corner store owner who defends his business... before collapsing into fear and surrender. The gang members seeking vengeance for a slight... who are Three Stooges stupid and clumsy. The fast food chain... where the customer always comes last. The beggar... who barely pretends to be little more than a thug. The neo-Nazi... destroyed by his new idol. The occupiers of a lavish estate... who are only the hired help. Untouchable country-club types in their golf course paradise... driven to terror and panic by an outsider. The innocent children... well versed in the operation of weapons of great destruction. The big city cop... emasculated by a deranged wife and humiliated by his colleagues.The chaos and violence of a big city... where law, order, and morality is ultimately restored.One of the more trenchant observations of society since some of the great movies of the Seventies like Network, Nashville, and others, Falling Down takes us on a fast-forward, no-holds-barred ride through the stylized hell of modern life, replete with alienation, hatred, misunderstanding, misrepresentation, cynicism, suspicion, and general human baseness. This is a world in which every element of society has completely lost touch with every other element. And the Michael Douglas character, feeling caught in the middle, lost in a world he no longer understands, snaps, grows bold, and swaggers through the twisted landscape, determined to make everything right again.He says he only wants to give his little girl a birthday present, but there is far more to it than that. Note that this gift he gives her is one of those little globe worlds, like a snow-shaker an ideal world he feels once existed and which he wants to be able to give to her.That world does not exist, of course, and perhaps even he knows it, but things are not as bad as his eyes see them. Chaos eventually resolves itself into order, and in the movie this happens through the Robert Duvall character from meekness and weakness he hardens into the figure of strength and righteous authority. Order is restored. The world is as it should be.We have never stopped relying on stereotypes, and this movie is very effective at puncturing them all, and leaving a little kernel of truth to observe and appreciate. Each of the little episodes that make up this movie always end in an assertion of simple humanity. The little masks that we wear, and that we see on others, are torn away and we see ourselves as we really are, no matter what image we might try and pass off for ourselves in the end, we are all fragile, vulnerable, often a little stupid but ultimately idealistic, and we are only good or bad by accident.Mixed with a sense of humour, a good cinematographic scheme, some decent secondary characters to support the powerhouse performance of Michael Douglas and the more subtle shadings in Robert Duvall's role, and the very real urban locations used, and you have one of the more notable achievements in film in the past decade or two.

Miramax has reportedly picked it up for distribution.This movie contains emotional crescendos that are subtle and powerful. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson are magnificent in their portrayal of a couple who have deep affection for and differences with each other, and their conversations are difficult and enriching to watch.  Director Todd Field's presentation struck some in our audience as too slow, but I found that the pace only increased the emotional impact of each subsequent scene.It may well be that Miramax will withhold release of this masterpiece until later in the year, in order to do better in the various awards races.  So be it.

I loved Vertigo, appreciated Psycho, was irritated by Spellbound, was partial to Strangers on a Train, was intruiged by The Wrong Man and fairly enjoyed North By Northwest... Rear Window is probably his finest work that I have yet seen... open, as it is, to many, varied interpretations.While Vertigo had a more domineering score, photography and general artifice, Rear Window has a greater impact for me. While Vertigo was gripping, this one was positively electrifying in that department. The fact that Hitchcock managed such a multi-faceted, intruiging effort with the original conceit he adopted - to make a film from one set, and one single vantage-point - is astounding. I've not heard of the novel it was based on, but this is one hell of a script.  All of the characters, and that's partially including the ones viewed by Stewart's L.B. Jeffries, are fully fleshed out and flawed. I found Thelma Ritter's performance amusing, and believable, providing the Bel Geddes (in Vertigo)-type role early on, and then developing interestingly. Grace Kelly's Lisa is a fascinating character, more than you'd initially suspect. Undeniably beautiful, but also frustrated, passionate, devious and desperate in equal part. While Jeffries, or perhaps his accident (a typically important little detail that Hitchcock uses brilliantly, like Stewart's vertigo in Vertigo), starts the whole voyeuristic business, Ritter and to an interesting extent, Kelly collaborate with his fancies. Stewart's role is a great one, that of a deeply flawed, and disturbingly obsessed voyeur. It is sure that, at least with the films he made for Hitchcock, Stewart fulfilled all of his promise as an actor. From the wonderfully casual early scenes, to his gradual obsession with a particular house, his acting is brilliant in conveying the character's less-than-positive traits. It seems absurd at first that he be resistive at all to Kelly, but gradually their relationship is made complex, with perhaps Kelly's motivations in the film's later stages intruiging to consider, if she is or not as perfect as Stewart earlier claims. There is twist after twist in characterisation, theme and plot, with the final 15 minutes particularly striking in this regard. The conclusion is brilliantly ironic. Audience expectation and sympathies are toyed with exceptionally by Hitchcock at every turn.  The themes are manifold, with voyeurism the guiding one. Themes are linked with character, and are effectively tackled; Wendell Corey's character pretty much emphasising the voyeuristic theme with a pertinent quote that I can't exactly recall. The direction is superb, as you would expect from Hitchcock (its his fascinating, complex use of narrative, character and theme that eleveates this work above so many of his other films), engendering many different moods, but none untainted by corruption in some way. The photography is impressive, giving the restricting settings a pungeancy. Hitchcock and his photographers always tending, at least with Vertigo and Rear Window, to capture colour in a more vivid, expressive and importantly, atmospheric light than most in the history of colour film. Perhaps pivotal in my view is the brilliant use of music, distant, from the houses Stewart spies on, especially the haunting piano tunes (referred to yearningly by Kelly's character) from one home. This adds contrast and depth to many scenes, both within and without of Stewart's flat.It seems a waste that there are so few films that try, and succeed, in capturing this film's mood and devices. In many ways, I felt David Lynch's Blue Velvet to capture some of its suspenseful brilliance. Terence Young's 1967 film, Wait Until Dark was very nearly as tense and exciting, and also well worth checking out if you love Rear Window. No doubts are there, that Rear Window is one of the classics more than deserving of its status.

While these elements are cornerstones of the storyline, the movie's foundation is grounded in far more subtle complexity.   Rather, The Pledge explores human emotions, and how they drive human action.  This is an epic story with a pace that may put off viewers expecting (or who have been led to expect) frantic scenes in the police headquarters, or copious car chase scenes.  Rather, The Pledge is an intellectual thriller.  Generous details and recurring themes (Jack's fishing, the porcupines) draw the viewer into the world of the characters, who are well developed, and continue to grow as the film unfolds.Nicholson  Brilliance unbound!  Jack Nicholson, sporting a moustache and all-over gnarled appearance, gives his 'retired cop' a richness, a realness.

The final sequence is heart-wrenching as the audience knows the truth.  Many will say the pace is slow, but the story drives the film and patience is the moral of the story.

The premise was good... nerdy kid grows up and goes after the snobs that made fun of him... granted, it's been done, but I found the whole creepy Valentine's and cherub mask to be a interesting twist.  The movie had a decent cast, with some excellent up and coming's like the afore-mentioned David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, and Katherine Heigel, as well as the well-known Denise Richards.  All of this said, the movie was oozing with potential, but fell quite short.Was it the lack of a plot that made sense, or a lack of convincing dialogue? Is it sad the only character that really seemed to interest me was a side character named Scary Gary that portrayed Marley Shelton's neighbor?  The guy had no more than 5 lines, but I found him to be the most amusing character.  I'm thinking that the worst part of this movie had to be the writing.  The story had 3 or four subplots that had no bearing on the rest of the story, and consequently made no sense.  There was about 20 minutes of the movie that took place inside a tasteless maze at an art show.  The whol e scene was ridiculous and didn't go along with the rest of the movie.  The charcter Campbell also seemed to have no point to the story.  There was also a bedroom scene between Denise Richards and a charcter named Brian, that although incredibly amusing, had ABSOLUTELY NO POINT.  Personally, I am still confused about the ending.  Nothing was wrapped up. I left the movie confused and disgusted.  This movie was supposed to be based on the novel by the same title.  I found out today that the writers of the screenplay didn't even READ the novel.  They only used the title.  No wonder it was terrible.Now, I have grown up under the assumption that horror movies were supposed to be.. well... scary.  With maybe even, god forbid, a little gore.  This movie fell short on all accounts.  It was too predictable to be scary, and there was no gore.  No blood.  I have to say, the best death scene involed a power drill and a hot tub...All in all, this movie was a waste of outstanding talent.  The only saving grace was the performances of David Boreanaz and Marley Shelton.  Both are phenomenal performers, and I hope this movie doesn't impede their careers. My reccommendation, if there is a person in this movie who you would like to see on the big screen for two hours, then go see it.  Other than that, don't spend the $7.75 to watch it.
