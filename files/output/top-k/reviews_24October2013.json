Up until the end at least. Otherwise, it's of the haunted mansion persuasion, and considered a Classic of the ghost story sub-genre.It tells the story of a group of people that have been specifically selected by a Professor, who desires to study the paranormal, by having them stay in an old mansion called Hill House, which is known to have a dark past, and to be haunted by the ghost of the daughter of it's original owners.The group members have been specifically selected because of particular traits they possess. Traits the Professor has deemed desirable for the purposes of his study. Elanor is a medium- who has the ability to connect with and feel the presence of the dead- evident from the experiences documented from her past. While Theo, on the other hand, is a psychic who possesses the ability to read minds. She was chosen by the Professor for the purpose of reading Elanor's mind- so that she cannot keep her thoughts and experiences hidden away. Hence why she is trying to form (what seems almost like a veiled lesbian) relationship with Elanor, throughout the film. The Professor is a seemingly legit scientist, who is sincerely interested in discovering more about the ghost phenomenon. Considering this, he has resorted to using the only effective instruments he knows of- paranormally inclined humans. Luke, the young heir to the mansion, typically thinks he knows everything, and thus plays the role of the skeptic. The value of his presence is derived from the fact that he works to keep the professor grounded in reality. His presence was requested by the current owner of the house, who insisted he get in on the experience, so that he can get an idea about what he'll be getting into in the future, when he inherits Hill House for himself.The plot starts off kind of like all of those shitty ghost hunter type shows, with each of the members of the group playing their respective roles. Even though there is pretty definitive evidence that there is actually a ghost, at times early on, Wise cleverly includes certain elements that lead to reasonable doubt.Sh*t starts to hit the fan when the Professor's wife shows up unexpectedly; invading the house and demanding to experience a ghost. After discovering that the sealed nursery is the center of activity in the house, that's, of course, where she wants to go. The group was careful to leave that room alone, but when they approach it...the doors are wide open, just waiting for the wife to enter.Prior to this, the ghost had been specifically targeting Elanor. It's clear that Elanor is trying to escape her past, as she is constantly calling this her vacation, and stating that she'd prefer to stay in the old mansion forever.Everything culminates when the Professor's Wife becomes possessed by the spirit of the house, and starts sleepwalking outside, at the very instant that Elanor (herself possessed? or fleeing in fear, perhaps?) gets in her car and starts to drive away...leading to a collision that would take Elanor's life- trapping her soul in the house forever. Like she wanted one would suppose. To bring things to a circular close, the Professor notes how she died at the same tree that the Original Owner's Wife had tragically died at- right before she got a chance to step into the place.Earlier on, a ghostly note is scribbled on the wall telling Elanor to, Come Home. Does this imply that she was, in fact, the reincarnated soul of the Original Owner's Wife? Was Abigail (their daughter, and the ghost that was known to haunt Hill House) responsible for trying to unite with her dead and reincarnated mother's spirit?

You are left to answer these questions for yourself.The Haunting is an interesting horror classic, that provides just enough reasonable doubt to keep you thinking, and second guessing your notions...which is fun. The ghost activity is subtle, and the film is slow and dialogue based, so it's more of a thinking-man's horror. What makes it so great is that it ties up all the loose ends, but leaves things open-ended enough to allow for different readings about what you think happened, depending on where you are coming from (think, which character in the film did you most relate to?).

It is a profession with a reputation for sleaze and slime. But Jerry Maguire is not your typical sports agent. Well, he is at the start of the film. But then he has an ethical epiphany. Unfortunately this epiphany gets him fired from his high-powered agency. Jerry is left with just one client, Rod Tidwell. Rod, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is brash, bold, bombastic and exceedingly self-confident. And with regard to Jerry he is interested in only one thing Show me the money! When Jerry is cast out on his own with his one client he also has only one employee for his new start-up agency. That is Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who apparently was the only person at Jerry's old agency who shared his ideals. Or who was willing to admit she shared them anyway. She leaves her secure job to take a chance on Jerry and it becomes clear pretty quickly that she may have made a big mistake. But as Jerry flounders professionally he and Dorothy grow closer. They come to count on one another. They fall in love. At least they think they do. Their relationship is a challenge, a love story which it turns out may not include much love at all. Did they come together for love or for convenience? They know true love when they see it, as they do in the rock-solid relationship between Rod Tidwell and his wife. Seeing what Rod and his wife have only makes it more painfully obvious to Jerry and Dorothy what they are lacking.So this is a rather challenging romantic film. The main characters don't fall instantly in love and settle into a life of constant bliss. If this relationship is to succeed they are going to have to really work at it. It is an interesting journey Jerry and Dorothy take and director Cameron Crowe was fortunate to have two excellent performers filling those key roles. Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger were at the top of their games here, playing off one another beautifully and creating two truly outstanding characters. The actors are certainly helped by Crowe's terrific dialogue, this is a script with so many memorable lines, both funny and poignant. Of course Cruise and Zellweger don't get all the best lines for themselves. Cuba Gooding Jr. shines, injecting so much life into the movie playing the outrageous Rod Tidwell. Bonnie Hunt provides some laughs as Dorothy's wary sister. Kelly Preston is a stunner, both in looks and in what she says as she plays another woman in Jerry's life. And there is also room for a wonderfully precocious child, Jonathan Lipnicki being incredibly endearing in that part. There's also Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Regina King, Beau Bridges...it is a really long list of quality performers and Crowe gives them all their moments to shine. There is a sense the movie struggles at times with the balance between comedy and drama. Is it a comedy that's trying to be dramatic or a drama that's trying to be funny? And how do you squeeze a romance into that mix? Oh, and it's sort of a sports movie too. Crowe really does have a lot going on here, maybe a little too much. But by and large it works. The movie manages to both entertain and charm you. And it is great to see the characters grow. Maybe even Rod Tidwell can come to learn that it is not all about the money.

Stricken with insomnia, he decides to enrol as a taxi driver in order to pass the time. What follows is a descent into madness, brutality and vigilantism. De Niro portrays the titular protagonist\/antagonist in what can only be described as a masterpiece, both for him as an actor and for Martin Scorsese as a director. The film's intense depiction of urban decay, and Travis' equally intense reactions to this corruption, have gone down (and will continue to go down) as a milestone in cinematic history. Initially, it is relatively easy to sympathize with Bickle. He is a lonely man, lost and without purpose. After several failed attempts at socialization, he finally manages to acquire a date with a beautiful political volunteer (Cybill Shepherd). When this ends miserably, Bickle's personality takes an even more twisted turn, with him becoming increasingly concerned with ridding the streets of New York from the scum that inhabit them and his taxi. His actions (and his motives) become more and more elusive. By the end of the film, amid all the bloodshed and mayhem, it has become nearly impossible to understand Travis. Scorsese's use of New York City is remarkable, with obscure angles and shots highlighting and contributing to the alienation and seediness that Travis and the audience are made to feel. Bernard Herrmann's ominous score likewise punctuates this overbearing feeling of dread and despair. Performances from now-veterans Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster all help contrast with De Niro's. Whilst Sport and Iris thrive and survive by indulging in the corruption of the city, Travis attempts to destroy this corruption, yet in doing so becomes something far more sinister. The film's ending has inspired countless debates as to its meaning, with critics and audiences seeking closure. In my opinion, this lack of closure is a perfect ending, as we are left to decide whether Travis is at all redeemable, ultimately an unanswerable question. If I have one complaint (and this is only a minor one), it is that the violence, due to the inevitabilities of time, has lost a bit of its impact. Today, you'll be hard-pressed not to find a modern mindless blockbuster that contains more hard-hitting violence and gore. Yet, the film's message (and a depressing one at that) remains as strong as it was thirty-six years ago. Must-see viewing.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"24 October 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a disturbed man. Stricken with insomnia, he decides to enrol as a taxi driver in order to pass the time. What follows is a descent into madness, brutality and vigilantism. De Niro portrays the titular protagonist\/antagonist in what can only be described as a masterpiece, both for him as an actor and for Martin Scorsese as a director. The film's intense depiction of urban decay, and Travis' equally intense reactions to this corruption, have gone down (and will continue to go down) as a milestone in cinematic history. Initially, it is relatively easy to sympathize with Bickle. He is a lonely man, lost and without purpose. After several failed attempts at socialization, he finally manages to acquire a date with a beautiful political volunteer (Cybill Shepherd). When this ends miserably, Bickle's personality takes an even more twisted turn, with him becoming increasingly concerned with ridding the streets of New York from the scum that inhabit them and his taxi. His actions (and his motives) become more and more elusive. By the end of the film, amid all the bloodshed and mayhem, it has become nearly impossible to understand Travis. Scorsese's use of New York City is remarkable, with obscure angles and shots highlighting and contributing to the alienation and seediness that Travis and the audience are made to feel. Bernard Herrmann's ominous score likewise punctuates this overbearing feeling of dread and despair. Performances from now-veterans Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster all help contrast with De Niro's. Whilst Sport and Iris thrive and survive by indulging in the corruption of the city, Travis attempts to destroy this corruption, yet in doing so becomes something far more sinister. The film's ending has inspired countless debates as to its meaning, with critics and audiences seeking closure. In my opinion, this lack of closure is a perfect ending, as we are left to decide whether Travis is at all redeemable, ultimately an unanswerable question.

(Other members of the group included the novelists Stan Barstow, John Braine, David Storey and Barry Hines and playwrights such as John Osborne and Shelagh Delaney). Their work was distinguished by a social- realist concentration on working-class life, often with a provincial setting.Sillitoe's first novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning had an immediate impact when first published in 1958 and is still regarded today as one of the key texts of the kitchen sink movement. As with a number of other kitchen sink works such as Osborne's Look Back in Anger, Braine's Room at the Top, Delaney's A Taste of Honey and Barstow's A Kind of Loving, the British cinema, which was going through a similar social-realist phase at the time, was quick to adapt the novel for the screen. Both book and film are set in the author's native Nottingham and tell the story of Arthur Seaton, a young worker in a bicycle factory. In many ways Arthur is not a particularly admirable character. He is a heavy drinker and a womaniser who is conducting an affair with Brenda, the wife of a colleague at work. His relationship with Brenda, however, does not prevent him from courting a young single woman named Doreen. Yet in Arthur's own words (a quote later made famous by the Arctic Monkeys) whatever people say I am, that's what I am not. It would be too easy to dismiss him simply as a drunken, rebellious troublemaker. Unlike his father, who was frequently unemployed during the depression of the thirties, Arthur is fortunate enough to have come into manhood at a time of economic prosperity, a time when Britons were being assured by their Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, that they had never had it so good, and is able to earn a reasonable wage by working hard. And yet, in Sillitoe's view, never had it so good was still not good enough. One of the themes of the novel is the way in which the class divisions of pre-war Britain still persisted despite the post-war economic boom. Arthur is not only angry with the System but also with his parents' generation, whom he sees as conformists, dead from the neck up. He is clearly intelligent and articulate, yet has only received a basic formal education and is unable to find anything other than mundane and repetitive factory work. His anger and resentment may stem from frustration at being unable to put his intelligence to more creative use. Sillitoe also wrote the screenplay for this film, and simplifies his story somewhat. For example, he omits Arthur's affair with another married lover, Brenda's sister Winnie this detail from the film. Shirley Anne Field as Doreen is rather older and more experienced that the innocent teenager of the novel. On the whole, however, the film remains faithful to the themes of the book. This was the first feature film directed by Karel Reisz, a Czech refugee to Britain from Nazism, who had earlier been one of the founders of the Free Cinema documentary movement. Two of his co-founders, Tony Richardson and Lindsay Anderson, also went on to work in the kitchen sink style; Richardson's work in the genre includes The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, also based on a story by Sillitoe, and Anderson's includes This Sporting Life which also stars Rachel Roberts, who plays Brenda here. The influence of Reisz's career as a documentary film-maker is evident in his use of genuine Nottingham locations, especially the scenes set in the bicycle factory which have a very documentary feel to them. Another influence is visible in the scene at the funfair where Arthur is trapped on a merry-go-round by Brenda's husband Jack, who has discovered her affair with Arthur, and two soldier friends; the menace in this scene recalls the work of Alfred Hitchcock, who also set a key scene on a merry-go-round in Strangers on a Train. In the early sixties Albert Finney was one of the rising young stars of the British acting profession, and this was his second film. (The first was Richardson's The Entertainer, also from 1960). Although he was only 24 he gives a very assured performance here, bringing out Arthur's intelligence as well as his feral, rebellious streak. This is probably a better performance than Finney's next one in Tom Jones which was to win him the first of his five Oscar nominations, but he was never going to be nominated here. British social-realism never found much favour with the Academy who probably found it too depressing and (an even greater sin in American eyes) too left-wing. There are also some good contributions from the supporting cast, too many to single them all out but Roberts particularly stands out. Brenda is married to an older man whom she does not love, and in love with a younger one who only uses her for sex. In the earlier scenes she seems hard and brassy, but is tragic and pitiable in the later ones after she finds out she is pregnant by Arthur who she knows will abandon her. Kitchen-sink realism was a fairly short-lived phenomenon; a few good examples were made in colour in the late sixties (Alfie, Kes, Up the Junction, Spring and Port Wine), but it largely died out in the seventies, although occasional attempts have been made to revive it. The finest of the genre, however, have survived to become classics of the British cinema, and along with the likes of A Kind of Loving and A Taste of Honey Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is among the foremost of these. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Alan Sillitoe was one of a number of young writers who emerged in the late fifties and sixties and who have become known as the kitchen sink school.

How is it that Carradine goes unscathed, after a vampire bite? I get that this is tongue in cheek, but come on! That's a bit much. Price and Carradine's bantering is fun, but the roles they have aren't big enough for my liking. I also got annoyed by the punk rock music. This was filmed in the U.K, and never got released theatrically in the US. Onto the storiesStory #1 The Shadmock. Raven (James Laurenson) is a lonely Shadmock, who nobody wants to date or see. He also happens to be filthy rich. George (Simon Ward) and his girlfriend Angela (Barbra Kellerman) conjure up a plan to obtain Raven's money. The plan is to make Raven fall for Angela, so Angela gets off Scot free with the money. I liked this episode quite a bit. It was original, and refreshingly unorthodox, with some really creepy atmosphere to go along with it. Raven's crippling whistle is also terrifying. I legitimately felt for the poor sap, as he clearly was in love with Angela. The ending is especially creepy, with Angela's disfigurement. I did feel that Simon doesn't show nearly enough shock at Angela's hideous appearance at the end, and kind of ruined some of the impact. But I liked this tale overall. Aside from Simon Ward, it's extremely well acted. Poor Raven. All he wanted was for Angela to love him 3.5\/5Story #2 Vampires. This is not quite as weak as the third story, but it is rather lame. Busotsky's Father is a vampire, and he doesn't realize it. He often wonders why he won't play with him during the day, and only comes out at night. The B Squad, lead by Donald Pleasence is out to get Busotky's Father. This is mostly for laughs, and it's not that funny to be honest. Donald Pleasence is great as per usual, and Britt Ekland is a sexy M.I.L.F, but it's just a lame story. The ending is extremely silly, and had me shaking my head. It's a really poor gag.2\/5Story #3 The Ghouls. Sam (Stuart Whitman) is a movie director, looking for the perfect place to film his movie. He comes across a decrepit village, which is completely isolated from society. The Innkeeper is rather spooky, and he meets a peculiar young woman named Luna. The village is filled with ghouls that have a thirst for the flesh. This was such a stupid and insulting story. Not only was it moronic, but very boring. It was a complete and utter snooze fest, and I had trouble paying attention. The ending is predictable and lame as well. By far the weakest of the trilogy 0\/5Final Thoughts Aside from a good first story, and the presence of Vincent Price, and John Carradine? There isn't anything to see here, really.

He and his wife have separated, and Baxter is not a believer, but peculiar things keep happening around him. The people he cares about die, and there seems to be no end to it. I enjoyed the second prequel (I mean sequel, whatever you wanna call it) more than the first movie, but it wasn't exactly clamoring for another installment. But we got one, and 4 more crappy DTV sequels, and even a remake as well. In fact&#x85; another movie about Amityville is heading to theaters later on this year. This was filmed in 3D. Naturally, it doesn't have any effect while watching it on DVD, but that was the big selling point back then. This movie never bored me, but it's inexplicably stupid. How much has to commence, for Tony Robert's character to realize that he should get the heck out of there? Everything weird happens when he moved there. It things happened to me like they did in this movie, for example. A haunted elevator, my daughter died, and my partner got burned alive, by being trapped in a car accident. I wouldn't wanna investigate the paranormal activities. I would be long gone! I also didn't have any proper heroes. Almost everybody in this movie is virtually unlikable. Tony Roberts plays a selfish imbecile, who is arrogantly oblivious to everything. I had no sympathy for him. Tess Harper (Nancy Baxter) is quite pretentious and claims Roberts is egotistical in this movie, to her own daughter. The subplot between her and Tony Roberts grated me. I understood that warning her daughter to stay away from the house was needed, but she was just as bad. Lori Loughlin plays it low key. It wasn't a great performance, but she's beautiful to look at. Meg Ryan's cheeky charm was just great. She had a very small part as Loughlin's friend, and she gives the best performance(!) Not much gore here. The burning sequence is harsh and quite disturbing, but the laughable looking skeleton hinders some of the impact. We also get the fly routine from the original, and a hilariously dated looking creature at the end, who spews a fireball. The effects were quite shoddyFinal Thoughts Never boring, but too stupid to enjoy fully.

He and his wife have separated, and Baxter is not a believer, but peculiar things keep happening around him. The people he cares about die, and there seems to be no end to it. I enjoyed the second prequel (I mean sequel, whatever you wanna call it) more than the first movie, but it wasn't exactly clamoring for another installment. But we got one, and 4 more crappy DTV sequels, and even a remake as well. In fact&#x85; another movie about Amityville is heading to theaters later on this year. This was filmed in 3D. Naturally, it doesn't have any effect while watching it on DVD, but that was the big selling point back then. This movie never bored me, but it's inexplicably stupid. How much has to commence, for Tony Robert's character to realize that he should get the heck out of there? Everything weird happens when he moved there. It things happened to me like they did in this movie, for example. A haunted elevator, my daughter died, and my partner got burned alive, by being trapped in a car accident. I wouldn't wanna investigate the paranormal activities. I would be long gone! I also didn't have any proper heroes. Almost everybody in this movie is virtually unlikable. Tony Roberts plays a selfish imbecile, who is arrogantly oblivious to everything. I had no sympathy for him. Tess Harper (Nancy Baxter) is quite pretentious and claims Roberts is egotistical in this movie, to her own daughter. The subplot between her and Tony Roberts grated me. I understood that warning her daughter to stay away from the house was needed, but she was just as bad. Lori Loughlin plays it low key. It wasn't a great performance, but she's beautiful to look at. Meg Ryan's cheeky charm was just great. She had a very small part as Loughlin's friend, and she gives the best performance(!) Not much gore here. The burning sequence is harsh and quite disturbing, but the laughable looking skeleton hinders some of the impact. We also get the fly routine from the original, and a hilariously dated looking creature at the end, who spews a fireball. The effects were quite shoddyFinal Thoughts Never boring, but too stupid to enjoy fully.

(Spare me!) Believe me, this film's premise definitely sounds so much more enticing than it really is.Since it takes a whole 45 minutes before the first murder actually occurs, the viewer is, instead, expected to be satisfied by a literal barrage of backstage bickering from a bunch of 2-bit strippers (with a token cat-fight thrown in for good measure) - And even some mediocre bumps & grinds done in a slapdash fashion on stage didn't cut the mustard enough to hold my undivided attention for very long.In Lady Of Burlesque, actress Barbara Stanwyck plays Dixie Daisy, a stereotypical stripper (or, is it a hooker with transferable skills) who, though jaded-to-the-core, naturally, has a heart of the purest gold.
