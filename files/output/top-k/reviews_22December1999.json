True, I was around six when Andy died. But somehow this strange man was able to affect both my work and outlook. So needless to say I was looking forward to this film. And I was not disappointed.Critics complain that while engaging, this film does not let the viewer in on who exactly Kaufman was. It's simple there was no real Andy Kaufman. He was socially inept, utterly brilliant, and a strange and distant individual. His sense of humor (if he even had one) was not for everyone to understand. THAT WAS THE POINT. So why should a film spoil the mystery? MAN ON THE MOON was as an homage to Andy, NOT an explanation, and far better than those dull, lifeless documentaries on E! or comedy central in which uninteresting comedians try to explain why Andy was brilliant. It's common knowledge that explaining a joke renders it humorous (a notion that Andy toyed with in his Foreign Man routine, remember?)True, some facts were altered for dramatic purposes (though the truth is just as interesting), or maybe just necessity, but the base story is still pretty accurate. Some of the more humorous moments in Kaufman's career were not mentioned (i.e. his stints on Johnny Carson and David Letterman, his work with performance artist Laurie Anderson, his street corner preaching). But lets face it, everything couldn't and didn't need to be included. The film is capable of capturing the essence of Kaufman's world. If you want to see everything Kaufman did, find a recording of it and watch that.Carrey is brilliant as Kaufman. Some call it an imitation, though that seems overly simplified and absurd. That was an imitation along the lines of Geoffrey Rush in SHINE, or Hilary Swank in BOYS DON'T CRY, or Richard Farnsworth in THE STRAIGHT STORY. Sure, Carrey observes and uses the many Kaufman quirks without a fault, but his observation goes far beyond what any other actor seems capable of. Carrey is Andy Kaufman. So many seem unwilling to admit that Carrey can act.Taken on it's own, MAN ON THE MOON is a magical, funny, and wonderful film.

When he burst on the scene there was no one like him and the world wasn't sure how to react to his humour sometimes. We would get used to the cute immigrant character, and then he'd be someone else.He never wanted to stand still in his career, going from one stunt to the next, and like Rick Nelson's lament in Garden Party, irritated at those who only wanted him to be Latka. He didn't want to do the show Taxi and agreed to do it only to get his own special - which the network balked at even airing as it wasn't mainstream enough. Now his kind of originality is more appreciated and so the time was right for making a movie celebrating this misunderstood and previously almost forgotten comic.Andy's later stage act of wrestling women, and the limited role in Taxi, did not make him into a superstar like Jim Carrey is now. He did not play by the rules and so showbiz did not reward him, nor was his range as broad or appealing as Carrey's, but he had a gentle and quirky vision of wanting to affect his audiences. It is fitting that Carrey recognized Andy's genius and chose to play this role, as they both started out with dreams of being famous entertainers, and one of them didn't quite reach the heights, but left a puzzling body of work that this film attempts to explore.As a true homage to Andy, Jim Carrey brings him to life for a whole new generation. And those who did follow Andy Kaufman during his career will shed a tear at the behind-the-scenes look at how hard it was for him to maintain artistic integrity in a business that wanted him to be like everyone else.Because this movie just came out today, I will not discuss anything that might spoil the experience for moviegoers. Thus my remarks must remain incomplete and I am chiefly here to say please see this movie if you like biographies of strong-willed but misunderstood people, or if you love Jim Carrey, or are at all interested, even mildly, in Andy Kaufman and what he was all about. You will laugh and cry, and be uncomfortable. It will not leave you unmoved.I also want to call your attention to director Milos Forman's other movie Hair; if you loved it you will appreciate Man on the Moon . Hair was a very personal retelling of the famous stage play, and Forman brought his own grace and style to it.Man on the Moon makes sparing but careful use of REM's beautiful song, which is featured in the TV ads. It is touching to reflect that this song was written about Andy years ago by someone who wanted to keep his name alive, and only now on seeing the movie will the song take on its full meaning to listeners who didn't know who Andy was.Like Hair, It is an amazingly executed movie. I fear that Jim Carrey's performance may not win an Oscar nod because they generally turn up their noses at impersonations (although Ben Kingsley was rewarded for his impression of Gandhi). But Carrey deserves a nomination because he truly captures Andy Kaufman, the driven man in motion. The material never drags; rather it is a tale respectfully told of a life lived like a meteorite. It might have been filmed in a number of ways - more comic, more tragic, but Forman shows all the complexities of the human being behind the public persona. A beauty, well worth seeing, and if there are flaws in the telling, as in Titanic, they don't matter because it's a real charmer.

The performances are outstanding, but it plays more like a highlight show that an introspective.First off, Jim Carrey is great. You get the feeling if there's one person who might get Andy Kaufman, it's Jim Carrey. He seems to hit all the characters just right. Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda is the best of the supporting cast, and there are a number of interesting guest cameos of people playing themselves.The only problem is that all the movie seems to do is show you his various acts in succession. There's no attempt to make Kaufman out to really be anything other than the actor he was, no attempt to see what was behind the characters. Milos Forman fails to make anything out of Kaufman, to suggest anything of his persona. This is strikingly different than his last movie, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and this technique lacks a little. There are a couple of various, really obvious attempts to show everyone's aware he's a little nuts, not no real probe into his physche. There's also a somewhat mysterious ending, something in the true Kaufman spirit.The bottom line is basically, if you thought Andy Kaufman was funny, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, it will likely appear a bit hollow, though good for a laugh. Still, it seems the movie could have somehow been a bit better. After all, if the filmmaker's didn't stick to the facts, as the opening suggests, why not take some guesses into his inner thoughts?

Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda is the best of the supporting cast, and there are a number of interesting guest cameos of people playing themselves.The only problem is that all the movie seems to do is show you his various acts in succession. There's no attempt to make Kaufman out to really be anything other than the actor he was, no attempt to see what was behind the characters. Milos Forman fails to make anything out of Kaufman, to suggest anything of his persona. This is strikingly different than his last movie, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and this technique lacks a little. There are a couple of various, really obvious attempts to show everyone's aware he's a little nuts, not no real probe into his physche. There's also a somewhat mysterious ending, something in the true Kaufman spirit.The bottom line is basically, if you thought Andy Kaufman was funny, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, it will likely appear a bit hollow, though good for a laugh. Still, it seems the movie could have somehow been a bit better.

Conrad Timothy Hutton (French Kiss) very deservingly won an Oscar for the part of the surviving son.  Conrad was a very sensitive young man, who learned how to cope with depression after the death of his brother,  and was trying to learn how to deal with the complete lack of communication between him and his mother Mary Tyler Moore (Flirting with Disaster).      His mother, Beth, was a perfectionist. Her house was immaculate. The drawers were perfect. She made life difficult on herself and everyone around her. Such as for the funeral of her son, she asked her husband, Calvin Donald Sutherland (Without Limits)  to wear a different pair of shoes than the ones he had picked. All she did was for appearance, what others would think! I wonder how Robert Redford (A River Runs Through It, The Legend of Bagger Vance) decided to pick that story for a movie. Brilliant!

He did this in a very tight budget.   This is a classic and timeless movie; Redford's first master piece. This movie will endure the test of time. I recommend it! This movie scores a ten!

He grows human-like personality, he tries to find out what a joke is and why something is funny, he learns to make wooden carvings, but yet most of the people around him are more robotic then him, with the exception of some of the members of his loving family. And he soon learns the pain of being immortal. The issue of people judging others by their differences, growing old and dying, mixed marriages, even slavery is felt in this movie. Williams does a fine job as our lead character, as does Sam Neill and Embeth Davidtz. But the movie does drag on a bit longer then it should have, so some younger viewers got bored. (and so did some older viewers) Since it's aimed as a family film, it's 131 minutes could have had a half hour trimming. And although there is your usual Robin Williams humor, the movie is not really a comedy.

This movie is an excellent war film, but it is much more than that -- it grapples with questions of morality, divinity, mortality, and love.The main question of the movie (many questions in this movie but little answers, which is great -- leaves the audience to solve them) deals with the nature of war Is it in our nature to destroy ourselves? Does nature destroy itself intentionally? (Why does the land contend with the sea?; Nature is cruel, Starros, look at the way the vines twine around these trees, devouring everything.) Does nature want us to destroy ourselves through war? (Does our ruin benefit the Earth?) Essentially the soldiers ask, is there any purpose to the madness of war? If there is a higher power, and he's (or she's) truly divine, couldn't he put a stop to it, and if he doesn't maybe he has a reason, maybe there's a purpose to it -- but what?Another interesting question put forth by this movie deals with how humanity has separated itself into different cultures. Pvt. Witt, when he looks at the natives in New Guinea, sees a life, a peaceful life, he wants to be a part of but realizes he never can (like when he went AWOL among the natives and was later captured and made a stretcher-bearer). This is very evident when native woman he was nonchalantly talking to while he was AWOL told him she was scared of him because he looked army.At first he sees these people as pure because he thinks they don't engage in serious conflicts; he sees them as basically almost existing in a utopian society. But later, when he goes back to a native village, he realizes that they have problems, too, after seeing two native men engaging in a serious argument, a child with boils on its back, and a row of skulls in a hut. They have problems, but on a smaller scale and they're as close to nature as you get, so maybe, just maybe, the whole war is a part of nature -- but why?We were a family, how'd it break up and come apart so that now we're turned against each other, each standing in the other's light? How'd we lose the good that was given us, let it slip away, scattered and careless? What's keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory?Why can't nature be divine, why can't we be divine? How'd we separate ourselves? What's the purpose of this war?As you can see from the previous quote, much of the dialogue in this movie sounds like poetry. This is a movie you can put in the VCR (don't get me wrong, the camera work is great) and use as background noise because the characters have so much to say, and they do so very eloquently. Unlike most war movies, which usually have a single or no narrator, pretty much every main character has something insightful to say.I have not even scratched the surface of this movie. It has so many questions to ask and things to say. Basically, the bottom line is If you're a teenage Rambo fan, you'll be disappointed, but if you liked Platoon and don't mind a little bit of poetry, you'll love The Thin Red Line -- and that's the bottom line.By the way, when you first watch TRL, you'll most likely think Pvt. Witt (who is my favorite character) is the main narrator, but this is not so. In reality the most insightful of the bunch is Pvt. Train (he's the big blond guy), who will probably seem the shallowist out of all the characters on your initial viewing, but he actually asks most of the important questions about the nature of god and the nature of nature and the nature of manDarkness, light, strife and love, are they the workings of one mind? The features of the same face? Oh my soul, let me be in you now, look through my eyes, at the things you made.I really liked Saving Private Ryan, but I loved TRL -- it should have got best picture, but unfortunately it came out against stiff competition and good marketing by Speilberg.

Does nature want us to destroy ourselves through war? (Does our ruin benefit the Earth?) Essentially the soldiers ask, is there any purpose to the madness of war? If there is a higher power, and he's (or she's) truly divine, couldn't he put a stop to it, and if he doesn't maybe he has a reason, maybe there's a purpose to it -- but what?Another interesting question put forth by this movie deals with how humanity has separated itself into different cultures. Pvt. Witt, when he looks at the natives in New Guinea, sees a life, a peaceful life, he wants to be a part of but realizes he never can (like when he went AWOL among the natives and was later captured and made a stretcher-bearer). This is very evident when native woman he was nonchalantly talking to while he was AWOL told him she was scared of him because he looked army.At first he sees these people as pure because he thinks they don't engage in serious conflicts; he sees them as basically almost existing in a utopian society. But later, when he goes back to a native village, he realizes that they have problems, too, after seeing two native men engaging in a serious argument, a child with boils on its back, and a row of skulls in a hut. They have problems, but on a smaller scale and they're as close to nature as you get, so maybe, just maybe, the whole war is a part of nature -- but why?We were a family, how'd it break up and come apart so that now we're turned against each other, each standing in the other's light? How'd we lose the good that was given us, let it slip away, scattered and careless? What's keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory?Why can't nature be divine, why can't we be divine? How'd we separate ourselves? What's the purpose of this war?As you can see from the previous quote, much of the dialogue in this movie sounds like poetry. This is a movie you can put in the VCR (don't get me wrong, the camera work is great) and use as background noise because the characters have so much to say, and they do so very eloquently. Unlike most war movies, which usually have a single or no narrator, pretty much every main character has something insightful to say.I have not even scratched the surface of this movie. It has so many questions to ask and things to say. Basically, the bottom line is If you're a teenage Rambo fan, you'll be disappointed, but if you liked Platoon and don't mind a little bit of poetry, you'll love The Thin Red Line -- and that's the bottom line.By the way, when you first watch TRL, you'll most likely think Pvt. Witt (who is my favorite character) is the main narrator, but this is not so. In reality the most insightful of the bunch is Pvt. Train (he's the big blond guy), who will probably seem the shallowist out of all the characters on your initial viewing, but he actually asks most of the important questions about the nature of god and the nature of nature and the nature of manDarkness, light, strife and love, are they the workings of one mind? The features of the same face? Oh my soul, let me be in you now, look through my eyes, at the things you made.I really liked Saving Private Ryan, but I loved TRL -- it should have got best picture, but unfortunately it came out against stiff competition and good marketing by Speilberg.

Yes, Aliens II is by far the best among the titles I cited, but they all have a similar structure and mentality.  Eraser features two of the best known actors in Hollywood. Schwarzenneger, the most famous personality (and always improving character), against the talented, varied, fantastic actor that goes by the name of James Caan. The big man has yet a long way to go in order to achieve a flawless or impressive (such as when he shot Conan the Barbarian) performance, and James Caan is like Pacino and De Niro - absolutely great. He really can be a nasty, mean person - even if other characters are meaner (the under-secretary, for instance...).  These two actors could have distorted the whole picture, pulling it apart in the directions  they wanted but they didn´t. They are part of it, although their characters command  actions and other characters. Arnold is always a true professional, specially by the side of an enfant terrible like Caan.

Don Johnson (Harry Madox) looks a little like Bret the Hitman Hart in the movie (with short hair). I never liked him in Miami Vice and don't really like him in this movie either. He does however play his character well (womaniser, good looks etc..and is the movie an ad for cigarattes because i counted at least 30 times he lit up in the movie).Virginia Madsen (Dolly Harshaw) is the manipulative schemer, psycho who once she has her claws into Madox won't let go.  She is also a good looking lady (and plenty of nude scenes for those that like the flesh in movies).  She got annoying as the movie progressed (but that is probably demonstration of how well she played her role, I think you are meant to hate her).Jennifer Connelly ( Gloria Harper), there is something about this girl.

The problem with the movie is that I got the impression there were some serious issues that were being preached throughout through Moore's character and the stereotypical male co-stars. Equality in the military, women are as good as men, women lead saves the day, take women seriously in combat etc.If you think about those aspects too much, you tend to see the stereotypical characters and the movie loses its appeal.Demi Moore plays Lt Jordan O'Neil who seems to have a mix of qualities ranging from Ripley (aliens), Mayo (Officer and a gentlemen and MAverick (Top Gun).  Moore is physically attractive but also has bulked up for this role.  Her acting is not really pushed here, however she does malke a passable Navy Seal.I liked Viggo Mortensen who plays the role of Master Chief John Urgayle. He is the consumate prick of a master sergeant, just like the really can be. He pushes O'Neil all the way whilst really having a growing inner respect and liking for her.  Unfortunatley the ending of the movie spoils the relationship that had been built until then.  It was too warm and fuzzy and became the women proves she can handle it and gets respect of superior finish that was inevitable.Anne Bancroft as Sen Lillia De Haven is also good. The manipulative politician uses O'Neil for political gain and sells out as quickly as she bought in.  Again the disappointment in the movie came in the win O'Neil gets from De Haven ( I won't spoil the plot other than to say for such a tough Senator she caved in like a deck of cards)The other main character is O'Neils love interest Royce (played by Jason Beghe who I last saw in Cab to Canada).  Another stereotypical male who doubts at first, becomes a convert and then supports O'Neil all the way. I like Beghe's acting and am sure that he will have a few more semi-leading roles in the near future.Overall the movie was entertaining and worth watching.  I caution you not to read too much into the messages that the movie delivers.  To do that would require you to take the whole movie too seriously and it quite simply isn't strong enough dramatically for this to work.  As an action flick, thumbs up.

It is far too mature.  There were times when the audience laughed so hard one could not hear the lines which followed and there were moments when tears came.  Embeth Davitz reminded me very much of Annabella Sciorra, who co-starred on an equal plane and with equal talent to perennial leading man, Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come.  Bicentennial Man is nothing new in terms of plot.  It is Pinocchio, but it is a mature Pinocchio, whose humanity is not so quick to obtain.  The film spans four generations, beginning in 2005.  Other than softcore robotics, there is little in the way of science fiction and none of the imaginatronic backdrops that the most recent Trek and Star Wars films have spawned.   Science fiction is purely the McGuffin as Hitchcock used to say.  It is the reason the characters interact, but not intrinsic to the basic elements of how the story unfolds. The tale might just as well have been about a working man aspiring to aristocracy.  There are a few plot holes and letdowns, though.  For instance, android Williams searches the world for twenty years on foot for another sentient anomaly like himself, only to find the only possibility, a hip-swaying, jazzed-out femdroid back where his journey began.  Meanwhile, Davitz's dual role as Little Miss and her granddaughter, Portia, are subject to the ill-conceived scripting of having them both appear alive at the same time, so that there is no possibility that the one might be the reincarnation of the other, who loved Andrew beyond the depths of his positronic brain.  There is also some mistoying with the presumably villainous robotics corporation owner, who never really develops into evility beyond a voiced desire to disassemble the robot for fear its emotions might affect sales.  All in all, though, it is a warm and brilliant film, which tickles the funny bone and tears at the heart.
