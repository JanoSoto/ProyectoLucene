All alone at home, 2am, in the dark, still exhausted from the end of this movie.. Face a teary, snotty mess, no chance of falling asleep before watching some Monty Python or anything mindless and funny..The reason I do it is because as crummy as I feel, I truly enjoyed this movie. I get a slight lump in my throat every now and then when movies or TV shows have sad scenes in them, but actual tears are much harder for me to produce. The only other movies I can think of where I've seriously cried have been Spielberg's masterpiece Schindler's list and Bay's not-as-great Armageddon (stop judging me, it's a guilty pleasure!). But lets forget about Armageddon, for the sake of my point.The reason this movie is so touching is because it combines a great plot that's based on true events; likable, yet imperfect (i.e. realistic) characters; pretty good writing and absolutely sublime acting. If Robert De Niro isn't one of the greatest actors in history, I don't know who is. I'm personally not a huge fan of Robin Williams, but even he was really good in this.I'm not going to really say anything about the plot, except that it works, and it is based on a non-fictional book by Oliver Sacks. After a moment of research it has become clear to me that the director has modified the story quite a bit and renamed all the characters. Still, judging by Sacks' website, at least De Niro's character was a real person, as were many of the other characters. The doctor's romantic interest seems to have been 100% fictional, in a Patch Adams sort of way, which is a tad disappointing..(luckily that and Robin Williams seem to be the only noticeable similarities between the two movies)All in all, 9\/10, mostly because the story wasn't 100% accurate.

The second time i watched it(an year later), i didn't understand why it was voted the Greatest Courtroom Drama ahead of 12 Angry Men. So i decided to read the book by Harper Lee before watching the movie next time. It is one of the finest piece of Literature i've read and the movie is equally good.The movie is narrated by Scout, played by Mary Badham. Scout is the younger child of Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. The movie focuses on the childhood days of Jem and Scout and what kind of a man their father was. The movie is set in the backdrop of a depression-hit Alabama of the 1930s where black people were subject to prejudice, ill-treatment and the laws of the state that were biased. A major part of the movie is about the kids Jem and Scout, until Atticus Finch dares to take up the case of a 'colored' man wrongly convicted of raping a white-woman. Atticus Finch is a father who is unmatched when it comes to taking care of his motherless children. He holds no discrimination against the 'colored' race and forces(after pampering sessions end) his daughter to apologize to their domestic servant; he also invites a 'colored' boy to dine with them and advices his daughter not to ridicule the way in which the kid ate. When Atticus Finch actually tries to prove the convicted man innocent, he gets threatened by the complainant's father and is despised by the people of the town. The man spits on Atticus' face. Normally you'd expect a six-foot plus tall man with a broad frame to strike the other man down but Atticus takes his handkerchief and wipes off the spittle. Such an inspiring character he is and AFI rightly called him the Greatest Hero of all-time.

The second time i watched it(an year later), i didn't understand why it was voted the Greatest Courtroom Drama ahead of 12 Angry Men. So i decided to read the book by Harper Lee before watching the movie next time. It is one of the finest piece of Literature i've read and the movie is equally good.The movie is narrated by Scout, played by Mary Badham. Scout is the younger child of Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. The movie focuses on the childhood days of Jem and Scout and what kind of a man their father was. The movie is set in the backdrop of a depression-hit Alabama of the 1930s where black people were subject to prejudice, ill-treatment and the laws of the state that were biased. A major part of the movie is about the kids Jem and Scout, until Atticus Finch dares to take up the case of a 'colored' man wrongly convicted of raping a white-woman. Atticus Finch is a father who is unmatched when it comes to taking care of his motherless children. He holds no discrimination against the 'colored' race and forces(after pampering sessions end) his daughter to apologize to their domestic servant; he also invites a 'colored' boy to dine with them and advices his daughter not to ridicule the way in which the kid ate. When Atticus Finch actually tries to prove the convicted man innocent, he gets threatened by the complainant's father and is despised by the people of the town. The man spits on Atticus' face. Normally you'd expect a six-foot plus tall man with a broad frame to strike the other man down but Atticus takes his handkerchief and wipes off the spittle. Such an inspiring character he is and AFI rightly called him the Greatest Hero of all-time.

On the outside world, Karl befriends a young boy and that will change Karl's life.This is the film that drove Billy Bob Thornton to stardom. He is wonderful as Karl.

The romantic story isn't original, but this is not a bad thing. Cameron re-invents the story to fit the time period and its characters. Everything fits perfectly, with nothing ever seeming contrived or awkward. Jack's immediate interest in Rose, and Rose likewise, is completely understandable. She is suffering emotionally, and Jack is there to support her. Themes from Romeo and Juliet are included, such as Rose being an upper-classman, and Jack being lower class. But the emotional connection between Rose and Jack is almost palpable, and this fuels the film's first two hours. We watch the trials of Jack and Rose, and as they overcome them, the ship comes closer to destiny. With a ship as large as the Titanic was, it was destined to crash. And of course, the ship isn't stocked with enough lifeboats to accommodate the 2,200 passengers. In the end, over 700 people survive, while the rest drown, freeze, or commit suicide. The resolution of the film, after the ship's gone under, is just as powerful as anything else in the movie. It ends rather surprisingly, with a touching symbolic conclusion. Most films end predictably, or inappropriately, but Titanic ends just on the right note. In fact, the symbolism of the final scene is so perfect, that many people will contemplate over the meaning for months. The film does end rather depressingly, and unexpectedly, but when you think about it, it couldn't have ended any other way. All the questions are answered, and we are left with a weak smile due to the intense situation we were just put through. The Titanic sinking is an emotional roller coaster, with many more realistic deaths than any Independence Day. The death scenes are so realistic, that you find yourself caring for every single passenger. Cameron never compromises the integrity of his film, and the deaths of the passengers is never overemphasized. He doesn't linger on each death, but takes it as it comes to show us the realism without trying to force emotions out of the audience. But emotions do show, and almost anyone will find themselves wiping away a few tears. Hats off for this masterpiece..!

In Top Gun director Tony Scott's half-baked thriller The Fan, De Niro creates another psycho but one with greater sympathy. As Gil Renard, De Niro plays a Willie Loman-like knife salesman whose obsession with baseball in general and the San Francisco Giants in particular takes him over the edge. When the Giants play $40-million to obtain the services of Atlanta superstar slugger Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes of White Men Can't Jump), Gil gives new meaning to fan worship. He thinks that Bobby can solve all of the Giants' problems. During a radio call-in show, Gil defends Bobby from the barbs of catty talk show host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin).The plot of The Fan alternates between the lives of Gil and Bobby. Gil's sales sink to the point that he finds himself out of work with the knife company that his father formed. Nevertheless, Gil's descent into self-destruction isn't the only one. Bobby shows up in the Giants' locker room and learns to his chagrin that he will suit up as number 33 instead of his lucky number 11. As it turns out, rival Giants' outfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro of License to Kill) wears number 11 and refuses to relinquish it for less than a half-a-million bucks. Their first day in the outfield, Primo and Bobby collide in pursuit of a fly ball. During the collision, Bobby loses his good luck necklace with the number eleven on it. Afterward, Bobby falls into a batting slump. He starts striking out on a regular basis. Before long the fans are booing him every time that he steps up to home plate. Everybody except Gil hates him and Gil decides to give Bobby a little help. Veteran action director Tony Scott pulls out every cinematic trick to propel The Fan along to a thrilling conclusion. Unfortunately, the film loses momentum in the last half hour because predictability paralyzes it. By that time, Gil has turned against Bobby. The gratuitous, blood-squib squirting finale comes as less of a thrill and more of a thud in a film that is ultimately downbeat. In other words, you won't feel chipper after to watch it. Robert De Niro's psycho character earns a little sympathy because his son in the film loves him. It is difficult for audiences to hate a villain who can elicit sympathy from another character. Their troubled father-son relationship shows a human side of De Niro's Gil Renard so he never degenerates completely into a toxically overblown monster. Instead, he is a man who paranoia and poor luck undermines him and takes him into the danger zone. Wesley Snipes brings a virile athletic presence to the role of Bobby Rayburn. Ellen Barkin hovers on the sidelines as a tabloid-minded sports announcer, but her role appears to have gotten lost on the editing room floor. Sorry, guys, no nudity here either. The Fan is a must see for De Niro fans, but if you're not up for foul language and the grim side of the human psyche, this R-rated effort may be out of your league.
