His brother worked at a videostore and brought home the Rushmore screener, so luckily I got a chance to see it long before it was released on video.The first time I saw it I was amused at its quirks and catchy dialogue, but didn't think much more. After a second viewing I began to really catch the off the cuff almost 'inside' humour, and I laughed through the whole film. Now I make a point of it to watch the film at least once a month. Wes Anderson protrays each character in such an endearing matter, and almost reverses the roles of the children with the adults, making the kids address each other with manifestos and cordial invitations, and making the adults (mostly bloom), behave like teenagers.Bill Murrays role to say the least, is timeless, and Jason Schwartzmann performs beyond his mere 18 during filming. A Cameo by Luke Wilson proves Wes Anderson's knack to incorporate friends into each of his films, and scene changes of act one, two, three give the film a sincere and almost innocent flow. As though Anderson wrote the film in his highschool drama class.I feel Rushmore is comedy for the intelligent, as you really have to feel out the characters to truly appreciate the countless one liners and silly 'real life' scenerios. Rushmore is truly a classic and will surely achieve its cult status further in the years to come. And with a staggering musical selection to its credit, its soundtrack may just do the same.
