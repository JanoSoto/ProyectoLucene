I was expecting the worst (especially since I  had originally heard that Arnie was to star) but I was pleasantly surprised. Remaking such an icon is a big ask at the best of times, and Burton does his best, bringing  his typical dark edge to the film, but he apparently had to battle the studio every inch of the way, and the interference shows in the lack of overall cohesion.That being said, the film has many great aspects. Danny Elfman, as always, excels with his score, and the opening title music is superb (turn it up LOUD!); this is no mean feat since the POTA1 score by the great Jerry Goldsmith is one of THE great film scores.If for no other reason, this film is worth seeing for Tim Roth's bravura performance. He steals the picture as the ape general, Thade, imbuing the character (and the excellent makeup) with a performance of such mailicious psycopathy that he'd have undoubtedly been nominated for an Oscar it he had been playing a character in a gangster film.Mark Wahlberg is a likeable screen presence and getting better, though hardly a 'great' actor, but with talent like Roth and Bonham Carter alongside him, even in the ape makeup they tend to dominate. He's a somewhat stolid performer and as noted elsewhere, he pretty much plays the angry-intense thing most of the time, but that's basically all he has to do here, and the real stars are the apes anyway.Design, makeup and SFX are great, much lusher and more detailed than the rather spartan California look of the original. Some people were obviously very disappointed by the ending, and there's no way even Burton could have topped the original in that respect. There's a lot of humour too, and some very funny references to the original (Chuck Heston's uncredited cameo is great).No, it's not the greatest sci-fi film ever made, and no, it's obviously not even the film Tim Burton wanted to make, but in spite of all the fiddling and the disappointing aspects, it's still a diverting and often entertaining watch. I've certainly seen MUCH worse.

Every film, no matter how good the story, the directing or the effects rises and falls with the quality of actors and the degree to which they are believable. In this film, it is apparent, that all of the actors deliver great performances. There is really nothing else to be said about the acting, for one cannot go and analyze character depth in this film, for the characters as they are presented, are quite shallow. There is some information on some of the characters, but their characteristics as I might describe them here, would have to be based mostly on their actions and doing that would really screw up your viewing experience.Another really great thing about this film, is it's story, which really is not that special at all when you look at it in retrospective. The story, is basically the typical robbery gone bad, but in this case, the way in which it is told (with a lot flashbacks) increases the excitement and produces not only great tension within the characters, but also within the viewer. Apart from that, the flashbacks also enable Tarantino to give this very thrilling film a lighter and funnier touch. So the flashbacks are really multidimensional here. They increase the tension, they relieve the tension and they provide the film with a lighter touch.All of the aspects above are brilliantly captured by Tarantino's ingenious though simple usage of the camera. In keeping the movements limited and rather simple, he manages to keep the viewer close to the story and the events. By doing that, he succeeds in producing maximum thrill with a minimum of effects.Considering the relatively low budget, the rather simple story and the minimum of effects, I think Reservoir Dogs is a really amazing product and I am not the only one. A lot of people seemed (and still seem) to agree with me on that one. Not only did Tarantino receive a lot of hail for this work, but he also managed to get many more of his idea's realized on film. The climax of Tarantino's career (which is not over yet, mind you) would come in 1994 with Pulp Fiction, which he co-wrote, directed and starred in. After that Tarantino's work (as far as writing and directing is concerned) became of less quality. First he would make a segment for the film Four Rooms and after that he would star in and partially write the still good genre classic From Dusk &#145;till Dawn. Following those films, he made Curdled (writing only) and later Jackie Brown, which was his last directorial offering. That film became something of a disappointment, for it did not have the typical Tarantino style and I ask all of you &#145;How could it have if Tarantino had neither written the original story nor starred in it?' One can conclude that, although on average Tarantino's work is of good quality, his films following Pulp Fiction have been of lesser quality than his work before that very same film and one can only hope, Tarantino will manage to shine again with his next project, called Kill Bill. I, for one, am very excited about that film, because the title is catchy, the actors have potential and it is written and directed by the master himself Quentin Tarantino. I must add though, that I am excited DESPITE. I am excited about Kill Bill despite the fact that Quentin does not have an acting part the film and I am excited despite the fact that I thought the trailer did not look very promising.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 January 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film draws ones attentionReservoir Dogs is astonishing in so many ways, it is hard to find a beginning, which in this case are the actors.

The movie was clumsy and boring to a point that it was almost clear to me that Coppola wanted desperately to make his trilogy without having a clue of what he was doing.

Maybe Coppola was trying to take the quote from Alfred Hitchcock a bit too literally, when he said that style in film is to plagiarise yourself. Godfather III is a recollection of scenes we saw before in a different outfit, adding some cheap cosa nostra crap that did not work, like the fake set-up scene with the helicopter. This is the moment where by unbelievable coincidence the Godfather and Sonny's son came out without a scratch. This is not the same kind of realism I saw in I and II.

The Abyss, though, is another matter and a movie I've always considered among the most overrated I've seen.On the one hand, we've got this great premise. An oil drilling team headed by Ed Harris has been enlisted to participate in a search and rescue operation involving a downed nuclear submarine. They're teamed up with Navy Seals (one of whom, in particular, is supremely paranoid), but when disaster strikes from above, they've got to work together to survive in the underwater habitat, but the Seals seem unwilling to correspond. To make matters interesting, strange lights deep in the nearby abyss indicate the possibility of alien life. Question is, are they friendly or hostile?Better question, do I even care? I've seen both the theatrical and director's edition of the film and the latter is certainly not an improvement over the former. James Cameron's always been a self-indulgent filmmaker, but he often makes good use of the running time. But rather than actually paying focus to the intriguing situation the characters find themselves in, Cameron chooses to play the premise as an underwater survival flick.This means he places action above characters and plot. I can't even begin to mention how frustrating it is that for all the wondrous possibilities of the premise, we instead have to waste time with repeated standoffs between the oil drillers and the Navy Seals. I might have found such moments tense if I even gave a rat's ass about the characters, but aside from Harris ad Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, everyone in the cast is a clichéd loser, Michael Biehn playing the predictable unpredictable psycho and some other guy who's obviously there for comic relief but only makes good on maybe two chuckles.As a love story, Harris and Mastratonio have a strong rapport that keeps parts of the movie afloat, but once again, too much of the movie's attention is shifted to those standoffs. It's only in the last forty minutes the pace finally picks up when the characters I cared about most have to face some pretty challenging decisions.Harris' odyssey into the alien world is visually spectacular, but I kept thinking, shouldn't the movie have done this earlier? Shouldn't it have explored this alien civilization with more detail and attention? Instead, we get a half-assed war is bad message and a deus ex machina climax. Most people I know agree it's rather cheesy that the hero is saved by the aliens, but I find the extra conclusion in the director's edition just as weak, when the movie turns into a possible end of the world flick. Wasn't this whole film about oil drillers and Navy Seals trying to survive in an underwater habitat just about fifteen minutes before? When it finally gets to the material I'm interested in, Cameron takes it in a direction that's out-of-balance with much of what came before it.If you're fans of Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, it might be worth checking out, but it disappointed much on virtually every other level.

I might have found such moments tense if I even gave a rat's ass about the characters, but aside from Harris ad Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, everyone in the cast is a clichéd loser, Michael Biehn playing the predictable unpredictable psycho and some other guy who's obviously there for comic relief but only makes good on maybe two chuckles.As a love story, Harris and Mastratonio have a strong rapport that keeps parts of the movie afloat, but once again, too much of the movie's attention is shifted to those standoffs. It's only in the last forty minutes the pace finally picks up when the characters I cared about most have to face some pretty challenging decisions.Harris' odyssey into the alien world is visually spectacular, but I kept thinking, shouldn't the movie have done this earlier? Shouldn't it have explored this alien civilization with more detail and attention? Instead, we get a half-assed war is bad message and a deus ex machina climax. Most people I know agree it's rather cheesy that the hero is saved by the aliens, but I find the extra conclusion in the director's edition just as weak, when the movie turns into a possible end of the world flick. Wasn't this whole film about oil drillers and Navy Seals trying to survive in an underwater habitat just about fifteen minutes before? When it finally gets to the material I'm interested in, Cameron takes it in a direction that's out-of-balance with much of what came before it.If you're fans of Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, it might be worth checking out, but it disappointed much on virtually every other level.

(Now, by 2004, his films have occupied many of the various AFI lists, including the best romance films and comedies.)This is Spinal Tap was the first of its kind -- a so-called rockumentary following the dissipation of a terrible British hard rock band during the mid-80s, with songs like Sex Farm ample proof of their considerably awful talent.Tons of bands like Spinal Tap were popular during the 1980s, then soon fell out of the public eye. Not many of them even had much talent at all --  just drugged-out band members and lots of rebellious attitudes as their primary advertising campaign.Because Spinal Tap is so close to reality, and because it is so ridiculously ironic and yet far-fetched, it has achieved a massive army of fans and even a famed Criterion Collection DVD (now out of print, unfortunately). The film was never exactly a smash at the box office, but its popularity -- like so many famous films -- grew rapidly over the years since its release, having gradual re-releases (the sure-fire sign of a cult film) and lots of fake reunion concerts. (One of which was recently released onto a DVD.)Legend has it that after the film was released in 1984, people often came up to Rob Reiner on the street and they would say, I really liked your movie, but I wish you would have chosen a more popular band to do a film on.Yes, Spinal Tap is absolutely false. It's not a real band. But it's hard to tell at times. Some people don't like the film because they find it too real -- but I think that's the whole idea.As the film fades into focus, we are introduced to Marty DiBergi (Reiner), a documentary film maker who was drawn to Spinal Tap, the UK heavy metal rock band, early on in their career -- he admired their loud songs and now, at the height of their career, he is setting out to record their private lives that exist behind the stage.The three main rockers are Nigel (Christopher Guest), David (Michael McKean), and Derek (Harry Shearer), who go around the world on rock tours, inspiring lots of loud noise amongst fans and upsetting a lot of people -- like the limo driver played by Bruno Kirby (The Godfather Part II) in a pre-When Harry Met Sally cameo. (Billy Crystal also makes a cameo as a mime waiter in one of the most subtle scenes -- look quick, you might miss him.)The cast performed all their own songs, as well as writing them. Guest, McKean and Shearer are all gifted musicians -- but they're also pretty funny. Part of what makes this film so effective on repeat viewings is that you're guaranteed to find some things you didn't notice last time. John Hughes once said that he liked to place small background quirks in his films (such as the crawling mice in Planes, Trains and Automobiles) so that, on repeat viewings on television, someone watching might drift from the main focus of the film to the background of the sequence -- and there's the hidden gag that isn't even all that funny, just...different.Your first viewing of Spinal Tap might be less than enthusastic. But I beg of you, watch it again, take a chance to open your ears more, pay attention to small things in the background, and listen to those songs the guys are singing. That's where much of the comedy lies. This is a film that is definitely worth owning for such purposes.Speaking of hidden elements, much has been said -- or rather implied -- about the homosexuality of Nigel. When David's girlfriend joins them for the tour, his heart sinks because he loves him. I dunno, I've always thought it was because they were childhood friends and Nigel doesn't want anyone to take David away from him for friendship reasons. (Although the line We're closer than brothers... makes you wonder.)This mockumentary formula has been re-created time and time again since This is Spinal Tap, even in films such as The Blair Witch Project.But the mockumentary style has been mimicked particularly by Guest, who starred in -- and directed -- Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and most recently, 2003's A Mighty Wind. Michael McKean and Harry Shearer returned for these entries, and I'm thinking that the next film should be a collaborative effort, and should reunite everyone from Spinal Tap for a 20-year anniversary -- Reiner, Guest, McKean, Shearer, the cast from Guest's mockumentaries, and perhaps even Crystal and Kirby, et al., in cameos. I'm sure more than a few people would go to see it. And, unlike so many other films, it is one that actually deserves a sequel. And probably one that would be just as funny as the first. And one that would have a purpose, other than being just another cash-in. Anyone interested in what happened to the band members twenty years after their downfall? I know I do.But this is getting off the point, and the point is that none of these Guest mockumentaries -- as good as they are -- come close to the pure greatness of This is Spinal Tap, and A Mighty Wind -- although funny -- started to show signs of formula aging. But This is Spinal Tap was, is, and always shall be, the granddaddy of the mockumentaries. It's the Psycho of mockumentaries, and actually a lot of regular comedies, too.5\/5 stars.

There's more quality in Airplane! than, say, Hot Shots!, but both films are enjoyable, because you have to do absolutely no thinking whatsoever. All you have to do is laugh a few times. And with the millions of jokes (okay, hundreds) per film, you're sure to find at least a handful of things worth laughing at.National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 is one of my favorite spoof flicks. Why? It's stupid, silly, funny, and one of the most enjoyable films available to see. Yeah, it's stupid, like I already said. But it's loads of fun, too. And I don't care if critics bashed it when it came out -- it's still a very fun movie.Everything gets lampooned in this Lethal Weapon to Die Hard to Silence of the Lambs to CHiPs. And, alongside It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World; Austin Powers in Goldmember; and The Player, it has some of the most cameos\/stars to date. Get this Emilio Estevez, Samuel L.

Luger lost his partner (Goldberg), too, and the effects of the past often catch up with him, so far that he finds it impossible to fire a gun without shaking violently and spastic-like.General Mortars (Shatner) is planning a devious scheme of running drugs through a Girl Scout cookie-type company, and Colt and Luger try to thwart his plan and save the day before it's too late. Meanwhile, they come to appreciate each other -- while lampooning everything in sight.The most puzzling thing about Loaded Weapon 1 is the fact that, if you look at most user comments on the Internet Movie Database, they're all quite positive. It has a low standing at 5.3 stars, yes, but the user reviews for the film are pretty decent. A lot of people found the film funny for what it is. I do, too.Spoofing a spoof is kinda pathetic, I'll admit. Lethal Weapon always was more tongue-in-cheek comedy than anything else. Even as a hard action film it was always winking at the other films of its genre. Wayne's World isn't exactly a drama of epic proportions, either, come to think of it. Even Basic Instinct is a hard film to spoof, if you take a moment to reflect -- it's never exactly horribly serious. Just sleazy. (I won't ruin how Loaded Weapon 1 pokes fun at the famous Sharon Stone interrogation scene.)Yet, in my honest opinion, Loaded Weapon 1 does a pretty darn good job of spoofing everything in sight. Estevez is a good Riggs-type who pines for his lost dog (not a wife, mind you, but a dog). Jackson -- who's usually great -- is decent as the Murtaugh-type character, although he is shoved aside by the screenplay to make room for Estevez.

In BE the few surviving humans have regressed into a primitive society with no technology or education and the film spends some time with them, seeing how they live and see life.

The film Is called Edward Scissorhands The title alone should tell you what you're about to embark on. The story is a modern fairy tale about a character, Edward (Johnny Depp) who was made from the heart of a cookie by  the inventor played by non other then the legendary Vincent Price. He starts out by making Edward out of a cutting machine. The Inventor never finished which left Edward alone and with scissors for hands. I'm guessing the story takes place maybe 20 to 30 years from that point, and we find an Avon lady, Mrs. Boggs (Diane Wiest), unsuccesfully trying to sell her make up. She works up the courage to try and sell to an old abandon mansion that no one ever goes to.This is where we meet Edward. This is when the story gets interesting. The genius of Burton's direction that he does with Johnny and the score that his pal Danny Elfman draws out is fascinating. You get a gothic sense of beauty. You can learn so many things from this story. One paticular lesson I took to heart was from the town people and how they took Edward in and used him and threw him away. He wasn't treated like a person. As a result, he was taken advantage of. In the end the person who didn't accept him in the beginning will be the one that finally excepts him in the end.

With some qualifications (e.g. Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me) I regard myself as a reasonably devoted David Lynch fan, albeit not an uncritical one. I bought the DVD of Mulholland Drive some months ago, and found all kinds of excuses not to make the mental and emotional effort to watch it. Until yesterday.I thought about refraining from writing a review until I had seen the movie in its entirety several times, but it seems more honest to write a review based on my single viewing.I can't pretend to complete innocence, however. I did read the first twenty or so of the 1200-odd IMDb reviews, in the hope of gaining some illumination.It seems to me that there are two basic ways to miss the point with Mulholland Drive1) Be so devoted a David Lynch fan that you kill the wonderful, haunting mystery of the film with explanation;2) Be so bone-headedly anti-intellectual in general, and hostile to Lynch in particular, that you dismiss the film as pretentious rubbish or the like.We can, I think, dismiss the latter group of reviewers; they'll never get it. It's the first group who bother me.I watched the film in complete innocence. I had no idea, for instance, that it was cobbled together from footage for a rejected TV pilot, and some new footage intended to turn it into a feature film. Knowing this would have completely altered my response. I'd've been looking for the joins, and would have expected some incoherence and haste in the plot development.Some reviewers regret that the TV series was not made. I have some sympathy with this, but perhaps it was better this way after all. The sainted Twin Peaks, wonderful as it was overall, was more uneven than gilded memory might suggest; it had its longueurs, and suffered from having, by necessity, to be directed not merely by Lynch, but by others, leading to an inconsistency of style and viewpoint.Even the tacked-on the first half of the movie is all Diane Selwyn's dream explanation doesn't take us VERY far, and robs the movie of much of its characteristically Lynchian suggestiveness. Lynch likes to set up situations that suggest rich possibilities of resolution, and then to withhold such resolution. You can feel cheated, as many doubtless do; you can attempt to defend Lynch by pretending that the plot has more coherence than is actually the case; or you can just accept that if you want what the pop-psych babblers call closure you'll either have to do some of the work yourself, learn to live with uncertainty, or stick to simpler cinematic fare.So, it's all Diane Selwyn's dream? Maybe I've missed something, but this doesn't, so far as I can make out, explain the following1) There are three basic forces of evil in the moviei) The hermetically sealed Mr Roque (the Twin-Peaks midget!), who seems to give the Mafia-types and the latino manager of Cookies their orders;ii) The Cowboy. Is the Cowboy (one of the weirdest and most sinister villains ever to appear in a Lynch movie) simply an enforcer for the Mr Big, or is he an emissary ofiii) The Winkies Garbage Demon? This demon, who dwells among the junk behind the Sunset Blvd Winkies, literally scares a man to death. This same man has had a pair of prophetic dreams, and informs another man (a police officer?) that the Garbage Demon (as I shall call him) is responsible for all the evil that occurs in his dream. The Demon later also unleashes the airplane oldsters (clearly his satanic underlings) from the sinister blue box in pursuit of Diane Selwyn.2) If Betty is really Diane Selwyn (or vice versa), how does she dream the earlier parts of the movie? She has already killed herself in response to the attack of the airplane oldsters.3) How is Diane Selwyn privy to the experiences of Adam Kesher? Did she dream all of these? Why?4) Why are hermetically-sealed Mr Roque (the Mr Big) and\/or the deadpan, riddling Cowboy (under orders from the Garbage Demon?) so keen that Camilla Rhodes be cast in the female lead of Adam's bizarre nostalgia movie?5) Who is the Blue-Haired Lady in Silencio? Why is blue so sinister in this movie (the blue box and its clunky key; the conventional blue key given to Diane by the hit-man)?6) Why Silencio?There are lots of other unanswered questions in my mind. Maybe other IMDb reviewers have the answers (or THINK they have!). As usual with Lynch, I think it's better just to accept that the whole thing is several interlocking shaggy-dog stories that aren't really going anywhere, but we can, if we like, hitch along for part of the ride. (I am reminded of the enigmatic Cowboy's reference to the buggy he is driving; it's the same with Lynch's narrative.)If none of this appeals, you can always enjoy just looking at the pretty women!
