The celebration on Times Square as well as everywhere else in the United States suggests a national zenith!!! America is on top right!! one thing, one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing..The period of adjustment!!..The actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished..Now everyone needs to get on with their lives...only one problem though...they have to get new lives...the old lives are gone forever...Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water!! Everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts, and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong, for the simple reason that it was not true!!! Once sergeants, and generals, and their wives, and daughters, and sons and virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and recriminations of World War II and what it really accomplished as well as negated, nobody was the same!! For now, social and moral issues had a self serving interest...Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start over!! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have been married to Virginia Mayo in the first place!!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish!! Las but not least, the character, Homer, is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope!!The reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way, once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new United States and the new world overall, tragedy from WWII was recognized, and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride, and dealt with accordingly!! Frederick March and Myrna Loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage, Homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him (i.e. half the times, she will feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage...This is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the Indianapolis 500...The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans in that they are stalemated by the rude awakening of coercive changes to their lives...Happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop-aesthetic...it is now about formidable conditions, and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice!!...World War II did not just happen!! It will henceforth dominate the social patterns of American living!!!The aggregate catastrophe of World War II has mirrored most Americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well!!I loved this film and so did AFI, probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo!!..Bottom line, see this movie!! Nightmares about combat, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and\/or readjustment, coping with your life when stricken-ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today, HOWEVER!! this is 1946!! Very new to Americans then....REMEMBER THAT!! Director William Wyler has illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of WWII in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back!!!

By this, I mean that the film, like most soap operas flit continuously from scene to scene without really advancing forward to anywhere specific.American Graffiti, like Happy Days takes a post-modern, nostalgic look at a bygone age; in this case the 1960s' white middle-class America, which it then no doubt distorts for commercial reasons if nothing else! Here in American Graffiti, there is a concentrated focus on the lives of four young adolescent men. This leaves the roles of the women and girls - which is exemplified in everyday life - as secondary, support roles, which serve the purpose of putting emphases on the importance of the male characters and their roles. Indeed, the women in this film are portrayed as emotionally weak and needy, particularly of the young men, who are shown here as having all the advantages of opportunity to excel, by advancing themselves via higher education, and new life experiences.While the lines are deliberately cheesy in this film, the actors pull them off very well. By pulling off cheesy lines, the young actors in this film illustrate their range of talent. I am only hesitant that it is by giving young actors cheesy lines to make them into more convincing adolescents, that it will have the effect of stereotyping teenagers, and portraying them as irrelevant, and corny young people with nothing important to say. This would have implications for Western democracy would it not? Meanwhile,although I am not a great fan of the music in this film, it did serve well as a sound track which is necessary, not only for telling the viewer what era the film is set in, but to create an ambiance which is essential to the film. And, it is ambiance as opposed to plot, and character development - which are not really relevant to the objective of this film - which makes this film work, especially in a sentimental way.Overall, a film worth seeing.

I was thinking it was a humorous movie, and my husband did also. We were very surprised when we watched it. The subplot (racism in the small town) was as interesting as the main plot (Melanie Griffith wanting a glamorous life). Sometimes I think Griffith is a bunch of fluff in real life, then she gets in front of the cameras and wows me time and again. She is a great actress. While watching the movie, as it inched towards the middle, my opinion of it was dropping fast. I think the pace slowed too much. I was planning on giving it a B-. Then the action picked up about 40 minutes near the end. I was riveted to the TV at this point. Actually I left the room for a short break and could still hear the dialogue. I raced back down the hall quickly! Warning! Don't leave the room as the film nears this point! You need to be watching and appreciate what is going on! The film starts to come together and you need to hear and see it! Lucas Black is top rate as usual. I was in tears at the end and my husband was getting misty-eyed also. When they were announcing filming of this movie and doing location checks, everybody in Alabama (where I live) was so excited! Oh boy, Banderas and Griffith are coming here to film! Then he changed his mind and decided to film in Mississippi. Everyone was sad. How could Banderas say that Mississippi looked more like Alabama? Other than that, this movie was great.

In my opinion the movie is far more impressive, possibly due to the superior special effects or the mystery of the Earthlings figuring out the gate for the first time.I'm the first to admit there are flaws-- the alien planet has not one but *three* moons which look EXACTLY LIKE OURS; a sloppy FX shortcut in a movie full of otherwise sparkling effects-- but they're forgivable in the face of a truly smart script connecting ancient Egypt and alien life-- only way they might have improved it was maybe to include something about Stonehenge. I'm a sucker for anything about ancient Eypgt so I was a perfect target for this movie. Also, it might be considered a premonition, as far as having the androgynous black\/white sequined king surrounding himself with young boys... a whole year or so before Michael Jackson started really getting in trouble with the law. Yikes.In short, a great film. Beautiful sets, and fine acting from everyone involved. It's fun to see Harry Solomon from 3rd Rock From The Sun (French Stewart) in his first film role too.

Why rent that when you can go with Predator? And for some reason I always got confused between Harold and Maude and Miss Daisy and her driver. Maybe because they both have old people in them.

Great for the time or great in general they did not know. So I rented it to find out.So ? So even if I don't think Harold and Maude is a masterpiece it clearly has the charm of the best films of that period of greatness in American cinema  the early seventies.

The blending of golden oldies from the 70s and 80s gives this movie an extra humorous and endearing boost and bespeaks the writer's appreciable creativity and perception. Heath Ledger does a wonderful job as the lead character--especially being so young himself--and his sidekicks in the movie are just as likable . . . in fact, one finds himself rather attached.The director did a wonderful job focusing on small things that one would hardly had given thought to . . . which--at least for the visually-oriented--calls into play a deeper level of emotion that the movie would have been much amiss without. Such keen observations render intrigue and the director thus avoids the monotony and mediocrity of presenting the work superficially. Much of the sentiment and reflective thought of the movie is translated merely through a close-up, an unusual angle, or a slow-motion technique at just the right moment. It was a job well done and I was very impressed. The humor was never dull and was always appreciable--down to the last moments--and the movie boasts some very touching, moving moments before the final curtain draws.Paul Bettany was purely delightful as Geoffrey Chaucer and the film simply could not have done without the spontaneous, spiked humor of short-fused Watt, played outstandingly by Alan Tudyk. I was speechless upon learning that Tudyk is really a natural born and bred Texan who completely (and marvelously!) faked an English accent for the movie. He had me totally fooled and upon watching it, I thought they'd gotten the guy from deep in the heart of England.The jousting scenes are intense and well done--if not a bit repetitious, but there is motive and reason behind each repetition so they are tolerated well and manage to keep the viewer engaged. In addition, there is wonderful chemistry among the actors and I suspect they all had a generally great time making the movie together. This translates throughout their production virtually automatically.Except for the nudity with Paul Bettany that we could have all done without and with the exception of the brief bed scene and a few choice words here or there, this makes an otherwise excellent family movie or great choice for a cozy night in front of the fireplace with a good flick.

Tootsie is one of the most intelligent comedies I've ever seen. It is perfectly cast, well-layered, and full of surprises.Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey. He seems to know everything about acting except how to stay employed as an actor. In an early montage we see him auditioning for numerous plays where he is either too old, too young, too short, simply not the right guy for the part, or in some cases impossible to work with. We also see him trying to teach his craft to some young wannabe actors, and working at a restaurant to pay the bills. After a hilarious argument with his agent, he is simply told No one will hire you! The very next shot has Hoffman in drag walking down the street to an audition for a soap opera part his friend (Terri Garr) was unable to land. So intent is the chauvinistic director (Coleman) on casting a woman that looks tough enough for the part of a hospital administrator, Hoffman is denied without so much as a reading. He responds with a hilarious tirade that opens the door to his television career. Hoffman lands the part, and is soon winning over fans all over the country.While Hoffman finds it wonderful to be working regularly, his personal life is understandably put to the test. He alienates Garr, is constantly made fun of by his roommate (Murray) and falls in love with one of his co-stars (Lange) who of course cannot learn his secret or he's out of a job. Things are further complicated when two older men fall in love with him. It would be pointless to try and describe some of the awkward situations he finds himself in. You must see the movie to experience them for yourself.The film is so well-cast it's incredible. There are so many fine actors at work here that it almost becomes a contest of who can steal the scene first. Murray gets his share with his improvised lines. His lamenting of the state of his plays during a party scene will have you howling. The icing on the cake was director Sydney Pollack agreeing to play Hoffman's agent. They only have a few scenes together, but they are the film's best.Tootsie is head and shoulders above other films I've seen that deal with men in women's clothing. Mrs. Doubtfire for example was all slapstick without much heart. In the end it tried to redeem itself in that department and just got way too sappy. Tootsie also wisely holds back in the feminism department. Although Hoffman's Dorothy Michaels is clearly a woman who inspires others to stand up for themselves, he is advised to tone it down by Pollack in one scene. Hoffman feels his Dorothy character should be doing specials and giving advice and whatnot, but Pollack reminds him, You have NOTHING to say to women, Michael. In other words, you're lucky you've gotten away with the stunt up to this point, now you should be looking for a way to get out.Overall Tootsie is wonderful experience. It made a fortune when released, and is still very relevant today. Don't miss it! 10 of 10 stars from the Hound.

Albert Brooks, playing both behind and in front of the camera, does a fantastic job of creating this courtroom drama set in Purgatory. By keeping a the films themes short and simple, enticing us with brilliant performances by Meryl Streep and Rip Torn, and bringing a true sense of fantasy to this picture, Brooks keeps us hooked from the opening scenes until the last. Panned by most critics, I actually found this film to be extremely witty with a Wes Anderson-esquire type of dry martini humor. Brooks is easily able to transform himself into a likable every man that finds himself defending his normal life. What works is that it feels and seems like your own life. Brooks' character isn't a superhero, he isn't a genius (only using 3% of his brain), and he isn't a playboy, he is your average human on the street. Makes decent money, celebrates being alone, just bought a new BMW, and is coasting through life rather simply. Sound like anyone you may know? Brooks creates this sensation that Judgment City could exist, that the trials of your life could happen, and within all of this chaos and confusion, love could emerge.Albert Brooks is a very smart writer. He wouldn't create your typical Hollywood love story and send it through the recycling machine. His approach to love in this film is totally random, somewhat sporadic, but yet honestly real. There is a mystery between he and Meryl Streep's relationship. That is what I loved so much about them. Typically in films of this nature you have this elaborate story of how two people meet, they fall in love, they fight, and suddenly discover that their passion is stronger than ever before (normally due to some unforeseen &#133; or clichéd moment), but not in this film. Brooks approaches love as if it already exists. He hints towards the notion that these two may have been in Judgment City before, that maybe they have already had their awkward courtship, that maybe the climactic cliché has already happened, and now they are just rediscovering themselves. Brooks sets this up with Streep's first lines, which are simply, Haven't we met before? While this may not seem like it is that exciting, the fact that they are in Judgment City after dying, and two random people recognize each other is heartwarming. I was immediately attached to these two characters from the moment they met in the Comedy Club. Their emotions didn't seem created by Hollywood, but instead created by the brilliant craftsmanship of Brooks' words. If you aren't connected to the courtroom antics of this film, than the spark that Streep creates with Brooks will surely keep you grounded for good.I would also like to applaud Brooks for his ability to create a whole new world from the inside out. Just as confused as Brooks is when he first arrives to Judgment City, we are forced to see this creative world through his eyes, and he is not afraid to demonstrate his attention to detail. The concept of food in this film kept me laughing long after the final credits rolled. The scene in the Italian restaurant with the waiter and the pies ranks among one of the funniest scenes in a film. In fact, as I type this review, I am still laughing about it. His creative mind also allowed us to consider the possibility of reincarnation and the existence of bigger and better worlds. He plants us in Judgment City, but doesn't leave us there. He allows us to travel while making us feel comfortable, thus keeping a smile on our faces throughout the entire visit. He makes us laugh, either through his own words, or through that of Rip Torn, who nearly stole every scene possible. As I continue to watch more of Rip Torn's work, I am beginning to see that he is quite a versatile actor that has very deep comedic roots. If it wasn't the instant connection between Streep and Brooks that kept this film glued together, than it definitely was the charisma of Rip Torn in the courtroom.Finally, I would like to say that watching this film in a post-Matrix universe, there are some interesting parallels between the two. When Rip Torn is talking about allowing humans to go through to another life, or sending them back to Earth, he references the universe to a machine. Again, living in a post-Matrix world, this immediately darkened the film and perked up my ears. I know this may be grabbing at thin air, but the scene in the Matrix when Cypher is talking about how good the machine makes his steak taste, eerily reminded me of all the food used in this film. There were several other moments just like this that just seemed to fit rather snug. Whether you believe it or not, I believe the Wachowski brothers may have watched this film once or twice before creating their prized trilogy.Overall, I thought this was an outstanding film. From the instant character excitement to the originality of the script, I thought that this was one of Brooks' best outings. The fact that you could tell that the cast was honestly having a good time in every scene, that you laughed when they laughed (which was quite a bit in this film), and that you could actually enjoy a witty comedy without guns or violence impressed me. Brooks has such a sharp humor that I cannot wait to revisit this movie to catch some of the lines that I may have missed the first time. Streep does a sensational job, while Rip Torn steals every scene he is in. Impressive to say the least, and am happy that the 90s were able to produce one original piece of comedy.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2005","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Defending Your Life is one of the smartest, funniest, and original films to come out of the 1990s.

The fact that you could tell that the cast was honestly having a good time in every scene, that you laughed when they laughed (which was quite a bit in this film), and that you could actually enjoy a witty comedy without guns or violence impressed me. Brooks has such a sharp humor that I cannot wait to revisit this movie to catch some of the lines that I may have missed the first time. Streep does a sensational job, while Rip Torn steals every scene he is in. Impressive to say the least, and am happy that the 90s were able to produce one original piece of comedy.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 September 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The title alone is enough to fascinate those who love believable sci-fi. This movie is not as far reaching as some would have us think. It links fiction with fact, as we know the military have underground sites. Following in the footsteps of Close Encounter of the Third Kind, Stargate is a great follow-up, bringing it into the 21st century. In the previous movie the beings are consistent with what many believe aliens might look like, and what many think has been happening for years. In Stargate, we see new possible beginnings. This is just one good version with enough special effects and great acting to hope someday this is feasible. It is worth watching, over and over, each time seeing something that was previously missed. Thoroughly enjoyable.

You know what I mean? This was because the story was a bit confusing and not very clear in the beginning. But when I continued watching, it all became clear and I ended up really loving this movie. The story was an excellent mix of all the ingredients of a real love affair. Julianne Moore was great as always. She can play any role and it's a shame she hasn't won any Academy Award yet. I think she should have one for her performance in The Hours, which was without any doubt her best up to now. But I'm not worried, because I know she will certainly win an Oscar some day.Ralph Fiennes was fine as well, but next to Julianne Moore I loved Stephen Rea the most. There is only one word to describe his performance and that is 'intense'. I loved him in every scene! Brilliant actor. The story was amazing as well. I think it showed the different stages of falling in love and loving very well. How the love is very physical in the beginning and afterwards develops to wanting to be with her all the time and holding her and being there for her.Although the story of The Wings Of The Dove was something completely different, it reminded me a bit of this movie from time to time. Neil Jordan managed to make another great movie with an excellent cast and a classic story.Worth watching! 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" When I first started seeing this movie, I enjoyed it but I didn't love it.

James Spader conveys this curiosity and channels his quest to discover the gate's secrets to the audience. Lindfors is also very good as an elder scientist who feels Spader is the answer to all the questions. Kurt Russell's range as a military officer is limited here; he's introduced as suicidal due to his son's recent death, but is quite stoic and just grim throughout. He's obviously a 'can do' soldier and leader, but also anticipates his later robotic fighter in Soldier 4 years later. After the action moves off Earth to what's on the other side of the gate, our anticipation to find out what's there is rewarded by little more than a variation on Dune(84) done in more formulaic style.A formula is what partners Emmerich and Devlin present, as is always the case in their movies - successful formulas, to be sure, but nothing to get surprised over. Even if you know nothing about one of their films beforehand, about 20 minutes in you may have it all figured out. Here, the expedition finds a 'desert' world and are soon expected to help the natives against an alien tyrant (Jaye Davidson, his unusual persona taken advantage of). Are we all surprised by such a plot? Of course not. The special FX are pretty impressive, especially the shots of the huge flying pyramid and some of the landscapes. They also have some impressive crowd shots which add to an epic scale of storytelling. But, there's very little emotional attachment to the unfolding struggle - it's all by the numbers and even Spader can't inject much feeling into any of it. The next project, Independence Day was probably more successful because our own cities were being destroyed, not some far-off planet we care very little about.
