And it has to be said this movie may well be thirty years old, but it's still capable of scaring the hell out of people.The story of Jaws is actually a quite simple one. When a girl dies in the ocean near a peaceful community on Amity Island, it's immediately believed to be a shark attack. But because the mayor doesn't want to spoil an entire summer by scaring the many tourists away, he is able to have it called a boating accident, much to the new police chief Martin Brody's frustration. He's convinced that more people will die if they don't do anything against this ferocious predator and soon enough he's proved right when a boy is killed by the shark. Together with a scientist and an old fisherman, he goes after the giant white shark to get rid of it for once and for all...This movie may well be one of the most famous movies of the seventies, but that doesn't mean that it is perfect. As long as you don't see the shark this is really a terrifying movie, but from the moment on that they show that giant rubber 'thing', it loses quite a lot of its power. You just know that this isn't correct, because it just is too gigantic and it doesn't react like a real shark. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it attacks boats, what I'm talking about are some 'small' details like not closing its eyes when attacking or not changing the position of the mouth. Normally a shark opens its mouth further when it gets closer, showing a lot more of its gums. This shark however is lifeless as it attacks.However, the movie has a lot of good things to offer as well. The acting for instance is really good. Roy Scheider does a good job as police chief Brody, but in my opinion it was Robert Shaw who was the best with his role of Quint, the fearless boat captain. Also very good is the music. I believe there is absolutely nobody who doesn't know what it is like and if you ask ten people to hum it, nine out of ten will be able to do it. And let's be honest, if it wasn't for the music, most scenes wouldn't even be scary. It's the music that creates the atmosphere of tension and terror when there is in fact nothing to be seen in the movie. But it works perfectly and that's all that matters.Overall this is a good movie, but if it hadn't been from the hand of Steven Spielberg, I'm pretty sure this would have been an awful one. It was probably his very first really great movie and he proved with this one that he was able to make a very good movie out of a concept that begs to become a failure. Many others have tried to copy its success with two sequels, but also with other 'shark' movies and not one of them was able to get to the same level of fear. However, when you are at least a little bit interested in sharks, you know that what is shown in it isn't correct. Many people only feared sharks after seeing this movie and that's too bad, because this marvelous creatures really aren't the mindless terror \/ killing machines that this movie made of them. I like the fact that the movie is one of the best in the genre, but I wish it had been a bit closer to reality. That's why I give it a 7\/10.

Now pick your average American boy, coming to Old Europe to meet his girlfriend -- but she is a really average girlfriend, one that comes to Old Europe for some kind of art study (we are allowed to think that this is not the real reason, or that art studies are useless - you choose); however, she is pretty average, so she ended up cheating on him and when he arrives, he soon realizes he's going to be dumped.He buys an interrail ticket and he too ends up on a Budapest-Paris train, only to bump into that not-so-average french girl who's still a student at Sorbonne because she doesn't feel like she's ready for a real life (and she's only 23 yo) Could they avoid falling in love? The answer is no. This is all the plot. The rest is about 90' of them getting closer, with Wien as a cute backdrop for their story.In this 'wannabe art' movie we can really see how nothingness can be stirred to fill up the standard Hollywood length of 100 minutes two people chatting about nothing and trying hard to make it feel real.But this IS Hollywood because there's not even a little bit of something real in this movie.

It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD.

That's the reason why I normally wouldn't have watched this movie, but because a few people told me that I should give it a try anyway, since this was definitely one of his better ones, I hoped for the best.In this movie Adam Sandler plays the role of Robbie Hart, a man who sings the hits of the 1980's at weddings and other celebrations. He has seen many couples getting married and is prepared for everything when it's up to him to get married with his fiancée. But nothing could prepare him for what she does to him. She dumps him at the altar, making him loose all believe in true love. In the meantime he has also met Julia, a waitress at the events where he performs and with who he has become good friends. She too is about to marry, but has made the wrong choice of partner as well. The only problem is that she doesn't know it yet and Robbie doesn't know if he should tell her or not...Although many jokes didn't really work very well for me, I still had a good time with this movie. I know that may sound a bit strange, but the main reason for that is because they made fun of one of the worst periods in pop history, the 1980's. The entire movie is situated in 1985 and you'll get to see several sidekicks dressed as Madonna, Boy George from the Culture Club,... but also other events like for instance the very first CD player. But what I probably liked most about this movie were the performances of Steve Buscemi as the drunk best man on one of the weddings and Drew Barrymore. And yes I admit it, I even appreciated Adam Sandler in this movie.Overall this isn't a bad movie and Sandler certainly isn't as annoying as in his other movies. I'm not going to say that I would buy it, but if it is shown on TV again, I might give it another try. Sure the romantic stuff was sweet, but thanks to Drew Barrymore who played the perfect 'girl next door' in this movie, I was able to cope with that. I give this movie a 6.5\/10.

I like this (at the time LITTLE film) very, very much. Douglas is terrific, playing a throwback cowboy, who is a law to himself, but who will not bow to injustice, and (thank God!) never really becomes a Rambo-like character. There is, under that rough exterior, a very tender side to him. The story is basically very simple, though the themes are definitely not so simple and still have great import today (especially today!).

Don't my babies have a right to experience something still a little wild. Isn't that in part what I served in two wars for? OK! OK! I'm getting off my soapbox.) The screenplay is quite literate but very sparse (absolutely the right touch for this film); everything flows smoothly and logically from scene to scene (Steven War of the Worlds Spielberg please take notes). The camera is really allowed to tell the story, and it is awesome. The 2.351 Panavision and the absolutely breathtaking black & white, exposes the uncredited character -- the still sometime wild and open (mid-20th century) West and the occasionally dangerous mountains and highways.

Tries her level best to raise her daughter in best possible ways &#150; giving her the basic necessities, educating her, providing her food and wants to keep her away from obscenities, cheapness and vulgarity etc. It's a movie of the 19th century , so now you can well understand how difficult it is for parents to give their child a healthy environment.Now what makes an environment &#150; Neighbors, newspapers, magazines, TV, Internet&#133;school friends etc. is'nt it ? yes it is.Few turning points of a girl named carrie  1. at the age of 7, she asks a shameless nude woman lying nude in the garden what her breasts were all about ! Now S L U T woman are the kinds who can lie like that in front of public to watch &#150; no mother &#150; a righteous one &#150; can ever stand her daughter being exposed to such vile women &#150; so she beat her up &#150; the poor lil' carrie ynderstood nothing. Mother thought that she is just doing the right thing.2. Mother never told daughter about Chums (periods, Menstrual cycle &#150; which the girls now-a-days are seen celebrating in the TV advertisements)! it comes to her as a surprise in school &#150; other class mates make fun of her &#150; except one girl (very attractive African girl with sparkling eyes &#150; I really liked her eyes &#150; do not know her name). Later of course all the girls are given a dose of a lifetime by the Instructress and she throws Tampons at them &#150; to teach the girls a lesson &#150; The Instructress was also very attractive to look at&#133;I like such chiseled facial features .3. The good friend of Carrie requests her boyfriend to ask Carrie for a date to the College fest PAM &#133;.or something. He agrees and asks Carrie out. Carrie who had read in magazines and in fairy tales since her childhood about Prince Charming coming and etc. was very happy.4. In the meanwhile Carrie had learnt Telekinesis ( Mind Control and contacting the subtle world) through the Internet &#150; since she was alone and hardly had any friends and other stupidities like partying, picnicking, gossiping etc. she could concentrate and even succeed in receiving the services of the Subtle world.5. She tailors a dress for herself &#150; a plunging neckline- revealing her cleavage and shoulders &#150; to her mother's horror &#150; her mother could not stop her as she had come to know of Carrie's super natural powers&#133;.and was rather afraid of her.

It is most definitely not. Not everyone will have seen it, but many will know the reputation it has gathered.Alex (Malcom McDowell) is the leader of his little gang. His hobbies include rape, ultra-violence, drugs and Beethoven. In other words, he is a very disturbed individual. But when he is caught by the police he wants to change to get out of prison. He applies for a controversial treatment to cure him of his need for violence and rape.This movie is one of my favorites but for some it wouldn't be easy to watch. There is a lot of nudity, a rape and a few sex scenes. Not to mention, ultra-violence (but by today's standards it isn't too bad). But it is a classic nonetheless. Stanley Kubrick does an outstanding job of directing and the acting is fine all around, especially McDowell's performance as Alex. The soundtrack is very good, the opening theme is suitably unsettling and there is a lot of Beethoven (which I love).The movie, even though it might seem aged, should not be seen as a mere violent movie with sex. It is much more, it has actual meaning and morals, brought to screen by Kubrick and McDowell with skill.

I am not nor ever have been any kind of conspiracy theorist, though that's not to say that I'm not a skeptic either. I was skeptical of the official story in the assassination. I suspected there was some kind of conspiracy involved and that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, but never gave the matter much thought nor did I ever actually go back and look at any of the evidence in the matter.Oliver Stone is different, though. For him, the world shook when shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, and left the youthful, handsome, and charismatic President of the United States dead, the Governor of Texas severely wounded, and the nation in shock. The Warren Commission's official story of what happened that day really bothered Stone. It was a story he found hurried, inadequate, flawed, and highly suspect, like the Commission was desperate to make the facts fit a preconceived notion of one assassin and three shots. It bothered him enough that he made a movie offering, in his words, my counter-fiction to the Warren Commission's fiction. JFK isn't supposed to be the definitive end-all explanation of what happened that fateful day but rather is supposed to get us thinking about it again, a task that it achieves with sheer brilliance.Oliver Stone presents us with a unique set of characters the straight-faced New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the flamboyant low-life David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth male prostitute (Kevin Bacon), the snobbish businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), the Deep Throat-like mystery informant known only as X (Donald Sutherland), and the mysterious Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Except for Bacon and Sutherland's characters, who are composite figures, all the others are based on real people. What Stone is doing, though, is not retelling the story of how Jim Garrison brought forth the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Even while this movie was in production, Stone was being criticized for making a movie for the purpose of vindicating the real-life Garrison, who many see as being interested only in his own glory. Stone, however, is not trying to vindicate anybody here. What Stone has done is use the real-life story of Jim Garrison as a jumping-off point to present his case, which is why Stone makes use of information (such as the whereabouts of Oswald right before the assassination) that Garrison did not have in 1969. Stone wants to cast suspicion on the Warren Commission's findings and uses Garrison as his medium to do just that.In that sense, this movie is not really advocating any one theory but rather rejecting the Warren Commission's theory. People have criticized the final theory that Stone puts forth, but in doing so, they have achieved his goal, which is to get the dialogue going again on the JFK assassination. What he presents is not necessarily fact but is rather counter-fiction. The first half of the film feels very much like a conspiracy theory, where I sat wondering how much of what I was being shown was true. In the scene where Garrison meets with X, where X talks about the question of *why* Kennedy was killed, the reasons put forth bring the conspiracy to the highest levels of the government and somehow manage to sound both outrageous and plausible at the same time. Throughout the movie, Stone uses a variety of film types and both color and black-and-white to present flashbacks and hypothetical scenarios so realistic that they achieve their goal of feeling like they are actual events.The end result is a movie that offers not *the* answer but *an* answer, an answer that rejects the Warren Commission's theory of a lone assassin, with evidence to support it. Now, tons of movies have been made and tons of books have been written offering various answers. But what makes Oliver Stone's JFK so unique is its storytelling. JFK is thrilling and mysterious, grabbing us by the collar and leading us step-by-step through the eyes of Jim Garrison through one of the greatest unsolved crimes of the 20th century. At the climax, Stone uses the power of film to its fullest potential, using his own color and black-and-white footage, created with a variety of film types, alongside archived footage (especially the famous Zapruder film) to show his heart-pounding recreation of the assassination, with John William's exhilarating soundtrack playing in the background. It is quite simply one of the the most exciting and heart-pounding scenes I have ever seen in any movie. JFK won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing and this one scene was enough to win both of those awards. It is a scene that is undoubtedly used in film schools to demonstrate a masterpiece of cinematography and editing.After watching JFK, I still can't say that I know what happened at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Did Oswald act alone? Was there a conspiracy? If so, who was involved? How many shots rang out? Was Oswald merely, as he claimed, a patsy? JFK asks these questions and wants us to ask them. It wants us to, if not reject, then at least *question* the official account and after watching it, it's impossible not to.

Throughout the movie, Stone uses a variety of film types and both color and black-and-white to present flashbacks and hypothetical scenarios so realistic that they achieve their goal of feeling like they are actual events.The end result is a movie that offers not *the* answer but *an* answer, an answer that rejects the Warren Commission's theory of a lone assassin, with evidence to support it. Now, tons of movies have been made and tons of books have been written offering various answers. But what makes Oliver Stone's JFK so unique is its storytelling. JFK is thrilling and mysterious, grabbing us by the collar and leading us step-by-step through the eyes of Jim Garrison through one of the greatest unsolved crimes of the 20th century. At the climax, Stone uses the power of film to its fullest potential, using his own color and black-and-white footage, created with a variety of film types, alongside archived footage (especially the famous Zapruder film) to show his heart-pounding recreation of the assassination, with John William's exhilarating soundtrack playing in the background. It is quite simply one of the the most exciting and heart-pounding scenes I have ever seen in any movie. JFK won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing and this one scene was enough to win both of those awards. It is a scene that is undoubtedly used in film schools to demonstrate a masterpiece of cinematography and editing.After watching JFK, I still can't say that I know what happened at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Did Oswald act alone? Was there a conspiracy? If so, who was involved? How many shots rang out? Was Oswald merely, as he claimed, a patsy? JFK asks these questions and wants us to ask them. It wants us to, if not reject, then at least *question* the official account and after watching it, it's impossible not to.

Kennedy. I am not nor ever have been any kind of conspiracy theorist, though that's not to say that I'm not a skeptic either. I was skeptical of the official story in the assassination. I suspected there was some kind of conspiracy involved and that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, but never gave the matter much thought nor did I ever actually go back and look at any of the evidence in the matter.Oliver Stone is different, though. For him, the world shook when shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, and left the youthful, handsome, and charismatic President of the United States dead, the Governor of Texas severely wounded, and the nation in shock. The Warren Commission's official story of what happened that day really bothered Stone. It was a story he found hurried, inadequate, flawed, and highly suspect, like the Commission was desperate to make the facts fit a preconceived notion of one assassin and three shots. It bothered him enough that he made a movie offering, in his words, my counter-fiction to the Warren Commission's fiction. JFK isn't supposed to be the definitive end-all explanation of what happened that fateful day but rather is supposed to get us thinking about it again, a task that it achieves with sheer brilliance.Oliver Stone presents us with a unique set of characters the straight-faced New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the flamboyant low-life David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth male prostitute (Kevin Bacon), the snobbish businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), the Deep Throat-like mystery informant known only as X (Donald Sutherland), and the mysterious Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Except for Bacon and Sutherland's characters, who are composite figures, all the others are based on real people. What Stone is doing, though, is not retelling the story of how Jim Garrison brought forth the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Even while this movie was in production, Stone was being criticized for making a movie for the purpose of vindicating the real-life Garrison, who many see as being interested only in his own glory. Stone, however, is not trying to vindicate anybody here. What Stone has done is use the real-life story of Jim Garrison as a jumping-off point to present his case, which is why Stone makes use of information (such as the whereabouts of Oswald right before the assassination) that Garrison did not have in 1969. Stone wants to cast suspicion on the Warren Commission's findings and uses Garrison as his medium to do just that.In that sense, this movie is not really advocating any one theory but rather rejecting the Warren Commission's theory. People have criticized the final theory that Stone puts forth, but in doing so, they have achieved his goal, which is to get the dialogue going again on the JFK assassination. What he presents is not necessarily fact but is rather counter-fiction. The first half of the film feels very much like a conspiracy theory, where I sat wondering how much of what I was being shown was true. In the scene where Garrison meets with X, where X talks about the question of *why* Kennedy was killed, the reasons put forth bring the conspiracy to the highest levels of the government and somehow manage to sound both outrageous and plausible at the same time.

Most of the tale is set about 40 years later, when this set of focused fighting machines are replaced by newer models, soldiers bred in the womb. It seems you've seen all this stuff before, but this big-budget yarn somehow keeps a lot of it interesting. The strongest theme is an amplification of the army's usual intent to destroy an individual's personality during training and build a new one back up. Russell, the Sgt.\/field leader of the first group, spent a year getting into proper shape for this role, earned a record $15 mil, and manages to have less dialog than Arnold Schwarzenegger did in the 1st Terminator flic. Jason Scott Lee (from Dragonthe Bruce Lee Story and a member of the new models) says almost nothing at all. A memorable set piece pits the 2 of them against each other during a 'show me yours,I'll show you mine' demonstration of abilities. The inhumanity inherent in the military's aim, the story says, will eventually be our undoing. Until we all love & care for another like the marooned colonists on the 'garbage world,' mankind is setting itself up for endless\/pointless conflict. However, until that perfect universe, such colonists will need a perfect soldier to defend them; face it, without Russell, they would all be dead, along with their nice attitudes. The drawbacks to the sci-fi tale are logistics as mentioned, Russell & his mates begin training just before the 21st century begins(now); within their lifespan, Earth has apparently colonized planets light years away. I suppose contact with aliens around year 2015 might make this possible, but it strains credibility. The main villain, a slimy colonel, is way over the top - not to mention he's a total idiot, but it's amusing to wait for and see his expected downfall. There's also simply not enough time to see Russell gain some humanity - we're treated to a quick montage to facilitate our expectations (it feels like 10 minutes were edited out to start the action). This pic, a box-office bust, probably due to poor marketing, should appeal to a male audience fond of a no-nonsense approach of getting things done, whether its saving colonists or mass destruction. The action sets are, if not gripping, decent for a big-budgeter. If you liked the first Universal Soldier pic (1992), this one's also for you.
