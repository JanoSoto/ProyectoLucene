He has the chance to make it in minor league hockey, and maybe go on to a major league team such as New York. But to make it with the Hamilton Mustangs, he has to compete with a big tough guy named Racki who enjoys knocking people down.Dean is not tough, but he has speed, so he does get to be a Mustang. He goes through the usual hazing that the new guy gets, and he must persevere every step of the way or risk either going back to the farm or ending up in Medicine Hat or some other remote place that I'm sure the longtime residents like.Dean does make one good friend on the team, Derek Sutton. But there is much to learn about being a competitor, especially in a league where violence is accepted as a fact of life (now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if bench-clearing brawls are frowned on in American baseball, how can they actually be encouraged by even the hockey coaches?). Dean must make important moral choices, and then he must think about what his future will be with each possible option.Dean also has a chance at romance. Jessie Chadwick is the adorable but feisty coach's daughter. And his landlady is Miss McGill (think Bull Durham). Which one do you think he'll choose? Or will one of them choose him?I know little about hockey. I have seen the Mighty Ducks series, and I was watching when a team from my state won the Stanley Cup. So I don't know enough to evaluate the on-ice action. I do know the finale was exciting if somewhat formulaic, with effective use of slow-motion.As for performances, I thought there were some really good moments. Cynthia Gibb did the best job overall, in my opinion. Ed Lauter also had some good scenes as the coach, and a couple of scenes with Dean and Sutton were really good. Jim Youngs and Eric Nesterenko, as Dean's brother and father, both had several scenes alone with Dean which were quite good.This wasn't a comedy, but I liked the humor in several scenes with Jessie. The funniest part of the whole movie Jessie sneaking a portable radio into school to listen to Dean's game. Close behind was a scene where the public was skating in what I thought was a rink, but it may have been the arena where the Mustangs' games were played.I couldn't shake the feeling that this was another one of those average movies with the usual formula.

I was 15 and with my parents in the theater. I watched it again today with my wife because it came on FX and I was too lazy to get up and change the channel. All I have to say is what a movie. The story is about a gang of prison guards who work on death row in a prison down south, They do the best they can to make the condemned mens lives a little bit better for their final days. That is if the convict is not a complete animal without remorse. Enter Mr. Duncan playing a dimwitted muscular African American accused of murdering and raping two little girls. At first I thought maybe this character is slightly offensive? But his lovable nature and antique soul helped me see beyond that. He is truly a beautiful man, an angel perhaps who has the ability to heal the sick. As the film goes on you learn that he was actually trying to heal the little girls. Anyway let's just say a black man in the south in the nineteen thirties did not stand much a chance of being found innocent of anything even if he was Jesus Christ himself reborn.

It is by far the dumbest movie in the series, with a plot that defies credibility, and a closing boxing match that would surely prove fatal for both fighters if a contest like it were to take place in real life. What the film has in its favour is a sense of courage in its own absurdity. It's like everybody involved knows that they're working on something ludicrous, but they give it their all anyway &#150; the actors, the cinematographer, the composer, the editor and the director all pull in the same direction, united in some kind of cheerful conviction that they can make an enjoyable movie from this silliest of premises.Life is good for boxing champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He has a mansion, he has money, he has incredible public support and he has the all-important heavyweight champion of the world title. But news is spreading fast that there might be a better boxer on the face of the planet in the shape of Russian goliath Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Drago comes to America for an exhibition match against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), once Rocky's greatest adversary and now Rocky's greatest friend. The match is supposed to be a straightforward contest for Creed, giving him a chance to reassert himself as a top fighter, but it goes terribly wrong when Drago literally pulverises his opponent and kills him in the ring. Distraught at the death of his buddy, Rocky agrees to fight Drago. The venue Moscow. The date December 25th. In the middle of desolate northern Russia, Rocky trains for the fight of his life against a near-superhuman opponent. Not only is the honour of his dead friend at stake, but so is his life&#133;. not to mention the hopes of every man, woman and child from the free world! It seems kind of wrong for a Rocky movie to go all political on the audience, but Rocky IV indirectly does just that. Rocky's closing speech is a cringe-worthy plea for tolerance and change amongst the different societies of our world, and if I hadn't heard it with my own ears I would scarcely have believed anyone could put such infantile politics on film. The movie is much better when it concentrates on the sport aspects, especially the pulsating training sequences. With rapid-fire editing and rousing music, these parts of the film are quite inspirational and make you want to get out of your chair and put yourself through your paces in a gym as soon as possible! The final fight itself is a pretty exciting sequence but, given the fact that the film shows us that Drago has an impossibly strong punching-power, one finds it rather hard to believe that Rocky could still be standing after fifteen seconds let alone fifteen rounds. Rocky IV is totally unrealistic, totally simple-minded&#133;. and totally entertaining if you look upon it as a guilty pleasure!

You need to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate many films, otherwise they just don't click. But it was quid pro quo for the crappy sci-fi and horror and offbeat arty-type films I like to watch occasionally. From all I'd heard about the singing, I thought this film was going to be a musical. So when I realised this wasn't a musical, had Jane Horrocks, Michael Cane and Jim Broadbent in it, I thought it couldn't be all bad. The film seems to have been accepted as a real peach. Sadly it's not, but instead more of a curates egg - good in parts. The singing is good - but not exceptional enough to carry the film on it's own. Michael Cane puts in a very classy performance, and Jane Horrocks certainly does a job with the lines she was given. Jim Broadbent has a marginal, but significant role. Ewan McGregor, does OK with his 5 minutes but his character's involvement after the first 10 minutes seems to be a bit of an afterthought. Annette Badland, is a really excellent actress with a wide range(Archers and Dr Who fans will know this), and was wasted on this part, though she plays it well. Brenda Blethyn must have been told play an actress who is hamming up a performance as a busty irritating Hilda Ogden on speed. If so, she did a very good job. Somehow it just felt as if they had rehearsed their roles separately, and the director has then taken the first cut on every shoot to get it over with as quickly as possible.

Crowe's sharp script handles delicate topics such as sex, drugs and finding employment without ever preaching to its audience, whilst still managing to be both touching and funny. Add brilliant performances from practically all involved and Fast Times is absolutely unmissable, especially for anyone who grew up in the 80s (the film is a great reminder of the decade that taste forgot the soundtrack, the clothes, the video games, the hairstyles everything about Fast Times oozes 80s style&#151;or lack of it).Although, on the surface, the movie might seem rather aimless at times, meandering from one character to another at whim, there is a central story that runs through it all Stacy (played by the very cute Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a teenager desperate to learn about sex and, guided by her (seemingly) more experienced friend, Linda (Phoebe Cates at her most gorgeous), she samples the delights of carnal love without a thought for the consequences. Enevitably winding up pregnant, she decides to get an abortion, but fails to get help from the irresponsible guy who knocked her up.Other minor story lines run parallel to Stacy's, but they mostly exist to provide light relief; Sean Penn's stoner surfer (surely the template for Keanu Reeve's entire career) constantly upsetting his teacher and Forest Whitaker's football star who believes that the rival team he is due to play trashed his car, provide some of the funnier moments.And of course no review of this film would be complete without a mention of possibly the greatest topless scene in movie history (OK, I may be slightly biased, since I'm a die-hard Phoebe Cates fan); Brad imagines Linda emerging from a swimming pool, popping off her bikini top and giving him a full-on lip lock. As far as I'm concerned, Fast Times is worth watching for this moment alone (although I find it slightly off-putting that Brad is busy jerkin' the gherkin during this scene!). And if that wasn't enough, Jennifer Jason Leigh joins in the fun and flips hers out during both of her sex scenes.A modern classic that is worth watching time and time again, Heckerling's movie is a surefire winner from start to finish. Now if only they would make a sequel (Ridgemont High School Reunion, perhaps) gathering together the original cast and crew (Phoebe Cates could come out of retirement for this, surely), I would be one very happy bunny.

We had a second run theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or 50 cents before 2 o'clock, so I know I saw it at least a dozen times (it played at the theater for about 3 months). My Father coached little league for years for my older Brother and myself. Both are now deceased and I finally took a view at the DVD this week after not having seen it in more than 2 decades. To call it memory evoking is an understatement.Dad was neither a Buttermaker or a Turner as a coach. He would come right from work to the field and would be knocking out balls for fielding practice with his dress pants, Florshiem shoes, and always puffing that pipe filled with Middelton's cherry-blend tobacco. We won our share of games and he always made it a priority that everyone played, and that the game was first and foremost, fun. We had our share of Turner's in our leagues, and dad disliked those types to no end. I don't know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name, they would ask Did your dad coach little league? I had him one year as a kid, he was such a cool guy to play for. Dad thought that BEARS was a bit over the top with the drinking and language, but always admitted that gave him more laughs than any movie he had seen.I never saw any of BEARS sequel's, the TV show, or the 2005 remake. There was just no point. Without Matthau, O'Neal, or Morrow, I'm sure they are as substandard as can be.BEARS really pushed the envelope for it's time, forever shattering the Disneyesque mode of kid-films. What was inappropriate for 1976 is now intolerable, and deservedly so. But it is those attributes that makes the film so unique.I think the character that stands out the most for me is Roy Turner, having been the son of a coach-dad. I always left the theater loving dad even more for not being like him. Turner gave us a look at what I call Lombardi-isim. Vic Morrow was such a great actor. It was hard seeing him playing a villain character when I always thought of him as the heroic Sgt. Saunders of COMBAT. When the championship game is over and the Yankees win, I picture that huge trophy sitting in an apartment years later, collecting dust and being just about as worthless as the wood and plastic it's made of. Still in the possession of a bitter old lonely man wondering what happened with his family.Some time back, I spent a lazy Sunday just driving around and came across a league game of 13-14 year olds. I felt compelled to stop and watch a few innings. Oh how things have changed. The game chatter has been replaced with vulgar trash-talking. I saw a verbal exchange between a pitcher and hitter that led to a head hunting pitch. Nothing was done about it, and on the next pitch the batter took one to the helmet. The batter ended up being OK (I guess helmet technology has come a long way thank goodness), and the pitcher was ejected.

Throughout the movie Schindler comes with a keen nose for women but it fades out as he gets more and more involved with paying off his money to save more lives. It's all filled with dramatic scenes, the scene when the German trooper pours a full wad of golden teeth is a good example, but I guess it's been stuffed with those seen a little bit too much sometimes. An interesting point is the three different scenes that the movie turns into color while the rest of it is black and white; these are the moments of redemption.The music is masterfully composed, it's one hell of an impressing piece of art; You have no idea how many times I myself listen to those tracks. The music is so original and has unbelievable harmony with those scenes. Last fifteen minutes are the best when the Germans are leaving and Oskar's about to get arrested. The whole sentimental moments he gets through and Stern's sympathy is just unforgettable, also the scene where the worker's all are moving to where they're gonna live along with the music is the image of unity, sorrow and victory.

Also, there are too many usages of the Lord's name in vain, mainly said by Chris Cooper's character. It also took a bit to accept Matt Damon as some physically-rough spy since his image was not that prior to this film.OVERALL - A good movie that is part of my collection.

In this wonderful film, we see all seven deadly sins play out against one of the most incredible backdrops ever put on camera. Virtually every shot could be framed and hung on your wall as a fine piece of art. Malick even shows us he knows how to film a pheasant hunt!The story, though at times swallowed up by the cinematography, is also pretty compelling. Richard Gere is the main focus. He plays a down-on-his-luck laborer from the dirty world of pre-WW1 industrialized Chicago. After a dispute with a foreman, which we see but don't really hear, Gere kills the man and is forced to flee the area. Along with him are his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and his kid sister (Linda Manz). The three of them hop on a train, and before you know it, they all have a jobs harvesting wheat on a seemingly boundless Texas farm. The work is difficult to be sure, but once the owner of the farm (Sam Shephard) notices Adams, things take an unexpected turn. All along, Gere has told everyone that Adams is his sister rather than his girlfriend. Shephard likes Adams enough to let the three of them stay on after the harvest is done. Gere overhears the Farmer talking to a doctor in which it is apparently revealed that he has only a year to live. Gere urges Adams to marry the farmer so hopefully the three of them will get his money after he quickly passes. Adams agrees, setting the table for nothing but tragedy and betrayal.The story is narrated by Linda Manz who plays Gere's kid sister. In her words and in her voice we hear clear evidence of just what kind of difficult lives the three of them have lived, and what a wonderful opportunity their new situation seems at first to provide. Her character is one of the most authentic that this critic has seen in a film in many years. She even has an odd beauty about her, if the camera catches her in the proper light. Notice one scene in particular when she is watching a friend jump a train and the sun is setting behind her.Gere, Adams, and Shephard are also as good as ever. It would be so easy for their performances to get lost within the aesthetic beauty of this film, yet they stand out in well-defined characters. I don't recall us ever being told Shephard's name in the film. He's only referred to as the farmer. Is he really dying? We can never be quite sure. Does Adams really love Gere or Shephard? Maybe. Maybe not. There is much left to the imagination about each of these characters. Towards the end, all hell breaks loose, as you might expect. Secrets are found out, fortunes are lost, and lives are taken. The last fifteen minutes look like something out of the book of revelations, as they were most likely intended to. And for some of the characters, new lives are forged, but they are another story. And it's a story we can only imagine. Days of Heaven is a triumph on all levels. It is simply unforgettable.

That looks terrific (and nostalgic for Russian people). I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies. Here there's a lot of this stuff. It's quite amazing watching the characters falling\/jumping\/running\/driving through all manner of panes.All three movies are great. There is no down-slide in the quality - it's a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts (and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies - that's also excellent and keeps continuity up).Each movie can be described in a few words No.1 - great (in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - raging (Jackie is really off the hook here) and painful (Jackie gets tortured); No.3 - unbelievable (the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should a lot of guns and explosions be mentioned?).As to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others.It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again (at least by me). Its place is in top 10 among action jewels. Yes, to me it is a trilogy. Further parts are of no interest, while they simply cannot keep the same pace.A solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

Brusati takes the audience through the life of an illiterate southern Italian immigrant as he tries to find refuge in the economic system of Switzerland in order to earn enough money to support him self and that of his so called families back home in Italia. As he progresses through the story unusual problems arise that involve differences in culture as well as a specific stereotype problems created by the society and even by himself. Threw out the film Nino (Nino Manfredi) is thrown into situations that arise because of his lack of a formal education and of his difference in cultural practices. For instance in a spectacular scene ware Nino is confronted by a Swiss police inspector (Giorgio Cerioni) who presents Nino with a photograph of himself urinating in public, his cultural differences are evident. But at first the inspector tells Nino that he has committed an obscene act in public. Nino is appalled by the accusation, but when the inspector tells him that the act was of him taking a pepe in public Nino is Lost and can not see why the act was so offensive that he should be fired for the act alone. What is missing is that in Nino's culture of uneducated southern Italians (hicks) the act is a trivial one and an obscene act is much more sever, infect Neno rebuttals that he has not done an obscene act in private for some time. This and a plethora go to show the distance that Nino was from the members of his surrounding communities. Finally after trying to assimilate into the Swiss culture Nino gives up and decides to change his physical appearance to better resemble the traditional blond hair. When he travels into a pup for a drink he does not know how to answer the water. When a soccer game between the Italian team and the Swedish team appears on the television Nino tries to hide his indignation of the Swiss towards himself and root for the Swiss team. To all that are in the pup the fact that Nino is not a Native German speaker is in explicitly evident. He is ultimately rejected from the society and is imprisoned ware when he is released his blond hair was cut off. This further goes to illustrate his lack of acceptance from the members of the Swedish society. But when her tries to return to Italy, he abandons the train and returns to Switzerland. Throughout his struggle Nino is constantly rejected and a pone boarding the train that will take him back to Italy he is reminded of the stereotypical cultural influence of the fellow train occupancy as they brake out into song. This further goes to demonstrate his unwillingness to return to the foreboding family back home and reaffirms his belief that wail he may not be educated he is at least trying to make ends meet. But one must wonder if he were smarter why did he not go to the Italian speaking part of Switzerland or after a few years why he could not speak more German than the hand full of words he admitted to know. But all in all the stories goes to show that racism and prodigies are not always the solution and that wail one may be illiterate that the circumstances that perspired against that person may or may not lead that individual full circle. This film has much more to say and I, the writer do not have the space to elaborate. For example there is the social implications of the forged friendship of the Italian Industrialist and Nino. But for all purposes this film encourages those who take the time to watch the film to engulfed ourselves in Nino's struggles and to relate to Nino's desperation and a lack of social mannerism and lack of cultural adaptability.

I love the 3 villains, but truthfully they should have been portrayed as rougher and someone we would all be scared of, at times you can only laugh, especially at Non.

You definitely can tell the difference between some of the scenes shot by Richard donner and the scenes shot by richard lester.

One of them is a former competitor and champion. But she hit bottom, literally, and can't get on the bike again. So that's the plot. Get her back in competitive women's surfing.She and her two friends work as maids in one of the hotels. She has a younger sister who goes to a local school, and generally acts up. But she's a cutie, too. They all are, basically. So it's around February, and the NFL Pro Bowlers come to town. There's the QB and his lineman, presumably from his own team. The QB sort of looks the part, because QBs generally are not that built. They're not all Terry Bradshaw. And the offensive lineman sometimes can have a belly and still be all-Pro - think Larry Allen. So I found the casting just barely believable in that. And she and the QB sort of hit it off. And eventually she offers, with the help of her friends, to teach them how to surf.It's a comic scene after scene as they learn to surf. But the point is to make the payoff. She goes to his hotel room, and he practically propositions her with a wad of bills. But she takes it home, pays the rent, etc, and we're on to the competition. Of course, she starts having sex with the QB, too. But it's for love, not the money. Certainly not any suggestion of actual marriage.The heart of the story is the competition. She has to get over her fear. She has to brave a number of waves. And of course - she wins in the end, gets the sponsorship deals, etc. That is success.The film really, that is, didn't have much of a story to tell. The story really was surfing itself, a sort of lifestyle, and that people would devote time to this, and to the competitions. The Pro Bowl backstory, while providing the 'love interest' only served to show their interest in this thing called - surfing.Despite surfers complaining that it wasn't just one big wave ride after another in this film, the film, nonetheless, is all about surfing - because it really is not about anything else. It's light-hearted. The actresses are almost always smiling, which is attractive. It's just a film with a lot of cute scenes, and at least one 'gross-out' scene. And when they do hit the water, there are some clever following shots right into the water showing the 'washing machine' that grabs the surfers who fall.I suppose the actresses have other commitments. I suppose Rodriquez will be about done with, Lost (which looks on the verge of getting cancelled). And I'm sure many would wonder, even though 'Penny' is now much older and very different, if the three other actresses are looking to reprise a Blue Crush II?
