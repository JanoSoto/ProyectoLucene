Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see Psycho 2 and Psycho 3 (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis the stiff and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being The Birds. And the main character being Marion Crane? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise).

The screenplay consists of numerous carefully-crafted speeches practically designed to remind everyone at every moment of what a noble enterprise this film is, and it's hard to ever warm to the characters or the drama when everything remains so schematic. This is the rare movie that feels like it would be more at home on the stage even though it was originally written for the screen.The cast pulls this movie through any rough patches, though. Spencer Tracy and Roy Glenn stand out the most, as two fathers, one white and one black, whose children want to get married. Sidney Poitier plays the black son, saddled with the kind of righteous black man role he could never seem to escape. Of course, just to make sure we all get the point, and agree that a black man can be good enough for a liberal WASP family, he has to be incredibly successful (he's a doctor), educated and articulate, making you wonder why he wants to marry Tracy's dingbat daughter in the first place.

The movie follows Maya (Winona Ryder), a religious Catholic woman who is very spiritual and is a part of a small group of fellow religious people who perform exorcisms, investigate religious mythology, etc. But she becomes convinced that a famous writer, Peter (Ben Chaplin) has been pre-destined since birth to become a leader for Satan, after decoding the writings of an institutionalized man. When she approaches Peter about her findings, he is skeptical, as most would be. He's not religious and isn't a spiritual person by any means. But Maya and Peter both find themselves stuck in the middle of the bizarre happenings that have been predicted, and a final showdown ensues between the forces of good and evil.As far as religious-themed horror films go, this is a really good one. Religious horror films typically tend to get under my skin, it could be because I was raised Catholic, but they have always tended to scare me much more than say a slasher movie would. So, with Lost Souls being a film of this type, it did creep me out a little. The story has been done many times in various different ways (The Omen probably being most notable for this), but what I liked about this film was that it was crafted a little differently and wasn't quite what one would expect. The performances here were great, Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin were both perfect and showed some significant talent. Philip Baker Hall and John Hurt have supporting roles as priests, and they were both also very good. To sum the performances up, the acting was all really wonderful and believable.The cinematography is what really soars in this film though - not surprisingly either, as the director is a cinematographer (who worked on both of Spielberg's Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan) and has won Academy Awards for his work. So naturally, the film looks stunning. Very flashy photography, dark and sometimes almost sepia-toned, and very moody and artistic all at the same time. I really liked the entire movie's 'look'. From what I've read on here it seems like the biggest problem people have with this film is the ending. I personally liked the ending. It was ambiguous. So what? It made you think a little and, while it was a inconclusive, it at least went out with a bang (literally). I've seen other films end in a similar fashion, but I think this film did it pretty well. It was daring and I liked that about it, and it didn't happen too fast.Bottom line - Lost Souls is a notch above most religious thrillers, and is very well acted with some amazing cinematography. While the ending may disappoint some, I thought it was at least fitting to the film and it changed the entire perspective of what had lead up to that point - it ended like that for a reason.

However, these characters are always made to be so funny to the point where it doesn't matter that they are such damn typical bored middle-class Americans, with nothing better to do than make problems out of nothing. Everyone is doing it with everyone, like in Melrose Place or some such crap TV show, but Woody Allen cleverly included a bit in the movie where he defends his character's book's indulgence with everyone doing it with everyone. In the film his character justifies this aspect of his book by saying that it's an exaggeration serving the purpose of more easily making its point (which is fair enough; I've always agreed that exaggeration is one of the best ways of making any point). Clever, indirect defense. There is also great irony in the film concerning the real-life situation between him and Farrow right after the completion of the film. Examples; 1) Farrow asks him early on in the film whether he is hiding something from her(!), 2) Allen falls for a twenty year-old (admittedly, we know Allen finds 20 too old), 3) they eventually split up in the end of the film, 4) Allen's character says to the camera that he often involves himself with women which he shouldn't be getting involved with. PURE IRONY, in wake of the scandal regarding his present wife (and former adopted daughter), Soon-Yi. The overly casual style of the film, typical of his movies, is a little too much at times but one gets used to it after the first ten-twenty minutes. The camera work? What camera work? Allen tried so hard to make it super-casual that he decided that not only did the actors have to look like as though they weren't playing roles, but he also must have told the cameraman to pretend he wasn't working on a picture but instead just filmed the family cat falling off a table or something like that. The camerawork looks at times as though it's been put into the hands of a drunk, or a playful chimp - or a drunk playful chimp. I'm referring to the ever-annoying hand-held-camera shtick. However, in all fairness, the wobbly motions of the camera don't irritate all the time. A small plus is that there are no left-wing political statements - which is a miracle considering Pollack's involvement (and W.Allen isn't exactly an anti-Socialist, either). A small minus is the attempt to interrupt the plot with documentary-style sequences where the film's characters give their explanation about (past) events. (Here Allen's obsession with Bergman's dull movies becomes apparent.) It doesn't work because it's trying so hard to look and sound like documentary footage - too much casualness can get irritating; with one exception though the sequences in which Farrow's ex-husband describes her very funny. Another thing why is this film considered a comedy-drama? Where's the drama then? I don't see anything dramatic about bored middle-class morons bitching about their relationships &#150; sorry, but I can only laugh at this; so, to me - if you like - both the film's comedy and drama bits are funny. Judy Davis is the standout in a very effective cast. Neeson is okay\/bland as usual. Pollack is quite good a far better actor than director. Juliette Lewis is quite miscast; I cannot accept her playing a BRIGHT 20 year-old TALENTED WRITER; she talks like a typical MTV-generation Beverly Hills airhead, and whenever she uses a word longer than two syllables I get the impression she had never heard of it before reading the script.

WATCH THE MOVIE and make up your own mind. and as you watch it...put yourself back in time (pre-Terminator, pre-Star Wars, pre-Lost Ark, pre-Matrix, pre-Snakes On A Plane) and imagine how people from that era actually saw---and loved, that movie. if you can manage that, you'll certainly see the movie's true worth.Salute!

It had a great characterization done by Billy Bob Thornton of a semi-retarded man freed from jail. Unfortunately, all the great potential was destroyed by a poor and inconsistent script. The first sign of flaw was when Thornton's character explained why he was jailed. It was understandable that he killed a man who he believed threatened his Mom and family. However, then he killed his Mom. This made no sense, and indicated that he was a psycho, whom we should not pity. The filmmakers were trying to portray the man in a sensitive light, but in the end they failed. The other characters in the movie were poorly explained. The late John Ritter plays a gay man in a small Arkansas town, who feels a duty to protect a woman and her boy from her boyfriend (Dwight Yoachim). When Ritter's character first meets Thornton's character there is very clear fear of this retarded man on his part. All the fears and stereotypes are there. After Ritter reveals to the retarded man that he is gay, he falls apart and becomes totally empathetic. This makes no sense. The gay man would probably still feel threatened and suspicious until he got to know the retarded man better. The Mom is poorly explained. Whom is she? Whom was her husband? What was he like? Why was she so pacific, and took so much from her boyfriend? What was up with her son? He seemed depressed and like he didn't have any friends? Why was this? These things are never explained. The boyfriend (Yoachim) is poor and stereotypically portrayed. He is the bad guy, abusive boyfriend. No attempt is given to explain why, and even much about why he is a threat to justify the ending of the film. Why were the cops never called in? Even in backwoods Arkansas, in the 90s cops are called at some point. The filmmakers could have at least showed that the cops were overburden and apathetic. At least the cops could have made an appearance and basically did nothing. Why wasn't there more suspicion about the retarded man? He killed his Mom for no really justifiable reason. Why let a dangerous man walk around with your boy? That isn't today's World. People are absolutely nuts about these kind of things. Basically, they all just trusted the guy. They also know that he killed a man because he thought he was a danger to his family. Okay. So, let the guy stay in a dysfunctional home with a violent tempered boyfriend.

The ending would have been much more meaningful if Thornton's character restrains himself, and the police arrive late to a scene where the boyfriend kills the Mom and her boy. That would have caused the audience to really think about the issue of domestic violence. After all, this was an art film. Why have the sell-out Hollywood ending.

Thus adding a whole new layer of depth to what could've been a sub-par horror film.The idea is simple. Jeff Goldblum is the scientist Seth Brundle, who after a what appeared as an successful experiment in the fields of teleportation finds himself slowly turning into a half human half fly hybrid. Gena Davis plays Veronica Quaife, Brundle's girlfriend and also former girlfriend of the third major character in the film, Stathis Borans played by John Gets.From the beginning to the end Cronenberg focuses the movie entirely into these three characters. Establishing a sort of love-triangle between them as both Brunle and Borans develop or still have feelings towards Quaife. While at the same time facing their own deeper fears as the transformation from man to ... something else, begins slowly digging at Brundle's humanity. And it is here where Cronenberg excels with his ability to properly direct human reaction to situations that are often found unnatural. Employing a turn in character focus that causes the viewer's own established empathy towards them to change. While in the first half we saw the developing relationship between Brundle and Quaife with Borans's character portrayed in a more anti-heroic role, in the second part we witness a complete switch of roles as Brundle is becoming more and more distanced from human feelings and logic. Culminating in the last scene with him finally realizing what he has become and what must be done to stop himself. Even then, at that point we don't see him as the beaten villain but as a casualty of his own personal desires.Cronenberg sets a dark serious tone to the film and he never changes the pace. Even though the plot outline might sound as something found in the B-movie standard of horror, there isn't a single scene that could be considered cheesy or weakly executed. The effects also help in that matter, with the breathtaking design of The Fly. It is really no wonder why this movie won an Oscar for make-up. But it should have won for a lot more...People who are searching for a horror film that delivers far more then some cheap scares should give The Fly a try.

The answer is a predictable and resounding no.And don't you fall into the trap that he doesn't want to make a conventional high-quality movie. Like all outcasts and misfits (I'm not referring to his homosexuality, all you Homophobia PC Police spies) he only PRETENDS to revel in making garbage. (Garbage is all he CAN do, so what choice does he have?) Secretly, deep inside him, there is a lonely, ambitious, and quite normal boy who wants to be just as good as Kubrick, Fincher or the Coens. Alas, when you lack even the minimum amount of talent required...So, knowing that he can't match any of the masters - not even enough to get one of his fingers on the Hollywood Walk Of Infamy - he indulges in being the rebel. Many misfits go the rebel route whether it be punk music, hippy crap, or maverick cinema. Anything to get attention.(Maverick cinema the area of movie la-la land often inhabited by lesser talents who scream for attention by being outrageous because no-one would notice them if they placed their unskilled hands at something worthwhile.) A largely crap cast in a badly written and even more badly directed crap film. It's John Waters, that untalented (and pretending to be proud of it) indie director, so it's no shock.ONCE AGAIN Waters tries his clumsy hand at satire, a genre which he neither understands nor is capable of doing in his wildest dreams. Satire is at its best when it's subtle, not to mention clever - and not to mention funny, but Waters once again takes a stab at it with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.His attack on mainstream Hollywood is to an extent in order - but look where it's coming from from the gay\/transvestite\/indie\/porn\/trash-for-the-sake-of-it scene which totally overestimates itself while ignoring the obvious fact that while Hollywood does turn out big amounts of filmic garbage every year, it also produces a couple of gems now and then.Waters ridiculing Hollywood is a bit like Ted Bundy complaining that Hitler was a genocidal psychopath.What about the indie scene? (And I mean the very low-budget type.) While a lot of its movies are watchable, very rarely do they come up with a great film, and in spite of the fact that hundreds, even 1000s, are being dumped into the internet and seedy cinemas every year. Most of these movies delve in clichés, trite PC characters, and most of them are about meaningless relationships between very boring people and their uneventful environments.Don't get me wrong I'm not anti-gay, and I even find Waters likable as a person, i.e. the way he presents himself in interviews, but affability is a very long way away from making him a great director.To see just how pathetic Waters's taste in movies is, he shows us by the way of tattoos of various directors on the arms of the cinema terrorists who kidnap Griffith (all supposedly representing the true independent directors through the ages) Spike Lee, Sam Fuller, Otto Preminger, Passolini, and a few others. What a sad bunch. Not a single one of these dolts belongs on the directorial Olymp, and - obviously\/predictably - some of them have to be gay. Kubrick's greatest mistake was not being gay, otherwise he too wouild have had the honour\/privilege of being featured as a tattoo on one of Waters's retarded terrorists.You wouldn't expect Waters to worship Kubrick, Scorsese, or Fincher, now would you. Waters makes fun of Patch Adams and Forrest Gump, which is to be encouraged, but these are easy targets to ridicule, and he does so in an inept, dull manner. Besides, the alternative he offers us - though quite different - isn't any better just look at his movies! Waters hasn't made a single mediocre movie yet, and I mean that in the reverse sense, of course he has yet to RISE to the elusive heights of mediocrity, for even that seems like an unattainable goal for him. His films are plain AWFUL.The gags are dumb, the humour is beyond America Pie-level. The acting is manic, amateurish, and well... wateresque. Another water constant is that all his flicks start off bad, and then get progressively worse. The script seems to melt away as the time passes in a Waters movie; things get even unfunnier, even dumber, and even more manic. If you enjoy French banana-peel comedy, you might disagree...The cast is blah Griffith, Dorff, Witt. I can understand why unknown actors would snatch a chance to appear in a Waters film (i.e. any film), but there is no excuse for any of the more or less established faces to appear here every single actor who says yes to starring in a Waters movie is a complete and utter moron - no ifs and buts about it. Did they actually think they were improving their CVs by working with yet another master? How clueless can you get...

What a sad bunch. Not a single one of these dolts belongs on the directorial Olymp, and - obviously\/predictably - some of them have to be gay. Kubrick's greatest mistake was not being gay, otherwise he too wouild have had the honour\/privilege of being featured as a tattoo on one of Waters's retarded terrorists.You wouldn't expect Waters to worship Kubrick, Scorsese, or Fincher, now would you. Waters makes fun of Patch Adams and Forrest Gump, which is to be encouraged, but these are easy targets to ridicule, and he does so in an inept, dull manner. Besides, the alternative he offers us - though quite different - isn't any better just look at his movies! Waters hasn't made a single mediocre movie yet, and I mean that in the reverse sense, of course he has yet to RISE to the elusive heights of mediocrity, for even that seems like an unattainable goal for him. His films are plain AWFUL.The gags are dumb, the humour is beyond America Pie-level. The acting is manic, amateurish, and well... wateresque. Another water constant is that all his flicks start off bad, and then get progressively worse. The script seems to melt away as the time passes in a Waters movie; things get even unfunnier, even dumber, and even more manic. If you enjoy French banana-peel comedy, you might disagree...The cast is blah Griffith, Dorff, Witt. I can understand why unknown actors would snatch a chance to appear in a Waters film (i.e. any film), but there is no excuse for any of the more or less established faces to appear here every single actor who says yes to starring in a Waters movie is a complete and utter moron - no ifs and buts about it.

The answer is a predictable and resounding no.And don't you fall into the trap that he doesn't want to make a conventional high-quality movie. Like all outcasts and misfits (I'm not referring to his homosexuality, all you Homophobia PC Police spies) he only PRETENDS to revel in making garbage. (Garbage is all he CAN do, so what choice does he have?) Secretly, deep inside him, there is a lonely, ambitious, and quite normal boy who wants to be just as good as Kubrick, Fincher or the Coens. Alas, when you lack even the minimum amount of talent required...So, knowing that he can't match any of the masters - not even enough to get one of his fingers on the Hollywood Walk Of Infamy - he indulges in being the rebel. Many misfits go the rebel route whether it be punk music, hippy crap, or maverick cinema. Anything to get attention.(Maverick cinema the area of movie la-la land often inhabited by lesser talents who scream for attention by being outrageous because no-one would notice them if they placed their unskilled hands at something worthwhile.) A largely crap cast in a badly written and even more badly directed crap film. It's John Waters, that untalented (and pretending to be proud of it) indie director, so it's no shock.ONCE AGAIN Waters tries his clumsy hand at satire, a genre which he neither understands nor is capable of doing in his wildest dreams. Satire is at its best when it's subtle, not to mention clever - and not to mention funny, but Waters once again takes a stab at it with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.His attack on mainstream Hollywood is to an extent in order - but look where it's coming from from the gay\/transvestite\/indie\/porn\/trash-for-the-sake-of-it scene which totally overestimates itself while ignoring the obvious fact that while Hollywood does turn out big amounts of filmic garbage every year, it also produces a couple of gems now and then.Waters ridiculing Hollywood is a bit like Ted Bundy complaining that Hitler was a genocidal psychopath.What about the indie scene?

Get it at Amazon.)There are a lot of dogs in this movie. And there are some dog-fighting scenes that dog lovers may not want to see. Be forewared, a lot of dog blood is spilled.And why? Does director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has some kind of obsession with dogs? I don't know but according to something I read at IMDb there's a blurb at the beginning of the film stating that no animals were harmed in making the film. I played the DVD back, but I couldn't find the statement. I wonder. They sure looked harmed, and at any rate must have been sedated for some of the scenes. There is a short documentary called Los perros de'Amores perros (2000) that explains it all for those who are worrying about the dogs. Personally I'm not too worried because I very much doubt that Inarritu would make a film involving so many dogs and allow them to be hurt.Anyway, this is a violent movie with a lot of the violence happening to the dogs. It was Inarritu's first film, or at least his first big film. He has since made, most notably, 21 Grams (2003). As in 21 Grams, there are three stories here, connected only by chance and the dogs. The opening scene is a car chase in which, we later learn, the three stories collide. There was also an accident in 21 Grams that help to hold the stories together.Here we have (1) the story of Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is in love with his older brother's wife, Susana (Vanessa Bache); (2) the story of El Chivo (Emilio Chevarria), one-time guerilla fighter, now a hit man who dresses and behaves like a homeless person; and (3) the story of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who leaves his wife and children for a lanky runway model, Valeria (Goya Toledo). All three stories include dogs. Octavio's dog Cofi becomes a big winner at the dog fights and makes money for Octavio which he gives to Susana to save so that they can run away together. El Chivo lives with four dogs, and Valeria has a little dog Richie that somehow (I can't figure out how) gets stuck under the floor and put upon by rats after it chases a ball through a hole in the floor.Presumably this film shows us the violence that is endemic in Mexican society, perhaps inherited from the Aztecs and the Conquistadors, who were pretty bloody in their time. Or perhaps Inarritu knows that violence plays with the young American audiences that go to the theaters, and what he has is a nice commingling of purpose. One thing for sure, Inarritu knows how to make a film that engages the audience with not just violence but the clash of character and aspiration. A lot of the credit for the success of this film must go to the outstanding cast, in particular Emilio Chevarria and Gael Garcia Bernal.Best, most original scene when El Chivo leaves the two men tied up with the gun equal distance between them, just out of reach.Bottom line not for the squeamish.

It's rich   in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors; rich in   characters with all good-hearted men and women of character; rich in   love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in   storytelling.    Yes, it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's, and not the   sort of thing I would normally enjoy, but this movie was so well-done   that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modern-era of   film-making (late '60s to today), it is always a pleasure to see a   totally clean and nice movie.    The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon   play wholesome roles, something they don't always do, but they do it   well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets   decent screen time. Ryder's character - the more independent,   feminist-type thinker - will always get preference anyway in a   Hollywood film. My favorite of the Little Women was Beth, the most   kind and compassionate one. Claire Danes' innocent face won me over.   The real beauty was the grown-up Amy, played by Samantha Mathis. Most   of her role, however, is seen as a young girl and played by Kirsten   Dunst, who has gone on to become a pretty famous actress. The other   sister is Meg, who is a solid, conservative woman and is played by   Trini Alvarado. Her role is the smallest of the four girls.    Sarandon's Mrs. Abagail 'Marmee' March, holds everyone together as   the mother and head of the household while her husband is off fighting   at War. She looks more like an older sister.    I liked the March daughters' suitors in here, too. First there was   Laurie or Teddy as he also was called by the girls. A young   Christian Bale played him. Then there was Gabriel Byrne as Friedrich   Bhaer. It was a bit strange hearing this Irishman play a part that   required a German accent. Eric Stoltz plays Meg's future husband, John   Brooke. He starts off as someone with a very stiff personality but   soon changes into a warm and good husband.    If this film appears slow in the first 20-30 minutes, hang in there   because it gets better and better as it goes along.

Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap shocks and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f\/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry Mom! (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major disappointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all.

With pretty much nothing to work with other than a great deal of talent these folks turned out a really wonderful piece of work. Given all of that this flick has no real downside for me. Its well put together, the plot is a very good one, the whole thing flows well, and Heather Donahue in particular shines. This became an instant favorite for me. I like the way the whole thing is handled. The scene sequences and how they're done work particularly well. The movie comes off in a very natural way. Its exactly what I would expect to happen if that sort of thing happened. Which makes its believable while you're into it. These folks set a standard here. Now no budget is no excuse for no quality. No quality reflects only a lack of imagination or talent. And there is PLENTY of both involved in The Blair Witch Project.

It starts with Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson commenting about how uncool they think everything is. I could immediately identify with the kind of denigrating attitude towards the world that they have. Certainly, many of the people I hung out with in high school had that same attitude, including myself to some degree.Add to that, a remarkable performance by Steve Buscemi, one of my favorite actors. I don't think anybody could have plays Seymour better. He is a nerd and he knows it and until he meets Birch's character, Enid, he is actually pretty comfortable with it. Seymour is a sympathetic character, not one Buscemi get to play very often, but he is really terrific. His scenes with Birch are sweet but not so much to make you hurl (I don't know where that came from).Scarlett Johansson's part is more underwritten but even in the few important scenes she has, she is able to convey the changes she goes through.Even the smallest part have some kind of edge to them, like the man sitting at a discontinued bus stop and the manager at the convenience store (Seinfeld guest star, Brian George). The always great Bob Balaban has two or three hilarious scenes as Enid's father trying to connect with her and failing miserably.This is definitely an actor's picture but the director, Terry Swigoff does a good job of not overdoing it with clever dialog and weird camera angles and still making the film as close to mainstream film-making as you can get and still make it feel like an independent movie. Look at the picture, Storytelling, for a complete opposite side to independent film-making.

While it wasn't as outrageous as Mrs. Doubtfire, it was still a fun and realistic movie that made you laugh and feel.Robin plays Adrien, a marine who has been brought to Vietnam actually for a radio show due to his comedic reputation and he blows his audience away with great sketches along with the best music of our time. But Adrien is also somewhat playing with fire when he decides to read unofficial news that shouldn't be broadcast according to the military, which disappoints Adrien since the audience is being held back from the truth. He also makes some Vietnese friends, one of which he finds out to be part of the enemy while he is in love with the enemy's sister.Good Morning, Vietnam really shined Robin William's talents and strength towards being a star. He and the cast brought together a great comedy mixed with very dark drama. It had great acting and a unique story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy.
