I can pretty much assure that number is pretty small. I personally love to play chess, but if you were to force me to sit and watch people do it, I'd feel like committing suicide after the first thirty minutes. That's about how I felt watching Sleuth. The entire movie is absolutely nothing but two men playing a dull game from the opening to the closing. There camera never leaves the house for the entire runtime. The most diversity in the entire movie is some minor clothing changes and some facial expressions. The entire movie is straight-up dialogue and nothing else. The entire movie is two long, dull scenes, with one scene change near the middle. If you have less of an attention span than the average person with Down syndrome, you'll be bored to the point of nausea long before the 30-minute mark. There is about as much entertainment value in Sleuth as there is in watching a tree stump rot, and that may even be an overstatement, because at least doing that you can use your own imagination. Here, the most imagination you get is two men, four walls, and an insane amount of bland conversation. If that describes what you consider an entertaining movie, Sleuth will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure.People would argue that the conversation scenes I reference carry the clever plotting. In other words, the conversation scenes carry a cute, predictably plot-twisted story revolving around all the clichés that we've seen since the camera was invented. There is nothing clever about the plot. Sure it has a couple twists that will make you shed an Awe, that was cute! smile, but they're the same plot twists you've seen countless times. This is a clichéd murder story, folks. It's not some hyper-original idea. If you saw a single Sherlock Holmes episode as a kid, you've seen everything this movie has to offer. If the plot were truly clever or creative, it would do something new or different.The other problem with the plot&#151;if you even call it a plot; I don't&#151;is that it's so predictable. No, you may not have any lead-ons as to who-killed-who or who's-dead-who's-not, but does it really matter? The outcome is always the same. You're always told the answer, and there's always only two options. It's the most basic immature plot line known to man. I've seen cartoons that put this plot to thumb-sucking shame. Who really cares anymore? I overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you're 80-years-old. It's ineffective. It's pointless. Even if you force a laugh, you still feel annoyed.I understand this movie was made in the 70s. People will defend it by saying, There was nothing like it when it came out! and they're dead wrong. All their doing is defending their deep sense of nostalgia. In reality, this movie was just as unoriginal in 1972 as it is in 2009. And do you know what's sadder? Movies just like it are still being made, and they're still getting acclaim. It makes me sick. We don't need another paper-thing whodunit murder mystery with the same predictable results. What the mystery genre needs is maturity. Instead of pumping out more kindergarten level plot line movies like this, why not actually think of an, you know, actual STORY to support the mystery. That's something directors\/writers obviously didn't get back in the 70s, and it's something they still don't get today. Instead of focusing on plots, why not focus on STORY? Overall, Sleuth is a complete waste of time. It has a couple of intelligent high-brow lines, but I could get those from my dying grandfather. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to hear them? And, similarly, I could get the same predictable level of mystery of watching this movie from playing the Clue board game&#151;alone. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to do so? The more I think about it, I cannot find a single redeeming value in Sleuth whatsoever. It's long, boring, dull, pointless, lame, slow, uninteresting, paper-thin, predictable, annoying, pathetic . . .And most of all, Sleuth is exactly the same story you've seen hundreds of times, yet it expects you to be enthralled.

I found this film to be funny, sad, thought provoking, and enjoyable, mostly because of the cast and how their characters were written and how they were allowed to develop.Basically, the plot is about a squad of exhausted US Army enlisted men during World War 2, sent back to the rear for some rest and relaxation, but ordered to stay in camp, who are then given the chance by an enterprising PFC (Clint Eastwood as PFC Kelly) to score a major heist, behind enemy lines and unknown to the Allied command - if they can get everything coordinated. The movie tells the tale of if and how the plan was carried out and what unexpected obstacles were presented during the operation and how they dealt with them.I'm not going to go into the humor provided by several of the actors (Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, etc). but a couple of things seem to have been missed by others in the basic premise of the plot. Kelly had been a lieutenant but his commission was pulled and he was demoted (busted) for leading a totally successful attack against an objective given to him by his commanding officers. The problem was that the objective was another Allied position which had been misidentified. The character still has the smarts and leadership skills of an officer but is now just a PFC. So he is a victim of a screwed up military. And you can see the tension between his character and that of his ostensible sergeant, Big Joe (Telly Savalas).One note about Sutherland's character Oddball, I'll grant that it is highly unlikely that a character like him existed during WW2, spouting mid to late 60's hippie platitudes. Yet I will also say that during my time in the military, I came across a number of characters that appear as updated versions of the roles played by the other actors. Colonels who were full of it (you wouldn't believe some of the things I saw), lieutenants who ranged from Academy graduate 'strack' troops to the 90 day wonder let's get by as easily as possible kind. Sergeants who ranged from mad dogs to pushovers, and any number of conniving enlisted men. And I've also seen the committed, caring, let's get it done and move on types.I can also easily understand how the lower ranking types on the other side, can with a little help, see how they have more in common with their enemy counterparts then with their senior officers, because I witnessed it. And yes, I've also seen humor through even the most trying of situations.

I can see the men in Big Joe's squad understanding exactly what he means when he talks about so much luck, and I can see the men also understanding Kelly's well thought out plans &#150; if their luck runs out, it runs out, but at least for a few moments they can control a tiny bit of their own destiny, because they can see all too well the results of the orders that resulted in Kelly's original platoon completely wiping out everyone there. The important thing is they (and we) can see both the strengths and weaknesses of both characters.The movie was one of the more enjoyable war\/caper\/antiwar films I've seen and except for how loud the music was at times, I would highly recommend it.

And when the script found no solution, they trumped up one, any one, for the happy end. The real problem is that they had to fill the in-between with highly disgusting moments (to make you laugh !). Its dark twisted sense of humor killed even the scarce clever points. It got eventually obnoxious feel that suits a personality of a horror movie more than a slapstick comedy. And what could be more embarrassing for a comedy when you say after it  I didn't laugh even one time through it ?!I believe there is a specific wisdom that we're created to live a certain time in the bathrooms, long or short time it's always limited, so I don't believe that by any chance we had to get our natural time in the bathroom and in the movies also! Simply I was unfortunate enough to watch this in a theater and by virtue of its loyal determined toilet humor; it transformed the place into a toilet, being an actual crap ! So while the fabricated happy end, when you see the colorful food, you have to feel sick hard, because this very movie, during all of its time, succeeded at giving you the nausea already !Imagine what kind of movie that pushes you to hate its whole cast ? Because their acting ?, because being in it ? whatever. Truly after experiencing Nathan Lane and Lee Evans in here, I now think twice before viewing anything with their names on it. It was mean just accepting this job in the first place.After 10 years, director Gore Verbinski proved easily how his sense of comedy is mostly fruitless, that's something to say clearly after movies by him like (The Mexican), (The Weather Man), and (Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest) OHH that last one was perfectly a dead comedy.I still remember what I read on its original poster back then, it was some foul opinion for some fool critic, being between parentheses, saying Mousehunt.. The funniest comedy of the year !!!! I think it should have been  The most sick unfunny comedy of the year. At its first scene it enjoys throwing an old man's dead body in the sink, after completing the movie I threw it in the sink myself, it belongs there altogether.Sick world postulates Sick viewers, so (Mousehunt) must be made, must be loved yet not by me.. Not my kind of sickness.. or even close ! I fear one day in the future that one would watch it to sigh sadly while saying Hmm.. they never make 'em as they were.. so innocent like that !.

Because this is a damn bad comedy. A real ugly one. Although it got some good idea, polished cinematography, grand sets, moments of good directing, but nothing can end its loathsome effective sense, to be one of the most seemingly attractive unattractive movies. I told myself don't write about it, not only because all what I have to say is bad things, but also because I don't want originally to bring up the matter of watching it ever again. It's one of those memories that you can get easier in life if you managed to forget it utterly!OK, something had happened in the American cinema's comedies since the 1980s' end ; they became relying basically (and sometimes only) on vomit, fart, excrement, urine or even semen???. I think the success of movies that were pioneer bold at this area such as (The War of the Roses, Dumb and Dumber, The Nutty Professor..) pushed that ahead, or is it another circumstances related to the American society?, the international taste?, or Hollywood producers ?! I can't settle exactly, but I do know that they produce it, and somebody out there just loves it, and surely that somebody is NOT ME!How many sins in here? Many I suppose.

It was just one of those laugh-out-loud movies I needed to see, although I didn't know it when I paid for my movie ticket. I just came to the movie theater not expecting much other than a few pretty-good trailers I saw online, and ended up nearly falling out of my seat laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it.Ben Stiller really nails the character of Derek Zoolander and doesn't miss a beat. Zoolander is an incredibly ignorant individual, but not entirely stupid. His intentions are good, although sometimes misguided, and it makes for some really good comedy. The scene where he throws the miniature model of a building to the ground is still absolutely funny even though I know the scene by heart. Stiller really takes that scene and sells it.Christine Taylor is also incredibly good in her role. This was probably the role for her where she stopped being known as the woman who played Marsha Brady in the movies, yet her resemblance to Maureen McCormack is still very striking. No matter, she played someone who was convincingly smart, and she played a great straight man (or woman) to Stiller and the equally ignorant Owen Wilson.Was this film perfect? Of course not, but I still liked it better than many film critics did at the time. Richard Roeper, a film critic whom I usually agree with, hated this film. Roeper said that the film made fun of male models when they really make fun of themselves in reality, using Fabio as an example. However, I saw this film not so much making fun of male models specifically, or even models themselves, but more the fashion industry and its seemingly self-centered nature. I also thought it was a great and unexpected way for VH1, who partially produced the film, to make fun of their pre-I Love The '80's image. Sure, the celebrity cameos were a bit much at times, but they really didn't overshadow the overall humor and appeal of the movie (at least not to this reviewer).The other problem critics had with this movie was using Malasia as a major plot point, and not a fictional country. In reality, Malasia has been democratic for decades, and is considered a U.S. ally. The critics probably have a point here, but at the same time, Malasia wasn't being made fun of in this movie, nor were there any hurtful, low-brow attempts at humor through racial stereotyping. Using a fictional country probably would have been better, but no movie is perfect.Despite the bad reviews, Zoolander went on to find an audience, particularly when it was released on video. I hear people my age quoting lines from the movie all the time, and the main people in the cast have gone on to bigger and better things.

Gregary Peck is a journalist given an assignment to write a story about anti-Semitism. His Maw, Anne Revere, gives him the idea of pretending to be Jewish himself. His name -- Phil Green -- could be anything. He can now write the story from an emic or inside point of view, like a cultural anthropologist, instead of just using statistics or historical archives. But to make the trick work he must keep the pretense secret from everyone except those who already know him for the shagetz he is -- those in the know include his Maw, his fiancée Dorothy McGuire, his son Dean Stockwell, his editor Albert Dekker, and his visiting friend John Garfield.Well, I'll tell you. The reaction begins popping up all over, including the most unlikely places. Small, itchy kinds of abrasions at first. His secretary, June Havoc, slyly admits she changed her name from Walensky in order to get the job she has. Then his son is called a dirty Jew at school. Then he informs his fiancée that he's simply going to tell everyone I'm Jewish, and is startled by her response -- Oh, but you're NOT. I mean, are you? In a tense scene he confront the manager of a restricted hotel, who bluntly turns him away, leaving him humiliated and enraged. Peck's friend, Garfield, playing a character named Dave Goodman is realistic and reassuring. He's been through it all his life, he says, but Peck is meeting it for the first time so for him it's all telescoped. Peck gets the series finished and it's evidently a knockout for the paper, but his anger has driven away McGuire and ruined their plans for marriage. In the end, through the offices of Garfield, the two are reunited -- but only after McGuire has agreed that one must fight back at anti-Semitism in all its isomorphs, whether small or large.In fact, though, I found myself rather sympathetic towards McGuire's character. In his pursuit of truth, Peck has driven himself half nuts. The slightest HINT of prejudice raises his hackles. He goes about in a constant state of irritation, a walking raw nerve.What he's demanded of McGuire is the impossible. She's going to dish it out. She will from now on object to ethnic jokes among her friends and neighbors and get all serious about things. And her neighbors in Darien, Connecticut, are portrayed as pretty dumb, too. They all seem to be cackling old ladies. One of them inquires of Peck's journalist, Tell me, do you get your ideas first and then write about them? Or do you write first and get your ideas later. You want a WASP stereotype? How about that one. Well, the old biddies aren't much, true, but if McGuire turns as edgy and hostile and intolerant as Peck, she's going to lose them all anyway. She and Peck will wind up like the two boarded-up sisters in Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Those of us in our dotage will remember where a claim to victim status got people during the 1960s when everyone of good taste became intolerant of any sign of discrimination, of jokes or remarks at the expense of any minority group. You couldn't say anything about Jews, Indians, or Brobdignagians (unless you were inside the social borders). That was a nice peaceful gumbaya decade, wasn't it? Yet so many of us seem compelled to find an Indian or a Jew or a dwarf or a woman in his ancestral tree. Why? There's a good deal of moral authority that comes with defining yourself as a victim -- even if you've never been victimized. If a stranger at the next restaurant table mentions something, anything, about whatever disenfranchised group we think we belong to, we can lean over and give him a verbal kick in the pants.Well, that's the anthropologist in me running off at the fingertips. I will now step down from the box. Oops. Thank you.Dorothy McGuire is from Omaha. And I have a question. Why are so many famous actors from Omaha and environs? She grew up there in the 1920s. So did Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, James Coburn, Henry Fonda, and a bunch of others. I did a chi square test of famous performers from Nebraska, as against Oklahoma, Kansas, and North and South Dakota, with an equivalent population. The results were significant. Is it something in the water? The founder effect? Back to the movie, following our usual linear progression. Peck is pretty good. He's hit his stride here as the easy-going man of strong principle. McGuire is breathless and vulnerable and turns in a fine and mostly understated performance. The movie dates, of course. This isn't 1947, thank God, and anti-Semitism is not as rampant as it was then, and perhaps not as rampant then as the movie depicts. It's a bit heavy handed and overly dramatic, despite the reality of the social problem it deals with. But it took guts on everybody's part to make it. The studio moguls of the time were hardly behind this kind of effort, since they had names like Mayer, Zukor, Cohn, and Goldwyn, and Warner, and they were reluctant to draw attention to that fact. Some of the people involved wound up before HUAC and some were blacklisted. A shocker for its time, because nothing like it had really been done before.

Ironically, the first time I saw it, I was disappointed. The problem was that the studios were marketing this film like an action movie, which in many ways it can be, but it's so much more than that. This is the reason why this probably should've been an indie film rather than a major studio one. But anyways, here's what I think of the filmTo me this is not far from a Kubrik or Terry Gilliam film in the sense that it's more than just a movie, it's an experience. A journey into the human soul, into the human condition. And sometimes, this is a dark place. And sometimes it hurts. And sometimes you're running around in the jungle aimlessly, imagining yourself right in the midst of a video game. This is truly a movie that holds up after the years and gets better and better with each viewing. You start to slowly pick up on all the subtle nuances and begin to understand how complex and sophisticated this movie actually is despite all its flaws. And even when it's flawed, it's flawed in the most seductive of ways. Leo is spectacular. Far from the sweet, iconic, almost surreal Jack Dawson, Richard is a real person. He's dark, he's selfish, he's cocky, at times we hate him, at times we love him, he's tortured, tormented, he's a lonely soul in search of redemption. He's the ultimate antihero. I admire Leo DiCaprio for taking on that sort of role right after the madness that was Titanic (the best movie of all times).

One night he is picked up by the cops and charged with two robberies after some witnesses identify him and he cannot provide an alibi. How can he prove his innocence ?In sharp contrast to the glamorous, evocative, stylish thrillers of The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo which adjoin it in Hitchcock's career, The Wrong Man is a deliberately ordinary, unsensational, frighteningly plausible story of mistaken identity. It was based on a true story, no details were altered and it was shot in many of the actual locations in New York where it happened (notably The Stork Club, a famous hangout in midtown Manhattan). What Hitchcock and Fonda achieve here is a disturbingly real, almost documentary-like portrayal of how it feels to be criminalised. And although Manny only spends a brief time in confinement, the terrible bewildering process is depicted with intense detail. Even worse than the trauma of the arrest are the after-effects on his life, specifically his wife's nervous breakdown, his fruitless search to clear his name and his endless money worries (bail, lawyers, doctors). Hitchcock had a pathological fear of being arrested (he never drove a car so he wouldn't get a ticket) and his film gently but firmly reminds us that no matter how robust any justice system is, there is always the capacity for honest mistake. Nobody deliberately maligns Manny - even the witnesses who ID him genuinely think they're doing the right thing - but he and his family are cruelly victimised and only escape via good fortune. Both Fonda and Miles are excellent in the leads; his Everyman performance ranks with The Grapes Of Wrath and 12 Angry Men (his next film), and she is even better than in her much more famous subsequent appearance for Hitchcock in Psycho. The great director proves here, as he did so often in his career, what a gifted range he had as a filmmaker, skilfully adapting his style to best suit the drama and the atmosphere of the piece. Unusually in this film he does not make a cameo appearance, but instead appears in shadow to deliver a brief introduction.

The character is based on a mixture of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one Willie committed. The conflict of both Willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well.Prejean's approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions, she also reaches out to the victims' families, to help them know that the convict did, indeed feel remorse for what they did-effectively aiding both parties.Everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the Death Sentence. It's not my place to say it's right or wrong-in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of Karmic sense, however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days, although costly, makes more sense to me-being stuck in a small room 23\/7 (with one hour of exercise)for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment-they are technically alive, but denied living. Say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required (like Susan Smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake). I find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned.Prejean's point comes through the story very well. She has my respect-she manages to find that balance-she isn't supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accepting what they did. If they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance.Ona final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix parent for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn't apologize for her death. I think the point was that throughout the movie, Poncelet denies killing both kids. There is doubt in Prejean's mind he did both killings-there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death-my thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl-hence Poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did.

She has my respect-she manages to find that balance-she isn't supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accepting what they did. If they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance.Ona final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix parent for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn't apologize for her death. I think the point was that throughout the movie, Poncelet denies killing both kids. There is doubt in Prejean's mind he did both killings-there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death-my thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl-hence Poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did.

He's played by Hayden Christiansen in a style about as wooden as Long John Silver's leg, which means Lucas has turned the greatest villain in cinema history into a whiny kid and a dork in two consecutive movies. Christiansen is astonishingly bad, with line readings that sound like a failed audition for an amateur dramatics society. He instantly sinks Anakin's involvement with Padme without trace.
