The plot was a good one, the actors convincing, even Arnie (although perhaps having 42 words in the entire film helped.)and the action took place largely at night. Five minutes into T2 when Arnie has killed no-one and nicked one guy's sunglasses, I thought *uh-oh* - one-liner ahoy, and sure enough, later one of many such gut-wrenchingly bad lines emerges, delivered with enough lack of Acting ability to cover his compatriots in splinters. Now sometimes a Movie can be salvaged by it's co-stars, but unfortunately although Linda Hamilton is the only member of the cast that emerges with any credibility, the young John Connor is so incredibly irritating that 30 minutes into the film, I wanted to kill him myself. That leaves the quintessential Baddie to sustain some sort of suspense and danger. Alas, James was still obviously obsessed with the morphing techniques he discovered while making The Abyss with the result that we end up with a robot that is supposed to be made up of liquid metal capable of altering it's colour, texture and size, and even reforming itself. All movies of this type call for a certain degree of suspension of disbelief, but this is just ludicrous. Even in non-liquid mode, the new wimpy looking terminator runs around with his head inclined - apparently this is supposed to be frightening.

This film could have been a damn sight better, even with Arnie in the lead, but this seems to have been targeted at a preview audience of teenagers in the mid-west with all the ingredients that they tend to expect.

Now the ending is positive, even hustlers care and friendship triumphs.Phoenix should have gotten an Oscar for this James Dean like characterization, which no one has ever come close to since Dean's death.

His understated interpertation of Scott Favor is masterful.  For me it is hard to separate Reeves from Scottie Favor, he makes the part so natural.  Both Reeves and Phoenix characters are so right on, their story seems true.Van Zant, who wrote and directed this classic, must have had some exposure to hustlers to so clearly understand the lifestyle. Did he use real hustlers for the bit parts? Sure seemed like it to me.Aside from the ending, the best scenes are the funerals and the campfire scenes.  How would you want to be buried, like Scottie's dad, or like Bob? The interplay of the two funerals says so much about the sad state of affairs of Christian America.

Did they have any real feelings for each other or are they just terrific actors? Same question applies to Sal Mineo and James Dean, interestingly Mineo said yes in an interview, he was attracted to Dean.

Also I don't yet understand the choice of Eddie Arnold's 'Cattle Call' (an all time favorite song of mine) early in the film.

There are other important films with great gay scenes (Lion In The Winter, for instance) but a whole film with nothing but gay lifestyles so clearly defined and beautifully portrayed.

Between the sight gags and the innuendo, the message emerged with gathering force throughout the film the fifties were not so pleasant for those whose ideas were not mainstream, and whose ideology didn't conform to the close-mindedness of the times.Images borrowed from many other films depicting the ugly middle-American penchant for intolerance are used throughout Pleasantville, and although a bit too obvious, they worked well enough to trigger a shudder in me.  I thought that the casting of Joan Allen as the robotic Stepford-like wife was a coup, considering her former role as Pat Nixon (in the 1995 film Nixon). William H.
