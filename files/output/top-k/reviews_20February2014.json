A crazed man, shouting in Norwegian, brandishes an assault rifle and tries to kill a husky that has arrived at the camp. In the process he wounds several of the residents, forcing the warden to shoot and kill him. Wondering what the hell that was all about, helicopter pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell) and several others fly over to the Norwegian base. They find it in smouldering ruins, retrieve some tapes indoors and a strange, humanoid corpse with two faces outside. The tapes reveal that the Norwegians found a crashed UFO buried under the ice, and retrieved a life form from the wreckage.The next night, the husky undergoes a horrific physical transformation in the kennels and attacks the other dogs. The scientists, showing common sense rare to horror movies, kill it with a flamethrower. Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) begins research on the retrieved corpse and discovers that on a cellular level, the organism attacks and destroys other cells, then uses the biomass to reproduce. Studying the corpse of the supposed husky, he discovers that these cells can imitate any DNA that has been consumed, and that the husky was merely the organism pretending to be a husky. Realising that it had been roaming their base unchecked for more than 24 hours, he comes to the paralysing conclusion that this creature has almost certainly already killed and copied several residents at the station.The scariest thing about The Thing is that that the main characters are intelligent. So many horror movies feature fools in their leading roles. People whose ignorance leads to their inevitable gruesome demise. The Thing isn't like that. The twelve main characters are scientists, stationed at an isolated outpost in Antarctica. They are smart. They are educated. When they realise what is happening, they are creative and even entertaining in coming up with potential solutions or methods of combating the threat. The scariest thing about The Thing is that in spite of all of this, it still outsmarts them. It's always a step ahead. It still wins.The Thing isn't just a brilliant idea for a horror film, it's the brilliant idea for a horror film. Literally every other work in the genre is at a disadvantage to The Thing because it is not based on the idea that The Thing is. It is the most ingeniously terrifying concept that I have ever encountered as a film fan. And it follows through on the promise that such a premise could give. This is the scariest movie of all time.But much like The Thing is a glorious work of horror, it's also a glorious work of science fiction. It's an incredible thought experiment. Ask the question How would you react to this scenario? Every character does so in a different way. (At least, those who are given the chance.) Paranoia and infighting takes the spotlight in the central act of the film, as the residents, unsure of who has been assimilated, begin to turn on each other. Themes and ideas of social conformity, hysteria and witch hunts are explored. Strategies to deal with the threat are frequently suggested and carried out, often with disastrous and horrific results. With every mishap the tension increases and the human numbers dwindle.MacReady takes the role of the protagonist and leads the group against the threat. Unfortunately, this paints a glaring target on his face. Not only is The Thing ruthless in eradicating its strongest threats, targeting those who can lead and take initiative, but MacReady's leadership and confidence inspires apprehension and eventually panic in his colleagues. By standing out, he becomes noticed and targeted, not only by alien, but by human. Kurt Russell is utterly astonishing. His performance here deserves to be regarded as legendary &#x96; it is one of the greatest in cinematic history. His desperate determination to defeat The Thing oozes out of him, the fear and exhaustion is etched not only onto his face but seemingly onto his very soul. He only intensifies as the film draws on and the hope of victory fades.If one were to say that witch hunts and paranoia are the fuel of the film, the handful of encounters with The Thing out of its disguise is a lit match. The shock horror here is second to none. The practical special effects used in The Thing's gruesome transformations are absolutely fantastic. As a shape-shifter, The Thing is constantly changing it's appearance, taking terrifying forms. For long stretches of the film we do not see it or know of it, and this only increases the suspense, leaving the viewer utterly dreading the next confrontation.The Thing terrified me so profoundly that I still have recurring nightmares where I am one of the scientists in that situation. The looming feeling of dread and inevitable doom is as present here as it is in those dreams. But the film had that off the back of the base idea already. Just look at the 2011 prequel of the same name It was poorly written, poorly acted and had terrible plastic CGI, but it was still an interesting film just because it had this idea to work with. But that's not why this is so good. The Thing is a masterpiece because it does more; it is more. It is strongly acted. It is a master-work of practical effects. It is densely plotted. The screenplay never stops, the twists and churns just keep hitting. From start to finish you keep guessing. The fact that, to this day, people still argue about the circumstances of the brilliant ambiguous ending is a testament to this film's genius. And that's what makes it one of the best movies of all time.

His 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released to similar success, and is now one of the classic of the science-fiction genre. His next film, however, 1941, was a colossal bomb, showing that as good as he was, he wasn't invincible. So for his next project, he turned to his friend George Lucas (Director of Star Wars), and told him of his plans to direct a James Bond movie. Lucas then presented a similar character he had come up with, Indiana Smith, a homage to adventure serials from the forties and fifties. The two then collaborated on the project, with Spielberg directing and Lucas producing, and created what is now known as Raiders of the Lost Ark. (With the protagonist changed from Smith to Jones)For the two people on the planet who have not seen this movie, here is the basic premise In 1936, Indiana Jones is an archaeologist who is recruited to find and retrieve the lost Ark of the Covenant, which is essentially a radio to God, which could make whoever carries it invincible. The problem is that Hitler is also interested, and evil Nazis are trying to recover it for their army. What ensues is the greatest adventure film ever made. (I'm not exaggerating at all)The movie has so many strong points I don't know where to start, but I'll begin with the obvious Harrison Ford is the best possible pick for Indiana Jones imaginable. He doesn't just play Indy, he IS Indy. He is both awesome and yet barely able to make it through the movie's many fight scenes. (Well, except the one fight that is played for laughs) You like him so much that you want to see him win. It's because of how he barely does this that you realize, This could be me in this scene! He brings the right amount of relatablility and awesomeness to the role. Maybe the movie could work with someone else in the role, but it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as awesome.Everyone else is good too; Karen Allen is excellent in here, (She seems a little stubborn and like a damsel in distress at times, but Willie in Temple of Doom is a hundred times worse) Paul Freeman as Belloq is a fantastic villain (He's almost like Indy; he's an archaeologist looking for the Ark but is just more evil), John Rhys-Davies is pretty entertaining to watch as Sallah, and Denholm Elliot's Marcus Brody (Possibly related to Martin in Jaws) is a good father figure in here (But don't worry, we'll get Sean Connery later).This movie just looks incredible. The set design is very engrossing, the cinematography is tremendously well shot, and the stunts and other effects are so well integrated you can't tell which is which (Just like Jurassic Park).The movie also sounds good too. The soundtrack by John Williams is amazing. He really knows how to make iconic themes almost effortlessly (No wonder he's my favorite film composer). And the sound effects are pretty good too.But finally, we get to the best parts of this movie The script and action sequences. It is very well written, taking place in a period where the Nazis (The only villain more evil is the devil; wait, I've found a villain for Indy 5!) are going to be part of the story no matter what, and it completely embraces its simple adventurous tone by going all-out in order to make this as entertaining as possible. And boy does it deliver! We get one great action scene, another great one, some exposition that manages to not be boring, more action, more action, some more action, some humor here, a little setup here, action, action, action, humor and action (You know what scene I'm talking about), action, action, action, awesome John Williams theme here, action, a little more action, and a breathtaking climax. (Complete with a shot that takes a page from Citizen Kane's book) So yeah, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the essential action movie, and definitely Steven Spielberg's best film. If for some odd reason you haven't yet seen this, (gasp!) watch it immediately, and if you have, watch it anyway!

A mindless soulless drone- like soldier who kills without question and its set in the future! how can that not be kick ass...*ahem*.So in the near future humans breed soldiers by taking them at birth and basically transforming them into hardened killers that obey without question with brutal military schooling, they only know the military way. Then along comes a smarmy greasy Colonel with a bunch of even better genetically engineered soldiers who were created from hand picked DNA to give maximum results in every human sense. Russell and his men are replaced and brushed aside.At its core this film is basically a revenge action thriller, but it does try for a warmer touch throughout. Russell's character 'Todd' is a merciless killer but after he is abandoned and left for dead on a garbage planet by his superiors he must learn to survive on his own. That is until he finds a human colony of scavengers who crashed on the planet years before. He is taken in and this is where the softer side comes in as the scavengers try to break his robotic military programming and make him more human again.This whole element isn't too bad and shows a good attempt at character building. We do get to see Todd slowly coming around as he is immersed in a more family orientated society. There are the obligatory ups and downs along the way and Todd has reoccurring nightmares which does feel rather clichéd but I guess its what you'd expect. It is good to see Todd becoming close with a young couples little boy, we never really get too much emotion from Todd, he barely says much for the entire film accept for yes Sir, no Sir and nods. I did find myself enjoying the simple story arch for Todd and the young family that take care of him, its basic sure but it works.Of course all that is filler simply for the big revenge action showdown at the end where Todd gets his chance to kill all the enhanced soldiers and their Colonel. Todd grows attached to the scavengers in his own way only so you feel more emotion when he must protect them in a whopping sci-fi shoot out. That shoot out being the main focus of the film and it doesn't disappoint if you ask me, its like 'Commando' on another planet with Russell taking down faceless futuristic soldiers with big guns, big knives and a few neck snaps.The one thing I find odd is why the Colonel and his soldiers do this 'security sweep' on this garbage planet. The planet seems to be known as a massive dumping ground for scrap with no known life on it, intelligent life anyway. So why on earth would they need to do a security sweep of it?? especially with all those huge armoured vehicles!. Well because the director needed a way to get the bad guys on the planet surface so Todd could kill them all that's why. Its just a shame that plot direction is so stupid.The film certainly looks slick considering it was made in 98. The planet looks pretty cool harsh and desolate, nice models, nice matte work, sets are decent and futuristic weapons\/equipment look solid and authentic. I did get a feeling the film needed or wanted to be grander though, personally I wanted to see more of the planet, the military, it all felt a bit compressed and revolved around one area the entire time (the scavenger camp got a wee bit boring).I like the small Easter eggs though. The film was suppose to be set within the same universe as 'Blade Runner' (a sequel on the side) and there is a nod to that with the 'Battle at Tannhauser Gate' on Todd's service record. Plus Todd appears to have been decorated with the 'Plissken Patch'.I liked Russell's performance here, he comes across surprisingly well as a terminator-esque killbot and the lack of dialog also works surprisingly well. Visually the film is pleasing to the eye for any sci- fi buffs, the action is well directed and it is very satisfying to see Todd get his own back on Isaac's shitty Colonel character and his lackeys. The final battle between Russell and his uber opponent Jason Scott Lee is clichéd much like the rest of the film and felt like a typical JCVD fight sequence really. All in all I think Lee's character could have been left out really as he seemed too much of a daft predictable comicbook type bad guy. Overall this is definitely a guilty pleasure action film, you know its dumb but its also a good gritty ride.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 February 2014","score":"","review":" Back before Kurt was a bit too old he starred in the odd kick ass flick like this...oh yes this is indeed kick ass.

The reason being that having heavyweights like Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty (who had championed Elaine May in the first place) on board, they were not about to scrimp it.Which is the film's first problem. Elaine had envisioned it as a Road To&#x85; movie (although it comes across more like those Sixties Bond spoofs &#x96; like Danger Route and Our Man In Marrakesh) with a modest budget, shot locally &#x96; not an epic, part-made in Morocco.Furthermore, the studio insisted on paying both its lead actors a fortune &#x96; while both would have been happy with far less.To make things worse, the political situation in North Africa at the time was TENSE.Then to cap it all, just as the film was nearing completion, David Puttnam (now LORD Puttnam) was brought in as the studio's new head of production. He hated Beatty, Hoffman and production cost waste in equal measure &#x96; and publicly condemned the movie on the basis of all three.And all along the way, there had been a plethora of problems and fallouts too numerous to mention here &#x96; all of which conspired to CAPSIZE the film before it had a chance.So what is Ishtar actually LIKE? Well, most of those who decried it never even SAW it. It is actually not that bad.Beatty and Hoffman's chemistry is pretty good, Charles Grodin is as funny as ever &#x96; and the blind camel steals every scene he is in (the camel originally signed for the part got eaten instead).Plus Paul Williams' songs are realistically awful (Beatty and Hoffman play bad singer-songwriters) Dave Grusin's score is fine, May's script and direction is okay (although after Ishtar, she never got to direct another movie) and altogether the film lopes along agreeably, never becoming boring (which is more than can be said for the other four films listed above).So if you find this piece in your DVD hire shop or it turns up on your TV schedules &#x96; give it a try. It may not be in my All Time Top Ten Movie list &#x96; or even my top hundred &#x96; but it is NOT as bad as many would have you believe.On its original release, it was well received at its three premieres, hit Number One at the box office during its opening week &#x96; and almost all of IMDb's 121 reviews (written by actual PEOPLE) are POSITIVE.And it is now available on Blu-Ray.I finally saw it a few days ago on DiggerMovie HD and LOLed many times (particularly during the scenes involving that camel). And as Elaine herself once said, If all of the people who hate Ishtar had SEEN it &#x96; I would be a rich woman today.

In the pre-credits sequence, Mills and Somerset stand outside in the rain. Somerset asks Mills why he would ever want to come here - the city is dank, gritty, riddled with crime. Perhaps at the end of it all, Mills would ask himself the same question. It - and he - is about to become terrorised by a serial killer of otherworldly proportions.The killings are committed as ironic punishments against those who have been seen to commit one of the seven deadly sins. They are grotesque, even creative in a morbid kind of way. Somerset suggests that these killings are linked, and that the killer is preaching. Just what about, they're yet to know.Seven is marked by a remarkably dense atmosphere. The cinematography is deceptively gorgeous, bringing with it a strange contradiction to the urban decay and grime of the city. The villain, an elusive figure known only by John Doe, seems to be a figment of their imagination. They can't find any clues or leads. There isn't any forensic evidence. The killings themselves are the only indication that he even exists. His intangibility takes on a a haunting presence, an almost supernatural quality. And yet, Seven walks the fine line, never making you feel like it is unrealistic. The film becomes surreal without being fantastical.Seven has a screenplay that could have made Alfred Hitchcock wince. The idea of dense plotting seems to no longer take on a meaning. The film carries constant existential dread with it, that inevitable chaos and tragedy will befall the main characters. It manages to make a run of the mill dinner scene between the main characters an exercise in inexplicable suspense. Yet at the same time it twists and turns at a frantic pace. You have no idea what will happen next. You couldn't possibly guess. With these two elements entwined, it escalates towards the unbearable.Grounding all of this is a cast of strong, believable characters. Grounding them is a masterclass of acting. Morgan Freeman is a regularly acclaimed actor, so I don't mean it lightly when I say this is the best performance of his career. His silent despair and visible insecurity as the case falls apart in his hands is the emotional vehicle of the film. Brad Pitt brings great energy and intensity with him as his young sidekick, and the chemistry between the two is fantastic. The seemingly generic pairing of a to-retire veteran and hot-headed rookie is played straight with courage. The depth of the characters and the strength of the actors' performances keeps things fresh and interesting. The rest of the film is bolstered by these strengths.With tight pacing, dense plotting, fantastic cinematography, brilliant acting and an incredible supporting role from Kevin Spacey, Seven is a modern classic. It is polished in almost every degree. It makes every other crime drama look like a textbook. We may never see something like this ever again.

Maybe it's because I have a Y-chromosome, but I never found Ariel fawning over Eric or King Triton blowing his top to be that enjoyable. Again, the musical numbers are fun, but the scenes between them aren't very memorable in terms of dialogue and events, excluding the climax and that one scene of Ariel combing her hair with a fork.Now, the Ugly I never realized it before, but I can totally sympathize with people who hate Ariel. Why? Because she essentially sells her voice to the underwater version of the Devil in exchange for a shot at a getting guy. She does nothing to really help anyone else throughout the movie and doesn't spend much time thinking about things other than herself, boys, and human trinkets. At the end she gets her father turned into a... plant-fish-thing? And, despite all the trouble her raging teenage hormones have caused, she still gets what she wants.THAT'S not a harmful message at all!

Plot twist is too nice a word for the unmotivated interminable reversals and red herrings. Viewers who don't always follow plot closely may easily lose track since it makes no sense.It tries and fails to be several things at once. It is primarily plot driven, but the plot is so ridiculous and full of holes and arbitrary reverses that one quickly ceases to bother predicting what will happen next. It's never surreal (might have helped) but it is so illogical. There is extensive brutality and gun play, but it is mostly of little consequence and seems more played for laughs. The entire climactic casino shootout seemed more comic than dramatic. Gary Sinese and his men's interminable beatings of Affleck have little dramatic impact after the initial one. The gun choreography is lazy with little sense of care or threat. There are moments meant to be comic, mostly Ben Affleck mugging, but virtually none of them work. There are multiple love affairs but these are just more red herrings to keep the plot tottering along--not one of them is convincing or deep.We're left with what I guess I'd call a dumb guy's popcorn heist movie along the lines of ; something that keeps us lurching forward with gunfire, the pounding score and the moving camera and letting us know that if we don't care about the current scene, something disconnected and brutal will be along in five minutes. CGI is missing; instead we get overacting. I cannot fathom how a script development process arrives at this conclusion. Nonstop unmotivated physical abuse is not interesting to most audiences.

I mean, we've got pirates, Muppets, swordfights, comedy, musicals, and Tim Curry, who steals every single scene he's in.It's more or less the same story we've heard before Jim Hawkins finds a map to the treasure of Captain Flynt and manages to get himself a ship, captain and crew to go look for it. He befriends Tim Curry a.k.a. Long John Silver and after a bout of Cabin Fever explodes into the craziest song ever put on film, they find the island, Long John is torn over his bond with Jim, yadda yadda you know how it goes.But you don't. What makes this my favorite rendition of Treasure Island is the Muppets. Gonzo and Rizzo play co-cabin boys alongside Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkings, whose singing voice can be a tad annoying at times but helps show how much he needs to treat that Disney Princess Syndrome he suffers from.Disney Princess Syndrome - a common disorder among physically weak Disney leads, the only known treatment for which is a sword fight. Symptoms include 1) Tendency to burst into song about wanting more. 2) Effeminate demeanor. 3) Developing Stockholm Syndrome towards overly charismatic villains. 4) Tendency to get kidnapped and\/or locked up.Don't worry, he'd cured by the end of it.The celebrity guests are kept to a bare minimum like with the Muppet Christmas Carol, Billy Connolly and Jennifer Saunders getting bit roles in the beginning as Billy Bones and Ms. Bluberidge at the inn. Tim Curry steals the show as Long John Silver, his performance confirming long-time fans of his that he is, indeed, actually a Muppet.

As revealed on a certain Wiki site, the film was shot in just four weeks in 1986, at a cost of around $110,000, but was not released until four years later. Despite its great reputation, it is a film that I had long put off watching, having a suspicion that it would be a rather unpleasant experience for me over all. But lately, I have been exposing myself to a bunch of previously dreaded films (such as Blood Sucking Freaks and 1978's I Spit on Your Grave, with Audition and Cannibal Holocaust soon to come), and find that Henry is actually quite excellent; unpleasant, of course, but nevertheless featuring a winning script and three dynamite performances that elevate it to the ranks of first-rate independent filmmaking.In the picture, the viewer makes the acquaintance of Henry (Michael Rooker, in his first screen role), a polite, soft-spoken, illiterate young man who looks a tad like a less muscular Arnold Schwarzenegger crossed with Grand Funk Railroad's Mark Farner...and who also happens to be a quite casual serial killer. Before we even get to hear him speak, we see a trail of Henry's victims on screen a beautiful brunette lying in the grass with a gashed abdomen, a pair of liquor store owners with gunshot wounds to the head, a bloodied hooker with a glass bottle stuffed in her mouth (!), a dead woman lying face down in a stream. When we first meet Henry, he is doing work as an exterminator, appropriately enough, living in Chicago with an ex-jailmate named Otis (very loosely based on the real-life Ottis Toole, and played here by Tom Towles), a parolee who makes a living as an auto mechanic and pot dealer. Otis' sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) soon comes to stay, and learns that Henry had done his time in jail for the killing of his own mother. And it would seem that old habits do die hard, as Henry's propensity toward homicide for kicks remains undiminished, and when the bored and frustrated Otis becomes a willing student in the art of casual killing, the pair enters into a series of slayings that achieve a whole new realm of fun and games....Featuring expert direction from John McNaughton and those three finely crafted performances, Henry truly is a powerful experience. The film is often quite suspenseful, and much of that suspense derives from the viewer's never knowing which of Henry's encounters will turn lethal. Anyone who Henry sees, be it a waitress in a diner or a woman walking her dog, becomes a potential victim, and it is the lighthearted, blithe casualness with which Henry dispatches these victims that makes the picture so horrific. Operating under his philosophy of It's either you or them, Henry is as dispassionate a killer as Schwarzenegger's Terminator, calmly eating a burger and fries, for example, after breaking the necks of two prostitutes. Several of the picture's slayings are merely suggested (for example, that guitar-toting female hitchhiker who gets into Henry's car; Henry later offers the guitar to Otis as a present) and some seen, as mentioned earlier, only as bloodied aftermath, but still, the film DOES give the viewer ample evidence of Henry and Otis in action. Thus, the repeated stabbing and head bashing of a TV-dealing fence; the oh-so casual murder of a driver in an underpass; the pair videotaping their rape\/murder of an entire nuclear family (arguably, the most disturbing sequence in the film), and the final 15 minutes of the picture, which I won't go into but do guarantee will long linger in the memory. The film gives us an explanation for Henry's psychosis that at first seems only barely plausible (his mother had been a hooker who had forced Henry to wear dresses and watch her have sex with the customers)...until one learns that such had been the case with Henry Lee Lucas himself in the 1940s. My mama was a whore, Henry tells Becky with a sneer on his face, and the moment is an icy one. All told, Henry may be unpleasant, detailing as it does the lives of three very damaged and disturbed people (Becky had been repeatedly raped by her father as a girl and beaten by her present husband), but remains a very fine film. Its violence is clinical but hardly exploitative, and in its understated way, leaves a residual chill that a less artfully composed picture could never achieve. It was followed by a sequel six years after its release, but with a different director at the helm and another actor portraying Henry, this follow-up is a product that this viewer is in no great rush to see. Further good news regarding Henry is that the film is available to us today on a great-looking DVD from the always dependable Dark Sky outfit; Henry, originally shot in 16mm, may never look better for home viewing. It took me 24 years to catch up with this one, but I am so glad that I finally did. Pretty potent stuff, indeed!

It is well-known that George Lucas was interested in recreating the feel of 1930s and 1940s adventure and sci-fi serials, not only for Indiana Jones but for Star Wars as well. The Indiana Jones movies, and Raiders most of all, therefore does not look like a big-budget production. It makes very little obvious use of special effects technology, even less so than Star Wars which had mostly used practical effects such as scale models and puppets. The distinctive Indiana Jones color palette is drab, from the tweedy earth-tones of an archaelogy professor's office to the olives and grays of WWII-era military vehicles to the unadorned off-whites of a desert tent village. The movie's image quality is, by design, ever so slightly dusty and murky. It feels nostalgic and vintage, and I recall it feeling that way even when I first encountered it as a child in the early 1990s. It feels small and unprepossessing, like a secret that very few have uncovered. It is like nothing so much as an old classic newly rediscovered. Perhaps that is also what helps keep it fresh so many years later. To rediscover it now, or ten years ago, or ten years from now, is to be transported not to 1981 but to a mythical version of the 1930s, reimagined here as the last age of globe- trotting adventurers, with a layover travel map a la Casablanca, and Arabian bazaars and snakes and pith helmets and, of course, those ever- scheming Nazis. It doesn't hurt that the story is rock-solid and moves along at a perfect clip, that the script hits every note it aims for from humorous to mystical to epic, and that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have great chemistry together (she should have been his partner throughout the trilogy; she radiates confidence and power even when the script tries to limit her to the pot-smashing damsel-in-distress role.) It may seem strange that such a purely entertaining movie, with no whiff of a message and no grand artistic pretensions, would occupy such a prominent place in the history of film, comfortably making both AFI lists of the 100 best American movies and enjoying almost universal critical and popular acclaim. But since you have seen it, as almost everyone of all ages has, you know why it does.

It is well-known that George Lucas was interested in recreating the feel of 1930s and 1940s adventure and sci-fi serials, not only for Indiana Jones but for Star Wars as well. The Indiana Jones movies, and Raiders most of all, therefore does not look like a big-budget production. It makes very little obvious use of special effects technology, even less so than Star Wars which had mostly used practical effects such as scale models and puppets.
