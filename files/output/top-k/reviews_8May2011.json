I felt the anger that the soldiers felt when the leader of the uprising died in such a heroic way. The death of the soldier inspired a future of the country under united peoples. The theme is expressed with the repetition of the word Brother throughout the parts of the film. The message of hatred for hierarchy was portrayed with the montage of clips of actions in the movie. The movie was portrayed well for the silent movie. I liked sense on unity in the movie. The German montage moment was focused more on the group rather than the individual. Einstein used the death of the officer to unite the people against a common foe. Part five, the final battle, was the worst part in the film. The preparation for the battle took ten minutes.

The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl\/poor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.

When the foreignness of the ocean collides with land, we see the disaster that can even be evokes parallel's of the Tsunami that has recently occurred. Such untampered, senseless and foreign destruction unleashed on a country is something that American's have not dealt with, but which the Japanese have dealt with plenty from conflict with china to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

We then cut to Preston Waters as an 11 year old kid who is harassed by his family about money. His older brothers run a Lawn Cutting business, and the parents treat them better because they are already making money, and saving. They buy the brothers a new computer and place it in Preston's room. Preston tells his dad about that it's his room, but his dad scolds him for Preston not making money. The brothers though have no idea how to run a computer, and mess it up. Yeah I can see why these are the favorite ones (sarcasm). Eventually the family goes to a party and Preston is sent to ride on kiddie rides while the others are on better rides like a roller coaster. Preston even gets a birthday card, and only an $11 check. How cheap does this family have to be to Preston? He's already being pressured to find a job, and he's only 11! Is this some world where child labor laws don't exist? Preston goes to the bank to set up an account, and meets Shay Stanley who tells him he needs $200 to open an account. We then cut to the villains of the movie, Quigley, and the head of the bank, Biderman. Quigley learns the bills are marked, and sends for Juice, his other henchman. Quigley leaves, but accidentally runs over Preston's bike. Quigley writes a check, but before completing it he sees the cops, and hands Preston a blank check (ladies and gentlemen we have a title!). At home Preston's mom and dad are angry because Preston's bike got run over, and they scold him about not taking care of his valuables, and ground him. Seriously someone needs to call Child Services and take the kid away, and arrest the parents for negligence. Preston decides enough is enough, and uses the check to forge a $1 million check. Preston goes out to the bank (wasn't he grounded?) and meets Biderman who believes he is Juice, and gives him the million dollars. The real Juice comes by, and both realize they have been duped by Preston. Now to be fair, Juice seems to be the only enjoyable person in this movie. Preston creates a new alias name, Mr. Macintosh, and buys a home for himself, a limo driver named Henry who supposed to be comedy relief, but isn't funny at all. Preston meets Shay again, and tells him that Mr. Macintosh would like to meet her. We then learn that Shay is actually an FBI agent who is looking for Quigley, and the other villains. They even watch Mr. Macintosh since they consider him an interesting person which makes no sense considering that all of Macintosh's business is done by a kid. They honestly don't think it's weird or something? From here on in the movie uses a lot of filler with Preston on a shopping spree. I wouldn't mind it so much, but it keeps going on, and on. Preston explains that he has a new job as Mr. Macintosh's assistant to his family, and being the idiots they are they believe it. We get more scenes of Preston riding Go-Karts, playing games, hanging with the driver, buying a lot of ice cream, and so on. The movie then finally remembers it needs a plot, and we cut to, I wish I was joking, Preston taking Shay to dinner and then taking her to a geyser and get both of them wet. Meanwhile the villains are asking kids if they knew Preston, and one spills the beans on him, and they chase him down in the park. Preston and Shay get away and the villains are sprayed with the geyser. Preston then celebrates Mr. Macintosh's birthday, but it is his in reality, and soon realizes he has only a little over $330 in his account. Preston's dad comes into Mr. Macintosh's office, and tells him that he wants Preston to have a childhood, and to send him home early. What a hypocrite. Preston sends everyone home, and sits lonely around pondering his speech his dad told him. The villains though break into the home, and Preston needs to fight back. So the movie decides to go and rip off Home Alone with all the traps Preston sets up. The traps are dead ringers of Home Alone and too similar. Eventually Preston is cornered, and just as he is about to be killed, the FBI movie sin and Shay leads the party. The villains are arrested, and then in probably the creepiest moment in cinema history, Shay and Preston kiss on the lips. If this is romantic, the movie is wrong. This isn't romantic this is creepy on every level, and horrifying. I can imagine when parents took their kids to see this, they must have been shocked to see this scene. Shay continues the creepiness by saying she wants to see him in 6 to 7 years later. The FBI doesn't arrest her because? So the movie ends with Preston goes home to his family who celebrate his birthday obviously forgetting he lied to his family.Final Thoughts I can't imagine why this movie passed as a family comedy. There are too many creepy moments, and the movie is rather mean spirited. The plot is predictable, the characters are flat, the family is negligent, the humor is dreadful, the romance is creepy, and it steals from Home Alone. The only good thing in this move was Juice.

Preston explains that he has a new job as Mr. Macintosh's assistant to his family, and being the idiots they are they believe it. We get more scenes of Preston riding Go-Karts, playing games, hanging with the driver, buying a lot of ice cream, and so on. The movie then finally remembers it needs a plot, and we cut to, I wish I was joking, Preston taking Shay to dinner and then taking her to a geyser and get both of them wet. Meanwhile the villains are asking kids if they knew Preston, and one spills the beans on him, and they chase him down in the park. Preston and Shay get away and the villains are sprayed with the geyser. Preston then celebrates Mr. Macintosh's birthday, but it is his in reality, and soon realizes he has only a little over $330 in his account. Preston's dad comes into Mr. Macintosh's office, and tells him that he wants Preston to have a childhood, and to send him home early. What a hypocrite. Preston sends everyone home, and sits lonely around pondering his speech his dad told him. The villains though break into the home, and Preston needs to fight back. So the movie decides to go and rip off Home Alone with all the traps Preston sets up. The traps are dead ringers of Home Alone and too similar. Eventually Preston is cornered, and just as he is about to be killed, the FBI movie sin and Shay leads the party. The villains are arrested, and then in probably the creepiest moment in cinema history, Shay and Preston kiss on the lips. If this is romantic, the movie is wrong. This isn't romantic this is creepy on every level, and horrifying. I can imagine when parents took their kids to see this, they must have been shocked to see this scene. Shay continues the creepiness by saying she wants to see him in 6 to 7 years later. The FBI doesn't arrest her because? So the movie ends with Preston goes home to his family who celebrate his birthday obviously forgetting he lied to his family.Final Thoughts I can't imagine why this movie passed as a family comedy. There are too many creepy moments, and the movie is rather mean spirited. The plot is predictable, the characters are flat, the family is negligent, the humor is dreadful, the romance is creepy, and it steals from Home Alone. The only good thing in this move was Juice. Blank Check will leave a blank feeling in you, and you are better off picking up Home Alone then waste your time and money with this.

I don't remember much about it except that there was a drinking game associated with it&#x85; after that it all became a blur. So, many years later and much more sober I decided the time had come to give it another try, but this time without the obligatory drinking game. What I found was a quite bizarre, at times, tale that was not only entertaining, but also pretty funny too.Withnail and his flatmate, Marwood, are two out of work actors who have a hard time keeping a grip on reality. To put it very mildly, they both like a drink and Withnail, in particular, will go to extraordinary lengths to satisfy his lust for the booze. Dissatisfied with the situation in London, Marwood persuades Withnail to get his uncle, Monty, to let them stay at his cottage in the Lake District. The pair drive up there only to find that life in the countryside is quite different to life in the city. They soon find their feet though, but have a bit of a run in with a local poacher. Uncle Monty drops in unexpectedly and pays Marwood a lot more attention than he would like. Can he get out of the situation with everything intact? Will Withnail stop drinking long enough to care? Will either of them ever find a paying job? All these and many more questions are answered in this interesting and amusing film.The film is set in 1969 and a few of the songs that were popular at the time litter the soundtrack. This includes a snatch of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' by Executive Producer, George Harrison. Great performances all round, particularly from Richard E. Grant as Withnail and Paul McGann as Marwood, both really threw themselves into the parts. Also, Richard Griffiths was superb as the camp Uncle Monty. A special mention for Ralph Brown as their crazy friend Danny, a part he reprised (in the guise of Del Preston) in the 1993 film Wayne's World 2.This is very much a character driven piece, and what characters we are given to enjoy. They are all larger than life, but are all people it's possible to spot, if you do enough people watching that is.

Having recently given it another try (approaching 22) it turned out a completely different experience altogether; the humor, the social confrontations, and especially the indelibly subtle performance of Peter Sellers it all appeared so much more clear to me now. The natural outcome of having a few more years of experience on your back than before? Perhaps, but I imagine that also older and more experienced parts of the audience would benefit from giving this film several viewings. Although the story is really very simple in essence, it is explored in a way which makes it multi-layered, providing nuances which one single viewing won't reveal.Based on the novel by Jerzy Kosinski, Sellers is reported to have tried for years to convince the author that he would be right for the leading part of Chance the gardener in a movie adaptation, until the film finally came true. When it did, Sellers was actually approaching the end of his life; although being only in his fifties, his failing health made him appear considerably older, and this would be the last film of his to be released before his death. Not least for that reason is it touching to affirm that his performance as Chance may be said to be his crowning achievement, rivaled only by his work in Kubrick's DR. STRANGELOVE. But although incredible and unforgettable in and as Strangelove, Chance provided Sellers with an opportunity to showcase his talent for more subtle aspects of human behavior (and humor). As Strangelove, and other characters such as Inspector Closeau, Sellers had to a large degree played improbable human beings, whose burlesque behavior and characteristics made them fit more into the world of traditional clowns than the real world; only with his extraordinary gift was it possible to make these characters appear human and somewhat believable after all. Chance, on the other hand, is not a clown in such an inevitable manner; his uncomplicated and childish mind is, in fact, mistaken for being a mind of genius. For that reason, he is the biggest clown Sellers ever portrayed; the consequences of his existence do not only lead to people getting physically hurt, such as with Closeau, but to the entire population around him becoming clowns themselves, as they are unable to recognize what person they really are dealing with.In order to create the character of Chance, Sellers was reported to have combined the basic characteristics of two persons who intrigued him while growing up; an actual gardener whom his family knew, and comedian Stan Laurel (of Laurel & Hardy). His use of typical Laurel-mannerisms is often striking, although to me, the one character which may be mistaken for being Chance's twin brother is another, even earlier comedian of silent films named Harry Langdon. Although Langdon was, like Sellers with Chance, very much an adult by the time he established his character, his trademark was to portray a thoroughly bewildered and innocent child man, a seeming an alien from another world. One difference between Harry and Chance was that Harry never found himself mistaken for being a genius...You'll find yourself discussing details from this movie over and over again, with yourself or other viewers; what does it mean that Chance walks on water?

The story is simple yet totally captivating, and centres around a naive, disabled (deaf in 1 ear) and simple minded Sheriff Freddy Heflin, played superbly by Sylvester Stallone in a subtle, gentle and understated performance. While surrounded by excellent performances by the likes of Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, Robert Patrick, Michael Rapaport, Annabella Sciorra and particularly Ray Liotta as a nefarious, but ultimately loyal to Heflin Garry Figgis, Stallone carries this film with a truly stand out, if not career best performance. He is ably supported by writer-director James Mangold, who has a very clear trajectory with the story, and makes it particularly fascinating by rooting the structure of the story as a Western, even though it is set in contemporary New York. Stallone plays a character very different from his normal choices flawed, naive, disabled, and somewhat simple-minded and nothing like his previous superhero type characters. However, what is so great about his character, is while most of the characters around him, who are his friends, want the status quo, and in some cases, they will kill to keep that, his character makes a courageous, if possibly suicidal decision to challenge the status quo, leading to the film's powerful climax. There are clear echos of High Noon here as all of Freddy's friends suddenly see him as the enemy at worse, or abandon him at best. It is also interesting that Heflin's journey earlier in the film is not a neat linear one. His initially unswerving loyalty to his friends, particularly to Harvey Keitel's Ray Donlan, and his initial rebuff of Internal Affairs investigator Moe Tilden, played solidly by De Niro (who brings loads of interesting detail to what is not much more than a glorified cameo) seems to indicate that he doesn't want to get involved with despite his intuition and some incidents in the story making him question his loyalty to his friends. However, events force him to confront his law enforcement colleagues, leading to an excellent climax that is a relatively simple and low budget shoot-out, but works so well because the audience has invested in the characters and care's what happens to them. It is also helped by Mangold's clever use of sound and slow motion in this part of the film. While the characters are all law enforcement types, action is not the focus of this story - it is the dramatic conflict between the characters, which is the heart and drive of the film.

It is also interesting that Heflin's journey earlier in the film is not a neat linear one. His initially unswerving loyalty to his friends, particularly to Harvey Keitel's Ray Donlan, and his initial rebuff of Internal Affairs investigator Moe Tilden, played solidly by De Niro (who brings loads of interesting detail to what is not much more than a glorified cameo) seems to indicate that he doesn't want to get involved with despite his intuition and some incidents in the story making him question his loyalty to his friends. However, events force him to confront his law enforcement colleagues, leading to an excellent climax that is a relatively simple and low budget shoot-out, but works so well because the audience has invested in the characters and care's what happens to them. It is also helped by Mangold's clever use of sound and slow motion in this part of the film. While the characters are all law enforcement types, action is not the focus of this story - it is the dramatic conflict between the characters, which is the heart and drive of the film. While technical credits are solid, it is composer Howard Shore whose score understands the tone of the film so well and helps elevate what was a competent low budget film into feeling something more epic, expansive and emotionally involving.Overall an outstanding result. Congratulations to the cast in particular, brilliantly led by Stallone and Liotta, with director James Mangold being an excellent guide in shaping the story, and Howard Shore in creating a fantastically involving atmosphere with his terrific score.

Never has a truer word been spoken and this film would have saved itself by paying heed. The basic plot concerns an overly intelligent and smugly sophisticated 15 year old Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) and an infatuation with his much older stepmother, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). No prizes for guessing which 1967 Mike Nichols film this is styled on.One drunken night, Oscar bumps into Eve's best friend, Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), a similarly older lady. Diane seizes her opportunity and seduces Oscar like the classic cougar that she is through the guise of wearing a scarf and perfume that remind Oscar of his stepmother. Now, it should be duly noted that if you're a 15 year old guy with a fetish for the older woman, then said older woman could not take any better form than that of Diane when played by Ms Neuwirth. However, the overall plot is not a challenge and distinctly lacks any sense that it might actually be going somewhere until the last ten minutes. Importantly, the last ten minutes turn out to be just as disappointing as the rest of this film.The only pillars of strength for 'Tadpole' are the performances turned in by Bebe Neuwirth and John Ritter. Their time on screen manages to break the monotony of what is otherwise a drab and disengaged motion picture. It says a considerable amount about a film when an actress of Sigourney Weaver's caliber fails to resonate or lift the tone, as even she appears bored at times.The characters seem wholly underdeveloped and the interesting ones appear to drop off the face of the earth almost as quickly as they were shoved onto it. Eve, as Oscar's stepmother could have been an interesting version of the love interest but her limited time on screen leaves a vague and insipid impression of the character. Oscar is an acceptable protagonist, but given that the film deals with a rich topic for storytelling, he is also somewhat disappointing for a male lead with what could have been an excellent show and tell of the Oedipus Complex. The fact that Aaron Stanford is evidently older than his character's 15 years has not gone amiss with either the scriptwriter or the director as the supporting cast constantly reminds the viewer that he is indeed older than he seems, in more ways than one.As John Ritter puts it during the dinner sequence, incidentally the best scene in the film, it's all very The Graduate. Indeed it is, minus the finesse. Crammed with embarrassingly clichéd musical dream sequences, that would quite frankly make Rodgers and Hammerstein seem like a welcome addition to any film collection, we have before us a disastrous attempt to make a Graduate-esque teenage crush appear facetious. Winnick has failed to provide an attention grabbing look at Oscar's dilemma, instead eliciting the comical whimsy of the protagonist's daydreams to the point of exaggerated (and plain bad) slapstick. Overall, 'Tadpole' suggests that it could have, should have and would have been better had Winnick been prepared to put some oomph into the production. It's a shame to see actors of Weaver's, Ritter's and Neuwirth's ability being wasted on shoddy production values and lazy attention to pulldown's and video field capacity. The result is a half-baked comedy that is watchable (tenacity spanning) but at times lacking in passion. Very disappointing ultimately.

It is the first instance in Cameron Crowe's delightful little teenaged-young adult comedy during which we observe youngsters confused, bewildered and in angst over romance or items more broadly linked to romance. What the film eventually comes to do is branch out into a charming piece about a young man's feelings for another girl, as the clock ticks down to her leaving and a proverbial net of all things pressurised and unenviable appear to close in.That young man is Lloyd Dobler, John Cusak's likable; softly spoken; kick-boxing fanatic high-schooler in his final year based in a suburban America with his family. Far from a slob but a long way from what might be perceived within the film's realm as academically imbued, Dobler's somewhat happy with being an easy-going and kind young man who has penchants and interests as well as a fondness for his close relatives; a man not afraid to confront another male if it transpires he made ill of another woman's feelings for whatever reason, yet is humble enough to have to give his automobile's cassette player a good whack if required when desiring to operate it. Principally, above all else; above the university places some have and above the goal to get as drunk as possible whilst one is still able to at this delicate stage in your life, Dobler's key interest is in Dianne Court (Skye) a young woman at Lloyd's school who's mostly everything Lloyd is not.Dianne is described, whilst off screen and with we the audience having yet to observe, as a girl with the body of a game-show hostess; ear-opening when we realise these are words from the mouth of another young woman and is not a mere jibe from that of a male with nary much else but you-know-what on his mind. Dianne lives with her father, a rich rest home owner, in a large secluded home with its own gravel driveway; one of those which reaches the house and then finds enough time to spin around into a circle with a centrepiece in the middle. She has a place abroad, such is the way these things work in films such as these, a place in what is commonly used as the land of academia, in that she's on her way to a university in England for some studies of a prestigious sort. When we first observe Dianne, she is driven to her graduation ceremony by her father who's extremely proud; a leavers speech which she provides has everybody seemingly at her command, the film centralising the point of focus on Dianne without ever objectifying, as she finds the entire occasion very moving &#x96; moving in a way everybody else seemingly does not when they perhaps ought to, something that infers a person in touch with themselves and their emotions, and somebody perhaps a little above the rest of the graduates in this regard whom watch on before catching on.Through some brave and rather lucky means, Lloyd snaffles a date with Dianne; but surely, going by the opening scene of definition arguments and whatnot, it more than resembles something else close to a date but just not quite a date. He calls her house, gets put on with her father; already as nervous as anything, the insinuation that many-a male attempts as such what it is Lloyd's trying now is humorously put across when it transpires Dianne's father recalls attempted dates and so-forth by calling to mind what it is the various men drive. The night out itself is fraught with the potential of something going catastrophically wrong without anything necessarily going catastrophically wrong; a rather loud party fuelled by alcohol and large groups of youngsters huddled into rooms inside of a house that is made to look a lot smaller than it is. We don't feel as if this is exactly Dianne's scene, while Lloyd himself appears elusive; the pair of them coming together as attendees thin out and a small group of whom Lloyd knows congregates as the night draws to a close &#x96; Lloyd's role there ultimately seeing him put people straight and aid in the safety to prevent drink-driving, more than anything, in what might have been a more lewd display in more contemporary films.Say Anything... eventually mutates into a really quaint, really rather remarkably played love story between these two people whom at first seem at odds, but through spending enough time with each other, come to understand the authenticity of one another. In one scene, each party are asked on respective career and potential marital relations; neither party can give concrete answers that please the enquirers but both can reply honestly to the best of their own ability, something which binds them in this sense as Lloyd is granted deeper access into her home and her life which reveal minute flaws and such from her past deconstructing or demythifying prior perceptions he had that yet goes on to retain fondness. Crowe allows things to progress and naturally develop competently and engrossingly, a plot to do with tax evasion and the fall out that arrives with that melded into proceedings in a slick and pleasingly unassuming manner in conjunction with the primary material; the film coming to resemble a remarkably played coming of age film which works.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 May 2011","score":"","review":" Say Anything... (complete with, count 'em, three periods) begins in a teenager's bedroom as they sit there with two of their closest companions, at that stage in a conversation during which the knocking back and forth of ideas threatens to escalate into arguing. The disagreements are over words, or more specifically, words that define what it is certain actions of a romantic nature ought be labelled &#x96; there is enough pressure in these people's lives, it seems, when it comes to one's peers; maintaining reputations and the overbearing issue of studies to have to worry about without getting your words and terms right when speaking openly to high school chums. It is the first instance in Cameron Crowe's delightful little teenaged-young adult comedy during which we observe youngsters confused, bewildered and in angst over romance or items more broadly linked to romance. What the film eventually comes to do is branch out into a charming piece about a young man's feelings for another girl, as the clock ticks down to her leaving and a proverbial net of all things pressurised and unenviable appear to close in.That young man is Lloyd Dobler, John Cusak's likable; softly spoken; kick-boxing fanatic high-schooler in his final year based in a suburban America with his family. Far from a slob but a long way from what might be perceived within the film's realm as academically imbued, Dobler's somewhat happy with being an easy-going and kind young man who has penchants and interests as well as a fondness for his close relatives; a man not afraid to confront another male if it transpires he made ill of another woman's feelings for whatever reason, yet is humble enough to have to give his automobile's cassette player a good whack if required when desiring to operate it. Principally, above all else; above the university places some have and above the goal to get as drunk as possible whilst one is still able to at this delicate stage in your life, Dobler's key interest is in Dianne Court (Skye) a young woman at Lloyd's school who's mostly everything Lloyd is not.Dianne is described, whilst off screen and with we the audience having yet to observe, as a girl with the body of a game-show hostess; ear-opening when we realise these are words from the mouth of another young woman and is not a mere jibe from that of a male with nary much else but you-know-what on his mind. Dianne lives with her father, a rich rest home owner, in a large secluded home with its own gravel driveway; one of those which reaches the house and then finds enough time to spin around into a circle with a centrepiece in the middle. She has a place abroad, such is the way these things work in films such as these, a place in what is commonly used as the land of academia, in that she's on her way to a university in England for some studies of a prestigious sort. When we first observe Dianne, she is driven to her graduation ceremony by her father who's extremely proud; a leavers speech which she provides has everybody seemingly at her command, the film centralising the point of focus on Dianne without ever objectifying, as she finds the entire occasion very moving &#x96; moving in a way everybody else seemingly does not when they perhaps ought to, something that infers a person in touch with themselves and their emotions, and somebody perhaps a little above the rest of the graduates in this regard whom watch on before catching on.Through some brave and rather lucky means, Lloyd snaffles a date with Dianne; but surely, going by the opening scene of definition arguments and whatnot, it more than resembles something else close to a date but just not quite a date. He calls her house, gets put on with her father; already as nervous as anything, the insinuation that many-a male attempts as such what it is Lloyd's trying now is humorously put across when it transpires Dianne's father recalls attempted dates and so-forth by calling to mind what it is the various men drive. The night out itself is fraught with the potential of something going catastrophically wrong without anything necessarily going catastrophically wrong; a rather loud party fuelled by alcohol and large groups of youngsters huddled into rooms inside of a house that is made to look a lot smaller than it is. We don't feel as if this is exactly Dianne's scene, while Lloyd himself appears elusive; the pair of them coming together as attendees thin out and a small group of whom Lloyd knows congregates as the night draws to a close &#x96; Lloyd's role there ultimately seeing him put people straight and aid in the safety to prevent drink-driving, more than anything, in what might have been a more lewd display in more contemporary films.Say Anything... eventually mutates into a really quaint, really rather remarkably played love story between these two people whom at first seem at odds, but through spending enough time with each other, come to understand the authenticity of one another.

It is, in the way of most '50s Hollywood films, deliriously artificial in manner, though the settings look real, and are. Its only excellent performance is by the grain-belt town where the exteriors were filmed.Picnic asks us to accept a mid-30s and facially haggard (but tanned and very fit) William Holden as a post-collegiate. That could work in a play, where acting, body language and makeup could make us believe. But here he looks a lot older than his college chum Cliff Robertson. Holden is game and fearless, but is directed to a performance that is hammy, frantic, almost awkward. He moves big and impulsive, like Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls.Holden generally just doesn't seem right for a likable if show-offy lummox with a disreputable side. He's intrinsically a man's man, a Don Draper prototype, a wordly cynic, not someone who's going to mask his insecurities and shame with puppy-ish fratboy physicality. That much of this energy is directed at tiny, under-age Susan Strasberg, his date for the big picnic (before his real love interest is revealed), seems creepy to 21st century sensibilities.Other apparent age anomalies include Kim Novak and her mom looking to be about 12 years apart.The director gives his actors stagy bits of physical business that make the most normal gestures--hanging onto the ropes of a swing or the columns of a porch while speaking--look forced.This is the corny kind of a movie where when a character thinks of the whole wide world outside of Kansas, then their eyes have to loft achingly upward of the horizon. To me the film's loud, broad and energized acting and brisk editing suggest a sort of terror of the bucolic setting and overtly prosaic title as being threats to the searing, sexed-up realism that was being attempted. The performances play to the back rows, lobbing one uninflected emotion at a time, and the characters fairly frequently blurt out just how they feel, even before the bottle gets passed around. Seems among these salt-of-the-earth Midwestern types, only the stuffy schoolmarm has any use for any pretense or posturing. Rosalind Russell's Romemarie still just about beats her head with her own limbs like a Tex Avery wolf when Holden takes his shirt off. Subtle. Scenes like this make this wide screen Technicolor epic feel like it was directed for the iPod.There are bits that work. Arthur O'Connell escaped with his dignity and an Oscar. By being authentically good, he excels here. The actress who played Kim Novak's mom, while generally acting as if in a silent melodrama, does manage to beautifully project mingled worry and sympathetic excitement for her daughter near the end. One key scene between O'Connell and Russell is done in one long take and as the scene goes on, they seem to emerge from the cloud of recently whispered dunderheaded directorial instructions, escaping to something authentic and touching.A vastly over-celebrated film.

They show a society that puts its foot on your neck if you fail to play along and sleepwalk the path laid out for you through school and the workplace.

Domestic in the issues it raises about the rights of cross-border workers in Switzerland (recurrent from Tanner's 1974 film Le milieu du monde), the ghost of the Geneva Massacre (of socialist protesters in 1932 by the Swiss Army), of the contradiction of a prosperous though backwards country where female suffrage was achieved at a federal level only in 1971.The film follows eight individuals, whose names all begin with the letter M, who are not happy following the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and seek different ways to express that whether that is in looking to withdraw from society, sabotage it, or develop an alternative. They show a society that puts its foot on your neck if you fail to play along and sleepwalk the path laid out for you through school and the workplace. There's thatch-haired Marie (played by actress Miou-Miou), who performs individual acts of covert defiance at her supermarket job; her boyfriend, Marxist-Leninist teacher Marco, chock-full of enthusiasm and desire to help people be happy and grow; Madeleine who seeks an internal retreat via her interest in Vama Marga tantra; her preferred partner for this realisation Max, who performs acts of capital sabotage on a larger level, a disillusioned 1968er, who was in a group but now acts unilaterally; buzzard-headed Mathieu who sets up an alternative school for children and performs menial jobs, perhaps the closest of them to a true proletarian Marxist; his wife Mathilde, a happy mother and lover, compared to a kindly whale; finally their farmhouse hosts, animal-loving biophilosophiser Marcel and his farmer's wife Marguerite, who seems to have a secret life as a prostitute.The individuals are for revolution but Tanner makes it clear that they're not interested in the authoritarian outcome from the USSR, so archive footage of missile-fetishisation parades are spliced in. The ultimate point is that the chance to change society for the better in 1968 was a once in an era possibility, and that the 70s folk have to wait for future generations to have a chance. The note at the end of the film for me however, sounded pessimistically, we failed to brake what is now a runaway train.The most beautiful moment for me was when Marcel describes the singing of birds at dawn, how people don't hear things like that anymore and have built walls of silence around themselves, unable to hear the world turning, self-obsessed and desolate. I think that although it's taboo in the west to be anything other than bullheadedly proud of the way we live nowadays, there are still many people who are forced to live inside their heads, and neurosis along with mental illness is widespread. This inside-living is shown in the movie by transitions to black and white images that show wish fulfilment. The inmates in this film are only ever fleetingly fulfilled.My heart was broken before even the first shot in the movie rolled, by the piano solo from Jean-Marie Sénia playing over the opening credits, full of present drudgery and faraway hope, that is perfectly tailored for the movie.The movie is actually very subtle, what's easy to pass by is that there's quite a lot of conflict between the members of the group Marxist Mathieu would like to be able to examine the farm's books so that he understands how much profit it is making and what would be a fair wage for him, however his asking that and Marguerite agreeing to it is in one of those black and white fantasy segments - the farm is very much not a commune, Mathieu sits at the same table but is fundamentally labour; Max is very belittling about his girlfriend Madeleine's tantra; there's Marguerite's illicit prostitution, which her husband is totally fooled by, her secrecy he thinks is something mysterious and beautiful; and towards the end Marco suggests that Mathilde's child be named Marie (who has been jailed), and the others don't even clock who he's referring to. Perhaps if one were to look at the film blackly, the characters are stubborn, lacking the ability to fit in, to go with the flow.

There was multiple viewings and with each viewing something more brilliant emerged. This did not happen with this movie. This is my second time watching this movie and it gave me the same impression I had the first time I watched it. I do love this movie and I think Dorothy Vallens is worth hours of discussions alone. In my mind she is the one of the more interesting characters Lynch has used. There is something relatable about her character more than the rest of the characters. She is scared, vulnerable, and so little of her life in her control. She wants to be loved, but is so damaged that she does not understand love in the way that does not frighten the rest of us. I do love this character, but she is surrounded by such a strange cast of characters I do not know what to think of the world she exists in. She seems to be stuck somewhere in the middle of Frank Booth's world and Jeffrey and Sandy's world.This dichotomy is what makes Blue Velvet interesting. The opening sequence is brilliant and really sets the stage. This is a perfect example of how to create atmosphere for the rest of the movie. I think the ending of the movie involves a little analysis. The robin at the end of the movie is holding one of the beetles from the beginning of the movie, but it is only one beetle. The interesting thing that I am getting from Lynch is that the seedy underworld that the bugs and dirt represent are necessary for the rest of the world to exists in its happy little bubble. Removing one bug does not do anything to stop that world from existing, but it does in a way feed the bright world that Sandy's life represents. My favorite part of this movie is the soundtrack and it is the only thing keeping the movie from falling apart. The two extremes do not play off each very well in my opinion. The seedy underworld is to lawless, while the picturesque world is too clean. When the two of them are interacting I am not sure how to take it. It is hard to judge the acting here, because all of it is over the top. I think Rossellini did a great job, but honestly I am not sure about the other performances. Dean Stockwell comes to mind. Either it is brilliant or terrible. I am not sure which. I am sure the performances are exactly what Lynch wanted, but to me it they seem too over the top for either one to work. A last word about Frank Booth Frank Booth will remain one of the most memorable villains in movie history and unfortunately this was my first exposure to Dennis Hopper so now anything I see him in I see Frank Booth. This movie is very much a David Lynch film. There is no arguing that. It is obviously brilliant and there is some extremely tight direction, with some fantastic lighting and a soundtrack that is spot on. But overall that movie did not make me sit up. It is definitely worth a watch if you are a Lynch fan or are just looking for something new.
