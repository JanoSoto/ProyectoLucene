So when I saw the movie case for Election, I thought, it can't be that bad if it's got Matthew.  It wasn't THAT bad, but it wasn't good either. It was just okay. He plays a teacher who teaches about morals and ethics but has some morality problems of his own. He might say the f-word 1 too many times, and it just ain't that funny. But all in all, a pretty okay job. Now onto Reese Witherspoon. Legally Blonde. Usually what you think of when you think of Reese. There's a good reason for that. She wasn't that great in this movie. She played an annoying, snobby overachiever, and that just didn't fit her very well. F***k me, Mr. McAllister? Please! She's a student, for godsakes!  Matthew and Reese are those people who do really well if they're given better material, or so it shows in this movie. They don't really make the best pair.

My first thoughts were that this movie lost a bit the realitysense but to my great shock it all seemed based on real events and after having seen this movie you probably think twice before you rent your house! It all starts when a couple (Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine) buy their dreamhouse but as such things are expensive (yeah we know!) they must rent two parts of the house. One is rent by an ordinary Japanese family but for the other etage it seems they cant find a candidate till a man shows up with a Porsche (Michael Keaton). Drake Goodman (Modine) really cant hear anything bad about Carter Hayes (Keaton) especially not if he sees the money in the mans wallet but Patty (Griffith) isn't that convinced and soon she has right as the promised rentmoney never cames and Drake develops himself to a real evil  and it's not just the house he wants destroy and with tears in their eyes the young couple must witness how the American justice protects the renter... It all might be a bit predictable but Schlessinger uses such unique (and quite shocking) plots to catch the attention of the viewer that is the kind of movie you always wanna see back and Modine plays such a twat that you tend to be in favour of Keaton, if only there wasn't Griffith! One of the best roles I ever saw from Michael Keaton!
