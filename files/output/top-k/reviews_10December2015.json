[{"date":"10 December 2015","score":"","review":" Patch Adams is the most Robin Williams Robin Williams movie I've ever seen. Unfortunately, the cute premise far overstays its welcome and we miss our disbelief which we have to suspend at the door. Williams is typically fine - not nearly as fun as he is in superior work Good Morning Vietnam or Mrs Doubtfire - but solid. Monica Potter sleepwalks through the movie with a sour face and little else, whilst Daniel London contributes next to nothing. For me - what a non- shock - the standout is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whose furious monologue at his fun-loving slacker roommate is startlingly profound and out of place in what is otherwise a dull screenplay.The film stays about forty minutes too long, with Williams and the always good Bob Gunton having the same argument every three or four scenes. Lots of slapstick comedy makes for a good return on investment but does the story of real life Hunter Adams a great injustice. The final scenes play out like a far less well executed version of Scent of a Woman, which feels completely flat despite having much higher stakes. A comparison with Billy Madison would be more apt - and not in a good way.
