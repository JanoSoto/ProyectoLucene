It's like they just went with the first draft they received and said to hell with it, let's make money. Now, I loved the first MIB film. A funny, quirky in it's own way yet instantly memorable movie about a government agent that protects Earth from aliens as well as monitoring alien activity. MIB 2 consists of all the same gags, rehashed material and such as the first one, yet it does it far, far worse.The lines delivered in the movie sound like they were written by a 10 year old, and the dialogue was generally just forced jokes and straight up not funny jokes throughout. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did what they could with this script, as their performances aren't terrible by any means (it's especially funny when K gets his memory back) but they seem uninspired compared to the first. About halfway through the movie we are treated to Agent Z doing a Crouching-Tiger -esque kicks while he floats in midair for about 7 seconds. This type of humour belongs in martial arts spoof, not MIB. There are tons of other flaws like a PS2 controller being used to navigate their car, Michael Jackson having a cameo as an alien, everything about MIB 2 just screams unoriginal. That being said, it does have some redeeming points which stop it from being unwatchable. The chemistry between J and K takes a bit more time to develeop again this time round, but when they do its funny till the end. The SFX are OK, though i thought they were better in the first one, and even though the ending was rushed it was a nice surprise that i didn't see coming.MIB 2, not required viewing by any means, but if your a fan of the original at least worth checking out. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" MIB 2 takes place 5 years after the first Men In Black film, both on film and in real-time, and I couldn't believe in that 5 years this is the script they agreed on.

Ah-yawn. Well, maybe. It depends on your perspective, and I'm sincere in my belief that there's something about this movie that transcends it's own badness. From the look of the TV spots over a decade ago, it seemed like it was so horrible, by all accounts, that it SHOULDN'T exist! Anyway, me and my brother relived Ed-mania on premium cable the other night, and something odd struck me. Is it possible that this movie is a satire on what Hollywood thinks the lowest common denominator enjoys? Sports? Check. The show Friends? Cast member that the sports bar crowd fancies as their ideal self is in tow. A primate dressing like a person? We'll do you one recursion better. A person dressed as a primate dressing like a person.The Chuck Jones cartoon sound effects are there, transforming the shock of violence and injury into temporary and absurd conditions. The spirit of the Munsters, a satire on immigrants living in American suburbia, arises in unnecessary fast-tracking film techniques to make this world more cartoon-like and sped up during moments of intensity.The American ideals are constantly lampooned upon, sometimes in ways we're so used to living here that we don't immediately notice them. It's very telling throughout the picture, but I'll only focus on some of the final scenes, which is everything that follows a car chase (I mean, after all, car chases are part and parcel in crazy American life).A girl child prays to God at the eve of the big game to spare the life of the chimp in the hospital bed. As soon as she lays the chimp's pitcher mitt on his lap to go blithely get a drink of some apple juice (or something, I was distracted), the heart monitor begins to beep in steady rhythm and the once comatose chimp recovers and is eager to go to the big game. This entire drama, from the setup to the climax, is about twenty seconds in length. We didn't know beforehand that the chimp was so badly frozen in the truck that it would resign him to a hospital bed, and that cognitive dissonance is just as intentional as the scene where the chimp watches late night TV and plays with his food, I assure you.Before the final pitch of the big game, a distressed Matt LeBlanc wipes the sweat on his brow and calls for a time out. He runs to the stands and steals a kiss from the attractive woman, and turns to the chimp. The chimp licks his finger tip and knowingly chalks up another as Matt LeBlanc shows his dental work and nods in sinister agreement. As he heads back to the mound, he is now destined not to blow the game at all. The woman and a girl child stand in awe as their hair blows in the wind in one half of the shot, and the other half of the angle incorporates the American flag flying high and proudly. Now we have a nuclear family, including a family pet. Except the pet is not a pet. And the girl is not her daughter. Yes, those conflicts with the ideal are intentional. It's pointing out an absurdity that even the misfits can pull themselves together and be the ideal if we so choose, but only in movies.There are many ways to take the symbolism in this movie, and all of them are deeply cynical and rightfully critical of white culture and Hollywood, alike. Unfortunately, this film will only be preaching to the converted just as Beavis and Butthead also did in the same era, while sterile and boring masses take it at face value. The roman a clef to that show was that what they were saying itself was not the joke, but the fact that THEY THEMSELVES found it funny. The further recursion was that the kids who took the show at face value were looking in the mirror while looking in the TV--sitting on their couch, looking dead ahead at B&B sitting on the couch.I only go off on that tangent to say that Ed is doing a similar thing, but not getting the same kind of recognition for it because it's a few steps ahead of even this time and offers us no crutch of the mirror stage. That is, with the no-brow ironic movement starting to wane and with the introduction of the new sincerity movement where there is NO shred of irony, this is a very hard movie to place because the intent isn't spelled out for us. Were the movie makers being sincere in the way Ed Wood was sincere, and just didn't know they were making a terrible movie children would hate? Were they trying to be ironic, and try to make a farce of the Hollywood conventions in the hopes that the audience would go through an hour and a half deprogramming session? Or what is most likely in the children's market today--try to make a quick buck off in the risky market of imitating more successful movies, in hopes that parents would accidentally pick their movie up thinking it was a Disney Home Video movie? These are three dangerous prongs to dance on, because nobody has time to think about these things except for young adults that play XBOX Live too much. So the movie is a Chinese puzzle box, in this way...and I have the sneaking suspicion that the Ed team planned that all along.Trust me, if you smoke a few bowls this will all make sense, man.

The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) **** (out of 4) A lonely young boy (Henry Thomas) finds a stranded alien who he calls E.T. and must help him get back home. It's rather strange how sentimental this movie is because the farthest back in life that I can remember is my mother taking me to see this on opening night. If the release date for this on IMDb is correct then I 25 months and 2 days old. It's strange but I still remember just about every feeling that I was feeling while watching the movie then and I still fondly remember the reaction that the other kids were having while watching the movie. All these years later I still have the same affection towards the film and it still makes me lose it like a little girl just like it did when I first watched it. I certainly don't think this is a movie for young kids due to various subject matters including death but I once read an interview with Spielberg who said it was a film for anyone who believes. This is certainly one of the most magical movies out there due to its sense of wonder and its meaning of friendship. In a lot of science-fiction movies we really don't get to know or feel for the characters but that's not the case here because the screenplay is so smart that we learn all sorts of facts about not only the humans but E.T. himself. Thomas gives the greatest performance here that I've ever seen from a child but I'd probably go even further by calling it one of the greatest ever put to film. The range of emotions he has to display is rather amazing considering his age. Dee Wallace, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton and Peter Coyote are all very good as well. The greatest performance in the film has to go to the special effects that created E.T. and made him one of the most memorable characters in the history of film. The 2002 CGI enhanced version is pure garbage but the original creature is one of the greatest to ever come to the screen and it's just amazing at how well he holds up and how human they were able to make him. With his funny talk, silly walk and human eyes, he really is one of the most loved characters in film history. I also find John Williams score to be the best work of his career and it certainly gives an extra charge to all of the scenes, especially at the end.

One, they made the effort to try to establish some reasons to think these two actually belong together, as opposed to the more typical Hollywood deal of, well, they're right for each other because we say so, and here's the sentimental violin music to prove it.The other thing I liked is that the Walter character, the fiancé who's doomed to ultimately be the loser in this game of romance, is actually made out to be a half-decent guy. He's not made out to be an obvious putz that we know is all wrong for the woman, which would be the usual Hollywood thing to do (i.e. His Girl Friday or The Philadelphia Story (don't get me wrong, *great* movies, but you see my point)). Yeah, the whole excessive allergy thing is rather loserish, but other than that, he seems like a perfectly fine guy, who treats her well and really would try hard to make her happy, and in general she really does seem to respond to him and, at least on some level, be in love with him. Look at how happy she is, for instance, to get his valentine card. This all works very well, because it really does introduce a feeling of doubt in our minds... is she really going to leave him? I thought that was a very nice touch.So in the end, I enjoyed it.Although I'm left wondering at the end... they *still* haven't solved the problem that it's like 26 states between Seattle and Baltimore (as someone in a very-long-distance relationship, I can report first-hand that that kind of problem can be *very* hard to solve, true love or not), ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2008","score":"","review":" What can I tell you?

I was round 14\/15 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn (American can't make sweets to save their lives).X-Men is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues. It has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government, the AIDs virus and the Holocaust. There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g. Rogue and Cyclops. There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.The plot of the film is in the world they are mutants, people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather. They are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the US Senate for the Mutant Regisration Act, to get details of every mutant in the USA. Within the mutant community there are two major factors, the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier, want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the Brotherhood, led by Erik Lehnsherr\/Magento, believes that the human race would never accept Mutants and that a war is coming. In the middle of this are two mutants, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paqulin). Wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and Rogue is a teenage runaway, who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him. Mangento wants Rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the world's leaders in mutants.This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who's most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller. He chose to focus on character development which was a good move. He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak. He made the film into a realistic sci-fi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers. He made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics, like the codenames and the costumers. The film does tackles ideas like Wolverine's tortured past and his rivalry with Cyclops, Xavier's friendship with his rival Magneto, the human factor, Wolverine's need to protect children, the list goes on. The film also has a good international cast, Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellon, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden and Anna Paquin. The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise.

My problem came with the ending. Although there is more explanation in the director's cut of Donnie Darko, it does nothing to change the fact that this is three different films, but the ending picks one (science fiction) and renders the other two possibilities (a religious parable or a film about teenage angst) moot. That said, the acting is great, the writing is sharp, the editing is crisp...one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I understand why many younger people feel so passionately about it. I am a few years older than the director (I graduated high school in 1983) so I also appreciate the generational quality of the film.My problem is, for the first 90 minutes of the film, I thought I was watching a really fantastic film about a young man who might be schizophrenic, with all that entailed for his family and friends. I began to wonder if the religious allegories might be more appropriate. Then, with the ending, it suddenly became nothing more than Groundhog Day or Memento...a better-than-average Twilight Zone alternate universe story. I might have suspected this at the very beginning (when the jet engine should have killed Donnie) but thought this was a leading to something grander than the old you have a month to get your life in order scenario. I really did like it, but I have to give a strong negative for this cheated feeling I had after. This is what always results from a deux ex machina, which Donnie actually mumbles at the end, his tormentor's knife at his throat.

He also has a secret he does not reveal which is that he tapes women talking about sex in order that he gets off.This is the mix that Steven Soderbergh combines to create an amazing film that sucks the viewer into this strangely disturbing, yet, beautiful world as the different elements come together to form a very different picture of relationships and the human condition that goes with you after you leave the cinema.The music is, well, not really music, more like a concoction of sound to go with the mood at a particular moment, but it captures the mood more elegantly than any attempted tune could. The performances by Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher are great as the couple whose relationship is just a concoction of lies, while James Spader is immaculate as the quietly disastrous Graham who has found a unique way to push women away while getting close enough to them to feel sexually close to them.A great film that I sadly see in a lot of bargain bins because, like so many films of the eighties, it's association with this period of cinema, makes it regarded as somehow less than it is, when it is so much more than the sum of the era that spawned it.

Those who made films like Rollerball, Westworld and Capricorn One did so on the assumption that the future would look like a marginally trendier version of the seventies and that they could therefore save money on designing expensive sets and costumes. The other school of thought held that the future would look very different from the present, although even this school tended to rely on a few clichés rather than use their imaginations. Logan's Run was made according to the tenets of this second school, and duly trots out their standard received ideas. We learn, for example, that in the twenty-second century all buildings will still be in the Modernist style of the twentieth, only made of plastic rather than steel, glass and concrete. Men will wear Lycra shell-suits and women diaphanous mini-dresses. Everyone will travel by monorail or moving walkway. And everyone will be young, beautiful, fit and healthy.The plot borrows elements from a number of other science-fiction works. From Arthur C. Clarke's The City and the Stars it borrows the idea of a domed city, hermetically sealed off from the outside world. From Huxley's Brave New World it borrows baby factories; children are not born naturally but produced in hatcheries. The scenes of a ruined Washington DC owe something to the Statue of Liberty scene in Planet of the Apes.Logan's Run has one original idea of its own. There is a good reason why everyone is young, beautiful, fit and healthy; at the age of thirty everyone is subject to compulsory ritual euthanasia (euphemistically known as renewal). The greatest crime is to run, to try and leave the city in order to escape this fate. The title character, Logan, is a sandman, one of an elite police force whose function is to hunt down and kill runners. The film explores what happens when Logan himself becomes a runner and tries to leave the city with Jessica, a beautiful girl with whom he has fallen in love. Pursued by Francis, a former colleague of Logan, they escape to a now-ruined Washington where they meet an old man living with only cats for company.There are a number of gaps in the plot; it is never explained how Washington came to be ruined, what has become of its former inhabitants or how Peter Ustinov has managed to survive there while everyone else has been killed or fled. Plot-holes are not necessarily a bad thing in science fiction; we do not, for example, waste much time while watching the original Planet of the Apes in wondering how the apes came to take over the Earth. (There were, of course, four sequels made in which it was explained exactly how they did so, but none of those sequels is anywhere near as good as the original). There is, however, a more vital plot-hole in Logan's Run, one which I think does affect our enjoyment.The film is (like Brave New World and Orwell's 1984) an example of dystopian science fiction. Although such works are ostensibly set in the future, they are really satires on the ages in which they were written. Their purpose is to draw attention to some feature of modern society which the author finds objectionable and to show how that feature could, at some future date, have disastrous consequences. (Orwell's main targets were totalitarian ideologies like fascism and communism). The main character is typically a young man who is discontented with the values of his society.In general Logan's Run follows this pattern. The social evils against which it appears to be targeted are the generation gap, the tendency, very prevalent in the sixties and seventies, to glorify youth at the expense of age and the don't trust anyone over thirty mentality. Logan is the young malcontent equivalent to Winston Smith or John the Savage, with Jessica the equivalent of Julia or Lenina. In one important respect, however, it departs from the standard model. Most dystopian novels have a raisonneur, equivalent to O'Brien in 1984 or Mustapha Mond in Brave New World, whose task is to persuade the rebellious hero to conform to the values of his society. There is no equivalent character in Logan's Run, so we never find out exactly what the ruling value-system of Logan's city is, why it is considered necessary to kill off the entire population in the prime of their lives and why so many people accept this fate uncomplainingly.When I recently saw this film for the first time in many years, I realised that I had confused its plot with that of the spin-off TV series. In that series the city was controlled by a hidden elite of elderly men who killed off everyone else at thirty in order to prevent their power from being challenged. Francis was so anxious to hunt down his former friend because he had been promised membership of this elite if he succeeded. Although the series was not a great success, it did at least try and answer some of the questions that the film avoided.Michael York, 34 when the film was made, is strictly speaking too old for his role, but looks youthful enough to get away with it. (Richard Jordan, who plays Francis, was 38). The lovely Jenny Agutter makes an appealing heroine as Jessica. Jenny was one of a number of British actresses from around this period who looked to be on the verge of becoming major Hollywood stars but never quite made it. Seen as a simply science-fiction adventure the film provides some exciting moments, although some scenes today seem unintentionally comic, especially the one with Box, the frozen-food processing robot.

I was shocked that a best-picture Oscar winner could be as trite and boring as this one.In defense of myself, let me first say (1) I am no grouch. The same day I saw Going My Way (GMW), I happened to to re-see the wonderful Captains Courageous and cried throughout. I like Bing Crosby and found The Bells of St Mary (the one starring Crosby and Ingrid Bergman) to be immensely enjoyable, a zillion times better than GMW. I loved, and highly recommend, Leo McCarey's (the director of GMW) An Affair to Remember (starring Cary Grant).(2) There were a few moments to like about GMW the whole idea of a priest rescuing a neighborhood and church; the whole idea of Crosby being appointed to supersede\/ease out Fitzgerald without the later realizing it; Crosby and Fitzgerald's acting and chemistry; the young man joining the war effort; and the reunion scene with the mother at the end (one of the most powerful\/tearful scenes I have ever seen).Other than those few scenes, there were no powerful, clever moments. Most of the music did nothing for me. A lot of what went on seemed scattered, unrelated, trite and too brief, too unconvincing. As one reviewer said, it was as though Crosby quickly waved a magic wand to get results, like easily\/suddenly converting a street gang into a choir. On one hand, the film reminded me of those silly B-films of the period where they say, hey, why not have a dance to raise money to.... On the other hand, there were hardly any moral\/social\/priestly problems that we see Crosby seriously\/laboriously grappling with -- it is mostly singing, playing golf, eating and mingling with the upper crust (the moral of the movie seems to be turn things over to a guy with good connections). He solves the runaway girl's problem with a $10 bill, for example. I don't know what he did for the elderly women tenant neighbors. Sorry, but I wanted to like it.

While I do admit that The Great Escpae is still a better movie than this one (The Great Escape is probably one of my favorite all time movies) this movie is a great and classic one as well.Just like The Great Escape, the movie knows to create a perfect balance between its drama and comedy. This movie could easily been turned into a heavy war drama but instead a more light approach gets picked, without loosing any of its serious and more dramatic power. It makes the movie entertaining as well as effectively powerful. It can be assumed that The Great Escape and its style got inspired by this movie.The movie is a 'great' portrayal of the lives of American officer POW's, in a German stalag. They try to make the best of it, with very limited resources. Every small thing and things that are out of the ordinary are the things that make them go through their days and is what's keeping them alive. The first halve of the movie isn't even about the William Holden character and he is just one of the boys. It isn't after about halve way through the movie that the story takes to take shape and the main plot of the movie becomes obvious. In advance you would just expect from this movie to be one about POW's trying to escape. But the story is way better written and layered than that though.But it above all things is also a very well made and especially directed one, by 6 time Academy Award winner Billy Wilder. He also received a directing nomination for this movie. It's a '50's movie but it doesn't feel like one. The movie seems to be ahead of its time with its story handling, directing and just overall style of film-making. The camera-work is especially great and worth mentioning.William Holden does a great job at portraying a complicated character. At first you just don't know what to think of him and he isn't a very likable character but he slowly turns into a strong and more important character, that starts doing the right thing. Holden also actually won an Oscar for his role in this movie, despite the fact that he never really wanted to do this movie. It was the only Oscar he ever got, which makes it quite ironic.A great powerful, entertaining classic, which was truly ahead of its time.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2008","score":"20 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":" Despite the fact that this movie got made 10 years before the WW II POW classic The Great Escape, the movie is still known as the 'other' WW II POW movie.

If this movie is to be believed, it is an urban nightmare (or at least was, circa 1971). Trash-strewn lawns jammed next to crowded overhead freeways, filthy sidewalks, bleak alleys and side-streets patrolled by young punks waiting to break into your car. At one point, a cop walks past a downtown doorway where lies a man in an overcoat, face down. The cop doesn't even blink or slow down; he just keeps on walking. It has nothing to do with the plot of the movie, it's strictly background, or ambiance. And downtown itself seems to be mainly a collection of small restaurants, boutiques, and newsstands crowded together at street level. What goes on in the second, third, and fourth stories of these buildings? Something tells me we don't want to know. And what a plethora of eateries, which I found strange because should I ever find myself in this Brooklyn, getting something to eat would be dead last on my list of things to do. The people are busy, driven it seems; there's not a soft or sentimental character in the movie. Typifying them is 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman), a narcotics cop who is driven to bust drug users and dealers. He's not on any moralistic crusade; one could make the argument that he's no better a human being than the people he arrests. But it's his all-consuming passion, for some reason, and he seems to have no other life to really speak of. He and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), get a tip about a big heroin shipment on its way to New York and the various plot elements start to fall into place. Much has been said about the chase scene later in the film, and it is a knockout, sort of the granddaddy of all great chase scenes. In a sense, though, the whole MOVIE is one long chase, as Doyle and Russo spend almost all of their waking hours tailing one suspect or another. There is one sequence in particular, just prior to the great chase, where Doyle shadows the prime heroin smuggler Alain Charnier (a wonderfully cool and smug performance by Fernando Rey). It is every bit as well-staged as the car chase that follows, except here it is simply one man trying to follow another through the labyrinth of downtown Brooklyn without losing him. Charnier offers no hint that he suspects he is being followed; he never looks directly at Doyle, even when glancing around. The audience is as frustrated as Doyle when Charnier walks through shops and across streets almost interminably before getting on a subway train, only to get off before it leaves, then get on again, at which point Doyle loses him. It is only when Charnier looks at Doyle directly for the first time through the train window and offers a small wave goodbye that we realize he knew all along. Great stuff. The success of 'The French Connection' both at the box-office and the Academy Awards says something about the era in which it was produced. The early seventies were the time for gritty, violent cop thrillers. The first 'Dirty Harry' film came out the same year. 'French Connection' spawned not only a sequel of its own, but a follow-up of sorts starring Roy Scheider, 'The Seven-Ups.' Even good old John Wayne briefly got into the act with 'McQ.' Audiences were really enjoying the realism and profane dialogue recently unleashed and rated 'R.' Looking back on it now, 'The French Connection' plays like a tough little indie film, and has an almost documentary feel to it in places. It is part and parcel of its era, a grimy time capsule of the early 70's.

No big catastrophes or changes are made with any of the characters--we just see how these former radicals are now dealing with life. Sounds boring but I found it absolutely fascinating.

I have a truckload of negative adjectives that I feel like applying to Alien Resurrection, and I think they all fit.I know some people don't share my appreciation for Alien 3, but good grief, I think it's miles better than this installment. Indeed, Alien Resurrection strikes me as one of those train-wreck movies that leaves the average viewer scratching her head, wondering why a studio would ever give the green light to such a misguided project.Alien 3, unpopular though it was, brought the Alien saga to a very definite close by killing off the protagonist, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. In this film, Ripley is not-very-convincingly brought back to life as a clone. Indeed, this whole movie focuses on the cloning issue to the exclusion of all else; it's clearly trying to say something about genetic manipulation, or parenthood, or whatever, but the message (if any) is lost in a quagmire of grossness and bad writing.Speaking of bad writing, the movie's scriptwriter was none other than Joss Whedon, he of Buffy fame. I gather that Whedon has sort of disowned Alien Resurrection because he doesn't like the way his script was realized, but I'd argue that the script was fundamentally unsound to begin with. It's loaded with techno-babble, profanity and pilfered ideas, and populated by a cast of seedy, cardboard and thoroughly unlikable characters. Apart from Ripley, the only character who gets any development is Winona Ryder's cyborg-lady, but Ryder's acting stinks and her motivations aren't that interesting anyway.Really, this film is the worst possible blend of elements from previous Alien movies. Unlike the first Alien and Alien 3, it lacks the presence of a single, unstoppable, awesome alien creature - and unlike Aliens, it lacks the excitement of a whole hoard of alien creatures. In Alien Resurrection, there are 12 *somewhat stoppable* aliens - ho, hum. So we haven't got the sheer terror value of the first film here, or the raw energy of the second. We've got 12 aliens milling around yet another boring spaceship setting. What an ill-conceived idea.There's only one really good scene in this film - the underwater action segment, which is more sophisticated than any of the battles in the other Alien films. But since I don't care about the characters, I don't care about who dies in that scene. And, apart from that one exciting bit, the film has few merits, choosing to get mired again and again in disgusting concepts and disgusting imagery of mutants, clones, and a half-Alien half-human creature with saggy boobs. Gross.If the tagline for the second film was this time, it's war, the tagline for this one should have been, this time, bring a barf bag. Or, better yet, this time...stay home. Atrocious stuff.

That it is one of the best movies ever we all already know. What makes me like it so much? It was the movie that got me interested in the Movie industry. The movie that touched me so much i immediately knew that I wanted to make movies. Without this movie my life wouldn't look like it does today. But it isn't just me that this movie has affected. The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.Based on the Novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather, after a lot of problems during the shooting, was released in 1972 and was a great success. It was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best director Francis Ford Coppola, best Costumes, Best Supporting Actor Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Best Scrip based on previously published or produced material Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola, Best Leading Actor Marlon Brando and Best Movie, and won the three last mentioned. The movie got 3 sequel's, one released in 1974 and one in 1990, both directed by Coppola and written by Puzo.The acting is superb, Brando does the performance of his life. Al Pacino, who got his breakthrough in this movie, together with James Caan and Robert Duvall make perfect supporting actors. For examples take a look at Pacino in the restaurant scene, Caan when he is arguing with Tom Hagen, or Duvall when he delivers a horrible message to his father played by Brando. The writing is amazing, it is true to the amazing novel, a lot of the dialogue is taken directly from it. The directing is perfect, he sets the perfect feeling and mood for the movie and it's a mystery that he didn't win the Oscar for his directing.To conclude the review.The Godfather is a true masterpiece that no-one should miss, maybe it will change your life the way it changed mine? It is in my Opinion The best Motion Picture ever created.
