I had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like Scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. Goodfellas is based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry Hill from the beginning till the end.The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who's played by Ray Liotta. The narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. I've never been so impressed of Liotta's performance than I was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. I've never seen Joe Pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's the mighty Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can't go wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor\/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I wouldn't say it's downhill after that but I'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why I said it's too long. I feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. The second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it's Scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie.Goodfellas is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. You don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie.

Fans of French Stewart (3rd Rock From the Sun) will at least be entertained by his many one-liners. Unfortunately they are the only elements that work in this ill-advised movie. Like a lot of this mid-budget stuff, Love Stinks places its characters in ultra upscale surroundings and shows them living posh life styles; trying to fool viewers into believing it is a high-end production. But few moviegoers come from the richest portion of the 20- something demographic. Those living a less than swank lifestyle found viewer identification difficult; so the movie was quickly pulled from its theatrical distribution. Almost everyone else will have difficulty connecting with the film, which is basically the story of Seth's (Stewart) efforts to escape the grasp of the beautiful Chelsea, his materialistic and totally controlling interior decorator. Like this is a continuing problem for all of us! Chelsea is played by former beauty queen Bridgette Wilson (I Know What You Did Last Summer). Wilson is a better actress than she is given credit for people tend to dismiss her because of her non-acting background, and she is well suited to this type of bad girl role. But the script gives her no opportunity to add dimension to this character. At least most of us have seen this sort of mega-manipulative blonde at work. Desperate to marry, Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights, pressures him into a quick commitment, moves in and alters his priorities, then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback, necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature. Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast, which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner (Kenny Bania from Seinfeld) also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film. Love Stinks was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating Full House and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. Ultimately, all you are left with are Stewart's occasional one-liners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film. Then again, what do I know?

As for my self, I don't know if I would call it boring, it did hold my attention, I did not fall asleep, even though I only slept 3 or 4 hours the night before, but I do think that the film is a failure on many fronts. I would rate it a 6 out of 10, and I'll tell you why.First the film is slow, one of the very slowest films of that I have ever seen. There is no pacing, it never picks up at all, except at the end where it goes into second gear. The film is slow in every aspect, from the pacing to the camera movements and worst of all, is that this only hurts the film in times when it is supposed to be a moment of reflection in the movie- like Nicholson's speech on the bridge- but you hardly notice because it just continues the same pace as the rest of the movie. The action does pick up at the very, very end; but still not even at a level that John Ford would move at. Its just slow, and for no real reason. So much time is wasted in this film on nothing, and there is never any anticipation, except at the very very end, and it does not have nearly as dramatic an effect as it could have. Secondly, in this movie, that runs at close to 3 hours, there are only 4 real characters in the movie. Nicholson, who only develops enough to come to a point where he wonders about his legacy. Saeto who becomes softer, though still undoubtedly a bad man. Shears, who becomes less of a whiner, and almost courageous at the end-at least enough to get himself killed. And of course Wardon, whose only change is physical-he'll probably end up losing his foot.Not that a movie must have characters who grow to make it a good film, but if it doesn't have that than it better have other things. The photography was outstanding, but I am sorry to say that there was no cinematography in this film. The camera seemed like it never moved, and there seemed to be less than five tracking shots in the whole picture. I can watch this with Ozu, but not in an adventure\/epic. Though I understand that the colors have become drained over time, I didn't see much there other than green, so I can't imagine the film being all that lush even on opening night, 1957.It is plain to see that Lean did learn a few things from this film, and put those lessons to good use in the much better Lawrence of Arabia. It still is a very long movie, with only one real character, whose development is rather vague, but at least it is sumptuous and colorful, and the supporting cast has personality and more talent. And LoA had action to pick the movie up a bit, though neither film contained much humor.I must say that I haven't been this disappointed in a film in a long while. The Bridge on the Rived Kwai is a film that never once moved me in any real or even 'artificial' way. I never felt anything...oh except for the end, when something perhaps could have been resolved, but all we get is Nicholson Accidentally fainting and falling on the plunger. What kind of ending is that? The main character doesn't make a decision to blow the bridge or not, NO, he is given a pass, a scape goat and it is an accident, maybe if he would have blown it up or NOT the audience would have been forced to feel something-David Lean obviously did not want that.

The balance of these films is the reason I vote them so high. Allow me to explain.The first hour or so of Rocky Two was very painful to watch. Not because of the actors or direction, but the story line. I frowned when Rocky and Adrian are just buying on impulse, wasting a lot of money, but the part that really hurt was when Rocky is dressed as a caveman and is doing commercials. That part was humiliating to the character, and it shows how famous people making commercials can turn into something absolutely stupid.However, the rest of the film was very well done. Sly is the obviously ideal Rocky, Talia is in her element, and the supporting characters are all good. Carl Weathers was on the fence in my opinion, because I didn't like the way he talked of himself in the first person. In my opinion, he was much better in Rocky 3.The movie was at its best up to when Adrian wakes up from her coma and tells Rocky to fight Apollo Creed again. The training scenes are always my favourite parts of the Rocky movies, as are the final fights. The music is amazing, the training believable, and they completely balance out the films.Rocky Two is a great movie to watch, as are the first and third of the series. Indeed, I think this saga will always stand with such series as The Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Batman, and those other series that will forever be watched by generations to come.

The balance of these films is the reason I vote them so high. Allow me to explain.The first hour or so of Rocky Two was very painful to watch. Not because of the actors or direction, but the story line. I frowned when Rocky and Adrian are just buying on impulse, wasting a lot of money, but the part that really hurt was when Rocky is dressed as a caveman and is doing commercials.

Without a doubt this 1977 masterpiece from George Lucas which he done it by his own independent and rebel way clearly is one of the greatest films ever made. So many themes and elements are present mainly a tale of good against evil it comes down to light vs. dark. Plenty of mythology is present as Lucas shows by the different cultures of the film and that one must believe in higher powers to accomplish things. Star Wars has it's own civil war battle with the big focus on the rebels and the empire's fight over the galaxy with the Empire's greatest weapon being the mighty Death Star which is ruled by an iron fist with the cruel and powerful Darth Vader. Yet even though Jedi Knights are supposedly long gone, enter Luke Skywalker who's the film wild card who just as a simple farm boy wants and has bigger plans to be a Jedi and defeat the evil empire. Help is provided along the way for Skywalker by the beautiful Princess Leia, and droids C-3PO, and R2-D2(who sends the secret messages and signals) and most importantly the trust and experience of loyalty from Obi- Wan Kenobi. As the furry Chewbacca and cocky pilot Han Solo provide the transportation during this galaxy adventure. I must say also that the special effects and model crafted spaceships used in the film are superb many had never saw anything like it. Great job from George Lucas his direction of the scenes and sets is fabulous. Really what more can I say this movie is so special to me since it was one of the first I saw and being a little kid in the 70's it has a special place in my heart. Seeing this for the first time it was like my real cowboy movie, making me role play in my head and among friends the character of Luke Skywalker thinking he was real I wanted to be him! This epic saga also was the film that started to make me collect action figures, and truly believe in myself and see that the world was about good versus evil. Star Wars created a lasting impact on our times and culture a great tale of morality, faith, good versus evil, and it had all the genres of fantasy, adventure, escape, sci-fiction, and drama mixed together. Really one of my favorite movies of all-time, and always remember what it taught us all May the force be with you.

I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions, and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.On reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers Uma Thurman in leather always a plus, Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory, and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears.

I certainly believe this is a crash course in how to shoot Gothic horror the real way. The opening is just astounding with all the cobwebs, possums, the lady vampires and how they submit to their awakening master, and Lugosi appearing for the first time in all his splendor. His eyes, as the light glistens upon them, wreak of power and lust..whoever faces these eyes have to submit their will to his. Few weak minds, if any, can outlast the power of Count Dracula. Such richly macabre dialogue stands etched in horror lore from, I bid you welcome, to The blood is the life, Renfield..each line becomes so eerie when rolled off the tongue of Lugosi. Some consider Lugosi's performance hammy, but I just revel in the way he stretches his dialogue..it becomes so quotable. Lugosi was simply born to play this creature of the night and when someone says Dracula, some might think Chris Lee, but most envision Lugosi with his vile stare that penetrates the very soul. His equal, let's just admit it, is Dwight Frye as the crazed Renfield, once quite a sane, intelligent, soft-spoken office type reverted to a blood-thirsty maniac because of Dracula. It's that fiendish, stark-raving madness that is so intensely memorable..no one can match this performance, so why even try? But, it's the way director Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund set up creepy darkened shot after creepy darkened shot of Dracula waiting out in the darkness commanding others to do his bidding that makes this such an endearing horror classic. Some might think Edward Van Sloan might be a bit too theatrical as Van Helsing, but I can't imagine anybody else in that scene where Dracula tries to pull his rival towards him with mind control only to find his adversary's will is too strong even for him.My favorite scenes, to be honest, occur in Transylvania before the film settles in London because the castle and way Lugosi is shot are so burned in my mind. Just the way Dracula looks inside his decrepit abode on the stairwell as he stares at Renfield with that fiendish blood-lust so apparent or where we see an armadillo climbing from a coffin with this skeletal hand peeking ever slightly out. Or, the scene where Renfield receives his ride on the horse carriage as Dracula hides enough under a black cloak to remain anonymous..each Gothic set-up is a hypnotic entrapment for the fan in love with the moody set up of atmospheric horror. I watched this with the Philip Glass score and must say I prefer it..something majestic occurs when we hear the eruption of strings as Dracula appears. The score, for me, takes away the creaky criticism that so often accompanies one's insult towards it.
