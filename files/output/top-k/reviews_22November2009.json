But his experiences in the trenches of the first world war leave him a broken man, and he returns to Savannah a shadow of his former self, to afraid to resume his romance with Adele. Years later the depression hits and Adele's family's investment in a grand golf course and club is threatening to go bankrupt. As a last attempt Adele invites two of the best golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, to a two day competition with a grand prize of 10 000 dollars. To defend the local honor Rannulph is convinced to play, but he has lost his swing. Out of nowhere Bagger Vance appears and offers to caddie for him.Comments A top notch feel good movie, with some romantic flair. There are some ominous feelings, mostly in Rannulph's war memories and the depression effects, but the most suspense are in the feelings between Rannulph and Adele. It's also the main point in the story, as Rannulph's play hinges on him sorting his emotions out.The acting of the three leading actors and actress is impressive and is the main benefit from the entire movie. Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very good as Rannulph, Bagger and Adele respectively. Damon's and Theron's characters are maybe the most interesting as they have their history and conflicting feelings together. But Smit's portrayal of Bagger is just stellar. He always has some wise advice to give but is also always so easy going, always with a smile on his face. There doesn't seem to be any conflicts within him, all the more impressive for Smith to make his character deep and complex.Maybe the best part is that there is no bad guys. It is too typical and too easy to have one of the competitors to be a real scum. But here both competitors are pure gentleman, and based on real golfers too. The entire movie is about to win the fight within yourself, so no exterior threat is needed. It is nice to see that they didn't take the easy way and introduced one.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Recap Rannulph Junuh is a promising young golfer who also has won the heart of the beautiful Adele Invergordon.
