Japanese animation is not well known in the United States, but I've very positive that once you watch Princess Mononoke, you'll begin to understand why it is the best form of animation to date.I watched the original Japanese version late last year and it already captured my heart with so much beauty and a very powerful creation from Hayao Miyazaki (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service).  After watching a dubbed Kiki by Disney, I began to pray that they will do as good with Mononoke as they did with Kiki.  I'm happy to say, they did one great job.I'm a little concerned about the casting of Claire Danes and Billy Bob Thornton, but it is quickly made up through an excellent translation of the script by comic book writer Neil Gaiman (Sandman) and other great voice actors, including Minnie Driver who knows exactly how to do voice acting (See Tarzan).All these critics who are giving the film a bad rap should really focus on the story and what it really is about than the B.S. they're writing.  It's PG-13 and it was made in Japan.  You'd expect a Japanese animated feature to be violent, not for children in the U.S., and a little longer than normal animated feature length.  Quote Roger Ebert, If the Academy is looking for early nominations for Best Picture, look no further than Princess Mononoke.  May not be the exact quote, but that's the message he is delivering.

I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the N word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.

Okay, so I figured I was going to get scared, and I wasn't, but it was still a ton of fun and very exciting. And how about those crazy decapitations?!  Tim Burton is an amazing visual storyteller, and this movie is perfect for him.  Nobody could do Sleepy Hollow better than him, and Johnny Depp was just great.  This is going to have to become a Thanksgiving tradition!  What a good time at the movies.

This movie was poorly directed and simply too cartoony with the sets and special effects, in contrast to the first film, which had a much more realistic, stylized look.  I liked the bigger array of characters but thought it was stupid that hardly any of them were mentioned by name or had a maximum screen time of 5 minutes and the animality nonsense at the end was silly.  The acting is rather subpar, as if anyone who saw it couldn't guess that already.  I did enjoy the music though and promptly picked up the soundtrack.  Overall, though it could have been better, it's not a horrible movie and it's a good watch if you're not in the mood for anything else.

On that score, this is somewhat like the movie Anaconda (although Anaconda definitely had more fun stuff).When it comes to Deep Blue Sea, I guess I'll have to read thebook.
