For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.

I am pleased to state that it has lost none of its power.This is surely a classic suspense film. Actually it is one of the best suspense films of the 80s. The storyline is basic yet gripping in the extreme. Even if the mechanisms of the plot bear some usual cliches (the fragile heroine suddenly becomes a tough survivor; she has to seduce and sleep with the bad guy to divert his attention; the hero leaves the heroine alone with a total stranger in the middle of nowhere without even thinking of the possible consequences; the psychopathic bad guy rises once again for a final messy ending and so on) the film has such a unique set-up and atmosphere that it becomes easy to forgive its weaknesses. It is interesting to note that dialogue is actually sparse which consequently necessitates some style for the film to become effective. Director Philip Noyce certainly succeeded in this task. He was clearly very ambitious while making this and he injected everything he could in terms of style. His efforts were amply rewarded since he continued with a highly prolific Hollywood career. However none of his later films had much distinction (including the much overrated Tom Clancy adaptations) and Dead Calm is still his best film do date. The sea, the sky, the two boats and the isolation resulting from being on the wide open sea are eerily combined and as a result the viewer is completely drawn into the story. Working on sea is always a hard thing as demonstrated with widely reported on-set troubles of recent water-pics such as Waterworld, Cutthroat Island and Deep Blue Sea; however, the makers of this film manage to make it look all so easy. The changes in the sea and weather conditions are so smoothly integrated into the film that most of the time you forget this was filmed and feel as if this really took place and those people are alone by themselves at sea.The three leads, all major stars nowadays, are fine and interesting to watch. When I first saw it, I was aware that Nicole Kidman was a rising star in her home country and that this became her international breakthrough. She had striked me with her otherworldly beauty as well as her acting ability. Watching her tonight, I once again admired her determination which made her a big star in her own right despite the always looming presence of her fantastically famous husband. Her ability to attain important roles in major movies was most of the time attributed to her spouse's links and the couple's spiritual affiliations. While some of this may be true, it is also very clear that she is a very talented actress (just remember To Die For) and one of the few noble-looking stars around, in the best tradition of legends such as Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn. She is always a delight to watch and has academical training to boot. It is no surprise that 12 years after the making of Dead Calm, she is on the Hollywood A-list.Sam Neill was more famous than his co-stars during that time following his starring roles in many British television series in early Eighties. He has become a household name now in many different genres, be it a big-budget extravaganza such as Jurassic Park or an arthouse period picture such as The Piano and the conviction he brings to his scenes alone on the sinking boat and his performance during the calculated survival tactics makes you realize the reason why. Billy Zane was an immediate center of attention in this film due to his extremely good looks and it is nice to see that he has not followed the usual Hollywood path of becoming the bland leading man in the intervening years. He made different acting choices instead and alternated supporting roles in big films-see Titanic- with more indie-oriented low budget pictures. He even made a credible comic hero in the much-maligned The Phantom. However it is apparent that being a bad guy suits him more, considering his performances here and in Titanic.On the more technical side, the cinematography is simply a joy to watch; production design, which here naturally consists mainly of the design of the ship is effective and makes good use of the limited space indoors and outdoors; sound design is simple albeit effective in reflecting the natural sounds of a ship sailing at sea. The opening car accident is very realistic and gives you the creeps. An honourable mention also goes to composer Graeme Revell whose first big assignment this film was. His pulsating and breathing score makes the viewer literally breathless and in the later scenes the use of a solo soprano voice brings a definitely haunting quality to the proceedings. A sparkling Hollywood career was in the waiting and he created memorable music for many distinguished Hollywood films, mainly in the action-suspense-fantasy genres.And finally, a real surprise the dog dies.Overall rating 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  WARNING-POSSIBLE SPOILERSTonight I had the opportunity to watch Dead Calm once again after more than a decade.

As the years have gone by, I have just about completely forgotten about the film and the Talking Heads.    Fast forward to 1999 I heard it was being released on DVD, and immediately rented a copy as soon as it was released.   I'm awfully glad I did.This film can be best described in one word fun!   This is the first movie I watched that made me want to get up and dance with the music!   I had all but forgotten many of the very danceable tunes that the Heads had performed in the past, and here are many of their best songs, delivered in a most straightforward and entertaining way.   On the cover of the `Stop Making Sense' DVD is a quote from Leonard Maltin `One of the greatest rock movies ever made.'   Leonard doesn't quite have it right; this IS the greatest rock movie ever made!The very first scene we see a pair of white gym shoes walking out on stage. We hear David Byrne tell the audience that he has a tape he'd like to play, and a boom box is plopped down on stage, then David pushes `play.'   A hypnotic drum beat starts thumping its rhythm, the camera pans up, and there's David- alone, on a bare stage (and I do mean BARE) with a microphone, a boom box and his acoustic guitar.   Hardly the opening one expects for an awesome rock concert!   David then performs, sans musicians, the classic `Psycho Killer' using nothing more than his guitar, his drum machine rhythm, and his incredible audacity!But the fun is only beginning.   As David sings, the roadies and stagehands are setting up for the next number, on stage at the very same time he's singing!   And so begins one of the most clever and effective openings of a rock concert in the history of music.   Each song adds a musician or two, a bit more stage, and before you know it, the whole band is standing before you, performing the jammin' nonsense song `Burning Down the House.'   It takes six numbers to get to this point; but, once again, the fun is only beginning!Although the music will make you dance, the stage antics of David Bryne will make you wonder which mental hospital he escaped from in order to do this concert!   Well, lets just say he certainly lives up to the title of this film.    And, of course, there's the classic `Big Suit' and the famous `lamp dance;' they're simple little things Byrne does to always keep the audience in a state of wonderment!David and the Heads manage to keep the excitement level increasing in a near exponential fashion until we reach my favorite Head's song `Take Me to the River.'   We are now on the verge of religious ecstasy, praising and worshipping a wonderful almighty God for the great honor of watching and listening to one of the most original and entertaining films ever made.David Byrne stages this concert in a fashion that is nothing short of brilliant.   Rather than having a stage cluttered with various amps, guitars, stands, etc.; David only allows the band to have the instruments that they absolutely need.    No extra equipment of any type is visible, and references to manufactures are neatly blacked-out from the drums and keyboards in a very humble matte black.    The stage setup seems to be a tribute to a Mies Van Der Rhoe style of minimalism.Nor does he allow the usual colored lights and laser beams.  Rather the stage is lit with nothing more exciting than white stage lights!   But there's never been a band that has used so little to such great effect. Watch the movie to see many amazing lighting designs, all done with boring old white light.While this isn't exactly a forum for reviewing DVD's, let me just say that the DVD version of `Stop Making Sense' does this medium a great service! This is what the DVD format was meant for, and the use of the medium for `Stop Making Sense' will make DVD believers out of all who care to watch. I would even go so far as to say that a soundtrack of this film on CD would be a waste of money.The DVD features the entire film, plus THREE bonus songs not in the original theatrical release!    But that's not all!  You also get no less than THREE sound mixes to choose from Dolby Digital 5.1 Feature, Dolby Digital 5.1 Studio Remix, and Dolby 2.0 Stereo!   There's also a rather informative and entertaining audio commentary track featuring the four original band members and director Jonathan Demme.   Lot's of other little goodies are included as well, making this disk quite an entertainment bargain.I highly recommend this film to anyone.   Even my four year old son and two year old daughter love for me to play this DVD, just so they can dance to the music!   It is a much-loved part of our permanent film collection.

","genre":"Documentary, Music"},{"date":"5 June 2000","score":"","review":"  There might exist a movie that is more fun and more pure entertainment than the Talking Head's `Stop Making Sense,' but I've failed to find it.I wanted to see this film when it first came out in 1984, but for some odd reason, never got around to it.   As the years have gone by, I have just about completely forgotten about the film and the Talking Heads.    Fast forward to 1999 I heard it was being released on DVD, and immediately rented a copy as soon as it was released.   I'm awfully glad I did.This film can be best described in one word fun!   This is the first movie I watched that made me want to get up and dance with the music!   I had all but forgotten many of the very danceable tunes that the Heads had performed in the past, and here are many of their best songs, delivered in a most straightforward and entertaining way.   On the cover of the `Stop Making Sense' DVD is a quote from Leonard Maltin `One of the greatest rock movies ever made.'   Leonard doesn't quite have it right; this IS the greatest rock movie ever made!The very first scene we see a pair of white gym shoes walking out on stage. We hear David Byrne tell the audience that he has a tape he'd like to play, and a boom box is plopped down on stage, then David pushes `play.'   A hypnotic drum beat starts thumping its rhythm, the camera pans up, and there's David- alone, on a bare stage (and I do mean BARE) with a microphone, a boom box and his acoustic guitar.   Hardly the opening one expects for an awesome rock concert!   David then performs, sans musicians, the classic `Psycho Killer' using nothing more than his guitar, his drum machine rhythm, and his incredible audacity!But the fun is only beginning.   As David sings, the roadies and stagehands are setting up for the next number, on stage at the very same time he's singing!   And so begins one of the most clever and effective openings of a rock concert in the history of music.   Each song adds a musician or two, a bit more stage, and before you know it, the whole band is standing before you, performing the jammin' nonsense song `Burning Down the House.'   It takes six numbers to get to this point; but, once again, the fun is only beginning!Although the music will make you dance, the stage antics of David Bryne will make you wonder which mental hospital he escaped from in order to do this concert!   Well, lets just say he certainly lives up to the title of this film.    And, of course, there's the classic `Big Suit' and the famous `lamp dance;' they're simple little things Byrne does to always keep the audience in a state of wonderment!David and the Heads manage to keep the excitement level increasing in a near exponential fashion until we reach my favorite Head's song `Take Me to the River.'   We are now on the verge of religious ecstasy, praising and worshipping a wonderful almighty God for the great honor of watching and listening to one of the most original and entertaining films ever made.David Byrne stages this concert in a fashion that is nothing short of brilliant.   Rather than having a stage cluttered with various amps, guitars, stands, etc.; David only allows the band to have the instruments that they absolutely need.    No extra equipment of any type is visible, and references to manufactures are neatly blacked-out from the drums and keyboards in a very humble matte black.    The stage setup seems to be a tribute to a Mies Van Der Rhoe style of minimalism.Nor does he allow the usual colored lights and laser beams.  Rather the stage is lit with nothing more exciting than white stage lights!   But there's never been a band that has used so little to such great effect. Watch the movie to see many amazing lighting designs, all done with boring old white light.While this isn't exactly a forum for reviewing DVD's, let me just say that the DVD version of `Stop Making Sense' does this medium a great service! This is what the DVD format was meant for, and the use of the medium for `Stop Making Sense' will make DVD believers out of all who care to watch. I would even go so far as to say that a soundtrack of this film on CD would be a waste of money.The DVD features the entire film, plus THREE bonus songs not in the original theatrical release!    But that's not all!  You also get no less than THREE sound mixes to choose from Dolby Digital 5.1 Feature, Dolby Digital 5.1 Studio Remix, and Dolby 2.0 Stereo!   There's also a rather informative and entertaining audio commentary track featuring the four original band members and director Jonathan Demme.   Lot's of other little goodies are included as well, making this disk quite an entertainment bargain.I highly recommend this film to anyone.   Even my four year old son and two year old daughter love for me to play this DVD, just so they can dance to the music!   It is a much-loved part of our permanent film collection.

They are ponderous and poorly cast - impossible to connect to in any way that is human, and more than likely infested with one or more of Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, or Bernadette Peters.  Imagine my horror then, in discovering that there is a darker pit of culturally misguided artistry in the breast of that most American of directors Martin Brest.  With a pedigree of such resoundingly poor films as Beverly Hills Cop (a film so woeful at its heart that Sylvester Stallone turned it down), Midnight Run, & Scent of a Woman,  it is with an admittedly heavy heart that during my latest masochism-fest, I picked up his dream project - Meet Joe Black.A remake of a film that I've never heard of before, 1934's Death Takes a Holiday, Brest's film is a light romantic fantasy about Death manifesting itself as Brad Pitt to see what it's like to really live.  Judging by Pitt's performance, if Death really wanted to learn about life he probably should have chosen a better vehicle.  Death reveals himself to Anthony Hopkins who plays Bill Parish - a successful businessman and father of two grown daughters who, on his 65th birthday, will suffer a fatal heart attack. Before that happens, Death asks Bill to act as His guide to human experience.  Unpredictably, Brad Pitt's Death falls in love with Bill's youngest daughter, the very lovely but very grimace-y Claire Forlani, and finds Himself on the horns of a romantic dilemma.Not enough plot for a three-hour film, you say?  Fear not - Bill is being robbed of his corporation by a vermin go-getting, Tim-Roth-Lookalike and it's up to Death to save his legacy.  He does this, not ironically, by posing as an IRS agent.  Have I forgotten to mention that Pitt, at one point, imitates a Jamaican accent to better communicate with a dying old Jamaican woman?  Oh yes, Claire Forlani (nurse Grimace as I like to call her), is a doctor of internal medicine and Death follows her on her rounds (HA!).  Anyone that's seen Seven Years in Tibet recognizes the unadvisability of Pitt doing an accent.  It would have been a nice thing if Pitt had done an imitation of a human being to better communicate with the audience.Did I mention that this movie is actually 3 hours long?  To be fair, the film is nice to look at and, were any of the actors to actually speak in a normal cadence rather than their ponderous, measured, drippy-faucet, mumbling, it would only be 90 minutes.The film fails as a romantic drama.  It fails as a romantic comedy (although the sensitive love-making scene is unintentionally hilarious, as is the scene where Pitt gets hit by two cars).  It fails as a dark fantasy - and as a light fantasy.  It fails as a drama of any sort - or anything that approaches whimsy or wit.  Already faltering, the film grinds to a crashing halt when it attempts to handle a neurotic older sister and her competition for her father's attentions.  In three hours, one has a reasonable right to expect some sort of reward.  The ending, however, is a bizarre, hackneyed thing that is so poorly tacked on it resembles in spirit that paper tail of that beknighted donkey of children's party fame after the retarded cajun with the helmet has had his turn.There are so many questions that are raised by this sad monstrosity. Chief among them1. why is Death, omnipotent as he is, so clumsy around people?  Pitt plays him as some kind of Starman without the charming pathos (or the expected unfamiliarity of an alien with humanity). 2. why does Brad Pitt, so excellent in 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, & Seven, suck out loud in this film?  You feel like turning up the RPM's on the turntable. One wishes someone had told him the camera was on. 3. why is Anthony Hopkins in this film?  I haven't seen Instinct yet, but I'm pretty sure this will be a question raised by that film as well. 4. why doesn't the daughter of the elderly Jamaican woman wonder why this young white man is mocking their accent so outrageously and poorly? 5. why did this film cost $90 million dollars and six months to make? 6. why did I watch the entire film?There are more, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

I am confused by the way that he looks.  He is almost always a policeman or an ex-policeman, a soldier or an ex-soldier (green beret or commando or special forces or black ops whatever that is) - twice he was a research scientist, twice a bodyguard or something, twice an ordinary father, and once he was jungle boy that had a twisted little dwarf as his brother.  Twice, of course, he was a robot and that actually makes sense with how he looks, robots can look and sound as ridiculous as they want to (Robin Williams has now been a robot case closed), the same goes with the two times he was a pre-Christian barbarian.  But more often than not, Arnie is a human being that happens to move and look like a pre-kiln slab of river clay.  There is never an explanation as to why he sounds as he does nor of how he finds the three or four hours a day to work out.  Just once I'd like an explanation of how a boy raised in New York, third generation Irish cop, would sound like he just rolled down a mountainside after bugling through a giant horn.Thus we are introduced to Arnie in End of Days.  He is Jericho Cane (I guess Golgotha Christ was too much of a mouthful) - and he is sitting in his giant New York apartment, holding a gun to his head.  Again - how do these out of work losers afford the $5000.00\/month rent in these places?  First thought in my mind is that this was a pretty good introduction to a cop (or ex-cop in this case) the first time I saw it when it was called Lethal Weapon. Immediately, you know that his wife has been killed, his kid has been killed, or he's accidentally shot a child in the line of duty (both his wife and child were killed, incidentally).  Soon his pithy partner, the increasingly unwatchable Kevin Pollack, shows up, looks concerned at the gun on the coffee table, makes appropriately gaggy faces when Arnie slams a mixer concoction of chinese takeout and pepto bismol, and gamely does his best Tom Arnold impersonation for the remainder of the film.What's this movie about, though?  It's one of the many films that opened near the end of 1999 to capitalize on the sudden interest in the apocalypse shared by Hollywood and about 1000 cult members in Uganda.  It's about the return of Satan to New York city where he hopes to impregnate THE CHOSEN ONE by the stroke of midnight, Eastern standard time, and hasten the, ready? End of days.  It's about young Christine York (Christ-in-new York - get it? No, me neither), who is born with a sorority tattoo, baptised in rattlesnake blood, and raised by Udo Kier and another unattractive servant of Satan in an upscale Brownstone at Central Park West.  Really, though, the movie is about Arnold shooting 10,000 rounds into Satan and here's the punchline, actually slowing Him down.Satan is played by the terminally dull Gabriel Byrne.  Byrne is some sort of investment banker or something that is possessed by Satan three days before the turn of the century.  As Satan, he seems to have the ability to blow up tony New York cafes with a smoldering glance, to p**s gasoline, and to survive falls of ten stories and more.  He does not seem to be able to move faster than the comically lugubriously uncoordinated Arnold.  We assume that it's important that it be Byrne's investment banker sperm that finds its way into Christine York, thus lending some kind of explanation as to why Satan is so enamored with that particular body rather than jumping around from body to body like the demon in Fallen.  This doesn't seem to be the case, however, because, and I don't feel like I'm giving much away here, Satan jumps into Arnold when Gabriel Byrne's body's been trashed.  Arnold, I mean Satan (mercy, it's all so very confusing!), then proceeds to try to rape Christine York with only 9 seconds remaining in 1999.  While I'm sure that Arnold can rip one off in 9 seconds, what boggles the mind is that he tries to get a nice kiss first.  That's charmingly old fashioned, don't you think? Like swabbing Sean Penn's arm with alcohol in Dead Man Walking before injecting him with potassium sulfate.There's also the bit about a Vatican priest-turned-assassin named Thomas Aquinas that unsuccessfully tries to shoot Gabriel Byrne in the beginning of the film.  He apparently believes, as Charlton Heston believes, that the best way to combat a manifestation of evil is with a good gun at his side. What kills me is that no one seems to have a moment of frission with the name Thomas Aquinas.   I don't claim to be an expert in theology, but the name rings a bell.  It does not ring a bell with the cast (and nor does it ring the bells of the myriad fans of this film, I venture).Who's the guy in the hospital? Thomas AquinasThat's a bizarre conversation.  I kept waiting to hear this oneWho's the guy in the hospital? John the BaptistIt's appropriate in both instances that someone take note of strangeness. Taking note of strangeness is a very important function in film.  If the film doesn't know that it sucks, there are certain irritating people in the audience (like myself) that will.  And it does.  Suck, I mean.End of Days is that most unforgivable of films.  It is the kind of film that urges us to leave our brains at the door and hold on for the ride - to remember when we were eight years old again.  In other words, it asks us to be mentally challenged, emotionally immature, and so beaten by the onward marching tide of culture that we are wholly incapable of not liking something that cost 100 million dollars.  How Schwarzenegger remains a top box office draw is an uneasy combination of the vast foreign box office that think that Arnold somehow embodies the U.S. and (heck, he does) capitalism, and the gleaming hope for a third installment in the Terminator series. It certainly can't be for such triumphs as Jingle All the Way, Eraser, Batman & Robin, Junior and Last Action Hero.At its best, End of Days joyfully invites heckling and flabbergasted looks - at its worst, End of Days is almost as aggressively condesending as Phantom Menace.  Still and all, when excretia such as this earns its studio a tidy profit and truly wonderful films like Wonder Boys spends a quick two month run at the multi-plex, we deserve what we get.

","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"5 June 2000","score":"","review":" I've gotten to the point at which there are certain things that I would like to be explained to me with Arnold Schwarzenegger in his films.  I am confused by the way that he looks.  He is almost always a policeman or an ex-policeman, a soldier or an ex-soldier (green beret or commando or special forces or black ops whatever that is) - twice he was a research scientist, twice a bodyguard or something, twice an ordinary father, and once he was jungle boy that had a twisted little dwarf as his brother.  Twice, of course, he was a robot and that actually makes sense with how he looks, robots can look and sound as ridiculous as they want to (Robin Williams has now been a robot case closed), the same goes with the two times he was a pre-Christian barbarian.  But more often than not, Arnie is a human being that happens to move and look like a pre-kiln slab of river clay.  There is never an explanation as to why he sounds as he does nor of how he finds the three or four hours a day to work out.  Just once I'd like an explanation of how a boy raised in New York, third generation Irish cop, would sound like he just rolled down a mountainside after bugling through a giant horn.Thus we are introduced to Arnie in End of Days.  He is Jericho Cane (I guess Golgotha Christ was too much of a mouthful) - and he is sitting in his giant New York apartment, holding a gun to his head.  Again - how do these out of work losers afford the $5000.00\/month rent in these places?  First thought in my mind is that this was a pretty good introduction to a cop (or ex-cop in this case) the first time I saw it when it was called Lethal Weapon. Immediately, you know that his wife has been killed, his kid has been killed, or he's accidentally shot a child in the line of duty (both his wife and child were killed, incidentally).  Soon his pithy partner, the increasingly unwatchable Kevin Pollack, shows up, looks concerned at the gun on the coffee table, makes appropriately gaggy faces when Arnie slams a mixer concoction of chinese takeout and pepto bismol, and gamely does his best Tom Arnold impersonation for the remainder of the film.What's this movie about, though?  It's one of the many films that opened near the end of 1999 to capitalize on the sudden interest in the apocalypse shared by Hollywood and about 1000 cult members in Uganda.  It's about the return of Satan to New York city where he hopes to impregnate THE CHOSEN ONE by the stroke of midnight, Eastern standard time, and hasten the, ready? End of days.  It's about young Christine York (Christ-in-new York - get it? No, me neither), who is born with a sorority tattoo, baptised in rattlesnake blood, and raised by Udo Kier and another unattractive servant of Satan in an upscale Brownstone at Central Park West.  Really, though, the movie is about Arnold shooting 10,000 rounds into Satan and here's the punchline, actually slowing Him down.Satan is played by the terminally dull Gabriel Byrne.  Byrne is some sort of investment banker or something that is possessed by Satan three days before the turn of the century.  As Satan, he seems to have the ability to blow up tony New York cafes with a smoldering glance, to p**s gasoline, and to survive falls of ten stories and more.  He does not seem to be able to move faster than the comically lugubriously uncoordinated Arnold.  We assume that it's important that it be Byrne's investment banker sperm that finds its way into Christine York, thus lending some kind of explanation as to why Satan is so enamored with that particular body rather than jumping around from body to body like the demon in Fallen.  This doesn't seem to be the case, however, because, and I don't feel like I'm giving much away here, Satan jumps into Arnold when Gabriel Byrne's body's been trashed.  Arnold, I mean Satan (mercy, it's all so very confusing!), then proceeds to try to rape Christine York with only 9 seconds remaining in 1999.  While I'm sure that Arnold can rip one off in 9 seconds, what boggles the mind is that he tries to get a nice kiss first.  That's charmingly old fashioned, don't you think? Like swabbing Sean Penn's arm with alcohol in Dead Man Walking before injecting him with potassium sulfate.There's also the bit about a Vatican priest-turned-assassin named Thomas Aquinas that unsuccessfully tries to shoot Gabriel Byrne in the beginning of the film.  He apparently believes, as Charlton Heston believes, that the best way to combat a manifestation of evil is with a good gun at his side. What kills me is that no one seems to have a moment of frission with the name Thomas Aquinas.   I don't claim to be an expert in theology, but the name rings a bell.  It does not ring a bell with the cast (and nor does it ring the bells of the myriad fans of this film, I venture).Who's the guy in the hospital? Thomas AquinasThat's a bizarre conversation.  I kept waiting to hear this oneWho's the guy in the hospital? John the BaptistIt's appropriate in both instances that someone take note of strangeness. Taking note of strangeness is a very important function in film.  If the film doesn't know that it sucks, there are certain irritating people in the audience (like myself) that will.  And it does.  Suck, I mean.End of Days is that most unforgivable of films.  It is the kind of film that urges us to leave our brains at the door and hold on for the ride - to remember when we were eight years old again.  In other words, it asks us to be mentally challenged, emotionally immature, and so beaten by the onward marching tide of culture that we are wholly incapable of not liking something that cost 100 million dollars.

Isn't that funny?  Hey look, there is Martin Lawrence wearing a different dress, isn't that still funny?  That seems to be the continuing running gag in the new film staring Martin Lawrence titled, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE.  A film that tries to pull off the same male dressed as female jokes that we've seen before in TOOTSIE, SOME LIKE IT HOT, and MRS. DOUBTFIRE.      Lawrence plays Malcolm Turner, a federal agent who is after a escaped convict, Lester (Terrence Howard), who is looking for his ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) who might or might not have the $2 million dollars that he stole during a robbery.  Before you can say, STAKEOUT, Malcolm and his partner John (Paul Giamatti), travel to Georgia to watch over the house that belongs to one Big Momma (Ella Mitchell), hoping that Sherry will show up to see her big grandmother.  When Big Momma makes a unexpected departure, Malcolm decides to play Big Momma so he can help capture Lester.      The plot to this film is as routine as Lawrence's last film, BLUE STREAK.  And like BLUE STREAK, it also has another element missing, humor.  The jokes in this film are so predictable and lame.  And to get the 12 year olds in the theater laughing, they also include some more left over potty jokes from READY TO RUMBLE, which were just as stupid in that film.  And to get the audience groaning, they have a shot showing Big Momma's behind.  Why they did that, I still don't know?      Lawrence use to be funny on his t.v. show and in the movie BAD BOYS.  Here, he's just playing the same role, Martin Lawrence, just this time he's dressed up as a woman.  When Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy dress up as women, they at least add some personality to their disguises, and make their fictional character seem real.  With Lawrence, it's just good ol' Martin wearing a wig and dress.  And character actor Paul Giamatti is wasted playing the bumbling partner of Lawrence. Giamatti has been in some excellent films like PRIVATE PARTS, NEGOTATITOR, and MAN ON THE MOON, among many others.  Why is he in this film, I still do not know.  And Nia Long is also wasted playing the girl who notices the little differences in big momma, but just shrugges them off.      What's bad about this movie, everything.  There are no jokes, ripped off plot, stereo typed characters and stereo typed situations that the average movie audience has seen a dozen times already.  I guess the people who never seen classic drag films like SOME LIKE IT HOT and TOOTSIE, would enjoy this. But for those who love and enjoy those films, will pity the filmmakers of this film.  There is one good thing I can say about BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, it will keep BATTLEFIELD EARTH company for one of the worst movies of the summer.  * (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2000","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"      Hey look people, Martin Lawrence is wearing a dress!

A film that tries to pull off the same male dressed as female jokes that we've seen before in TOOTSIE, SOME LIKE IT HOT, and MRS. DOUBTFIRE.      Lawrence plays Malcolm Turner, a federal agent who is after a escaped convict, Lester (Terrence Howard), who is looking for his ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) who might or might not have the $2 million dollars that he stole during a robbery.  Before you can say, STAKEOUT, Malcolm and his partner John (Paul Giamatti), travel to Georgia to watch over the house that belongs to one Big Momma (Ella Mitchell), hoping that Sherry will show up to see her big grandmother.  When Big Momma makes a unexpected departure, Malcolm decides to play Big Momma so he can help capture Lester.      The plot to this film is as routine as Lawrence's last film, BLUE STREAK.  And like BLUE STREAK, it also has another element missing, humor.  The jokes in this film are so predictable and lame.  And to get the 12 year olds in the theater laughing, they also include some more left over potty jokes from READY TO RUMBLE, which were just as stupid in that film.  And to get the audience groaning, they have a shot showing Big Momma's behind.  Why they did that, I still don't know?      Lawrence use to be funny on his t.v. show and in the movie BAD BOYS.  Here, he's just playing the same role, Martin Lawrence, just this time he's dressed up as a woman.  When Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy dress up as women, they at least add some personality to their disguises, and make their fictional character seem real.  With Lawrence, it's just good ol' Martin wearing a wig and dress.  And character actor Paul Giamatti is wasted playing the bumbling partner of Lawrence. Giamatti has been in some excellent films like PRIVATE PARTS, NEGOTATITOR, and MAN ON THE MOON, among many others.  Why is he in this film, I still do not know.  And Nia Long is also wasted playing the girl who notices the little differences in big momma, but just shrugges them off.      What's bad about this movie, everything.  There are no jokes, ripped off plot, stereo typed characters and stereo typed situations that the average movie audience has seen a dozen times already.  I guess the people who never seen classic drag films like SOME LIKE IT HOT and TOOTSIE, would enjoy this. But for those who love and enjoy those films, will pity the filmmakers of this film.  There is one good thing I can say about BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, it will keep BATTLEFIELD EARTH company for one of the worst movies of the summer.  * (out of five) ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"5 June 2000","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"      Hey look people, Martin Lawrence is wearing a dress!

A couple of hard boiled stories, are waved together by only such perfection as Tarantino.Now, I'm not going to say that Big Q is my favorite director, but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. Just look at the script! And, just as in his other masterpiece RESERVOIR DOGS, the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. As a director, well, he's good but not that very original, with some exceptions like the PULP-dancesceen and the ending in DOGS. His real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. It is genius!!!PULP FICTION is my second favorite after STAR WARS (I'm not sure why I love that film, but hey, sue me) and it can't be compared to the rest of my top-movies, nor Tarantino's others. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a big flat joke to this, also NATURAL BORN KILLERS (Tarantino's story) and probably TRUE ROMANCE too. JACKIE BROWN is a good film, but it's one million floors down from this movie. The nearest so far is RESERVOIR DOGS. The direction of DOGS was better than PULP, but PULP FICTION has got this screenplay that no other (and I do mean NOT ONE) has got.Let's go on to... acting. Well, I'll put it like this A majority of the actors do their best roles ever, here is my PULP FICTION ACTING-GUIDE TRAVOLTA Definitely his best role so far. His portrait of VINCE is a classic. It's cool, funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.Wallace's house. And the dancing-scene is also notable. Here we see that Travolta's dancing king age is still not over.JACKSON It's a hard choice, but I'm pretty certain that this is his best performance I've seen. He's around everywhere, so it's tough but he tops. Still, it's easier concidering the fact that his performance is THE BEST IN THE MOVIE! The path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... THURMAN I have never been such a tremendous fan of Uma Thurman, but this time wer'e talking COOL CHICK. It is a shame that she's only in like 1\/5 of the movie. We should see more of her. KEITEL No, mr.Wolf isn't his best. I'm rooting for mr.White or the priest in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. I know, it's a crap movie but the role is good. ROTH Yeah, mr.Orange is better, but this one is on a good 2'nd place. RHAMES His best role! Without a doubt. MARCELLUS WALLACE wer'e talking respect here. I'M GONNA GET MEDEVIL ON YOUR ASS!!!!!! He is one tough bastard. His scene with Willis was great, and every other scene he was into in this great, great movie. ARQUETTE She isn't in this movie that much, but it is by far her best performance. STOLTZ Eric Stoltz is a great actor, and I think every part he ever played is the best, and I'm sorry that he's not in this one that much. WILLIS Bruce Willis might do his best performance, and the most quality-role but I have a very hard time if I'll ever try to forget JOHN McCLANE. This is his second best role.Well, let's not forget about ERIC ROBERTS and QUENTIN TARANTINO. Or should we? Yes, actually but let's try to focus on these two gentlemens too. Ok Roberts, everybody's hate victim and the biggest C-actor since DOLPH LUNDGREN.

The digital special effects were a disappointment. The biggest being when Russell Crowe went into the Coliseum in Rome for the first time. I was not impressed by the panning around the Coliseum. A good deal of it looked artificial to me. I could plainly pick out the digital stuff. When they were building the Coliseum and there was a shot going over the under construction building it was obviously digitized. In the movie there was a shot from high up towards the ground of the Coliseum and you saw all these small people and they seemed Sim City like. Any scene that had a flock of birds was disturbingly not realistic and poorly digitally created. I am sure that they could have done a much better job. I liked Russell Crowe in this film and just mused to myself what it would have been like if Dr. Wigand could have gone into a telephone booth and come out Gladiatorman and slaughtered all the CEO's of the tobacco companies at the senate hearings. It would have been neat to see right arms flying and heads rolling. The fight scene at the beginning of the film was truncated and did not seem to be as effective as it could have been. Check out Braveheart. The fight scenes in this film are excellent but Russell Crowe does not look like what I envision a Roman to look like. I think of Kirk Douglas. Russell Crowe has the looks of a bloke in an Aussie pub. One of the best performances in the film was given by Oliver Reed. I really feel this is one of his very best. Richard Harris also does fine work as Marcus Aurelius. I did not even recognize David Hemmings of Blow-Up fame. He obviously doesn't have the Dorian Gray portrait thing going on. The Emperor is a puff and I could not help thinking of the Monty Python film The Life of Brian where the Emperor says What do they find so amooosing?

The problem is that well done is not a phrase I would use with regard to Ever After.  I suppose it's an OK movie if you're a 13-year-old girl, but it is an insult to the intelligence of any adult viewer, male or female.The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for the wonderful performances of the radiant Drew Barrymore as Danielle (the Cinderella character) and the deliciously wicked Anjelica Huston as the stepmother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.  (Then again, I saw it on cable and didn't even pay the price of the rental.)  But these fine talents are wasted by an inane script with banal dialogue, characters who are both improbable and trite, and absolutely no sense of historical reality.I understand, of course, that this is not a historical film and is based on a fairy tale.  Yet the filmmakers chose to move it to a concrete setting in 16th Century France, and to introduce such real-life characters as King Francois I and Leonardo da Vinci.  If they do that, they should make at least a minimal effort to strive for some historical accuracy.  Yet the royal couple behaves more like modern upper-middle-class American parents; what we get here is a family with all the glamour of royalty and none of its class prejudices.  There's also a lot of confusion about the heroine's social status.  She is repeatedly described as a commoner, yet her name is Danielle de Barberac; the de is generally a signifier of nobility.  In fact, normally under the laws of that time, if the Baroness had married a commoner, she would have assumed her husband's status and become a commoner herself (and if Danielle was a commoner, so was her father).I don't mind Cinderella being reinvented as feisty, independent or educated.  However, when she is turned into an intellectual, a champion of social justice, AND an amateur athlete and swordwoman all wrapped into one ... well, that's a bit much.*** SPOILERS AHEAD***I can accept the scene where Danielle rescues Prince Henry from the gypsies by hoisting him on her back and walking off (after the gypsy leader promises that she can leave with anything she can carry).  In fact, I don't know if the filmmakers knew this but this scene resembles an allegedly true story from the Middle Ages when a city was under siege by an enemy force, and as part of the terms of surrender, the leader of the enemy forces promised to let all the women leave town, taking away anything they could carry.  The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand, the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.  She holds a rapier to his throat, forces him to hand over the key to the shackles he has put on her, and simply walks out of his castle free as a bird.  How ridiculous.  The moment the rapier wasn't at his throat anymore, he would have simply either run after her, tackled her and thrown her to the ground, or called his servants who would have grabbed her.  I guess it was so important to make sure that she wasn't rescued by the prince but rescued herself that reality could fall completely by the wayside.

The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand, the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.  She holds a rapier to his throat, forces him to hand over the key to the shackles he has put on her, and simply walks out of his castle free as a bird.  How ridiculous.  The moment the rapier wasn't at his throat anymore, he would have simply either run after her, tackled her and thrown her to the ground, or called his servants who would have grabbed her.  I guess it was so important to make sure that she wasn't rescued by the prince but rescued herself that reality could fall completely by the wayside.

No one seemed to understand the film and I guess this is because they have been spoon-fed too many Hollywood formula plots.  This is not. Eye of the Beholder is not about a man chasing a serial man-killer across the country for three years.  On its surface it appear similar to Backtrack, where Dennis Hopper, hired to track down Jody Foster to kill her, instead falls in love with her and protects her.  Here, one must question whether Joanna, played by Ashley Judd, even exists outside the mind's eye.  Ewan McGregor, the Eye, we know from the onset of the film is delusional, continually plagued by visions of a ten-year-old daughter taken from his life at such an early age, he can only guess which girl she is in a class photo.The film starts out with the Eye photographing a man in front of a Christmas tree, getting up to answer the door to find a young, faceless woman with long dark hair, to whom he says, Come on, baby, lunchtime. The man then immediately hoists her onto a table, drops his pants and begins to have sex with her.  All we can see is the man's rear and the woman's legs.  Just to the right, taped to the monitor where the Eye watches, is the photograph with the Eye's daughter, who, like the woman and like Joanna, also has long dark hair.  After the Eye sends the incriminating and embarrassing evidence to every computer in the man's office, the photo drops from its taped perch. As the Eye scans it, we see the reverse, on which is written, Guess which is your daughter, asshole.  Go f**k yourself.  The Eye then chooses the girl who will be his daughter in his upcoming delusions.  A video call from K.D. Lang immediately opens with, How's it hanging, detective . . . It makes me wonder what you did before computers . . . Anyway, it's all hush-hush.The Eye's next assignment leads him to Joanna, who looks remarkably like his daughter might in fifteen years.  We seem him suddenly pained as he watches her, in a pseudo sexual act, murder a man in apparent cold blood, the first of several such episodes.  Yet throughout it all, the Eye attempts to become Joanna's protector.  As he moves closer into her life, the illusions of his young daughter vanish.  If you don't take me with you, the girl threatens him, I'm never coming back.  But he leaves in favour of the adult version in Joanna.The Eye never appears to be sexually motivated.  What he does for three long years, he does as, in Joanna's later words, her guardian angel.  But it is a fallen angel, whose deeds are always flawed.Joanna's life can never be free.  As complex and intelligent as she seems, she is nevertheless plagued by the father, who left her on Christmas while she went to get some food.  The Eye, meanwhile, describes his own daughter as a girl who had no choice, but to wake up one day to find her father gone.In the end there is neither a rescue of flesh nor of souls.  The Eye is like the Flying Dutchman, doomed to forever wander the earth without salvation. Did the Eye molest his daughter?  Is that why his wife left?  Surely there is something symbolic about the man in the beginning near the Christmas tree and Joanna's father's Christmas departure.  And how puzzling that the Eye, who, with the aid of all the government's computers, can find Joanna's juvenile record from the genetics of one pubic hair, but cannot locate either his wife or his lost child.  And as he travels from city to city following Joanna, he collects snow globes, reminiscent of Heidi, whose gift of a one made her remember the Grandfather that most regarded as a monster.Listening to director\/writer Stephan Elliott on the DVD, I find that he, too, has missed the archetypal point.  I think, though, that most writers do, and that often the levels we search for in literature, come not from intent, but from the writer's subconscious mind.
