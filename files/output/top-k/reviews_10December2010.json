Jim Henson did all sorts of movies with the fun-loving Muppets, but this one was out of this world. Jim from time to time makes these really different movies, other than the Muppets, He did this movie & the Labyrinth & (even though it wasn't done by him but his studio) Mirrormask, but I think this one is my favorite. For a time, when I was younger, I couldn't see this film because it was rather scary, but I got it out again & I was like, whoa... this is really something. I mean seriously this film stands out among many of my other movies.The story is about an ancient crystal; long ago it was tampered by one of the Urskeks, a race of godly beings and by doing this the Urskeks was divided into the 2 sub races, the good Uhru & the evil Skekses. The Skekses took hold of the now dark crystal & used its powers to find immortality&#x85; a 1000 years later a problem was that they found out another race, the Gelfing were the source of their bane they would put an end to the Skekses power, so the skekses got rid of all the Gelfing only 2 made it out alive. One was taken in by the Uhru, he was named Jen & the other by the Pod people, she was named Kira. One fateful day when both the Uhru chief & the Skekses emperor were close to death Jen learned of his destiny to cure the dark crystal & restore the unbalanced world to peace, he starts his journey by looking for the Keeper of Secrets, Aughra. I think I'd better stop there before I tell the whole plot; I know the story sounds stereo-type, but don't overlook it its really cool.I love the world it's based in, its wonderfully different world with totally different landscape, it's sort of a prehistoric, neo-earthy sort of place; definitely not modern. The plants have an ancient under-water look about them; they are so bizarre but cool like a cross between plants & animal. The wild creatures are just as unique, like a bush-baby part mushroom, some very scary gigantic glowing-eyed beetles, an over- sized red-eyed toad or a rabbit combined with a catfish on stilts, really cool. The Characters are very memorable themselves, Jen is very pleasant, sensitive, and modest, I don't really know how to describe his character but he's very nice. Gelfings almost look human & yet they don't, they look shorter with long ears & long noses. Kira is also very pleasant but she's almost bolder, people who will like this movie will like Kira. The Uhru are these beings who almost look like an elderly herbivore-dinosaur part horse, none of them look young they are very ancient, their personality it celestial, meditative & almost monk-like. The Skekses are these prehistoric, reptilian vulture creatures, under their robes their bodies are disturbingly mangled & twisted just like their personalities & yet they are rather regal & pompous, one of the Skekses, Chamberlain, is very odd & sly. Aughra is quite a character she is quite sort of an impatient hermit, although she is almost womanly, a person on the DVD said she was so ugly she's beautiful.All the voice-acting was great, Stephen Garlick, Lisa Maxwell, Billie Whitelaw did very well. But the puppet-performing was done very good; they did have Jim Henson! So many things I wonder how they did on this movie. It's very creative & unique, but also very dark as well.

I'm not an avid fan of Whoopi, but this is one of her finest things I've ever seen of her. Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi) is great. The movie has a good cast to boot, Maggie Smith is probably the most promising actress in the world of Whoopi's divine charade.The story follows Doloris Van Cartier, the vivacious Las Vegas singer who finds herself down in dumps. Songtress Cartier must put up with ant- size audiences at the old Casinos of Vegas, while juggling affairs with her boyfriend (National Treasure's Harvey Keitel), who turns turns out to be a low-down no-good gangster when Doloris witnesses him having his men gun down this other dude. He doesn't like this witnessing, so he plans to have Doloris wasted. But she's already got the draft and is wisely on the run. The police (Bill Nunn, his last name is sheer coincidence) have her safe but not for long, so they hide in all places that remains pure from gangster hands--- need I say more? Yes, a Nun's convent. Once there, strict the reverend mother (played by the ingenious Dame Maggie Smith) insists that if she must hide, she must also adopted their sacred ways also. Now stripped of her flashy suits, Whoopi adorns a nun's habit and alias Sister Mary Clarence, so now she's thinking she isn't shown such divine mercy... or is she? She soon befriends a rag-tag group of religious sisters, Kathy Najimy as the extremely plucky Sister Mary Patrick, Wendy Makkena as the meek and wonderful Sister Mary Robert and Mary Wickes as the gruff Sister Mary Lazarus whom she teaches them and the choir to break beyond a reclusive barrier to a roof raising praise for God.The acting is pretty good. Whoopi role is very convincing and developed, a little goofy sometimes (but this is a comedy), but still very Whoopi- ish, her expression are so great; I can't believe she can sing, she's really good. The very pale Maggie Smith is of course great, but I felt this was very peculiar role for her, it almost unexpected, but her knife-like strictness as Mother Superior is very very good. One can tell she's determined to a practice nun's traditional lifestyle, you can see that she's absolutely thinks the monotonous repetitive old way will honor God, but when Whoopi's new way truly does. Air Bud is the only movie I'm familiar with Wendy Makkena, she's extremely shrewd yet very grand in here as Sister Roberts, her character is very captivating; her blossoming secretive personality is interesting to watch, but the writers of the film kind left me kinda disappointed in her outcome other than the fact that she turned out to be a rather angelic singer (though I heard that wasn't Makkena's real voice). Kathy Najimy almost steals the whole show, she's unrealistically bubbly and, dare I say adorable; she literally scene everyone's attention in all her scenes (p.s. if that is her voice... amazing). Mary Wickes is very gruff and almost at first unlikable, she also a little scary as a nun. Bill Nunn is very sweet in this movie, you kinda see a love interest between his character and Whoopi's.Every set, except the church, was little odd. The Casino was barely noticeable as the camera didn't do lot of pan and scanning (whatever that means). The Church's location was very odd and out-of-place, the tramps around it were too, but the 90's kids were very unneeded (I guess the location was needed for the nun's to improve it and the kids' role meant that Whoopi's new praise to God appealed to them). The Church's set was very grand and regal, a place of shiny wooden surfaces and all that grand stuff to make it sacred (it was probably a real church they used).The music is all instant classics, it has THAT touch to it. Whoopi's beginning numbers were fabulous, they were just so... so peachy and rhythmic! The Nuns' improved choir was literally heavenly the most being the Regina one, when Whoopi has the Nuns grooving. The entire soundtrack is really good, a collection of R&B\/Soul hits, Just a Touch of Love is quite hypnotic.One scene that very weird was when Bill Nunn punches this office double- agent, that scene kinda deviated from the main plot. The pope being involved in the story was little awkward, too. The film's climax is very good, I love how Keitel's goonies can't get the guts to rid of Whoopi, and she's comically calm and even forgiving to Keitel as if her old life was no longer important now that she's adopted nun-hood and he tediously bops her on the head, uneased by her behavior. Near the end there was a moment when Keital looked like he could turn the gun on Mother Superior- --heaven forbid! But good thing he didn't ;) The ending number is great but I think not as good as the Regina number, Whoopi is the greatest in that scene.Overall this movie is underrated, Whoopi probably needed to win an award for her performance! There is a little cussing, but other than that it's great. The plot is goofy, but is a lot of fun. The story both has greatness of R&B\/Soul and old traditional.

He doesn't like this witnessing, so he plans to have Doloris wasted. But she's already got the draft and is wisely on the run. The police (Bill Nunn, his last name is sheer coincidence) have her safe but not for long, so they hide in all places that remains pure from gangster hands--- need I say more? Yes, a Nun's convent. Once there, strict the reverend mother (played by the ingenious Dame Maggie Smith) insists that if she must hide, she must also adopted their sacred ways also. Now stripped of her flashy suits, Whoopi adorns a nun's habit and alias Sister Mary Clarence, so now she's thinking she isn't shown such divine mercy... or is she? She soon befriends a rag-tag group of religious sisters, Kathy Najimy as the extremely plucky Sister Mary Patrick, Wendy Makkena as the meek and wonderful Sister Mary Robert and Mary Wickes as the gruff Sister Mary Lazarus whom she teaches them and the choir to break beyond a reclusive barrier to a roof raising praise for God.The acting is pretty good. Whoopi role is very convincing and developed, a little goofy sometimes (but this is a comedy), but still very Whoopi- ish, her expression are so great; I can't believe she can sing, she's really good. The very pale Maggie Smith is of course great, but I felt this was very peculiar role for her, it almost unexpected, but her knife-like strictness as Mother Superior is very very good. One can tell she's determined to a practice nun's traditional lifestyle, you can see that she's absolutely thinks the monotonous repetitive old way will honor God, but when Whoopi's new way truly does. Air Bud is the only movie I'm familiar with Wendy Makkena, she's extremely shrewd yet very grand in here as Sister Roberts, her character is very captivating; her blossoming secretive personality is interesting to watch, but the writers of the film kind left me kinda disappointed in her outcome other than the fact that she turned out to be a rather angelic singer (though I heard that wasn't Makkena's real voice). Kathy Najimy almost steals the whole show, she's unrealistically bubbly and, dare I say adorable; she literally scene everyone's attention in all her scenes (p.s. if that is her voice... amazing). Mary Wickes is very gruff and almost at first unlikable, she also a little scary as a nun. Bill Nunn is very sweet in this movie, you kinda see a love interest between his character and Whoopi's.Every set, except the church, was little odd. The Casino was barely noticeable as the camera didn't do lot of pan and scanning (whatever that means). The Church's location was very odd and out-of-place, the tramps around it were too, but the 90's kids were very unneeded (I guess the location was needed for the nun's to improve it and the kids' role meant that Whoopi's new praise to God appealed to them). The Church's set was very grand and regal, a place of shiny wooden surfaces and all that grand stuff to make it sacred (it was probably a real church they used).The music is all instant classics, it has THAT touch to it. Whoopi's beginning numbers were fabulous, they were just so... so peachy and rhythmic! The Nuns' improved choir was literally heavenly the most being the Regina one, when Whoopi has the Nuns grooving. The entire soundtrack is really good, a collection of R&B\/Soul hits, Just a Touch of Love is quite hypnotic.One scene that very weird was when Bill Nunn punches this office double- agent, that scene kinda deviated from the main plot. The pope being involved in the story was little awkward, too. The film's climax is very good, I love how Keitel's goonies can't get the guts to rid of Whoopi, and she's comically calm and even forgiving to Keitel as if her old life was no longer important now that she's adopted nun-hood and he tediously bops her on the head, uneased by her behavior. Near the end there was a moment when Keital looked like he could turn the gun on Mother Superior- --heaven forbid! But good thing he didn't ;) The ending number is great but I think not as good as the Regina number, Whoopi is the greatest in that scene.Overall this movie is underrated, Whoopi probably needed to win an award for her performance! There is a little cussing, but other than that it's great. The plot is goofy, but is a lot of fun. The story both has greatness of R&B\/Soul and old traditional. If you like Whoopi see this movie, but if you like good movies in general see it!

One side is envious of the gifts God has bestowed upon humankind and basically wants to wipe out the human race, the other thinks be cool Mun, and just wants everyone to get along.In the first film there was an evil soul that could turn the tide of the angelic war if it fell in the wrong hands.In this film there is also something that might provide a great advantage to either side, in this case it is an unborn child, and this time as we are told early in the piece the war between angels has come to Earth.Thomas Daggett, the ex-priest turned cop from the first film has understandably lost the plot and is holed up in a monastery mumbling to himself nonsensically and scribbling down his visions. (He has also changed from Elias Koteas to some other actor.)This film revolves around a young woman named Valerie (Jennifer Beales), who looks very much like Valerie Madsen from the first film, only if she was a brunette and had longer hair. Anyway in this film Val is driving along minding her own business when she hits a guy. Now I won't say he was a pedestrian because he wasn't walking, he literally fell from the sky, being a film about angels we can guess where he has come from...His name is Danyael, and when a distraught Val takes him to the hospital he is friendly enough to mouth Don't be afraid as he is wheeled into the emergency room, despite the fact that he should be all types of f*cked up.Meanwhile Tommy Daggett continues to be crazy with all the visions.There is a cool Terminator scene where someone is seemingly born from beneath the Earth's surface, somewhere fiery and dare I say it hellish?Good old Gabriel is back baby!! (At least they had the sense to bring back the best character from the first film, although while filming this Christopher Walken must have missed out on another 4 or 5 crappy films that he would ordinarily have taken. The man seems to have no quality screening mechanism.)In the next 20 minutes of screen time Danyael makes a miraculous recovery, chats up Val and gets her four months pregnant in 2 days. Now that's potency!Gabriel also decides to visit Tommy for assistance and without expanding Thomas Daggett plays no further part in this, nor the 4 other sequels!It turns out that Valerie's unborn child will be the key figure in the angelic war, having been born of woman and angel known as a nephalim. In short Gabriel and Co want to remove it from the picture by any means necessary, and Danyael and Co swear to protect it.Despite the mounting evidence;- the recovered car crash victim, - the 4 months in 2 days pregnancy, - dead bodies with no eyes and organs, - a warning from both the mortician who says this has happened before, get away!, - and a chat with Thomas Daggett's priest who says much the same ... Valerie is still skeptical, until Gabriel shows up and tries to rip the unborn child from her, somewhat against her will I would guess. And the rest of the film is basically a keep-e-off game between Gabriel and Danyael, with Valerie and her belly-bun as the ball.There is ample opportunity for this film to veer into Highlander cheesy territory, but the reason that it does not is basically the fact that everyone plays it straight... except Walken's Gabriel.Gabriel hams it up in every Prophecy film he appears in, which is actually a good thing folks. Gabriel openly detests humans, he can sniff and taste them, but can't drive or use a computer. As with the first film he takes a recently deceased re-animated assistant to complete such menial tasks, in this film it is actually Izzy, a recent suicide pact victim who just wants things to be the way they were when she was dead. (I guess she got her wish recently!) Gabriel treats her with disdain, bullies her and orders her around, playing the bad guy card beautifully.Without Christopher Walken there would have been no Prophecy 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. I know he wasn't in the last couple, but this series would have died at 1 without his presence. (And I am not even a die-hard Walken fan like some.)This could have been Big guys in dark coats speaking formally while reading bible verses perched on a rooftop 2, but that probably didn't fit on the poster.Thankfully the filmmaker who took the reins from the original had sense to hold true to the tone, rely on the story rather than big stunts and hokey chase sequences, and kept things simple enough to not lose track. The music is similar to the original, which is a good thing, and they also use the effective (but annoying when a 3 year old is asleep in the next room ) technique of hushed dialogue and loud effects and action.I fully expected The Prophecy 2 to suck when I first watched it, and even recently when I dragged it out again I thought rewatching it would uncover hidden flaws and disappoint. It doesn't.Final Rating - 7.5 \/ 10. A case of second verse, much the same as the first, but a worthy sequel to a great film.

I liked it but it doesn't have the stuff to make it to my higher favoritism of movies. Frank Oz is imaginative, but I have to say that this film to me is not so Frank Oz, and movies that are adapted from books are quite impressive, but I can only say I was slightly impressed. For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot.This story follows Omri, an extremely childish youngster who, for his birthday, receives a MAGICAL (ooh!) cupboard. The Cupboard lacks its key so Omri's mother (actress Lindsay Crouse, never heard of her), gives him her collection of keys, and guess what&#x85;? He finds the certain key on his second try! That part always took me aback. He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man. The pair has many tedious adventures, some including an idiotic rat ball and a down-right scruffy cowboy who was a toy figure too. The cupboard MAGICALLY turns plastic (plaz-teck!) things into their real life counterparts, only smaller. The pair soon learns that every boy must become a man (a typical, yet true moral).Omri's character really is childish, yet endearing; his parents seem to pamper him, he's afraid of the dark, and he has lame 90's action figures; but he does mellow out in the end of the movie. I liked the acting, but it was no To Kill a Mocking Bird, even at moving parts. The Iroquois man was different from other Indian movies; he was a guru in a way. The music was just moderate and odd, though with one exception you'll know when you hear it.Be warned, my dear readers, this movie contains slight profanity (embarrassing really); simulative killing and some ladies do a loathsome dance on TV at one point (they call this a kid movie, how embarrassing. Let's hope Omri was sleeping at that adultish scene). And no the kid does not play God, its just a story, have fun.

The entrance into the film is so kindling and awakening, we get a majestic view of New York City and then it slowly pans in... at that point, I knew I was going to see a good movie!It's a like Disney version of Oliver Twist with an anthropomorphic mix. On the harsh municipal streets of New York we meet Oliver the kitten (voiced by Joey Lawrence), a very different star in Disney; Oliver soon finds himself on the streets in trouble and alone, but a much unexpected fellow comes to his aid, Dodger the street mongrel. Oliver soon meets the true parental guardian he always wished for, Penny.The characters in general are very fascinating. As I watch a film I can usually get in the movie, and Oliver is no exception. I almost feel like I have to be the surrogate big brother for Oliver, he's an irresistibly adorable orange kitten with those big captivating eyes and chuffy mouth, but has a great sense of dignity too, a kid who can survive the streets of an uncaring society (as we see when he first encounters Dodger). I really like Dodger for some reason, he has that strutting machismo of a rough skinned archetype, but we soon see that he harbors that soft- heart of a big brother for Oliver. Dodger's homeys are a very colorful team of dogs. Tito (Cheech Marin), he's a gag, with his Latino flare and peppy personality he almost gives the will-to-go-on to the other member when they are blue. Francis is the refined one, with a daunting appearance; you'll soon see that he is the gentlemen of the group. Einstein (Richard Mulligan) is the strongman with a heart of gold, but but his role is very small, however we see a hidden leadership within him. Rita (Sheryl Lee Ralph)&#x85; I really like her; she's like Tina Turner in dog form! She seems to a maternal figure to Oliver and has an underlying superiority over everyone, even Dodger. She's the character you wish to be explained, and yet there is no revelation of her mysterious past. Penny is very charming, and a very determined mind, but sometimes I find her a little bit annoying, but through her hardships I really begin to understand her, no one-on-one parental interaction, and very lonely spare time. Oh yes, then there's Georgette (the one and only Bette Midler), The pampered poodle blue-ribbon winning of Penny's household, Georgette is a definite screen-hogger; she is the most aberrant of all the Oliver characters and harbors no redeeming qualities throughout. She scheming and endearing at the same time. Fagin (Dom DeLuise) is the keeper of Dodger's gang, even though he's supposed to funny, I can't help but feel sorry for this guy. I guess he represents the vagabond archetype. Sykes is one sick Disney villain; he's very realistic. The Dockyard crime lord wants every under his control and can't stand mistakes, but bestows dubious mercy dripping with poison. Not only is a physical threat to be reckoned with, those Doberman can instantly sic you with the snap of his fingers. His defeat is very unusual for a Disney villain; it makes this light-hearted film dark and interesting.Like all Disney movies, the voice cast can be respectable or astounding, and for the case of Oliver, this is a rather cool voice cast. Lawrence portrayed a very innocent and even desperate soul for Oliver. Joel did one heck of a job for the macho Dodger, with a strange sly accent. Cheech is the fiery soul of Tito, invigoratingly raspy and even overwhelming. Bette Midler did an astounding job on Georgette's song debut, but I almost felt like Midler's others vocal parts were simmered down.George Scribner directs Oliver and he did a very good job and graces Disney wonderfully, but he made the film very simple, and if you single out this film out from Disney (where is joins wonderfully) and into the world of the great movies (anyone say Shaw-shank?) it can be awfully weak and childish. The film however flows at a great place, and the sad or thought provoking scenes are put together with emotion and conciseness.I love how the animation is incredibly urban and contemporary, conveying the flashiness and grittiness of downtown NY. It's like a moving children's book almost throughout (which is a delight). The character design is brimming with soul and life, every one of the animals like a specific human trapped in dog form, the humans are works of art, but sometimes over done. Some action scenes are not to precise, like when Oliver is climbing frantically over the hot dog man, it's very cartoony there as opposed to the rest of the film's child picture-book quality.I can't expect less from Disney to make original numbers. Not only are the songs jive-provoking, but the score is good too, conveying tenseness and emotion. I absolutely love Why Should I Worry (Dodger's debut song); it fleshes the freedom of the city and freedom of an individual (Dodger namely). Street of Gold is cool, the theme is the notion of survival, and the virtue of social smarts&#x97;Ruth Pointer is amazing! Perfect isn't Easy is just good old entertainment, Midler does an amazing job fleshing out that show-tune vanity song. Once Upon a Time in New York City by Huey Lewis&#x85; this is a beautiful song, it's like the essence of the film, the city is can be a harsh place and this is one story of one individual, an orphan and his acceptance into a strange and new society.It doesn't standout much, but I like it&#x85; a lot! It is a herald of those that would come; the transcendent Disney Renaissance of 1990's&#x85; and in a way deserves to be part of those majestic titles!

Francis is the refined one, with a daunting appearance; you'll soon see that he is the gentlemen of the group. Einstein (Richard Mulligan) is the strongman with a heart of gold, but but his role is very small, however we see a hidden leadership within him. Rita (Sheryl Lee Ralph)&#x85; I really like her; she's like Tina Turner in dog form! She seems to a maternal figure to Oliver and has an underlying superiority over everyone, even Dodger. She's the character you wish to be explained, and yet there is no revelation of her mysterious past. Penny is very charming, and a very determined mind, but sometimes I find her a little bit annoying, but through her hardships I really begin to understand her, no one-on-one parental interaction, and very lonely spare time. Oh yes, then there's Georgette (the one and only Bette Midler), The pampered poodle blue-ribbon winning of Penny's household, Georgette is a definite screen-hogger; she is the most aberrant of all the Oliver characters and harbors no redeeming qualities throughout. She scheming and endearing at the same time. Fagin (Dom DeLuise) is the keeper of Dodger's gang, even though he's supposed to funny, I can't help but feel sorry for this guy. I guess he represents the vagabond archetype. Sykes is one sick Disney villain; he's very realistic. The Dockyard crime lord wants every under his control and can't stand mistakes, but bestows dubious mercy dripping with poison. Not only is a physical threat to be reckoned with, those Doberman can instantly sic you with the snap of his fingers. His defeat is very unusual for a Disney villain; it makes this light-hearted film dark and interesting.Like all Disney movies, the voice cast can be respectable or astounding, and for the case of Oliver, this is a rather cool voice cast. Lawrence portrayed a very innocent and even desperate soul for Oliver. Joel did one heck of a job for the macho Dodger, with a strange sly accent. Cheech is the fiery soul of Tito, invigoratingly raspy and even overwhelming. Bette Midler did an astounding job on Georgette's song debut, but I almost felt like Midler's others vocal parts were simmered down.George Scribner directs Oliver and he did a very good job and graces Disney wonderfully, but he made the film very simple, and if you single out this film out from Disney (where is joins wonderfully) and into the world of the great movies (anyone say Shaw-shank?) it can be awfully weak and childish. The film however flows at a great place, and the sad or thought provoking scenes are put together with emotion and conciseness.I love how the animation is incredibly urban and contemporary, conveying the flashiness and grittiness of downtown NY. It's like a moving children's book almost throughout (which is a delight). The character design is brimming with soul and life, every one of the animals like a specific human trapped in dog form, the humans are works of art, but sometimes over done. Some action scenes are not to precise, like when Oliver is climbing frantically over the hot dog man, it's very cartoony there as opposed to the rest of the film's child picture-book quality.I can't expect less from Disney to make original numbers. Not only are the songs jive-provoking, but the score is good too, conveying tenseness and emotion. I absolutely love Why Should I Worry (Dodger's debut song); it fleshes the freedom of the city and freedom of an individual (Dodger namely). Street of Gold is cool, the theme is the notion of survival, and the virtue of social smarts&#x97;Ruth Pointer is amazing! Perfect isn't Easy is just good old entertainment, Midler does an amazing job fleshing out that show-tune vanity song. Once Upon a Time in New York City by Huey Lewis&#x85; this is a beautiful song, it's like the essence of the film, the city is can be a harsh place and this is one story of one individual, an orphan and his acceptance into a strange and new society.It doesn't standout much, but I like it&#x85; a lot!

The entrance into the film is so kindling and awakening, we get a majestic view of New York City and then it slowly pans in... at that point, I knew I was going to see a good movie!It's a like Disney version of Oliver Twist with an anthropomorphic mix. On the harsh municipal streets of New York we meet Oliver the kitten (voiced by Joey Lawrence), a very different star in Disney; Oliver soon finds himself on the streets in trouble and alone, but a much unexpected fellow comes to his aid, Dodger the street mongrel. Oliver soon meets the true parental guardian he always wished for, Penny.The characters in general are very fascinating. As I watch a film I can usually get in the movie, and Oliver is no exception. I almost feel like I have to be the surrogate big brother for Oliver, he's an irresistibly adorable orange kitten with those big captivating eyes and chuffy mouth, but has a great sense of dignity too, a kid who can survive the streets of an uncaring society (as we see when he first encounters Dodger). I really like Dodger for some reason, he has that strutting machismo of a rough skinned archetype, but we soon see that he harbors that soft- heart of a big brother for Oliver. Dodger's homeys are a very colorful team of dogs. Tito (Cheech Marin), he's a gag, with his Latino flare and peppy personality he almost gives the will-to-go-on to the other member when they are blue.

Almost from the start, we are warned of the terrible events to come in the form of the town crazy, Ralph, who ominously warns one of the characters that Camp Crystal Lake has a death curse. Thankfully for us, the kids don't let all of the scary talk affect them, and soon enough we begin to see the old killer get back in action--dispatching of the apple-faced youngsters in a variety of creative ways.This movie was widely renowned for its creative murder sequences back in 1980--something which every film after it tried to copy shamelessly. As a result, some of the more bizarre murders might seem tame in comparison to what we've seen in the ensuing 30 years after its release. However, this doesn't take away from their entertainment value.What really works for this movie is the setting, which is so simple yet so classic.

Little does he know the podunk joint is home to over 5,000 singing and talking cockroaches.Joe must now cope with the roaches irrational behavior, as well as trying to score big with a local, garden nut named Lily (Ward). But there isn't a huge market for women who dig jobless men who have a home infested with thousands of cockroaches last I checked. I could be wrong though.I have seen the original short that this film is based on, and I hate cockroaches. Though seeing cheesy beta versions of themselves somehow made me tolerate them for 80 minutes. Plus Jerry O'Connell's likable persona was something that flowed nicely throughout the film.Joe's Apartment crosses the line of disgusting and becomes utterly filled with gross out humor and repulsive scenery of Joe's apartment. But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment.

I could also have mentioned The Bad and the Beautiful, another film from 1952, as a third. Whereas Singin' in the Rain is a comedy, and Sunset Boulevard a tragedy, The Bad and the Beautiful is a melodrama.It tells the story of the rise and fall of Jonathan Shields, an autocratic film producer. The story is told in a series of flashbacks by three of Shields's former colleagues, director Fred Amiel, actress Georgia Lorrison and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow. All three were at one time not only colleagues of Shields but also his friends, and in the case of Georgia his lover. All three have now quarrelled with him, and in each case it was clearly Shields who was in the wrong. Yet although Amiel, Lorrison and Bartlow all consider that Shields has used and exploited them, their careers have not suffered as a result. All three are at the top of their professions, while it is Shields whose career is in the doldrums after his arrogant ways offended one person too many and his most recent film was a disaster.There has been a lot of speculation on this board about whether the various characters are based upon real individuals, and doubtless there was even more in 1952. Shields appears to be based upon David O. Selznick; his most successful film, The Proud Land is a Civil War epic reminiscent of Gone with the Wind. (His first success, however, was clearly based upon Val Lewton's Cat People). Georgia, whose father was also a Hollywood star, may be based upon Diana Barrymore, who was the daughter of John Barrymore and who, like Georgia in the film, suffered from drug and alcohol addiction. (Judy Garland, the ex-wife of the film's director Vincente Minnelli, has also been suggested as a model). The Latin-American actor Victor Ribera, played by Gilbert Roland, is reminiscent of a number of Latin lover stars, such as Fernando Lamas or even Roland himself. The British director Henry Whitfield may be modelled on Alfred Hitchcock, who clashed with Selznick just as Whitfield clashes with Shields. The German Von Ellstein is probably a composite of a number of German directors, such as Fritz Lang and Erich von Stroheim.The role of Shields brought Kirk Douglas the second of his three unsuccessful Best Actor nominations. (The others were for Champion and Lust for Life). Douglas is certainly on top form here as the ambitious, vain and ruthless Shields, a man who may be a success as a film-maker but is an utter failure as a human being. Nevertheless, I think that the Academy were right to give the award to Gary Cooper for High Noon, a performance that few actors could have bettered. Gloria Grahame, however, won for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, something that rather surprises me. Grahame plays Bartlow's dizzy blonde Southern Belle wife Rosemary, and, although it was interesting to see her in a role quite different from her normal femme fatale parts, this is not really her best film. (She was, for example, to be much better in The Big Heat the following year). I felt that the award should have gone to Jean Hagen for her brilliant comedic performance in Singin' in the Rain. Lana Turner as Georgia was also not at her best, being too histrionic for my taste.I would not rate The Bad and the Beautiful quite as highly as either Sunset Boulevard or Singin' in the Rain, but it is one of those films which, although nearly sixty years old, still remains highly watchable even today, both as a vivid picture of Hollywood in its Golden Age and as a psychological portrait of a megalomaniac tycoon reminiscent of Orson Welles's Charles Foster Kane. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 December 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When I recently reviewed Singin' in the Rain I mentioned that film and Sunset Boulevard as two great films from the early fifties about the film industry itself.

This scene marks his transformation into a WiseGuy, one among the Goodfellas. How he grew up surrounded by the mafia and worked and lived off them for 3 decades forms the basis of this film.Based on the book Wise Guy by reporter Nicholas Pileggi (to whom the real Henry Hill reportedly gave his true-life account), whose also penned the screenplay with Director Scorsese, the 146 min movie successfully packs 3 decades of mafia life without compromising on the pace or the details, thanks to the brilliant direction of Martin Scorsese and the editing(Thelma Schoonmaker).The beauty of this movie was it was full of violence, murder, theft, smuggling, substance abuse, adultery, profanity and other unsocial acts, all of which were spoken of very casually in the same breath with no feeling of remorse or guilt. It delved deep into the subject of the power of Mafia but it never advocated their use or glorified it. Neither was it a typical moral bedtime story that are narrated to children. This is effectively expressed by the gradual change in the character of Hill's wife, Karen Hill(Lorraine Bracco) through her narration. She initially feels as uncomfortable as any outsider would feel with the movie's theme but slowly gets absorbed just as the viewer into the mafia lives and in certain places, even makes you feel a certain sympathy for the lead character and other people but leaves a stranger taste when you realise that all their sufferings are well deserved.

Bunks school, works with them and eventually grows up to be one of them. This boy narrating his story is half Irish, half Italian, New York based mobster, Henry Hill(Ray Liotta). He is lashed by his father but he complains to the mob bosses who help him out. His mother looks at him in a suit and shrieks You look like a gangster! This scene marks his transformation into a WiseGuy, one among the Goodfellas. How he grew up surrounded by the mafia and worked and lived off them for 3 decades forms the basis of this film.Based on the book Wise Guy by reporter Nicholas Pileggi (to whom the real Henry Hill reportedly gave his true-life account), whose also penned the screenplay with Director Scorsese, the 146 min movie successfully packs 3 decades of mafia life without compromising on the pace or the details, thanks to the brilliant direction of Martin Scorsese and the editing(Thelma Schoonmaker).The beauty of this movie was it was full of violence, murder, theft, smuggling, substance abuse, adultery, profanity and other unsocial acts, all of which were spoken of very casually in the same breath with no feeling of remorse or guilt. It delved deep into the subject of the power of Mafia but it never advocated their use or glorified it. Neither was it a typical moral bedtime story that are narrated to children. This is effectively expressed by the gradual change in the character of Hill's wife, Karen Hill(Lorraine Bracco) through her narration. She initially feels as uncomfortable as any outsider would feel with the movie's theme but slowly gets absorbed just as the viewer into the mafia lives and in certain places, even makes you feel a certain sympathy for the lead character and other people but leaves a stranger taste when you realise that all their sufferings are well deserved. They are casual with their criminal acts but deep down, they know they are wrong. And as Roger Ebert said, they know they are guilty, not because they did wrong but know that they want to do the wrong again.The music & tempo(Rags to Riches, Pretend you don't see her and so on) seem hand picked for the occasions, perfectly echoing the mood of the scenes. In addition to this, the screenplay of some scenes(which I heard was mostly improvised by the actors, spot on) stand out for their sense of sheer brutal-ism while some for their humour while some others explaining a subtle point or thought or a transition in character.The acting cast comprising of Robert DeNiro(Jim Conway), Joe Pesci(Tommy DeVito), Paulie Cicero(Paul Sorvino), Ray Liotta(Henry Hill), Lorraine Bracco(Karen Hill) ...the list goes on....put an earnest performance.

The problem I personally had with this film is the murky and dark moments where we can not see any of the violence or action, such as the awful strobe lights subway massacre as the Predator causes mayhem and death towards civilians and punks on board(or the meat packing factory towards the end when Busey and his para-military men seek to freeze the Predator with liquid nitrogen, as to seize and study it). Bill Paxton has a really obnoxious cop character quite similar to dorky roles like in WEIRD SCIENCE before stepping to the plate for more complex dramatic roles as he matured as an actor. Robert Davi is wasted in a minor part as Glover's superior, warning him to tone down his John Wayne routine. Ruben Blades and Maria Conchita Alonzo have supporting parts as members of Glover's team, soon, like Paxton, coming in contact with the Predator. The trophy room(which houses the memorable skull of an alien xenomorph) and cauterized wound sequence(where the Predator has to repair a wound due to Glover severing its arm which contained the auto destruct device) are two of my favorite moments in the film. Hopkins has some very impressive virtuoso camera movements such as when Glover is on a ledge as the Predator holds on to his arm or following a chase from the street to the tops of buildings, eventually leading into an elevator shaft, finally ending with the duel between cop and alien inside the creature's ship.

Officially it is an international co-production, but it was not only made by a British director, Terence Davies, but also shot on location in Britain, even though most of the action is supposed to take place in and around New York. (As a keen birdwatcher I have to say that I could tell that it had been shot on this side of the Atlantic from some of the typically European birdsong in the background). It is, in fact, a good example of the sort of costume drama at which the British film industry has traditionally excelled, although there have been some notable American examples such as Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, also based upon a novel by Edith Wharton.The action takes place in 1905. At the opening of the film its heroine, the socialite Lily Bart, appears to be living a charmed life. She is young, beautiful and the niece of the wealthy Mrs Julia Peniston. Yet her position is more precarious than she realises and the film traces her downfall from wealth into poverty and from respectability into social disgrace. The title is deeply ironic; this is a tragedy, not a comedy, and there is nothing about Lily's position that might arouse mirth. Wharton took her title from the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.The implication of this title is that those who live merely for mirth or pleasure are foolish, and certainly Lily's downfall is partly the result of her own folly; she incurs, for example, large gambling debts which she is unable to meet. Yet it is also partly the result of the hypocrisy of American high society in the early years of the twentieth century. Although some Americans tried to pretend that theirs was a classless society, the ultra-rich of New York could be just as ruthlessly snobbish as their counterparts in London, Paris or Berlin, and just as ruthlessly unforgiving of those who fell foul of society's unwritten rules. Lily's reputation is damaged not only by her gambling habit, which alienates her puritanically religious aunt, but also by an untrue allegation of an affair with a married man. (The allegation is made by the man's wife, who wants to distract attention from her own adultery). At times Lily's own good nature works against her; she has the opportunity to revenge herself on the woman who has unjustly accused her, but refuses to take it because to do so would also compromise Lawrence Selden, the man she loves.The star of the film is Gillian Anderson, which surprised me when I first saw it in the cinema as I had previously only though of her as that bird from the X-Files or the girl who, a few years earlier, had been voted Most Beautiful Woman in the World by the readers of FHM magazine. (This aroused some ungallant comments from members of the anti-redhead brigade, who opined that Gillian had only won the title because readers had confused her with her namesake Pamela). The House of Mirth, however, proved two things. Firstly, it proved that Gillian was a much more versatile actress than I had hitherto supposed. Secondly, it proved (to my satisfaction at least) that she was far more ravishingly beautiful than Pamela Anderson ever knew how to be. Her Lily Bart is one of the great tragic heroines of modern cinema; I was reminded of Nastassia Kinski's performance in Tess, another period drama about a beautiful young woman who struggles vainly to escape a cruel and inexorable fate.There are other good performances from Laura Linney as Lily's accuser, the spiteful Bertha Dorset, from Dan Aykroyd (an actor I more normally associate with comedy) as the financier Gus Trenor who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Lily, Jodhi May as Lily's quiet but scheming and hypocritical cousin Grace Stepney, who eventually inherits Mrs Penistone's fortune and Eric Stoltz as Selden.Like many British period dramas, the film is beautifully photographed and makes use of some sumptuous sets and costumes. My one criticism would be that, in the early scenes it moves too slowly, but the pace gradually quickens as Lily's tragic drama is played out to its climax; the ending is particularly moving.

The story is very manipulative, demands the viewer's full attention, constantly slithers around the characters, and boils until reaches its unexpected climax. The screenplay is structured as a complex puzzle and refuses to divulge any clues to its solution until the final piece is in place. The film is both challenging and rewarding. It plays with the audience's expectation until the very end when the viewer is finally rewarded by finding out about who Keyser Soze really is. The story is told via the narration and point of view of one of the suspects Verbal Kint (by Kevin Spacey) through flashbacks. The plot is about five cons, Kint, Keaton (by Gabriel Byrne), McManus (by Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (by Kevin Pollack), and Fenster (by Benicio Del Toro), that are trickily brought together to do a suicidal job for a mysterious figure, Keyser Soze, that will pay them $91 million. The central theme revolves around the mystical man, Soze, who is linked to the devil in the film. However, as the story prolongs, it is not clear whether he is a real person or just a legend. I watched the full screen version of the movie that delivers a sharp and beautifully defined image. The cinematography features drastic lighting and camera angles to create more or less tension for the scenes. Most of the scenes are played at night giving the film a dark sinister feel. Dark and bright lights accentuate on the drama and tension of the story, low-key lights give a dreary effect. The film features lots of bright white over the head shots. Tension is also created by extreme close-ups. The combination of lighting and camera shots create a shadowy underworld background. The low angle camera shots used to help the audience to understand the helplessness of the character. For example, in the opening scene a big part of the screen is covered by a man, whose identity remains a mystery until the very end, holding a gun on Keaton. Low camera angle accentuates on the height difference between the unknown man and Keaton, who is about to be killed. The low angle shots also emphasize on the importance and power of the unknown man in this scene. The audience only sees a portion of the mystery man and only from behind which adds to his secretive character. The cinematography also features an interesting interplay of colors, from the bright red shirt of Fenster to the dark color room scenes.The final scene, where everything comes together, is completely dependent on visuals and requires the viewer's full attention. The ending makes the audience want to see the movie again to explore the story-line for further understanding of the complicated labyrinth of the plot.The musical score driving the movie reinforces the story and instills even greater emotions in the audience. The score makes the climax of the film even more shocking. The tone of music creates a mysteries atmosphere. Slow songs represent sadness and faster beat represents action. Two other movies that I could link The Usual Suspects to are Reservoir Dogs and Identity. There are also a group of criminals brought together in Reservoir Dogs to do a job. Identity, just like The Usual Suspects, features lots of twists and turns with an unexpected ending. In conclusion, The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The multi-level plot structure assures that the viewer can find something new at each watch. The farther the movie goes, the more the audience realizes that not everything is what it seems. The plot circles around and keeps building and building before it hits the mark keeping the viewer pinned to their chair.

It's not a very conventional vampire movie but the fact that it doesn't have many clichés about vampires doesn't means that we are watching a movie about bloodsuckers. We don't see any crucifixes, garlic, mirrors, but instead, we get guns, slith throats, motorcycles, and the most sadistic and bad-ass vampires I've ever seen! Nosferatu, eat your heart out.Seriously, this is one of the most creative and atmospheric Horror movies ever made. We have a few decent vampire flicks in the genre. I won't mention Dracula because it's not the time. But I can clearly tell you that Near Dark is superior than The Lost Boys and maybe Fright Night (I write it with all the pain in my heart).The best about Near Dark is that you can't compare it with anything. I mean, it takes the vampire sub-plot into another level. We have a beyond the grave love story that it becomes a tale of an impossible love. It's not like ahh I will wait to become a vampire in order to make this work. That's BS! You know who I am referring to. ;) Like I wrote, even that we don't get clichés, in every single moment we know the villains are vampires even that the word vampire is never mentioned through the film.But the best feature about Near Dark is the extraordinary, almost artistic atmosphere. This is Terror inserted in art my friends. With a big budget, Katherine Bigelow designed a perfect film in terms of direction. The scenarios are desolating, scary, but at the same time dynamic and covered in mysticism. This woman realizes a great job. The budget is brought to it's maximum. The woman had an extraordinary artistic vision and knows perfectly how to put it into a Horror movie. There are just a few movies like this one.Each scene is extremely, perfectly crafted. To the last detail. The fact is that Bigelow doesn't mentions the golden rules of vampire cinema, she just takes the chance to do whatever she wants. And it's something amazing. We don't expect anything that happens. We get sadistic vampires that act like criminals and if we know how to stop them, it's just not predictable.It's also very remarkable the mix of Western with glam vampires. Yes, we're also into a Western movie. Caleb rides his horse, we get takes from the desert, the sun setting, etc. A not so common combination that works perfectly, believe me.All of the takes are dynamic, artistic, spectacular. One of my favorite scenes is when Caleb and Mae talk about the night. Pure poetry my friends. It makes me want to live something similar. The atmosphere makes you feel something special.The scene that will always stay in my mind is the bar massacre. It's violent, scary, brilliant, atmospheric, etc. It every moment it makes you grab your seat waiting for Severen to control his violent temper. It's one of the highlights of 80's Horror.The shooting\/raid in the motel also deserves a special mention. Spectacular and bloody! When a movie like this one generates different emotions in you, it means that we're in front of a perfectly created and crafted work.The plot is well delivered thanks to an intriguing continuity covered by a beautiful and disturbing cinematography and detailed Art Direction. The score from Tangerine Dream is simply surreal. It's one of the most impressing pieces of action, suspense, and 80's vibe. For some moments, the music fits perfectly with the almost nightmarish reality that the lead character lives.I rest my case with the intriguing song The Cowboy Rides Away, a delicious country song that figs into one of the most violent moments in the movie.Near Dark sets it's own rules. The acting is the most important aspect of the movie. Katherine Bigelow took support from actors from Aliens. The boss Lance Henriksen delivers an extremely bad-ass performance. His deep voice is amazing. I admire this man. He's perfect as the wise, violent, but clever Jesse. Bill Paxton steals the show as the sadistic-lunatic Severen, who in my opinion reminded me of Bill Moseley's Chop Top. Paxton delivers a memorable performance. He just gets your attention to the point that you will be looking at every single of his moves. Also, he adds the necessary black humor for a plot like this! Bill Paxton is used to be the secondary character that steals the show and this time he doesn't fails! Without a doubt, the duo Severen and Jesse is one of the most sadistic, cruel, and charismatic in the history of Horror.Janette Goldstein is perfect as Jesse's bitch. She's violent and adds the necessary amount of obligatory sensuality. The guy that plays Homer got into my nerves to the pint that I gave a standing ovation when he was killed. Was about time!.Adrian Pasdar is a great lead male. The man is attractive, good looking, has plenty of charisma, good actor, and best of all, he's believable. Jenny Wright is a total, major babe. I mean, you didn't understand. She's a total hottie that should be considered as marriage material. Delivers a decent performance although her character is the romantic support only. She's delicate, cute, and she expresses it very well.Gore is beautiful, extraordinary. We get slith throats, burned skin by sun (literally), wounds provoked by guns, brutal beatings, spilled blood everywhere, neck bitings, be-headings, etc. Brilliant exploitation of blood and gore!.The Cinematography is extraordinary. Makes you feel in love with the night. The highways, and more made me remember about passages in my life.I can't appreciate more Near Dark; one of the best vampire movies ever.

So, it's no surprise that the end result here is something very safe.Despite an ill-judged beginning that depicts the Whos as townsfolk overwhelmed by the commercialism and one-upmanship of Christmas, the movie soon falls into line with the central strand of the story when the grinch appears and plots to ruin Christmas day. In fact, everything steps up a gear when the grinch appears thanks to a fantastic, fun performance from Jim Carrey, almost unrecognisable under all of that make-up (mainly all green, as per the animated version that changed things from the original illustrations where the grinch was simply black and white with only a splotch of colour shading here and there).Carrey is the undeniable star of the show, and rightly so, but that doesn't mean we should have to settle for a cast of supporting characters who are quite so bland and irritating. Taylor Momsen plays Cindy Lou Who and is stuck with far too many moments of schmaltz, including her own musical number that's painful to endure. Jeffrey Tambor fares slightly better as the vain mayor and Christine Baranski is entertaining as Martha May Whovier, a lady who seems to protest too much that she has never been the slightest bit attracted to Mr Grinch. Clint Howard is here, as is Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon. They may not have as much to do but they're watchable enough with what they do have.

The mix of practical effects and CGI is superb and it's no surprise to learn that the movie apparently features the most characters in heavy make up since The Wizard Of Oz. The design and feel of the thing, even if based as much on the cartoon as the original work, feels very much Seussian (is that a word? it is now) and it's that singular quality, paired up with Carrey's superb performance that elevates this Christmas movie just above average. He also gets to redeem the soundtrack by singing You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch that was so memorable in the cartoon. Given a choice, however, I much prefer the cartoon version.

The design and feel of the thing, even if based as much on the cartoon as the original work, feels very much Seussian (is that a word? it is now) and it's that singular quality, paired up with Carrey's superb performance that elevates this Christmas movie just above average. He also gets to redeem the soundtrack by singing You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch that was so memorable in the cartoon. Given a choice, however, I much prefer the cartoon version.
