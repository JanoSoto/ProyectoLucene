This films beauty is in its soundtrack, imagery and dream like mind state. It will be hard for people who like a more formulatic approach to movies, but wonderful for people whose mindset is not rigidly stuck to the usual formulas for film.This film is utterly entertaining and fascinating, and is worth watching again and again for the effect it has on you. I watch this when I want to be taken away into an uncontrollable dream like state where I am thoroughly captivated by the films mood.For those of you who post the one star reviews (notice there is mainly 5 or 1 star reviews?) please go back to Titanic or something that will not challenge you too much. A true lesson in original film making.

This movie's captivating, a true fantasy classic with a romantic twist in it.  What I love about it too is that I can in many ways relate to our lovely heroine, Sarah.  She has lots of dreams which seem to be impossible to come true through the ordinary eye, but she knew that deep down in her heart, they could.  This is a wonderful movie, and I don't think I know one person in the world who didn't see or dislike this movie.  David Bowie was THE PERFECT rock star to play the Goblin King - other options were Sting (which wouldn't be a bad choice either), Mick Jagger (sorry, I can't picture it!), and Michael Jackson (what was Jim Henson thinking when he thought about putting Michael Jackson in this movie???).The movie set doesn't look like a movie set at all...it's very life like. I LOVE the style of the whole Labyrinth that surrounds Jareth's castle and the Goblin City.  I love the beautiful ball room where Sarah dances with Jareth - VERY VERY ROMANTIC!!! AHHHHHHH!Brian Froud is one of my favorite artists of all time, and I think that his work on illustrating the Goblins, the masquerade masks, and all the other strange and fascinating characters in this film was pure magic!  The movie itself is very magical itself!I say that this is THE best fantasy film of all time.  I miss Jim Henson very much.  Jim Henson is truly one of the greatest film makers of all time, and I still adore his work and his creativity.  His son, Brian Henson, is doing an excellent job keeping Jim's visions alive!!! o)Labyrinth is the bomb, and truly one of the greatest films every made!!! o) ","genre":null},{"date":"22 June 1999","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I fell in love with this movie the very first time I saw it, which was back then when I was about nine or ten years old.
