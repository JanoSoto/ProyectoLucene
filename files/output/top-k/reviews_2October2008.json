Ridley Scott revolutionised the genre forever by taking a horror film and staging it within a science-fictional setting. The result was one of the most suspenseful, frightening horror shows ever seen on a cinema screen. It would be seven years before 20th Century Fox greenlit a sequel to the 1979 classic.Considering the amount of time taken in the interim, that shows how badly 20th Century Fox wanted to get Aliens right, and avoid the trap of most sequels. Not to make it a rehash of the original. The director chosen to helm Aliens was James Cameron, just hot off the success of The Terminator. Filmed on a minute 7 million dollar budget, Cameron got an incredibly suspenseful action film out of it. His intense, muscular direction elevated The Terminator above B-movie territory and into classic status.But with Aliens, Cameron makes the leap to big budget film-making with complete confidence. It may be mounted more as a straight up action film, but its every bit as scary as Alien. In fact its that all too rare example of a superior sequel. One where it takes the original film, and uses it as a framework to build upon. It manages to find a whole new spin on events. As all good sequels should do.Where the original film only presented us with one alien, Cameron has broadened the horizons and given us a whole army of them. He's traded in the bio-mechanical world of the Nostromo for a more realist setting, a colony based on the same planet where they discovered the alien. And instead of a crew of blue-collar workers is a team of kick-ass Marines who get in way over their heads.Of course it wouldn't be an Alien picture without Ellen Ripley, and sure enough Sigourney Weaver returns, after a 57 year journey through space, to combat the alien that shattered her life. Sigourney Weaver has polished her act considerably in the time that's passed, and gives us a deeper, more emotionally fragile Ripley. One who has nightmares every single night about the Alien, and will stop at nothing to eradicate it from the galaxy forever.Most of the regulars who work with James Cameron are present too. The underrated Michael Biehn adds a steady anchor as Corporal Hicks, who forms a platonic relationship with Ripley. The always reliable Bill Paxton makes an early impression as the wisecracking Private Hudson. Lance Henrikson's emotionally detached style of acting is well suited to Bishop, the resident android. He brings some interesting ambiguities to Bishop. We're never really sure of him right up until the very end. And Jenette Goldstein is perfectly tough as Private Vasquez, one of the many resilient female characters Cameron likes to have in his films.One of the more interesting touches Cameron brings to Aliens is the whole inclusion of a mother\/daughter theme, between Ripley and Newt, the only survivor of the decimated colony. Only a little girl, Newt finds a kindred spirit in Ripley. Both sole survivors of the Alien, and both have been left emotionally shattered by it. The scenes between Sigourney Weaver and Carrie Henn are well written by Cameron (and given greater development in the Directors Cut), as each finds a new family in one another. And they're an interesting parallel with the Alien Queen, mothering and protecting her children.Of course Aliens' greatest success is in its action scenes. And they're just as ferocious and intense as you'd expect from James Cameron. But he uses them sparingly. Much like Ridley Scott, Cameron takes his time with the movie. He allows for a subtle buildup which generates some fine suspense, and then erupts like a powerhouse in the action scenes. The Alien attacks towards the end really gets the adrenaline pumping. Watching them break through doors, ceilings, and airshafts, they recapture something of the claustrophobia of Alien.But even better is a much quieter scene where Ripley and Newt are trapped in a sound-proofed room with two face-huggers. Its the one scene in the whole film where Cameron gets the terrible suspense of Alien down pat, and integrates it into his movie perfectly. He draws it out with such dexterity that you feel just as vulnerable as the characters.Cameron also takes the opportunity to answer a few of the questions left dangling by Alien. Like who lays the eggs? The Alien Queen is a masterful creation straight out of a nightmare. To describe her is an impossible task. But she's a product of some stupendous work from the late and great Stan Winston. She's one of his finest creations. Our first sight of her is one of SF cinema's most heart-stopping moments.James Cameron is not above reusing some of the same plot points of the first film. Again we get Ripley making a mad dash through a close to exploding reactor. But in this case, its to rescue Newt, and not a cat. And the added spin of the Alien Queen becomes a fresh twist on the same story. That in of itself would have been a great ending, only Cameron has more in store. The fight between Ripley and The Queen, in an exo-skeletal loader on the edge of an open airlock is a superb finale.Aliens is a magnificent sequel. Cameron does the original justice, by having so much respect for it. The Directors Cut is even better. Unlike Alien, the DC improves upon the film, and doesn't take anything away from it. It fleshes out the characters and ups the tension. Alien didn't need a DC. It was flawless to begin with, but Aliens The Directors Cut is a masterpiece.

In his attempts to use the wealth and power he has gained from those bloody triumphs, he tries to cleanse his family name, under the quietly desperate delusion that it is not an exercise in futility. For if it were not, there would be no opposition for his extensive criminal history to the landmark international real estate deal he works to seal. Nor would his old New York partners want in on the deal, an affair that tips the first domino in a succession of violence, betrayal, and scandal amongst the highest of statuses (stati?).Though there was great reluctance from Coppola to make a third installment, which was greenlit for the sake of understandably anticipated box office returns, it becomes an important part of the story of the Corleone family, even if it does not measure up to its two immortal predecessors. We see the modern effects of the conservation of the preceding generations. Michael suffers for his father's legacy, and Michael's stubbornness to preserve his own, though it has grown weather-beaten by the time during which the film takes place, has created a barrier of communication between himself and his wife and children, a classic senior having planned a much different future than he's received. Even Talia Shire's character, Connie, Michael's sister, is a completely different person in this movie than she was in the last. It is not a poor characterization but a very realistic one, as a woman from that generation who has resigned herself to the life into which she was born. There is no mention from her of Michael's order of her husband's death, for instance. She is not the meek, vulnerable soul she was before but astonishingly transformed into a highly competent adviser to her brother.However, even despite Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana being a cherry on top of the most beautiful musical theme in the history of film, the movie is inarguably the weakest of the three Godfather films. There is hardly a way of defending the idea that it surpasses or even equals its predecessors, which in the case of both had such a distinctly powerful touch not only at the helm but in the case of all departments. Here, the dialogue is weak with typical final-chapter-in-American-trilogy visibly scripted wisdom. I also have a hard time understanding why Andy Garcia, a Cuban, was cast as an Italian when so many hot-blooded young Italian actors could have played that role just as well as he did. Those are flaws some can accept and others have a difficult time accepting, and one cannot complain directly about Garcia's performance. (Besides, his father Sonny was played by James Caan and his grandfather by Marlon Brando, neither of whom are Italian.) The inextricable misnomer is one of the most well-known in contemporary cinema history, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary, Michael's daughter. I will not plunge into criticism because I know the poor girl suffered quite enough at the time, what with the Razzie awards, countless notices, and other such humiliating things. I am glad she was able to redeem herself by becoming a director like her father, a completely different style all her own, not plainly influenced by Francis, an unaffected subtlety as opposed to his inherent need to outdo himself, which brings me to another thought on this film's weakness.The Godfather Part III, now that I've rewatched it as a grown person and refreshed my memory and understanding of it, has supplied me with a theory as to the striking inconsistency in Coppola's filmography. In the 1970s, he made the first two Godfathers and Apocalypse Now, showered with giant personal, political, and artistic obstacles that in some cases almost literally destroyed him. The Conversation was made entirely from scratch. These films are his great works. After Apocalypse Now, the quality of his films took a major nosedive and even now, as he has recently returned to the director's chair with Youth Without Youth, he cannot seem to regain his aim. Godfather III is very telling. In comparison to the danger, conflicts and drama throughout the first two productions, Part III was a walk in the park. He had to fight for those films and that passion is what made them so incredible. Part III was handed to him, and because it was the other way around entirely, he had a hard time committing to the project, thus the film is clearly made with much less ardor and feeling, though the set design and atmosphere are still not one ounce short of top-notch. Coppola must run on frantic drama, frustration, violence and seemingly nothing else to make a great film.

Michael suffers for his father's legacy, and Michael's stubbornness to preserve his own, though it has grown weather-beaten by the time during which the film takes place, has created a barrier of communication between himself and his wife and children, a classic senior having planned a much different future than he's received. Even Talia Shire's character, Connie, Michael's sister, is a completely different person in this movie than she was in the last. It is not a poor characterization but a very realistic one, as a woman from that generation who has resigned herself to the life into which she was born. There is no mention from her of Michael's order of her husband's death, for instance. She is not the meek, vulnerable soul she was before but astonishingly transformed into a highly competent adviser to her brother.However, even despite Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana being a cherry on top of the most beautiful musical theme in the history of film, the movie is inarguably the weakest of the three Godfather films. There is hardly a way of defending the idea that it surpasses or even equals its predecessors, which in the case of both had such a distinctly powerful touch not only at the helm but in the case of all departments. Here, the dialogue is weak with typical final-chapter-in-American-trilogy visibly scripted wisdom. I also have a hard time understanding why Andy Garcia, a Cuban, was cast as an Italian when so many hot-blooded young Italian actors could have played that role just as well as he did. Those are flaws some can accept and others have a difficult time accepting, and one cannot complain directly about Garcia's performance. (Besides, his father Sonny was played by James Caan and his grandfather by Marlon Brando, neither of whom are Italian.) The inextricable misnomer is one of the most well-known in contemporary cinema history, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary, Michael's daughter. I will not plunge into criticism because I know the poor girl suffered quite enough at the time, what with the Razzie awards, countless notices, and other such humiliating things. I am glad she was able to redeem herself by becoming a director like her father, a completely different style all her own, not plainly influenced by Francis, an unaffected subtlety as opposed to his inherent need to outdo himself, which brings me to another thought on this film's weakness.The Godfather Part III, now that I've rewatched it as a grown person and refreshed my memory and understanding of it, has supplied me with a theory as to the striking inconsistency in Coppola's filmography. In the 1970s, he made the first two Godfathers and Apocalypse Now, showered with giant personal, political, and artistic obstacles that in some cases almost literally destroyed him. The Conversation was made entirely from scratch. These films are his great works. After Apocalypse Now, the quality of his films took a major nosedive and even now, as he has recently returned to the director's chair with Youth Without Youth, he cannot seem to regain his aim. Godfather III is very telling. In comparison to the danger, conflicts and drama throughout the first two productions, Part III was a walk in the park. He had to fight for those films and that passion is what made them so incredible. Part III was handed to him, and because it was the other way around entirely, he had a hard time committing to the project, thus the film is clearly made with much less ardor and feeling, though the set design and atmosphere are still not one ounce short of top-notch. Coppola must run on frantic drama, frustration, violence and seemingly nothing else to make a great film. However, considering the relatively peaceful circumstances of Part III's production, he succeeded to a good extent.

In this film, Miyazaki returns back to his anti-war and protect the nature themes that he already had in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Especially the mindlessness of the war is well shown in this film. Miyazaki has avoided the cliché situation that on the other side are good guys and on the other bad guys. Both sides have their reasons to get rid of the other one. Both are good guys because they protect their homes and communities, but both are also bad guys iron town wants to destroy the forest and the beasts want to kill humans.

From the epic opening score to the beautiful theme song, Hisaishi offers only the best.It should also be mentioned that Princess Mononoke has a surprisingly good English dub. I usually prefer original Japanese audios, often finding dubs either lacking or going over board. Only few times do I find dub to be as great as the original audio (anime series Fullmetal Alchemist is one of these cases). In Mononoke the English lines are written by Neil Gaiman, author of the books Stardust and Neverwhere. This might explain why Mononoke is the only case when I found the dub even better than the original audio. This has never happened before or later to me. Japanese audio is by no means bad, but talented dubbing cast (including Claire Danes, Minnie Driver and Billy Bob-Thornton) seem to bring just a little bit more life to it.Princess Mononoke is an awesome movie, both visually and as a story telling.

My first viewing led me to call it my favorite romantic comedy, for it was something different than I was used to seeing. It sparked an interest in Hope Davis, who has since become one of my favorite actresses (If you don't know her work, seriously check her out, she's great). So I bought the film about a year ago and haven't watched it since. Until this week, that is. And so comes my reevaluation..THE GOOD The thing I love most about Next Stop Wonderland is the fact that it's a romantic comedy that avoids most of the clichés the genre has been burdened with. The two main characters are far from unattractive, but it's no Kate Hudson\/Matthew McConaughey duo. The film doesn't capitalize on anything shiny or cheesy. These are real people in real situations. The two main characters are people stuck in ruts, waiting on their lives to change. And it's very true to life. Here we have a nurse whose boyfriend has just left her. Her mother tries to interfere in her life and get her back out there as far as dating. She doesn't want to and is pretty dismal throughout the majority of the film. Meanwhile, we have a serious man who volunteers at an aquarium while trying to afford schooling to become a marine biologist.Hope Davis absolutely shines in her role as Erin, the single woman who is too proud to admit that she's lonely. Another standout is Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, pre-Capote, in a small role as Erin's politically aware ex-boyfriend.THE BAD I try not to judge a film on it's predictability, but it's hard not to do so. As far as this is concerned, it's obvious what's going to happen from the third scene. Obviously the lonely woman and the hard working single guy are going to find each other and fall in love. I guess one could say that it's watching them get there that is important, which I kind of agree with, but it makes you really want to tune out and fast forward through all the meaninglessness and skip to the end.The ending is kind of a let down. Like I said, it's impossible to not see the outcome from the beginning, but the actual climax is pretty disappointing. You expect to see some kind of interaction and connection between the two future lovers, but there is none of that. There's one final scene with them together and it's truly not worth what they endured to get there.THE RESULT I guess the good outweighs the bad here. It's a simple concept and it mostly succeeds with what it's trying to do. Far from groundbreaking, but it is delightful entertainment and a suitable alternative to typical romantic comedies. There are some truly amusing moments here, but nothing really laugh out loud. Worth seeing for some good performances, some originality.7\/10, down from 8\/10.

My first viewing led me to call it my favorite romantic comedy, for it was something different than I was used to seeing. It sparked an interest in Hope Davis, who has since become one of my favorite actresses (If you don't know her work, seriously check her out, she's great). So I bought the film about a year ago and haven't watched it since. Until this week, that is. And so comes my reevaluation..THE GOOD The thing I love most about Next Stop Wonderland is the fact that it's a romantic comedy that avoids most of the clichés the genre has been burdened with. The two main characters are far from unattractive, but it's no Kate Hudson\/Matthew McConaughey duo. The film doesn't capitalize on anything shiny or cheesy. These are real people in real situations. The two main characters are people stuck in ruts, waiting on their lives to change. And it's very true to life. Here we have a nurse whose boyfriend has just left her. Her mother tries to interfere in her life and get her back out there as far as dating. She doesn't want to and is pretty dismal throughout the majority of the film. Meanwhile, we have a serious man who volunteers at an aquarium while trying to afford schooling to become a marine biologist.Hope Davis absolutely shines in her role as Erin, the single woman who is too proud to admit that she's lonely. Another standout is Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, pre-Capote, in a small role as Erin's politically aware ex-boyfriend.THE BAD I try not to judge a film on it's predictability, but it's hard not to do so. As far as this is concerned, it's obvious what's going to happen from the third scene. Obviously the lonely woman and the hard working single guy are going to find each other and fall in love. I guess one could say that it's watching them get there that is important, which I kind of agree with, but it makes you really want to tune out and fast forward through all the meaninglessness and skip to the end.The ending is kind of a let down.

A rich man, his much younger exquisitely charming wife, and a police detective. Two little girls have been raped and killed.

The story, like the Goonies, and frankly all IJ movies, is very basic and honest find the treasure to help the poor, before the bad guys find it and use it for evil. At the end of the day, it's Indiana's unique character that makes this movie stand out. Therefore, this movie, like all other Indiana's, is a winner.

Well, usually when we get a sequel, it tends to be a flawed continuation on the original. And one might think, because of the critic, that this is the case here.Don't be fooled, because it isn't. IJTOD was the first Indiana film I ever saw. The story was original, like all IJ movies, so it stands on its own perfectly.

This film is often funny, suspenseful and even scary at times. This film gradually builds in it's suspense and violence. There is one scene in particular that is hard to watch - make that hard to hear; it is one of the most disgusting moments in cinema yet shows you absolutely no gore when the 3 have to dismember a corpse. Kerry Fox, Ewan MacGregor, and Christopher Eccleston give 3 excellent performances as the somewhat obnoxious, but funny roommates. They are very lively and strong in their roles. The directing and cinematography are powerful and stylish. It is certain that there was a real vision for this film. Many of the scenes and sequences come together so well, it is impossible to think that they were not planned as such. Where so many films seem unsure of their direction, this one is stedfast and clear.

But the same truth can be said regarding most film adaptations of masterly written works.For me, having read Dumas and seen the 1975 film adaptation, I found this rendition more than satisfactory. Its a shame that for most of us who have read, will always want to hark back and compare it to the book. I think that to do such, would be wrong. One has to realise that to faithfully recreate the book on screen would have taken better part of six hours plus run-time, after final edit to make the story coherent. Not to mention maintaining the level of drama and intensity of acting in that time frame. Instead one should see the film for what it is... a good retelling not a remake.Peace's performance as Count Mondego and Caviezel's Dantes are truly refreshing. Much better than what I've come to expect from Hollywood, as of late. This film has both style, substance and above all passion.Hey, who am I to say! Go see it for yourself!!!
