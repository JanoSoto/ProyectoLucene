A wide-eyed youngster gaping at a big silver screen at the theater can be more memorable than a middle-aged guy seeing that film decades later on a small television.However, here is one film that is EVEN BETTER than I remembered it. Yeah, it's a little dated here and there, but not much, just mainly Audrey Hepburn's dialog. However, the story with all its twists is just as suspenseful and fun to watch as it was 40 years ago. I've seen this three times in the last two years, after that long, long absence. (Tip spend the extra money to get the Criterion DVD disc. It is the only clear, sharp copy of this film I have seen.)The story's strength lies in getting the viewer involved. One never knows whether Gary Grant is a good guy or a bad guy. The dialog between Grant and Hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. There are lots of good lines, particularly by Grant. That in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. The pacing of this story also is good; the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.This has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s. I have never known anyone who didn't like this film.

This could be a gay companion piece to The Breakfast Club, except it's deeper and more honest.There is a reason why Edge of Seventeen is such a cult film it has penetrated the soul of the times.

His Exorcist sequel is miles below the original if you're looking for scares, but miles above it in terms of actual storytelling, plot, character development, etc. It's full of interesting ideas (the most interesting being the idea of pure goodness as a magnet for evil), and Regan turns into an angelic heroine out to stop the demon that once possessed her. But Boorman's wacko imagery, while fascinating in places (the doves, the locusts), tends to get a little TOO wacko, to the point where you can't help laughing (the hypnosis machine, Richard Burton putting out a fire with a wooden crutch, James Earl Jones spitting up a tomato).If you can accept the fact that this is a completely different movie than the original, you might find that it's a pretty good movie on its own.

Here it was so grounded in reality that it was absolutely frightening; I kept saying a prayer over and over Please God, don't let my sons turn out like this.

This is something both males and females can relate to. The underdog, Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), is not pure of heart. McGill manipulates, lies and deceives people to get what she wants.

Once she does this she is able to face the reality of her situation and for better or worse move on. Does she persevere and come out on top? I won't tell, watch the movie.I think Mike Nichols did a fine job of taking a somewhat common story (an underdogs struggle to advance\/win), a cast of recognizable but (at the time of the release) non A list actors, and a nice but unspectacular song & score and produced a hit movie worthy of all the Oscar nominations it received, including a win for Best Song. In other words the sum of the parts was greater than a single part. Some movies boast big names or a great song but the film fails to have the emotional impact or appeal that WG does.

I think all people, to some extent, have done these very same things at some point in their lives. What is somewhat unique about this film is that the underdog has to come face to face with her moral wrong doings. Once she does this she is able to face the reality of her situation and for better or worse move on. Does she persevere and come out on top? I won't tell, watch the movie.I think Mike Nichols did a fine job of taking a somewhat common story (an underdogs struggle to advance\/win), a cast of recognizable but (at the time of the release) non A list actors, and a nice but unspectacular song & score and produced a hit movie worthy of all the Oscar nominations it received, including a win for Best Song. In other words the sum of the parts was greater than a single part. Some movies boast big names or a great song but the film fails to have the emotional impact or appeal that WG does. Speaking only for myself, I heard Let the River Run by Carly Simon before I saw WG and I didn't think the song was all that great. After I saw the film the song took on an entirely new aspect and I loved it.Lastly, with the exception of Harrison Ford, who at that point in his career had not shed his action hero image, many of the actors in this film were not quite famous. Look for Kevin Spacy as a sleazy would be hiring boss, Oliver Platt who uses his supervisor position to act as a pimp, Joan Cusak reminds us why the 80's are known for big hair, and a young Alec Baldwin who was busy trying to establish himself as an actor and not passing on his political ideology.

Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best recent films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!

I thought it dull and long-winded (I know, like my writing--hah, hah, hah!). I sat down last night to watch it again, after having it collect dust in my video cabinet for three years; I was going to give it away to the local library, but I figured, give it one more chance.What a strange transformation of my opinion of this movie. I really was bummed about Get Carter. I thought it was simply so dark and repulsive, so slow and dry that the people who raved about it were just hopelessly in love with crummy movies (I have my own sinful pleasures, but mine are at least entertaining; McQ comes to mind).Maybe it's the fact that I've seen the Stallone remake (not bad, but the best part was Sly's wardrobe) and it piqued my curiosity in seeing the original again. Frame of mind comes to mind. It's possible I just wasn't up to watching the perverted and vicious Jack Carter do his revenge number on the pornomobsters in his home town of Ugly, England. I just don't know, but it was like watching a new movie last night.Get Carter is still a dark and perverse revenger (watching the little sports car get pushed into the water and Michael Caine's bland reaction, his absolutely repulsive phone sex in front of his landlady, and the sociopathological way his knifes and shoots the scummier citizens he encounters actually gave me nightmares), but as a whole, the movie is a well-crafted and knife's edgy crime drama.Discovering that your first impression of a movie was wrong is not entirely a bad thing. Be patient with Get Carter. If you don't like it the first time, try it again in a different frame of mind.

A girl is brutally murdered by a faceless killer and leaves it up to the viewers to decide if the perpetrator is none other than Jason Voorhees, back from his watery grave for revenge? Well, unless you have been hiding under a rock for the last 20 years you know the killer IS Jason and this is the movie where he takes his rightful place in the hearts of horror movie aficionados worldwide.Friday 2 was Paramount's big follow up to their sleeper hit of the same name the year before. After the success of Friday 1, Paramount realized they had a cash cow on their hands and quickly gave the green light to director Steve Miner to make a sequel. This film takes place 5 years after the tragic events of the first. Crystal Lake is open again (albeit a few miles away from the crime scene of Camp Blood) for business. We meet several new, pretty young people who are ripe for the slaying and represent every cliché thinkable. But god you have to love these films! They're so bad that they're good. Watching a Jason movie is like watching a car wreck. You just can't seem to look away.Curiously, Jason appears in this movie wearing a burlap sack rather than the hockey mask we have come to love over the years. He doesn't get that until the third installment. I think the burlap sack sort of adds a hokeyness to this film; some much needed levity. There are some brutal kills in this outing, particularly the one involving the poor kid in the wheelchair (OUCH!). Aestically, the movie looks good and the new DVD does a wonderful job in restoring quality. I remember having this movie on VHS and it literally looked like it was filmed from a personal camcorder. I wish they had not killed off the character of Crazy Ralph. I really enjoyed watching him warn the characters about going to Crystal Lake. All his death did was add another body to Jason's overall tab. One burning question I have is when the police officer goes into the woods to pursue Jason. He leaves his car parked right in the middle of the road. Wouldn't the police have organized some sort of search mission for him? The car was there for several hours at least! Maybe Jason got them, too. The acting in this movie is definitely a notch lower than in the first one. The only person who did a good job was the guy who played Jason. Perhaps it was because his face wasn't shown ). I'm giving this movie a 5\/10.

Problem is - after seeing it again today, two important factors are quite clear about this version of the film.The first main one is that, in regards to the original Oz books by L. Frank Baum, this one is a disgrace to them, at least by today's standards. For its time - in the 1930's - it was the first adaption of the film on screen in sound and color. There was a previous silent version, which - like its modern predecessor Return to Oz 1985 were more in line with L. Frank Baum's book, which was indeed a mile stone in regards to film. But the problem is many of the details, and I am not going to nitpick about costumes as really that was, most likely, the only thing they could do. Ironically, like in the silent version, they opted for live people to perform the characters such as the Tin Man, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion. It must be taken in due consideration that this film should not be classified a drama film, as this IS a musical version of Frank Baum's story.I have no idea how people would react if there was a completely faithful adaption to the books. Because the truth is L. Frank Baum's real books are very dark in a lot of places. For example - in the scene where Dorothy is a prisoner in the Witch's castle, the Tin Man, Lion, and Scarecrow are already captured and unable to help Dorothy. She becomes literally the Witch's slave and does cleaning for her, until, to cut the story short, she throws water over the witch and she melts. Another aspect was that Dorothy's shoes were not ruby; but silver.When people see this film today; they think this is how it is in the books and that Dorothy will be all happy in Kanasas and marry 'Hunk'. Which couldn't be further from the truth.In the second version, Dorothy comes back (and the storyline) more or less follows the sequel Return to Oz (although it too is more of a combination of two of the latter 'Oz' books).Also there is noticed a lack of reality about the 1939 film. Again I do take into account that at the time, perhaps they could have done better and as far as technology this is what was good for then. But as of now; when you see it today - it is abhorrently... almost the word queer comes to mind. Exactly.It is too colorful; too idealized; its too wishy washy. There is again no sense of reality at all about it. I mean, it makes sense when you read the books (if you ever did wish to read them; which I must say the books are incredible).But the second big factor was, for one, the problem with Judy Garland. Although this made her a star, and indeed the song Somewhere over the Rainbow belongs to her in a way (not merely because she created it, but because she brought sound and life to the character) - it was because the truth is in the book Dorothy is really 9 years old.True - they did start off wanting to use Shirley Temple (which in hindsight probably would have been the best choice in regards to age); but as for heavy singing and the makeup and stunts, it was probably a good choice to use Judy. Although she was 17. Another problem factor was the relationship with the Scarecrow and Dorothy. In the book and also in Return to Oz; they regard each other as friends and the relationship is quite clear. However in this - they made it romanticized. Which was wrong. To put it bluntly - especially in light that Dorothy is supposed to be a little girl, not a teenager.Today there should be a remake of this film, in my opinion. More in line with the original books - because now we have the capability to do more realism with the characters and yet still be faithful to L. Frank Baum's work.People are so married to this version that most reject its predecessor which, like the 1938 one, is a milestone in regards to how they can do an 'Oz' remake. Also people reject the cartoon versions (there was an animated film version of The Wizard of Oz (not live action) which was perhaps the most faithful of all the films, although I believe it was a TV film - not exactly a film film.So for all the reasons today - if you really want to see an adaption (to this date) that is faithful to Baum's books - get Return to Oz or the animated version.

It's a wonder it took me this long to get around to seeing it, and I have to say I really found it to be quite great. Even After 30 years, 'Jaws' is still an entertaining, engrossing and even a bit scary motion picture. Sure, it has lost a lot with age, but it still manages to pull it off after all these years. This is one of the brilliant Steven Spielberg's first films and he knocks it out of the park. It's a damn shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this. Roy Scheider is great as town Sheriff, Brody, while Robert Shaw is ultra-creepy as the weird sea captain, John Quintis. A very young Richard Dreyfuss also does a superb job as the marine biologist flown in to this small summer town to help track down the man-eating 300 ton great white. The film features excellent action sequences especially the last 15 minutes of the film which could be considered masterful. The film drags a bit towards the middle, but everything else is very fast-paced.

It's a wonder it took me this long to get around to seeing it, and I have to say I really found it to be quite great. Even After 30 years, 'Jaws' is still an entertaining, engrossing and even a bit scary motion picture. Sure, it has lost a lot with age, but it still manages to pull it off after all these years. This is one of the brilliant Steven Spielberg's first films and he knocks it out of the park. It's a damn shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this. Roy Scheider is great as town Sheriff, Brody, while Robert Shaw is ultra-creepy as the weird sea captain, John Quintis.
