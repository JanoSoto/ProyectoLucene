This is Hitchcock's most personal, passionate film, reportedly one of his favorites with some reservations, unfortunately it did not perform very well during its 1958 release neither box office or reception wise. Hitchcock put the blame for the movie's box office failure on its star, James Stewart, whom he felt was becoming too old to keep audiences interested anymore. What Hitchcock did not realize was that this was not true. The only problem there is with Vertigo is that it was made too early in time. After a re-evaluation about ten or twenty years later, it became realized as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, is continually analyzed and studied to this day, and is regarded as his greatest achievement in film-making.Vertigo, based on a French crime novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, tells the obsessive story about a former San Francisco detective (James Stewart) suffering from acrophobia, who is asked by a friend (Tom Helmore) to follow his wife (Kim Novak) in fear that she might be possessed by the spirit of one of her ancestors and may be driven into her death. The detective becomes dangerously obsessed with the woman and ultimately falls in love with her, completely unaware of the horrific consequences that will follow.Alfred Hitchcock is affectionately known as the master of suspense for his remarkable ability to create horrifying moments such as the shower scene in Psycho (1960), another heavily analyzed film. But Hitchcock was always capable of making something far better and no where else in the director's works is that more clear than in Vertigo. This is not a horror story. This is a powerful dramatic mystery film that also embraces the rarely explored theme of obsession. Yes, it is a romantic film, but unlike any others before or after it.Of course, Vertigo is a love story. The plot is driven by James Stewart's character and his obsession with the woman he is hired to follow and suspect. But this is not at all how love stories were made before or even today. If Vertigo was made today, things would be completely different. The filmmakers would succumb to the hackneyed conventions that audience members tend to require for association with the movies they watch. The love between the two lead characters played by Stewart and Novak is not expressed through heavy, over-the-top kisses or unnecessary sex scenes like what we see today. It is shown through their actions, their behavior, their performances. Remember, this is a film that is about obsession. Not lust, obsession. And the obsession theme comes about especially within the last twenty minutes of the film. I will not explain how, I want you to look at it for yourself and see what I mean. When the movie was first released, this tactic was looked upon lowly by critics at first, again, because it was something revolutionary, ahead of its own time. It's not the conventional love story, so that also means, do not expect a few kisses and a happy ending. Again, this is revolutionary and because it's something we don't see everyday, it's so much more effective and wonderful.The leading force in this film is Alfred Hitchcock. Like I said, this is a personal film of his'. The next most effective tools are the performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak, who portray two of the most passionate lovers I've ever seen on film. And the third is definitely Bernard Herrmann, the music composer. Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese noted that Herrmann's score revolved around the main theme obsession. And in deed, he was right. The score to Vertigo is hands-down beautiful. The scene where Scottie and Madeleine first kiss before the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean (my favorite scene) has one of the most effective soundtrack pieces ever. Basically, Herrmann's score is more than just something in the background. It's an effective, driving presence that really makes this movie so special along with its other fantastic elements. Herrmann is one of the most mimicked composers of all time and this is most obvious in Vertigo, which I feel would be about three-quarters as good without his music.It's a shame the critics of 1958 were unwilling to accept such a revolutionary film at the time. It ended the collaboration between Hitchcock and James Stewart, who had worked many times before on movies such as Rear Window (1954), and Hitchcock ultimately ended up stuck with the horror genre instead of being able to work on more passionate movies such at Vertigo. Thankfully, like wine allegedly, it gets better with age. Keep in mind, this is a movie that also likes to play with your head. You may have to see it two or three times before you get the whole picture, but when you do, you will embrace it with more power than ever. I myself have seen Vertigo a great deal of times and each time, it just gets more and more powerful. In essence, I am obsessed with Vertigo. It may have been ahead of its time, but it is certainly one of the most spectacular and wonderful motion pictures ever crafted by human hands.

I saw it when it first came out and thought it was a masterpiece. I saw in ten year later at a college film festival and it was already starting to show signs of age, largely because of the social changes between 1961 and 1971. Even then the audience was starting to make fun of the movie. What looked bold in 1961 looked dated and repressed in 1971. I saw it perhaps a decade later and it left no memorable impression. Last night I could barely make it through. The characters felt intense to me when I was young. Now it seems to me that they seemed intense only because there was a lack of any real substance to dilute their one emotion. Each character has one defining emotion &#150; Deanie is fragile, all the boys are sexually obsessed, Bud's father in a blow-hard who never stops talking, etc. The characters are so lacking in nuance. Bud is laughable and pathetic in his longing and frustration. The silliness of the high-school girls, squealing and jumping whenever they met was a ridiculous stereotype. These were one dimensional stereotypes not real people. The only black characters are shown learning, wide-eyed at the prospect of witnessing Ginny Stamper's gang rape. I found myself wondering if this could really have been done by Elia Kazan. I even cringed at the things Natalie Wood did to convey youth. It had all the subtly of vaudeville melodrama. On the plus side, I enjoyed Deanie's mother's obsession with the stock market. I understand that this was typical of the 1920's when average people played the market naively, believing they could be come rich, fooled by the market into thinking they were smart when they were only lucky. The portrayal of this aspect of society was more interesting last night than fifty years ago. I also enjoyed Bud's introduction to pizza. We take pizza for granted, forgetting that it did not become common in the US until the 1950s. Bud learns of pizza as a college student when he's living in New Haven. Fifty years ago someone's hearing of pizza for the first time would not have seemed surprising, but it was bit of a treat. Overall, the movie is still interesting because of the time it portrays, but the characters are crudely drawn by current standards, the better movies of its era, or even Kazan's body of work.

While that movie was certainly a worthy keep,it's nowhere near as gangbusters frenetic or true Martin a film as this offering,another pairing he made with director Carl Reiner.Martin is Dr.Michael Hfuhrruhur,a brilliant neurosurgeon whose inexplicable naiveté over love has him in the arms of a diabolical gold-digger(Kathleen Turner,playing her vampishness for laughs not long after 1981's Body Heat),and then his subsequent disillusion over that leads him to a kindred would-be romance with a lovely woman whose one small problem is that she is a floating brain in a jar. Go figure!Too many great lines and physical comedy to get into here(stuff that almost rival any Zuker-Abrams-Zucker offering at their 1980s peak),this film,like The Jerk showcase Steve's total commitment to that Inspired Idiot,physically as well as verbally. Very good(if perhaps limited)support coming from David Warner,Paul Benedict,Richard Brestoff,Randi Brooks and Merv Griffin(!)enhance the elements of this madcap comedy. This movie is a great showcase of old Steve Martin,and if you miss seeing that,than rent or buy it as soon as you can find a copy.

It shows the defenselessness of being a kid. Nothing you do necessarily sobers an adult. Influenced by Truffaut's own early life, it shows an able boy growing up in Paris and seemingly diving foolhardy into a life of crime. Adults see him as an agent provocateur. We are afforded some of his personal time alone, as when he lights a candle before a small tribute mausoleum to Balzac in his bedroom. The film's famous final shot, a zoom in to a freeze frame, shows him looking straight into the camera. He has a comparable countenance at other times in the film, which is shot in black and white in Paris in a frigid season. He always has the collar of his jacket unfolded against the wind. Antoine and his delinquent friend have so much character in their young faces, and that is perhaps the most immediate force behind the final shot.I like how, when he's among his friends, Antoine betrays the feelings of inadequacy with which his everyday life endows him. He is played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, who has a kind of downbeat disengagement, as if his heart had undergone complicated pain long before the film began. The 400 Blows, with all its clarity and sensitivity, is in a class by itself despite being among the establishing films of the French New Wave. We realize that it materialized straightaway out of Truffaut's heart.Little is done in the film just for impact. It's guileless, and when it isn't it's still seamless. Everything complements the effect of the final shot. We meet Antoine when he is in his early teens, and living with the conditional love of his mother and stepfather in a cramped space where they constantly seem to be wringing out of each other's way. The mother is a blonde who likes tight sweaters and is troubled by financial need, by her exasperating son, and by goings-on with a man from work. The stepfather is a pleasant enough guy, complacent, and handles the boy in a fond manner even if he is not very close to him. Both parents are away from home a lot, and neither has the composure to pay enough attention to the boy. They assess him by appearances, and by the accounts of others who do the same.At school, Antoine has been categorized by his teacher as a nuisance. His fate is not lucky. When a pinup calendar is being snuck from desk to desk, his is the desk behind the teacher finds it. Sent to stand in the corner, he makes faces for his classmates and writes on the wall. The teacher orders him to take back the incendiary defense he has written, as further strong- arming. Here is one that's the story of my life He feels too preoccupied to finish his homework and instead of returning to school without it, he plays hooky. His story is that he was sick. After he skips again, he says his mother has died. When she shows at his school, apparently revived and deeply angry, he is pegged as a liar.Truffaut's film is not a lament or as hard-hitting as a social melodrama. There are a few instants where you find yourself laughing in quite the same way you would during a Billy Wilder movie. One moment in particular, which you might go as far as to call a sight gag, shot from above the street, shows a physical education teacher leading the boys on a routine run around a few blocks in town. Two by two they scramble into truancy, until the teacher is the leader of a rank and file of only two or three boys. There is a wonderful mostly wordless runaway bout with Antoine and his delinquent friend, who's afforded such freewheeling freedom that he has a daily life that thrives on impulsive chaos and spontaneous theft, which of course infatuates our angry young hero. The most relief in the film comes after one of Antoine's dumber screw-ups. He lights a candle to Balzac, which sets the shrine on fire. His parents put out the flames, but then, because one supposes they happen to be in a decent mood, their frustration turns into a dismissive bygone, and the whole family goes to the movies and laughs the way home.There is an ample amount of movie-going in this movie itself, with Antoine's intense face hypnotized by the screen. We know that young Truffaut himself fled to the movies whenever he could. The cinema saved Francois Truffaut's life, he apparently pointed out frequently. It took a student flirting with crime and gave him something to love. If the New Wave is the turnstile between classic and modern cinema, and quite a lot believe it is, then Truffaut is the participant whose films perpetuated the most earnest and personal passion for film-making.

Double Indemnity is a film which tells you its ending right at the start. And then the flashback begins and we spend the rest of the film seeing how it is we got to that ending we already know. It would seem that under these circumstances there may not be much drama or tension in the film but that could not be further from the truth. We may know the film's ultimate destination but the journey never fails to be compelling. It is fascinating to watch this classic film noir story unfold. It is a film which will hold your attention throughout.Fred MacMurray has the lead role in the film, that of insurance salesman Walter Neff, an ordinary man who will find himself entangled in an extraordinarily complex murder plot. The drama begins when Walter meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a woman quite eager to see her husband meet an untimely demise. A demise which will prove to be quite lucrative for Phyllis if only she can manage to take out a life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. Here of course is where our insurance salesman enters the picture and the plot will very quickly be put into motion.Barbara Stanwyck plays Phyllis in what would come to be one of film's most famous femme fatale roles. While Walter initially is not at all interested in murder he certainly is interested in Phyllis and it does not take long for her to entangle Walter in her web. The fact it takes her so little time to convince a man she doesn't even know to murder her husband does strain credulity a bit. One moment Walter meets Phyllis and seemingly a moment later he's willing to kill for her. It is very obvious who the stronger of the two characters is. Phyllis is cold and ruthless and apparently has her ways of convincing a weaker man to do her bidding. Since this is a film produced in 1944 we're not going to see explicitly what those ways may be but you can hazard a good guess. Walter never stood a chance.The story always captivates and it is fascinating to see the seemingly perfect murder plot play out. But the movie does have some flaws. Much of the dialogue seems clipped and forced. MacMurray is the biggest offender in this regard, so often speaking in a tone which seems completely unnatural. His insistence on referring to Phyllis as Baby every time he speaks to her wears thin quickly. It's as if Walter is trying real hard to be the cold, hard tough guy but it never convinces. He's no match for Phyllis. In fact while MacMurray is obviously playing the key figure it is Edward G. Robinson in a supporting role as insurance company investigator Barton Keyes who really shines. Watching Keyes try to unravel the plot, the plot we already know inside and out, is great fun and Robinson does an excellent job with his role, creating a truly memorable character. And of course Stanwyck is excellent as well. MacMurray's OK, just not up to the level of his co-stars, which is exacerbated by the fact that it is he who narrates the story throughout the film-long flashback.All in all, director Billy Wilder did a magnificent job creating a wonderfully atmospheric thriller. The look and feel of the film are perfect, adding to the great tension. The fact there is so much tension and drama even though we pretty much already know what's going to happen is remarkable. Yes at times the film seems a little dated, most especially with its dialogue. But there is no denying the film is very well done.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"24 March 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Kenneth Branagh's poor attempt at making a film of Mary Shelley's 19th century novel 'Frankenstein' fails to give across the message that Shelley's world famous creation manages to do. The adaptation mostly follows the line of the book with the enthusiastic Professor Frankenstein who is determined to create life after his mother dies giving birth his younger brother. Despite the fact the film is based on the book it lacks the ability to truly curdle the blood.Isn't the film supposed to be a horror? Although the makeup done by Daniel Parker, Paul Engelen and Carol Hemming was pretty frightening, the film never really gave me that spine-shiver that is expected from a horror. It lacks that sense of darkness and suspense. When expecting an ending that was similar to the book's, it is very surprising to find that Branagh has changed it. The gory scene of the monster ripping Elizabeth's heart out is then followed by a laughable failure of the zombie-like Elizabeth running through the house in flames. Despite the effect's this is unrealistic and whole house is a blaze in less then a minute! There are many great actors in the film such as the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh who both directs and stars in the film, Robert De-Niro who plays the distraught creature, Tom Hulce who plays Henry Clerval (Frankenstein's closest friend) and Helena Bonham Carter who plays Elizabeth, but this still doesn't bring the film to life. Branagh's attempt of the science-obsessed professor Victor Frankenstein is first seen in the cold blizzards of the Arctic wearing a frosted fur coat. He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation. His Frankenstein is dramatic and over-acted but doesn't bring out the enthusiasm of Victor Frankenstein described in the novel. Hugely contrasted to Branagh's attempt of Frankenstein is Robert De Niro's superb performance of the creature. His performance conveys the feelings that the creature is described to have such as hate for Victor Frankenstein and lots of sadness. The way he portrays the creature really allows the audience to feel sympathy for Frankenstein's creation.The music seems to play throughout the whole film and is as annoying as Kenneth Branagh's loud and over the top acting.

The adaptation mostly follows the line of the book with the enthusiastic Professor Frankenstein who is determined to create life after his mother dies giving birth his younger brother. Despite the fact the film is based on the book it lacks the ability to truly curdle the blood.Isn't the film supposed to be a horror? Although the makeup done by Daniel Parker, Paul Engelen and Carol Hemming was pretty frightening, the film never really gave me that spine-shiver that is expected from a horror. It lacks that sense of darkness and suspense. When expecting an ending that was similar to the book's, it is very surprising to find that Branagh has changed it. The gory scene of the monster ripping Elizabeth's heart out is then followed by a laughable failure of the zombie-like Elizabeth running through the house in flames. Despite the effect's this is unrealistic and whole house is a blaze in less then a minute! There are many great actors in the film such as the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh who both directs and stars in the film, Robert De-Niro who plays the distraught creature, Tom Hulce who plays Henry Clerval (Frankenstein's closest friend) and Helena Bonham Carter who plays Elizabeth, but this still doesn't bring the film to life. Branagh's attempt of the science-obsessed professor Victor Frankenstein is first seen in the cold blizzards of the Arctic wearing a frosted fur coat. He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation. His Frankenstein is dramatic and over-acted but doesn't bring out the enthusiasm of Victor Frankenstein described in the novel. Hugely contrasted to Branagh's attempt of Frankenstein is Robert De Niro's superb performance of the creature. His performance conveys the feelings that the creature is described to have such as hate for Victor Frankenstein and lots of sadness.

They complement each other well. They've extracted this tone from the gray pages of the comic book and flushed it onto the screen with a painterly, deliberate pitch in its pace. Director Sam Mendes and his screenwriter David Self have given a lot of imagination and emotion to this adaptation. This film is about gangsters in the 1930s, a vendetta riddled with Robin Hood-style bank robberies and brutal murders, all of which is packed to the rafters with subtext and metaphor. It's an often overlooked contemporary milestone that is stupendously, rivetingly acted. Even Ciaran Hinds, in a small role, is a powerhouse. And, I remember sitting in the theater as a mere seventh grader who'd never before been so stricken by the sheer look of a film and predicting that no movie that year would be more conspicuously lauded for its cinematography. Conrad L. Hall's work just had to win the Academy Award. And it did, and I was proud. He constructs an almost alternate reality through the subjective universe of darkness, shadow, night, grim chiaroscuro faces, cold and snow. His characters stand in downpours, the rain running off the brims of their fedoras and almost turning the shoulders of their inextricable wool overcoats into sponges. Their feet would do well in the trenches of WWI. The all-encompassing look of the movie emits a glossy atmospheric frost. There are lots of odd, slow scenes not in the graphic novel on which this very cinematic film is based.The classically structured narrative puppeteers three father-son pairs, two biological, the third emotional, and shows how the lives in which they've immersed themselves make unconditional love between them unattainable. Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a gunman for the Rock Island reach of the Chicago mob, around 1931. Tyler Hoechlin plays his son Michael Jr., an austere boy of 12. After his brother Peter asks what their father does for a living, it hits Michael Jr. that he's never really thought about it before, and to see for himself. One night he hides in a car, goes along for the ride, and sees a man killed. Not by his father, but what concession does that make? Sullivan works for Paul Newman's John Rooney, the mob boss, who is very old but very alive and zeroed in, and says in three words what another would say in seven. John's son Connor, played by a heretofore unknown Daniel Craig, is his muscle. Sullivan's kid gets suspicious because of Daniel Craig and has a nightmare about Hinds's house. Sullivan learns that Connor has been stealing from his father, and that foreshadows the epic's implicit deduction, because Sullivan thinks of John like his own father, and John speaks of Sullivan as a son. Men who name their sons after themselves have historically suggested a desire that the boy will become like them. This is not the fortune of Michael Sr., who has made a complacent agreement with his dark side and an underworld economy to afford a comfortable home with his wife, a fleeting Jennifer Jason Leigh, and two boys in relative peace from the hardships of being earnest.The key difference between the latent heroism of Sullivan and the innate evil of Rooney, he doesn't want his son in the business. What a horrible, terrible, despicable father is. Connor is in my eyes the most tragic and tortured character in the whole story. Our baroque plot ponders whether or not it is socially impossible for fathers to free their sons from the sneaky scope of their misdeeds and mistakes. It also adds definition with sons who feel they are not the most loved. Did you like Peter better than me? Michael Jr. asks his father. And in a scene where Sullivan goes to see Mr. Rooney, he is not psychologically prepared to grasp why Rooney would try to shield his son Connor, whom he sees as having deeply wronged him, to his unshakingly loyal servant who is like a son.The dominant chemistry is between Hanks and Newman, and Hanks and Hoechlin, who plays his son. Newman plays Rooney as a man whose preference for body count is as spare and pared down as his language, but his way of speaking keeps him from being fully predictable to those who know him, and so is his preference for body count. Alongside this pleasantness and aphorisms we must juxtapose his dealings in booze, gambling and women, and his intractable decisiveness to remove any affiliate whose further use would be impractical for him.The Hanks character sees the tautly quantified brighter aspects of Rooney so unswervingly that he has almost surgically blinded himself from the evil of his actions. Even after he bears witness to the worst, he feels let down, or unreciprocated, more than deceived. This willpower leaves him lacking in wisdom to pass on to his own son, and it takes Rooney, in a solipsistic passage Newman delivers with a stoic sense of altruism, to sober him. Father and son set out, hunted by Jude Law's fascinating hit man who indulges in a business hobby by bartering photographs of the people he has murdered to the press. Tom Hanks and Daniel Craig play deeply tortured, sad, personal roles. How intensely the time, place and culture vacuums the soul, from idealism to cold-heartedness to greed to vengeance.

Following in the steps of Cimarron and Dances With Wolves, Unforgiven finally got Clint Eastwood the Oscar recognition for one of film's great icons. It's also one nasty and uncompromising look at the old west with people neither all good or all bad, usually reacting to the time and circumstances they're in. And the reputations they've had built for them by the various dime novelists whose work littered the land during the last half of the 19th century.A former border raider back in the wild days of the Civil War, Clint Eastwood's William Munny is our protagonist. He gave all that up and got married, fathered two kids and has been living peaceful and quiet as a farmer. He's also given up the drink, because it was demon rum which helped him overcome a whole lot of inhibitions about violence.But a few states over, a cowboy being told about his shortcomings from one of the town tarts, decided to cut her up. After doing so, he fled to the safety of the ranch he works for. Town Marshal Gene Hackman, also a violent man in the past tries to play the whole thing down. But the women raise a bounty in the only way they know how to take vengeance on behalf of a colleague. One of the great examples of women's liberation in the old west.News of it is carried to Eastwood by old friend Morgan Freeman. Reluctantly because he does need the money, Eastwood, Freeman and young gun Jaimz Woolvett decide to go after it.Gene Hackman won his second Oscar to go with his one for Best Actor in The French Connection. His town marshal is another uncommonly vicious man who now that he is on the side of 'law and order' has some grand pretensions about himself. It's also a fascinating look inside the character of someone like Wild Bill Hickok or Wyatt Earp and what it probably took to keep 'law and order' in frontier towns. It was a well earned Best Supporting Actor performance.Part of the reason some folks in frontier America have the legendary reputations they do is the fact of those dime novels I mentioned before. Ned Buntline, the leading purveyor of this literature made the reputations that so many frontier icons have today. One of the most interesting roles in the film is that of Saul Rubinek who is such a novelist.When we first meet Rubinek he's traveling with English Bob, played by Richard Harris in another fine performance. Hackman who knows of him and knows he killed a friend of his way back when, takes it on himself to expose and thoroughly humiliate Harris. He then takes on Rubinek as his scribe because he fancies the kind of reputation that Earp, Hickok, and Bill Cody et al are now enjoying.Of course in the end when Clint delivers a bloody reprisal to one and all, Rubinek who now has seen such a scene of death and destruction that is having a lot of second thoughts about his profession. It's my favorite role in Unforgiven.Unforgiven in addition to Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Hackman got Clint Eastwood his first Oscar in the Best Director category. He's won two of them now also for Million Dollar Baby. He was up in the Best Actor category, but lost to Al Pacino for Scent Of Mystery. Unforgiven won its fourth Oscar in the Editing category.Unforgiven isn't John Wayne's kind of west, but it's a fitting climax for Clint Eastwood in the genre that launched his career. I don't think it's an accident he's not done another.

Bram Stoker's Dracula is my recommendation to everyone because it's a wonderful movie that deserves much more attention then it has gotten.At least more than Mamma Mia and other stupidities that are earning a whole lot of money for nothing!!! Enjoy!10\/10!
