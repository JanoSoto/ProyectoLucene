[{"date":"31 July 2012","score":"","review":" Rushmore is that odd little comedy which you find yourself struggling to explain to your friends -- It's about this teenage kid who gets expelled from his private academy and plots hilarious revenge on his adult friend that dated his hot teacher crush by funneling bees into his hotel room and cutting his brakes. It's great! No way to describe the plot that doesn't sound either boring, lame, or disturbing; perhaps a mixture of all three. So perhaps we should abandon all attempts to explain Rushmore by plot, and instead focus on the character of Max Fischer, the heart and soul of this newly-birthed Andersonverse.Max is the proverbial C-student who is destined one day to rule the world. That's because he's intelligent, charming, and leadership material in a way that rarely translates into good grades; that rare visionary who's also a do-er. Max spends so much time writing school plays, learning about offbeat extracurricular interests such as kite flying and beekeeping, and fieldmarshalling grand schemes to build an aquarium on the baseball field, that he rarely considers the basics of readin' writin' and 'rythmatic to be a worthy use of his time. Everybody at Rushmore adores Max -- except of course for the grade-fixated Dean, who tells (Bill Murray's character) Herman Blume that Max is the worst student in the entire school.Max's only real obstacle to his manic passions is his own youth. He is foiled in life and in the pursuit of love by the fact that despite all of his many gifts and devotees, he is still a kid muddling through the pitfalls of adolescence and immaturity. He wants desperately to be noticed by the lovely young teacher Miss Cross, but is foiled time and again by shyness, fear of rejection, and bad judgment calls. Despite all of this, Max still manages to rally ingenious solutions to the problems he has created for himself and others.A strong case could be made that Max Fischer is Wes Anderson's alter ego. Basically, you will love this film if the character of Max resonates with you -- and if not, you probably won't like many Wes Anderson films as a rule. All of Rushmore's plotting, acting, directing, and pacing is infused with Anderson's whimsical and nontraditional style--very similar to Max's style. I have often wondered if Rushmore wasn't written with some strong autobiographical leanings in mind.Overall, I found Rushmore to be a sort of timeless, understated comedy which I enjoyed several years later as much as upon the first viewing. Rushmore has a lot of heart. Don't expect gross-out humor or crassness, because this is the gentle Andersonverse after all. If that brand of comedy appeals to you, then you're in. Welcome!
