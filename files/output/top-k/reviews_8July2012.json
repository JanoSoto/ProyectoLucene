It's also being one of his earliest ones, making it perhaps all the more surprising to find out how great this movie actually is and how much I turned out to love it. But then again, there is no such thing as a bad Kubrick movie, so perhaps I should had known better.Evertything about this movie works out great in my opinion. It's not just Kubrick's directing that makes this a great and entertaining movie to watch but also really its story.It's more being a film-noir type of movie and its absolutely fascinating to see Kubrick handling this particular genre. Like all of his movies, it's not just being a standard genre movie, that plays by all of the rules or sticks to all of its familiar tropes. It's perhaps only being a true film-noir in its setup but the overall execution of it is something far more than just that. It uses many ingredients, from multiple different genres and Kubrick manages to blend them all together into one great and entertaining little movie!A great aspect about its story and storytelling is that its being for some part non-linear. Now, nothing special about that you would think but you have to remember this was a 1956 movie and non-linear storytelling in movies really wasn't anything that common yet. Sure, movies always had flashbacks in them, pretty much since the earliest days of cinema on already but non-linear storytelling is a whole other ballgame. The non-linear storytelling is mostly used to show us how the big heist plays out. It's absolutely great to see how the many different characters all did their little part and how it adds up to the eventual heist. And it's always showing you something more and different, so it never feels as if the movie starts repeating itself after a short while. It's great fun and fascinating to watch, all throughout! It besides lets its simple story and setup work out as something great and real clever.What I also really liked about its story were its characters. It's being a real heist movie but not with some typical heist characters in it. There are no Steve McQueen's or Paul Newman's in this movie. Just a bunch of middle aged guys, who look like they could be your next door neighbor. They are not being typical crooks and they are all in it for different and often personal reasons. And the movie really takes its time to show the motivations of the many different characters, which lets it all play out as something engaging and it gets you more involved with the story and its different characters. This also helps to make the movie often a more tense one.The movie has some really great moments in it, that show what a perfectionist and visionary film-maker Stanley Kubrick was. I especially also liked the very dynamic black & white cinematography of the movie, which also helped to give the movie some real pace, even though it probably isn't about halfway through that the actual heist gets set in motion. Kubrick style is definitely showing already in this early movie done by him and it's fun to see how some moments and compositions should remind you of some of Kubrick's later works.It's a wonderfully put together, stylish, fun and fast paced entertaining heist movie, that I absolutely loved watching!9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the very few Kubrick movies that I had never seen before.

Bruce Willis' best performance! A masterpiece *scoffs* Are you serious? This movie was downright horrible. All the false numbers, the reviews, they all gave my wife and I high hopes. But the movie starts off boringly enough and then turns into total snores-ville.Lets start the scoring9\/10 First and foremost everyone in this movie is on drugs, or is crazy. Or is acting like they are heavily sedated. The 'overacting' is absolutely insane. In fact, it's beyond words. While the acting is well done by Brad Pitt, but so totally over-the-top that it will get entirely on your nerves. The acting by Bruce Willis on the other hand, wasn't acting at all. Anyone, and I mean anyone can act like a fruit-loop, stagger around and mumble gibberish.8\/10 The movie tried to portray Philadelphia in 1990 and 1996. What you got was slum, after slum after slum. Sure I knew before I even watched this movie that it wouldn't be 'colourful' but a change of scenery, a change from just the colour 'grey' just once would have been really nice. The movie takes us through 2 hours of slum, after gutter, after slum. Everything looks dilapidated, everyone is a bum\/hobo, everyone is crazy. Even the ones who aren't crazy, are crazy. The setting of the movie just made me feel depressed. If that was really how America looked at back in the 90s then I laugh at all you Americans for thinking how great your country is.7\/10 The woman 'Kathryn Railly', Cole's 'partner-in-lunacy' can't act worth a damn. Her lunacy and irrational behaviour was extremely irritating. Not only that but she starts to make Cole seem like he was the normal one.6\/10 The voice in Cole's head that keeps calling him 'Bob' for some reason. It's never explained. We never find out if the voice exists or not. Some old man takes the 'form' of Bob in presence but then doesn't remember later on. This just only serves to confuse the watcher even more, and the voice never explains any sort of plot points, or adds to the plot at all.5\/10 Brad Pitt can't do the crazy role. It's just not him. He's a good actor, and he played it well. But it's not a role built for him. Or at least not one that I enjoy watching. You could have picked any old drama graduate and given them the exact same role, taped a contact lens to his right eye and voilá! I would have preferred this.4\/10 The cops are absolutely useless at trying to apprehend Cole. He kills 4 or 5 people in the movie. Brutally smashing their heads open, beating them with chairs etc. The movie is very violent. Except America's finest can't even track a single wanted guy and when they find him, which happens every 20 minutes they just let him get away. It's meant to add to the suspense of Oh no! He's going to get apprehended! but really it just makes the cops look like total buffoons.3\/10 All the stupid over-stereotyped machinery in 'the future' after the virus has killed everyone looks absolutely ridiculous. All the eyes staring you in the face from little screens mounted to a giant metal ball that swivels around your head. The singing 'It's a beautiful world' with a picture of the beach taped to the roof. All of it is meaningless. The movie looked like 'Steampunk' 17 years ago. While some of the machinery looked entertaining, it didn't fit anything. If that was the directors idea of trying to make it look like humanity had to go back to the stone-age. Then he's a fool and he paradoxes himself with the idea of 'time-travel'.2\/10 Someone said this movie had Romance. OK, actually a lot of people said it had romance in the reviews. This movie had 0 romance. If your idea of romance is when it looks like Cole is about to strangle his female accomplice and dump her body in the woods after she pulls a bullet from his leg. Then you're disgusting. There was no romance in this movie and no chemistry between the 2 lead actors. Even though they tried so hard and even threw in a few kisses at the end. 'The hills have eyes' is a better romance than this.1\/10 The ending, it made absolutely no sense. My wife sort of picked it out but with all the constant bouncing between 1996 and the future and back and forth etc. You just can't tell anymore. The ending, no matter what happens or if my wife was even right, is just garbage anyway. Really, after all the build up, you get nothing. Sure they warned us 10 or 20 times through the movie by saying I can't prevent this disaster from happening but even if you're like my wife and you think the woman at the end on the aeroplane who was one of the freaks from the future was sent back to 1996 to stop the disaster. Then it still isn't good enough and Cole (Bruce) was just put though some of the most messed up stuff so in the end he could get shot through the heart and die in front of his younger self.Worst movie of this callibre I have seen in years. Hands down one of the most overrated movies ever. You all might think you're cool for trying so hard to be a critic and find this sort of thing AWESOME and entertaining but I will leave you to your ignorance. It must be convenient.

The movie takes us through 2 hours of slum, after gutter, after slum. Everything looks dilapidated, everyone is a bum\/hobo, everyone is crazy. Even the ones who aren't crazy, are crazy. The setting of the movie just made me feel depressed. If that was really how America looked at back in the 90s then I laugh at all you Americans for thinking how great your country is.7\/10 The woman 'Kathryn Railly', Cole's 'partner-in-lunacy' can't act worth a damn. Her lunacy and irrational behaviour was extremely irritating. Not only that but she starts to make Cole seem like he was the normal one.6\/10 The voice in Cole's head that keeps calling him 'Bob' for some reason. It's never explained. We never find out if the voice exists or not. Some old man takes the 'form' of Bob in presence but then doesn't remember later on. This just only serves to confuse the watcher even more, and the voice never explains any sort of plot points, or adds to the plot at all.5\/10 Brad Pitt can't do the crazy role. It's just not him. He's a good actor, and he played it well. But it's not a role built for him. Or at least not one that I enjoy watching. You could have picked any old drama graduate and given them the exact same role, taped a contact lens to his right eye and voilá! I would have preferred this.4\/10 The cops are absolutely useless at trying to apprehend Cole. He kills 4 or 5 people in the movie. Brutally smashing their heads open, beating them with chairs etc. The movie is very violent. Except America's finest can't even track a single wanted guy and when they find him, which happens every 20 minutes they just let him get away. It's meant to add to the suspense of Oh no! He's going to get apprehended! but really it just makes the cops look like total buffoons.3\/10 All the stupid over-stereotyped machinery in 'the future' after the virus has killed everyone looks absolutely ridiculous. All the eyes staring you in the face from little screens mounted to a giant metal ball that swivels around your head. The singing 'It's a beautiful world' with a picture of the beach taped to the roof. All of it is meaningless. The movie looked like 'Steampunk' 17 years ago. While some of the machinery looked entertaining, it didn't fit anything. If that was the directors idea of trying to make it look like humanity had to go back to the stone-age. Then he's a fool and he paradoxes himself with the idea of 'time-travel'.2\/10 Someone said this movie had Romance. OK, actually a lot of people said it had romance in the reviews. This movie had 0 romance. If your idea of romance is when it looks like Cole is about to strangle his female accomplice and dump her body in the woods after she pulls a bullet from his leg. Then you're disgusting. There was no romance in this movie and no chemistry between the 2 lead actors. Even though they tried so hard and even threw in a few kisses at the end. 'The hills have eyes' is a better romance than this.1\/10 The ending, it made absolutely no sense. My wife sort of picked it out but with all the constant bouncing between 1996 and the future and back and forth etc. You just can't tell anymore. The ending, no matter what happens or if my wife was even right, is just garbage anyway. Really, after all the build up, you get nothing. Sure they warned us 10 or 20 times through the movie by saying I can't prevent this disaster from happening but even if you're like my wife and you think the woman at the end on the aeroplane who was one of the freaks from the future was sent back to 1996 to stop the disaster. Then it still isn't good enough and Cole (Bruce) was just put though some of the most messed up stuff so in the end he could get shot through the heart and die in front of his younger self.Worst movie of this callibre I have seen in years. Hands down one of the most overrated movies ever.

Glory is the tale of the 54th Regiment's long, hard journey to battle.Glory has very good production values, that much can be agreed. Very good cinematography, impeccable acting, etc. Glory is extremely well made and really does the story of the 54th Regiment justice.The battle scenes (there are three in all) are initially shocking. Not knowing much about how these battles were fought, it was a surprise seeing the action on screen. The opposing forces merely marched to the other all at once, firing shots as they go.

There he's hilariously paired with his antithesis, a left-wing stoner called The Dude. In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his hard-right politics, which he lovingly equates with rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo. Milius' films (Big Wednesday, Magnum Force, Dilinger, Conan, Red Dawn etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing Dirty Harry, Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because guns are more honourable than money. Conan was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote Apocalypse Now) salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance.Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. Conan doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' everyman warriors vs the evil Other who steals our Freedom tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist Private Ryan).Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - That which does not kill us makes us stronger - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of the will to power, the expression of human existence superior to that of the conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority. Nietzsche attacks man's moral principles such that the new superman is a law unto himself. He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who builds himself up into a being beyond the mob. His secret nobility, Nietzsche then says, will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists. The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne.So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's mind and flesh are greater than steel, Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness.Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze\/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity &#x96; gratuitous in another picture &#x96; only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled Theology\/Civilization, has itself become well known in concert circuits.Like Star Wars (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy\/mythological film which preceded it, Conan is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman &#x96; who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior &#x96; a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells Conan, what is best in life?, Arnie responds like a caveman To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women! Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - Do you want to live forever?! - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies.The film was followed by a worthless sequel. Conan itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain.Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms.

In real life Milius himself proudly claims to been have blacklisted from Hollywood due to his hard-right politics, which he lovingly equates with rugged individualism, personal mastery, survivalism, a Nietzschean warrior's code, self-actualisation, outlaw glory, free-markets and a Darwinian credo. Milius' films (Big Wednesday, Magnum Force, Dilinger, Conan, Red Dawn etc) themselves typically involve macho warriors slaying villains in the name of property rights and individual freedoms, shotgun or broadsword in hand. For writing Dirty Harry, Milius even requested as payment, in addition to his agreed-upon fee, a James Purdy shotgun, apparently because guns are more honourable than money. Conan was also written by Oliver Stone, who like Francis Coppola (Milius co-wrote Apocalypse Now) salivates over megalomania, power and authority whilst pretending to do otherwise. At least Milius is upfront about his stance.Milius' ideals are attractive, but breakdown in the real world. In the West Indies, for example, the seemingly simple issue of property rights (or private property) to this day confers dominance to East Indians (who were granted land rights as Indentured labourers) and Anglo Saxons over Africans. Conan doesn't take place in the real world, though. Set thousands of years before recorded history, when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia were a single land mass, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, a camel punching Ubermensch who fights for vengeance and freedom. His target? Thulsa Doom, a black guy who (ironic) takes kids into slavery. It's another of Milius' everyman warriors vs the evil Other who steals our Freedom tale (Spielberg would consult Milius for the cryptofascist Private Ryan).Opening with a quote by Nietzsche - That which does not kill us makes us stronger - the film eventually grows to becomes a literal translation of your typical mistranslation of Nietzsche (Nietzsche's writings, with their fascist associations, would have negative effects on everyone from Hitler to Rand). So Arnie, a superman whose paternity draws a straight line from Beowulf to Enkidu, Atilla, Alexander and Genseric, is a warrior who embodies Nietzsche's personification of the will to power, the expression of human existence superior to that of the conventional, sentimental, bourgeois moral majority. Nietzsche attacks man's moral principles such that the new superman is a law unto himself. He is autonomous, destined to fulfil his highest dreams, a man who builds himself up into a being beyond the mob. His secret nobility, Nietzsche then says, will be of an aristocratic elevation for which no pattern exists. The film itself ends with Arnie becoming a king, sitting triumphantly on a throne.So Conan may be a barbarian, but he is manliness at its pinnacle, the survival of the fittest, a keen mind with 20-pack abs. And while Conan's mind and flesh are greater than steel, Thulsa Doom (played by James Earl Jones) by contrast is the lowest, the animal, the reptile, that which we have left behind in our rise toward humanness. He is of the gutter, a cannibal, a shape-shifting black man who mocks all with his pretence of being human. Unlike Conan, Thulsa relies on skills not won by hardship, self-discipline and a triumphant will but that are simply emanations of his own reptilian baseness.Beyond all this stuff, the film features some of Milius' best direction. Milius' crew find some superb locations, his crowd scenes are well shot, his set designers cook up a convincing pre Bronze\/Iron Age world, and his injection of blood, gore, sex and nudity &#x96; gratuitous in another picture &#x96; only seem to add to the realism. The film's action sequences are also at times unconventionally structured, wordless, stretched and prolonged, with lots of creeping and slashing set to catchy music. The film's memorable Wagner inspired score was by Basil Poledouris. It, along with Milius' aesthetic, would prove a big influence on Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. One of Poledouris' themes here, titled Theology\/Civilization, has itself become well known in concert circuits.Like Star Wars (also with James Earl Jones as a bad guy), the pg rated fantasy\/mythological film which preceded it, Conan is heavily influenced by Kurosawa and Ford. Milius' R rated blockbuster, however, at times feels like an art film, with huge portions devoid of dialogue, and a monosyllabic hero who can barely speak. Unsurprisingly Milius cast non actors for his three lead roles, Gerry Lopez a champion surfer, Sandahl Bergman &#x96; who plays a kind of Nordic, goddess-warrior &#x96; a dancer and Arnie a body builder. Their dialogue has a similar physicality about it. When a Mongol General yells Conan, what is best in life?, Arnie responds like a caveman To crush your enemies and hear the lamentations of their women! Elsewhere characters spout WW1 battle cries - Do you want to live forever?! - or opine about hacking, slashing and besting their enemies.The film was followed by a worthless sequel. Conan itself has a terrible reputation, but there are no better R-rated sword-and-sorcery movies out there, it's one of the better superhero origin movies, its depictions of religious blood-cults remains creepy, and it's the only good film to contain a shape-shifting mutant snake villain.Upon release the film was attacked for being fascist. Today such films are the norm. Indeed, most cinematic form echoes a totalitarian aesthetic (most humans are unconsciously fascist), designed to lull the viewer into a state of docility, awe and wonder. As cinema and fascism are about actualising fantasy and wilfully surrendering reality, cinema more naturally lends itself to fascist theatre then other art-forms. Milius' next film was Red Dawn, essentially Conan with kids. 8\/10 - Worth one viewing.

The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's Whatta Man. Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.
