I would have to call Fellowship the worst Lord of the Rings movie, but it is not considerably inferior to its sequels.Australian director Peter Jackson brings the timeless sequel to The Hobbit to life. In Middle Earth, Rings were made to different races that gave power. One Ring ruled them all, owned by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron lost the ring in battle and is stubbled upon by a hobbit named Smeagal (Serkis). He goes crazy as the Ring consumes him and becomes a little creature known as Gollum. The Ring leaves him and is found by another hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Holm). When Bilbo leaves, the Ring is no longer left with an owner, so Sauron and his ugly band of Orcs are reawaken and seek the Ring. After wizard, Gandalf (McKellen) discovers the Ring's unspeakable powers, Bilbo's young nephew, Frodo (Wood) becomes the carrier and is joined by a group of warriors to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece. I found each sequel better than the last. But there are some people that are not fans of any of them. Famous film critic and award winning journalist, Richard Roeper, gave this movie thumbs down when he and Roger Ebert reviewed it. he later changed his mind after seeing the other movies, but still. And I know of people that don't like these movies because they found the whole fantasy subject to be too cheesy and unrealistic. Well, that's what a fantasy movie is unrealistic. People that don't like these movies are completely ignorant to movies and storytelling. The whole premise of these movies are long and complex that need lots of explaining. Most people generally don't understand the story, which is why my summary is long. It may follow the general monomyth archetype, but it is full of subplots and backstories that make the plot more complex and original than other monomyth archetypes. But what people love to praise is the general filming. People that don't like the LOTR movies fail to understand how difficult and masterful the movies were made.

After establishing his reputation in Hollywood with Above the Law (1988), Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), and Out for Justice (1991), Steven Seagal's career kicks into another gear with one of the most successful movies of 1992, which also proves to be his best movie at the peak of his career. Also with a good director and good screenwriter, Under Siege brought out the best in Steven Seagal.Steven Seagal (who has also cut off his trademark ponytail for this movie) is a former Navy Seal turned cook Casey Ryback. The movie starts with Ryback continuing to show defiance to most of the chain of command aboard USS Missouri, including Commander Krill (Gary Busey at his villainous best) who is also organising a party on board USS Missouri and has arranged to bring in entertainers via helicopter who are really mercenaries led by the unhinged and unstable William Strannix (Tommy Lee Jones at his over the top best). The main plan is for William Strannix and turncoat Commander Krill to hijack USS Missouri and take all sailors on board hostage in order to steal and sell the tomahawk missiles. The plan almost goes well until Casey Ryback, who was imprisoned in the freezer for assaulting Commander Krill, proves to be the hostages only hope as Ryback manages to escape and takes on the mercenaries himself. Along the way, playboy playmate Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak who is the only actress in this movie) who was brought onto the ship for entertainment value, is roped into helping Casey Ryback along with a small handful of freed sailors.Under Siege is summed up perfectly as Die Hard on a battleship, and it proves to be a very entertaining action feast. There is no shortage of gunfights, martial arts fights, knife fights, stylized deaths, explosions, and cracking one liners that will keep all action fans very content.Steven Seagal has never been better in his prime as Casey Ryback, the former Navy Seal turned cook. He's very likable in this movie and its a shame that this one time box office champion has been reduced to keeping his career alive through non-stop direct-to-video movies in which Seagal is a shadow of his former self. Under Siege will always be remembered as Steven Seagal's best movie to date. Tommy Lee Jones is a quality actor who often appears frequently as serious no-nonsense characters such as The Fugitive and the Men In Black trilogy. Here in Under Siege he is excellently over the top and the wild and unhinged William Strannix.Gary Busey frequently plays bizarre and psychotic characters, and is often one of the go-to actors if they need a crazy villain as evidenced in Lethal Weapon (1987) as the henchman Mr Joshua. As Commander Krill in Under Siege, he shows that he is psychologically unstable, particularly when he appears in drag during the USS Missouri's party. He also makes a great bad guy partnership with Tommy Lee Jones.Erika Eleniak as playboy playmate Jordan Tate who has been caught up in the hijacking show off her assets for one brief scene and then cries, whines and huffs and puffs her way through the movie at first but later sheds her damsel in distress image to help Ryback take down the mercenaries. If I had one criticism of Under Siege is that her character was unnecessary for this movie and the movie could have done without her.Director Andrew Davis reunites with Steven Seagal from his 1988 debut movie Above the Law and he does a great job as a director. Following the success of Under Siege, Andrew Davis would be picked to direct the Harrison Ford\/Tommy Lee Jones blockbuster thriller The Fugitive (1993).There have been so many movies that have attempted to replicate the success of Die Hard (1988) and there have been a variety of mixed results. Under Siege is definitely one of those movies that is a successful blueprint of Die Hard, but also carves out its own success without falling into the trap of being another Die Hard wannabe.

The dust from the flour creates a haze, giving the scene a dreamlike quality. She dances to Amapola, a song comparing a pretty girl to a poppy, the flower from which opium is derived. Together these elements form a constellation of themes running through this movie Debra\/dream\/love\/opium.Debra knows that Noodles is watching her, and she surprises him by opening the door, calling him a roach, and saying, That record's just like Ex-Lax. Every time I put it on, you have to go to the bathroom. It is to be noted that she does not enter the bathroom. Later in the movie, Noodles goes into another bathroom and sits down on the toilet, unlocking the door when he realizes Peggy is coming, so that he can expose himself to her. Unlike Debra, Peggy walks right in, and Noodles spreads his legs. He gets up from the toilet and starts making sexual advances. She says she is about poop in her pants, after which she plops down on the toilet he just got up from, telling him to get out. In fact, throughout the movie there are innumerable references to garbage, excrement, and anal sex. Taken together, all this leads to an opposing constellation of themes Noodles\/reality\/sex\/filth.As the movie jumps back and forth in time, it always seems to heading toward the end of Prohibition. When Noodles and Max first become friends, Prohibition has only recently been the law of the land. Their friendship comes to an end just before the repeal of Prohibition becomes effective, when Noodles believes he has caused the death of Max.Furthermore, Noodles' love for Debra begins around the same time, in the early days of Prohibition, and his dream of marrying her comes to an end when he brutally rapes her. The next day, he sees her depart on a train. He looks at a newspaper, the headline of which announces the end of Prohibition. This is regarded by some critics as a goof, because in subsequent scenes, reference is made to the fact that Prohibition has not ended yet, though it soon will.However, a scene occurring many years later, in 1968, makes it clear that this connection to the end of Prohibition is not intended to be understood realistically. Noodles finds out that Max is still alive. As he is leaving Max's mansion, there is the mysterious scene with the garbage truck, followed by what appears to be a bunch of revelers in a car made in the 1920s, as we hear the song God Bless America. The sounds they make and the background music being played are identical to what we heard at the beginning of the movie, as Eve prepared to enter her apartment. They are the sounds of people celebrating the end of Prohibition. In other words, even in 1968, it still seems to be the end of Prohibition. That is because what happens in 1968 is actually just a dream, a dream that is taking place at the end of Prohibition. One problem with this theory, however, is that Noodles would not know about 1968 technology, like television.In any event, Prohibition is the period during which Max and Noodles were great friends, and when Noodles' love for Debra was still something pure and beautiful. The end of Prohibition is the end of both his friendship with Max and his hopes of marrying Debra, and that is why it takes on such significance in this movie.After Noodles rapes Debra, he tries to forget what he did by spending time in an opium den. This is referred to, but not seen. We do see two scenes of him in the opium den, however, both of them being after he thinks he has killed Max. The first time is at the beginning of the movie, where we see him leaving; the second time is at the end of the movie, where we see him entering. Bookending the movie in this way, with the leaving being seen in the beginning and the arriving at the end, we are encouraged to see the movie as Noodles' opium dream. As his dream takes place at the end of Prohibition, the scenes set in the future are not real, but only part of his wish-fulfilling dream. In that dream, he denies the reality of Max's death, and imagines that it was really Max who betrayed him. Furthermore, by having Debra be Max's lover, and the mother of Max's child, his dream makes it appear that she betrayed Noodles, in a sense, thereby alleviating his guilt over having raped her.When Noodles raped Debra, he dragged her out of the dream\/love\/opium constellation into his own world of reality\/sex\/filth, because he was angry that she was leaving him, instead of marrying him, as he had always hoped. In a similar way, when he convinces himself in his dream that it was really Max who betrayed him, he gets his revenge by dreaming that Max jumps into a garbage truck, where he is ground up and turned into garbage himself.In the final scene, which is in the opium den, we see Noodles get his first drag on the opium pipe. The expression that suddenly appears on his face is one of happiness, but it is only the false kind of happiness that opium provides, a temporary illusion that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

The dust from the flour creates a haze, giving the scene a dreamlike quality. She dances to Amapola, a song comparing a pretty girl to a poppy, the flower from which opium is derived. Together these elements form a constellation of themes running through this movie Debra\/dream\/love\/opium.Debra knows that Noodles is watching her, and she surprises him by opening the door, calling him a roach, and saying, That record's just like Ex-Lax. Every time I put it on, you have to go to the bathroom. It is to be noted that she does not enter the bathroom. Later in the movie, Noodles goes into another bathroom and sits down on the toilet, unlocking the door when he realizes Peggy is coming, so that he can expose himself to her. Unlike Debra, Peggy walks right in, and Noodles spreads his legs. He gets up from the toilet and starts making sexual advances. She says she is about poop in her pants, after which she plops down on the toilet he just got up from, telling him to get out. In fact, throughout the movie there are innumerable references to garbage, excrement, and anal sex. Taken together, all this leads to an opposing constellation of themes Noodles\/reality\/sex\/filth.As the movie jumps back and forth in time, it always seems to heading toward the end of Prohibition. When Noodles and Max first become friends, Prohibition has only recently been the law of the land. Their friendship comes to an end just before the repeal of Prohibition becomes effective, when Noodles believes he has caused the death of Max.Furthermore, Noodles' love for Debra begins around the same time, in the early days of Prohibition, and his dream of marrying her comes to an end when he brutally rapes her. The next day, he sees her depart on a train. He looks at a newspaper, the headline of which announces the end of Prohibition. This is regarded by some critics as a goof, because in subsequent scenes, reference is made to the fact that Prohibition has not ended yet, though it soon will.However, a scene occurring many years later, in 1968, makes it clear that this connection to the end of Prohibition is not intended to be understood realistically. Noodles finds out that Max is still alive. As he is leaving Max's mansion, there is the mysterious scene with the garbage truck, followed by what appears to be a bunch of revelers in a car made in the 1920s, as we hear the song God Bless America. The sounds they make and the background music being played are identical to what we heard at the beginning of the movie, as Eve prepared to enter her apartment. They are the sounds of people celebrating the end of Prohibition. In other words, even in 1968, it still seems to be the end of Prohibition. That is because what happens in 1968 is actually just a dream, a dream that is taking place at the end of Prohibition. One problem with this theory, however, is that Noodles would not know about 1968 technology, like television.In any event, Prohibition is the period during which Max and Noodles were great friends, and when Noodles' love for Debra was still something pure and beautiful. The end of Prohibition is the end of both his friendship with Max and his hopes of marrying Debra, and that is why it takes on such significance in this movie.After Noodles rapes Debra, he tries to forget what he did by spending time in an opium den. This is referred to, but not seen. We do see two scenes of him in the opium den, however, both of them being after he thinks he has killed Max. The first time is at the beginning of the movie, where we see him leaving; the second time is at the end of the movie, where we see him entering. Bookending the movie in this way, with the leaving being seen in the beginning and the arriving at the end, we are encouraged to see the movie as Noodles' opium dream. As his dream takes place at the end of Prohibition, the scenes set in the future are not real, but only part of his wish-fulfilling dream. In that dream, he denies the reality of Max's death, and imagines that it was really Max who betrayed him. Furthermore, by having Debra be Max's lover, and the mother of Max's child, his dream makes it appear that she betrayed Noodles, in a sense, thereby alleviating his guilt over having raped her.When Noodles raped Debra, he dragged her out of the dream\/love\/opium constellation into his own world of reality\/sex\/filth, because he was angry that she was leaving him, instead of marrying him, as he had always hoped. In a similar way, when he convinces himself in his dream that it was really Max who betrayed him, he gets his revenge by dreaming that Max jumps into a garbage truck, where he is ground up and turned into garbage himself.In the final scene, which is in the opium den, we see Noodles get his first drag on the opium pipe. The expression that suddenly appears on his face is one of happiness, but it is only the false kind of happiness that opium provides, a temporary illusion that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. By extension, life itself is just so much filth, and what little happiness we find is like that produced by opium.

Now, Batman Mask of the Phantasm is not only the best Batman animated movie, but it is one of my favorite Batman movies along side with Tim Burton's classic 1989 movie and the awesome trilogy by Christopher Nolan. This movie gets so overlooked, and it deserves to be talked about as it has already become a cult classic. The movie centers around Bruce Wayne's past about as he once had a love one named Andre Beaumont as they were going to spend the rest of their lives together. Sadly, Andre breaks up with Bruce as he now turns himself into the Dark Knight to fight crime. During the present, the mysterious figure known as the Phantasm hunts down some of the crime bosses as Batman is being framed and goes out to find who the Phantasm really is. What can I say? Of course, you know the movie is based on a popular animated TV series which it is without a doubt one of the greatest animated shows about Batman. The movie is definitely larger than life as the movie went into theaters instead of being straight to video as it was originally intended. The movie open to great reviews, but did not perform well at the box-office due to how bad the marketing went. However, it did well for being success as it was first released on both VHS and Laser discs. I have it on VHS, and now I have it on DVD. Unfortunately, it has never been released on Blu-Ray yet which I will get to that later. I thought the animation is incredible as it does add a stylish look into as it represents what the comic books were. Also, the story is perfectly well told for showing the psychology of Bruce Wayne and following the path of becoming Gotham's greatest protector. The direction by Eric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm is absolutely top notch perfect. The voice acting is indeed perfect. Kevin Conroy does a heck of a job to voice both Bruce Wayne and Batman, as well as Mark Hamill for voicing the Joker. Of course, the late Gene Siskel from Siskel&Ebert did not like Hamill's voice, but that is his opinion. At least both Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the movie a two thumbs up which it deserves to. Dana Delany has also done a great job for voicing Bruce Wayne's love interest. The movie is 76 minutes long which it does go by at a very good pace, when it does keep you interest with the story and characters. I do love Shirley Walker's music which it is whether or not one of her greatest achievements. Now, about this movie for not being released on Blu Ray. Like Disney's remake of Mighty Joe Young, the movie does need another release on DVD as well as an official release on Blu Ray; it needs a heck of a restoration for cleaning up the movie's transfer, but no DNR like what Fox did to Predator because if it did then it will loose some of its textures and details. Warner Bros. needs to be faithful on how this movie looks, and maybe have it be supervised by Bruce W. Timm and some of the people that work on this movie. Also, the DVD only has a trailer but no audio commentary from the cast and crew as well as having deleted scenes, still galleries, maybe other trailers and TV spots and most of all a documentary on how the film was when it came to make a Batman animated feature film as it went from straight to video to theaters, and how the marketing turned out to be a huge disappointment but thanks to the fans for having it become a cult film. There is a petition that I found online, which I did sign it and I hope that Warner Bros. release this movie on DVD again, and making an official Blu Ray release with an all new video transfer with sound and an amount of special features. If you aren't interested to sign it, that is fine and I am not going to be upset or anything like that. I just want this to be release as soon as possible. If you are interest, then that will be wonderful. I will put the link on it whether you are interest to sign the petition to have this movie be released on Blu Ray.

In human form, he's actually Larry Talbot, and for the sake of plot expediency he already knows he turns into a wolf when the moon is full. Which it is, during almost the entire movie. After killing a couple of guys, Talbot winds up in a sanatorium run by Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles). Talbot wants desperately to die so he can finally rid himself of this horrible curse, and the old gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) who he knew from The Wolf Man tells him only one guy can really help - Dr. Frankenstein himself.Only the good doctor's dead, dead as a doornail, killed when villagers blew up his castle in Son of Frankenstein. These same villagers are right angry that Talbot and the gypsy even bring up the Frankenstein name, for some reason. Anyway, it's not until the movie's nearly half over that we finally see the grand titular meeting, when Talbot stumbles among the ruins of the castle and finds the monster, encased in a block of ice. (It's in an ice cave, although I'm not sure where all the ice came from.) After thawing out the monster (played by an unrecognizable Bela Lugosi), Talbot searches in vain for the doctor's diary. But luckily, Frankenstein's daughter is still around, the Baroness Elsa (Ilona Massey), and she helps Talbot find the diary. Then it's up to Dr. Mannering to hook up Dr. Frankenstein's old apparatus and - get this - switch the wires so that instead of giving life to the Monster, energy is drained off of both him and Talbot. Things don't go as planned, strange as it may seem.There's plenty of that old Universal atmosphere, although the Monster's lurching gait looks kind of silly. Here's why it's not, though he's lurching because he's blind. He's blind because the mind of Ygor in one of the earlier films was switched with that of the Monster. That's why Frank's Monster knows where some of the doctor's research is and why he lumbers about with his arms outstretched, as if he just needed a hug. Here's another fun fact - when the villagers are carrying a just-killed girl down the street, demanding justice, they're all carrying torches. Torches that are, yes, unlit. Even when they're searching the forest for the Wolf Man, the torches are unlit. These are not smart villagers.Some familiar Universal horror names are here, too. Lionel Atwill plays the mayor; Dwight Frye is one of the villagers. Martha Vickers, who was in the Bogie classic The Big Sleep a few years later, has an uncredited role, as does Jeff Corey.I saw this movie as part of an interactive event at the AFI Silver Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, hosted by Count Gore de Vol. For these showings, the Count stops the movies a couple of times in order to play some trivia or other games, with fabulous prizes. The Count is always good for a hammy, light-hearted performance. Always a treat.The film itself isn't anything to write home about, unless you're really into the continuity thing. The timelines of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein movies don't neatly dovetail, but close enough for government work, as they say.

The timelines of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein movies don't neatly dovetail, but close enough for government work, as they say. Still a cool movie, made all the better by Count Gore de Vol. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 February 2015","score":"","review":" Minelli's great master piece is undoubtedly The Band Wagon. Although it tells the commonplace story of a show and the plot is classic, that is to have a project for a show, the difficulties and success of life, Vicente Minnelli has succeeded in creating a movie of fine psychological analysis, prompting the spectator to think about society. Thus the Director responds well to those who have severely criticized musicals. Another element which gives particular value to this movie is the ballet Girl Hunt. Inspired by detective movies, Minnelli also has a lot of humor, humanity and poetry. It is a well stylized ballet. This belongs to a category of movies without violence and perhaps without cruelty. These days we no longer see musicals of this quality and the opportunity to see such masterpieces as The Band Wagon in more cinemas would be welcomed.

We meet Forrest Gump, a slow man perfectly portrayed by Tom Hanks, at the beginning of the film when he introduces himself to the first person who sits next to him on a bench at a bus stop. It is from this point that we begin the journey of his life starting with his philosophical mother Mrs. Gump played by Sally Fields and his unfortunate need for leg braces. From here Forrest takes the bus to school for the first time and we are introduced to his childhood friend and love at first sight, Jenny Curran played by Robin Wright. In college, Jenny and Forrest go their separate ways. Throughout Forrest Gump's life he experiences and causes many historical moments such as inspiring Elvis Presley's dance moves, meeting multiple presidents, and uncovering the Watergate Scandal. Although, these are monumental experiences, it seems he is somehow always drawn back to Jenny. In the film, they are brought back together several times. A significant time being when Forrest loses his mother and Jenny stays with him. The morning after their night together, she once again leaves him. In the end, we are brought back to Forrest Gump, the narrator, in present day looking for Jenny in response to a letter she sent him. The result of their one night together, left them with a son, Forrest played by Haley Joel Osment. Jenny and Forrest Gump are finally united and get married before she dies of an unknown virus. The film ends perfectly on a scene much like the one where Forrest first met Jenny, but with Little Forrest getting on the bus for school for his very first time.The theme of this film seems to be torn between drama and comedy. However, the main focus is the endurance and true love that Forrest has for Jenny. Although, he is always there for her when she needs him, she always ends up leaving him and going her own way. This fact does not seem to deter his love for her and every time she comes back into his life, he embraces it.A scene that reinforces this unbreakable love that Forrest has for Jenny is when they are reunited again in Washington. They are having a conversation before Jenny leaves him once again, which she has done multiple times before this scene. Even though she is preparing to leave him again, Forrest gives her his medal of honor and tells her that the reason he is good to her is because she is his girl. And then she was gone from his life again.Another film that is quite a different story but relates to the endurance of true love is The Notebook. In this film a young man tries his hardest to be with a young woman, before they are separated. Years later they are brought back together, but she is with another man. When they finally end up with one another she ends up with Alzheimer's. He spends the remaining days of their lives together reading to her and trying to bring her back to him.Music has a way of affecting our emotional response to a film. In Forrest Gump the use of music is very effective especially when changing scenes. When Jenny hitches a ride with a stranger instead of staying with Forrest, the musical score is soft and almost sad. However, the musical score playing when they see each other again in Washington is blissful and romantic. Another technique used in this film is voice-over narration. This narration done by Forrest emphasizes his thoughts and feelings of Jenny even though she is absent from a majority of the film. The use of this narration conveys his slow point of view on his life and the things that happened in it, but also speeds the passage of time along. The film itself is already a little longer than necessary, so voice-over used for narration is important in moving the film along at a good pace but creating an impact on his way of thinking.Overall, this film holds your interest in its creativity and alterations of historical events. The intermittent connection of Forrest and Jenny's lives surpasses decades. In the end, even though Jenny has an unknown virus, Forrest marries her and takes care of her until death do they part. This ultimately paints the picture of the true love that Forrest had for Jenny and how it endured the test of time.

There was no transition from loving husband to creepy guy he just was a creepy guy - which kind of destroyed the film.

Hopkins isn't doing a crazed dictator as usual but a needy outsider. I'm not sure about the constant back and forth between the time periods. The later time period adds very little to the movie.

In a trip she and one rich man fall in love and they decide to marry. When they are returning to the main house of the man she understands that he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a boating accident the year before. And in that the mystery starts.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was really nice written but also for the direction of it which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock and his contribution in the success of this movie was really obvious. We can understand in many scenes the tips and the guidance that Alfred Hitchcock gave to the actors on how to play, to show etc. About the interpretation I have to say that I loved the interpretation of Joan Fontaine who played as Mrs. de Winter and also the interpretation of Laurence Olivier who played as 'Maxim' de Winter. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Judith Anderson's who played as Mrs. Danvers and I believe that she was great on her part. Another important fact that I have to mention is that this movie did not tire me even a little and kept me in tense in the whole duration of it, something that I believe is extremely important for a mystery movie.Lastly I believe that Rebecca is a nice mystery movie which combines really well this mystery with the romance between the couple and the result that comes out from it is the best. I also think that this movie is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock and I strongly recommend it to everyone because it's a must see movie.

When they are returning to the main house of the man she understands that he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a boating accident the year before. And in that the mystery starts.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was really nice written but also for the direction of it which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock and his contribution in the success of this movie was really obvious. We can understand in many scenes the tips and the guidance that Alfred Hitchcock gave to the actors on how to play, to show etc. About the interpretation I have to say that I loved the interpretation of Joan Fontaine who played as Mrs. de Winter and also the interpretation of Laurence Olivier who played as 'Maxim' de Winter. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Judith Anderson's who played as Mrs. Danvers and I believe that she was great on her part. Another important fact that I have to mention is that this movie did not tire me even a little and kept me in tense in the whole duration of it, something that I believe is extremely important for a mystery movie.Lastly I believe that Rebecca is a nice mystery movie which combines really well this mystery with the romance between the couple and the result that comes out from it is the best. I also think that this movie is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock and I strongly recommend it to everyone because it's a must see movie.

It's such a shame that this film doesn't get much star treatment as it deserves because it is such a good film.The story centers around Basil of Baker Street (Voiced by Barrie Ingham) who is hired by Olivia Flaversham (Voiced by Susanne Pollatschek)to help find her father Hiram Flaversham (Voiced by Alan Young) Basil along with Dr.David Q.Dawson (Voiced by Val Bettin) begin the investigation against Professor Ratigan (Voiced by Vincent Price) who is the criminal mind behind the kidnapping of Olivia's father. This film is what I best know Vincent Price for and listening to performance in the film he was the right choice to voiced Professor Ratigan. Barrie Ingham sold the role of Basil very well his performance was like seeing a stage actor during a play he did a very good job as the Greatest Detective of Mousedom. The Great Mouse Detective had a lot going for it and of course it being a Disney animated film you would expect nothing less.Animation for this film is so well done with great background, the fog effect really helps tell the story of the film. And the water effects are very detail as well. Lighting and thunder is very well time.The Characters are very well animated and when you watch the film it feels like you're watching a play like the animators watch each actor during the recording sessions.The voice acting is very well done and the cast helps sold the story with their performances.The music is so well done I love the score that was written for the film it is some of the best work ever in animation. Another reason to watch the film because of the music helps sold the story of the film and can build up the next scene. The setting for each scene is like the classic detective story of Sherlock Holmes and all the famous detectives in fiction.The Great Mouse Detective is one of Disney's most underrated films in their collection of animated films but once you watch the film you will appreciate the story telling and animation along with clever voice acting with strong performances by Barrie and Vincent.The whole family will enjoy this classic film and it's one of my favorites as well.Do yourself a favor and check out this classic film.I give The Great Mouse Detective an 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the most underrated films from Disney that never got the respect it deserves.The Great Mouse Detective is like Sherlock Holmes but as a mouse, making him the greatest detective of all moused om.
