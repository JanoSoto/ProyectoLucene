But as film history will tell us, a good premise does not make a good movie unless the filmmakers do unique and interesting things with it. Does Speed have what it takes? Absolutely.When it comes to action\/adventure movies that expand on a single premise, there's no one better than Jan de Bont. Considering where his career is right now, that surprising, since the man who gave us masterpieces such as this and Twister is being passed over for hacks and wannabees such as Simon West and other cheap posers that don't know what they're doing. de Bont never wastes a moment, and that keeps the pace up. Speed is relentless, especially in this respect. The visuals are first-rate, and except for one minor exception, they surpass today's (if only because they are real, or the CGI isn't so cheap it's obvious).The acting is great as well. There are few actors as consistently wooden as Keanu Reeves (save for Luke Wilson). But I guess every actor has his day (Reeves has three this, The Devil's Advocate and The Matrix). Granted, the role doesn't require much range, but Reeves creates a likable and sympathetic hero (California cool included). Dennis Hopper is a terrific villain, rivalling Alan Rickman in Die Hard, though Hopper is more psychotic, or in his own words, eccentric. Also noteworthy is the terrifically lovable Sandra Bullock who uses her comic aptitude to great effect, and she also allows herself to be vulnerable, which makes her more three-dimensional.Like in de Bont's later film, Twister, composer Mark Macina creates a memorable theme that complements the film to perfection.Flaws aren't really a problem here (I dare anyone to name an action movie that hasn't given into temptation and gone over the top at least a little). Yes it recycles one of the twists that it used, but it still works, so I can't really fault it.Finally here's a movie that lives up to its premise and its title.

I don't know why Mariah thought this was a good idea, it's just so typical. Now granted, I do believe this was a bad movie, but as far as bottom 100 goes... I don't think it was that extremely bad, it's better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like In the Cut.

But when a local DJ, Dice, hears Billie's voice, he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world.

One simply canNOT refer to Bad scenes in a Badly scripted Bad Movie by a Bad Director to explain why the actor was not good to play his character. I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne\/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular\/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognise you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one cannot hide behind a costume. Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne\/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman\/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton.

Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton. CLOONEY As for 'Batman & Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman\/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records\/sources of that B&R-crap.My Ranking 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton. Clooney? Who Clooney?AS for this movie, I don't understand why people call this movie 'Dark'. This movie is Bad because it is TOO dark. Totally unwatchable \/ unenjoyable for children. On the contrary, the Penguin here, would give the innocent children, traumas for life. Don't ever show this movie to your children. Penguin is a seriously (pun intended) a horror crap here. Too Hideous, No Fun. And what's the use of the movie being Dark when you have No Character Development here. Penguin is a ridiculous villain and they have not shown even a single glimpse of his childhood, that is how the Penguins nurture him which is utterly impossible even in comics\/fantasy, especially if they portray the movie and the Penguin as 'serious' and 'dark'. But yes, De Vito has been a good obedient actor here and did what he was told to do efficiently.(P.S. As for the Comparison between those 'Batmen' Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2 Judgement Day' goes - 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.) ","genre":"Action"},{"date":"24 August 2008","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" It is a very difficult movie to review.

After all if the original is perfection, why not keep it that way? Once again, it's just interesting.Every choice Gus van Sant is motivated by a reason the use of colour, the shot by shot, the few details he changed and those he kept, the use of technology that did not exist at the time and the decision to keep the same technology for some scenes when better technologies now exist. There is a reason for every single one of those decisions and these reasons are neither good or bad, they're just reasons. I think we just need to admit Gus Van Sant wanted to have fun remaking Psycho and I'm sure he had a blast. So insofar, this is a perfectly successful movie.So sit back and enjoy.

Why is everyone always picking on him???? What does he owe money for??? and the STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY??? Are you serious????I can't believe this movie was ever made. What an abomination. A complete disgrace of the Garbage Pail Kids cards, and of movies as well!

Kim Hunter and Roddy Mcdowell both star in this film, unlike in Beneath the planet of the apes when Mcdowell was not in the film and Hunter did not play a major part.This film is similar to the original, but this time it is Cornelius, Zira, and Milo(another chimpanzee scientist) who travel through time to a world where humans rule. There is much humor as Cornelius and Zira learn about earth and its greatness. Cornelius learns that human women are Very human and ZIra learns the pleasures of alcohol.However the humor in the first half of the film turns to drama and suspense as the chimpanzees reveal a little too much information about the future. Forced to flee for their lives they must escape from the humans who now want them dead.I really like this film, it is the second best in the series in my opinion. Just having Hunter and Mcdowell together again for the first time since the first film is great, you can really see the chemistry. I think that Roddy Mcdowell may be the most under rated actor ever. One thing that I must say though, the ending may not sit well with you. I admit that some endings to movies are sad and that they must be in order to stress a point. I do not want to give too much away but I am warning you that some parts near the end may make you want to cry, it happened to me.Overall this is easily the second best of the series. Having Mcdowell back as Cornelius was awesome and you can see why he was so instrumental to the success of the series. I would recommend this film to everyone.

It truly is a science picture masterpiece and one of the greatest films to ever be made. Sadly, Beneath is not nearly as good for various reasons.Reason number one, Charlton Hestons lack of screen time. I know that he did not want to be in this film. However seeing as how the first film ended, it would have been a great idea to have Heston play a large role in Beneath as well. Instead of having Heston play the major role, James Franciscus does. Franciscus performs OK, but he just is not Heston.Reason number two. Roddy Mcdowells absence from the film. Mcdowell was a major reason for the success of the entire franchise of Planet of the Apes. They try to substitute another actor to play the part of Cornelius, but it is not the same. Mcdowell starred in all of the other films and without him in this film you can see that something is missing.To conclude, this film just is not nearly as good as the original. Franciscus is not as good a leading actor as Heston. Mcdowell not being in the movie at all is a big disappointment. I would recommend seeing this movie if you really liked the first one, just do not expect it to be nearly as good. There are some great action scenes in Beneath.
