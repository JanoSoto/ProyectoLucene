As a kid, this was an amazing film; hilarious, thrilling, engaging and definitely on par with Disney's best. Coming back to it after so long and little has changed. However, there were a few things that detracted my present experience from that of my childhood. The first half of the film is overall a little on the boring side. Other than the unveiling of Robin Williams' show stopping Genie, the music, visuals and Jafar, the rest of characters weren't as compelling as i remember. The main protagonists and their romantic endeavour isn't the most magical in Disney's history (compared to say Lady and the Tramp it's desperately shallow), which is a shame since they take up most of the plot. Jasmine is still gorgeous with a fiery personality trying to break free of a restrained life, but Aladdin is quite a standard underdog, his plight not really drawing great sympathy, despite the fact he's a swell guy and all with a heart of gold. So really, Jasmine's attraction to him comes of quite same old trick sort of thing, both individuals having the same trapped feeling in life that brings them together.Saying that, A Whole New World is still a breathtaking number, and that entire scene at least gives the romantic plot a more than satisfactory feeling. And that's Aladdin's key. It's last half is fabulous. From the transformation of Aladdin into Prince Ali to the very end, it's hard to find a glaring fault. For some reason everything just comes together. You care for the protagonists, Jafar just keeps getting more evil, and the animation is the definition of top draw (always is). In the end you just know you've seen something great and you don't care how it happened but your glad it did, like you've really been in a whole new world for an hour and a half (almost). The slowish first half just dissolves into memory, until you watch it again (you will), and once again, the second half will drag you back into it all and you'll love it even more.It's also worth noting that the one absolute constant in all of this is the Genie. Once he appears with the classic Friend Like Me, every scene he's in comes alive due to Williams' blinding comic momentum, plus the animators' endlessly imaginative play. He's definitely the most engaging, sympathetic character in the film and you really feel for him and his own wish to be free of the lamp.Aladdin is, and always will be, a Disney classic in my books. It's difficult to pinpoint how it does it, but it just does. A shining testament of what the company was and still is capable of when they really put their soul and time into something they really want to do, instead of something they think they need to do, which sadly seems to be to keep the company on it's feet so they can make even more money. There was a time when art, entertainment and dreams trumped everything else, the reason why Disney's Folly as it was dismissively called so long ago, became the pioneer in one of cinema's most magical medias. That was the idea that gave birth to films like this and a whole lot of others they did themselves (right up to as recently as Tarzan and Lilo & Stitch), plus the gems that everyone else have achieved. Lets hope the company gets through this dry spell and returns for another go round. They did it before, they can do it again.

According to this article, raising objections to this act is akin to valuing property over the life of a black man.Which is an asinine assumption. I had a problem with that scene - not because I don't value the life of a black man, but because there's a disconnect between the two things the killing of Radio Raheem by the cops, and the destruction of Sal's Pizzeria by the angry people of the neighborhood. We are supposed to understand that their anger over the murder of Radio Raheem justifies their taking their aggression out on Sal - who didn't cause Radio Raheem to die.Spike Lee has trouble connecting the dots between Radio Raheem's murder, Mookie's throwing of the trash can through the window, and the riot. Throughout the movie, he depicts the neighborhood as being comprised of different people who are generally good. They all eat at Sal's, and like him to one degree or another. The trouble comes when one member of the neighborhood tries to get a boycott of Sal's going because there are no pictures of black people on the wall - a justifiable desire, but ultimately, how important is it? The neighborhood likes Sal to the point where he can't get anyone to join him.That is, until he finds Radio Raheem. Along with a (presumably) mentally challenged person, they confront Sal - antagonistically. I got the feeling, while watching the film, that we (the viewers) were supposed to understand their anger, and at least partially agree with it. This is where the movie fails for me - I didn't agree with it, and thought their complaints were too trivial to really care about.Mookie, who throughout the movie had been a bit of a peacemaker between Sal and the boycott, eventually turns on his employer. Why? While Radio Raheem, et al are confronting Sal, a fight breaks out. Sal destroys Raheem's radio (which was being played purposefully loud), causing Raheem to physically attack Sal. The police are called, and (while trying to subdue Raheem) kill him. The police kick him once he's dead (in case you hadn't gotten the message that police love killing black men - even when they don't have to).Naturally, the neighborhood riots, and burns down Sal's. That's the movie, in a nutshell. This movie fails, for me, because there's no punishment for the black people who riot - destroying the pizzeria they loved and the life of a man they used to like. It's just another day in the life of black people. Mookie and Sal have a meeting towards the end of the movie - but Sal doesn't really seem to angry. I guess he learned his lesson, which, presumably, is that he was a racist white man who brought it on himself.Seriously, though. The only people who lose anything are Radio Raheem (his life), and Sal and sons. Considering that Sal and his sons are the only white people in the movie (excluding the racist, violent cops, or the fireman who turn fire hoses on the rioters - an image we all associate with real-life evil white oppression), the film seems to favor one side over another. Namely, it favors blacks over whites.The message I get from this movie is that whites are racist (even if some are liked), and that blacks should handle this racism better (maybe - though I guess that depends on which quote you favor at the end). And I don't think Spike Lee had this message in mind when he made the film - which is why I think it fails.For a more intelligent handling of racism, I suggest the movie Crash. Racism in this movie isn't one-sided. Racism is shown to be deeply ingrained in all of us. Racism is not something that only evil white cops or the KKK have, it's something everyone in our society deals with. Good people are racist, too - that's why it's so horrible. It's insidious.I don't know if the thought ever crossed Spike Lee's mind while making this film, that black people are racist just as much as white people. Because only the white characters in this film are shown as racist. The white people dislike the black people, here, simply because of their skin. The John Turtorro character says not to trust them. The black people, however, are shown as having justified anger (at least in their own minds) at the white characters. Whether it be because there are no pictures of famous black people on the wall, or because Radio Raheem was murdered by the police, or because Sal did like Raheem's music, or because, when Sal was fighting with Raheem, he used the n----- word (which said, in case you hadn't gotten the message, that Sal really was racist).Ultimately, this film is good for what it is. But, unless you're black, you'll have trouble following all of it. I'm not black, and thought the film was one-sided. It didn't get into the motivations as much as Lee wanted, because the ultimate goal of this film was to show (and understand) a riot over some black men being chased out of a pizzeria by some white people (this film was inspired by a real event of this kind). The deck was stacked against the white characters from the beginning.
