I mean Harris has only known his partner for a few hours at the most while the other cops don`t know him at all so why would they trust Hoyt to keep his mouth shut ?

On the night of his arrival, he's taken to the Moulin Rouge, a wild nightclub that caters to the rich and powerful.  There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) the Sparkling Diamond and star of the Moulin Rouge.  Then in a twist of events, Christian lands a job at the Moulin Rouge, as the writer of Spectacular Spectacular. From the first night they meet, sparks fly between Christian and Satine, and by the time rehearsals really start you can tell this isn't just a small fling, it's deep meanful love. Now, I saw this movie the first weekend it came out in theatres, and that was two years ago (2001).  Since then I have seen it probably about 20 times (don't ask why I'm only writing a comment now).  Everything about this movie is brilliant, the costumes, the sets, the music and the story.  But the best thing is the acting.  The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is phenomenal, they really sell the fact that they are in love through their singing and emotional performances. Another amazing thing is the way the two actors take their characters and help them grown up through out the coarse of the movie. We first see Ewan as the innocent and naive Christian who arrives in Paris with his idealistic youthful ideas of love, but towards the end of the film he changes Christian into a more mature man who has been scarred by losing something he loved very dearly, he makes you really feel the pain he's in. Nicole makes Satine an ambitious and do-anything-it-takes star who has men melting at her feet at the beginning of the movie, but then turns her into this vulnerable and desperate (and dying) woman who just wants to be loved. Another thing that I love about this film is how the whole cast (not just Ewan and Nicole) transmit on to the screen how much fun they all had making this movie. Which makes it even more enjoyable to watch. I know that this kind of movie doesn't appeal to everyone, but I guarantee that if you were to give it a try and sit through some of the more weirder parts, by the end of the it you'll be saying Now that was a good movie.

However, it is unfair to compare this to the original and not give it a chance on its own merits. I was 11 when I saw Jaws and 14 when I saw Jaws 2. I knew it had been made mostly because the original was so successful, but even at 14 I wanted to see it in part at least, for what it might have to offer. I was not disappointed. Granted, it was not directed by Spielberg, but I think Jeannot Swarc did a more than competent job. Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gay and Murray Hamilton reprise their roles and give very good performances, as good as in the original film. I thought the shark effects were good. The shark does not look fake. I think considering the technology available at the time, the shark looks pretty darn real.SPOILER WARNING If you have not seen Jaws 2 you may not want to read any further, as I discuss some scenes that reveal certain plot details.Maybe they show the shark a little more than Spielberg did, perhaps a bit too much, but the scenes where the shark attacks are well staged and convincing. The water-skiing scene is terrifying; makes you think about skiing on the ocean! Even the much debated helicopter scene. It was well staged and it's pretty scary. I don't think it's implausible with a shark that big, but that's all I will say about that. I was not bothered by the focus being on Chief Brody's sons and their friends going out on sailboats during most of the movie's second half. What's wrong with that? There is a sort of rivalry between Murray Hamilton's son in the film, Larry Vaughn Jr, and Mike Brody that I thought was interesting and at least rings true. Larry is the rich mayor's son; Mike is the Chief of Police's son who has to work during the summer; both are young, good looking kids, interested in the same pretty girls. The scenes with the boats play into that. (This rivalry was also present, albeit to a greater extent, in the novel which came out at the same time as the movie.) Ok, so maybe Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are not here, but remember that Shaw's character was killed; Dreyfuss probably had better things to do after winning his Oscar for Goodbye Girl, or perhaps simply wasn't interested, but I'm thinking, maybe it would be too easy to just bring the Dreyfuss character back. I think it makes at least some sense that this time Brody is on his own. At least he has some idea of what he's dealing with. As far as the Jaws movies that followed this one, all I can say is, if someone thinks Jaws 2 isn't at least worth watching (and it is a lot more than just worth watching! ), you should see the other ones (At your own risk!); both Jaws III and Jaws 4 are awful (Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong  were pretty much the only good things about Jaws 3, and even so their roles were badly written. Quaid should have passed on that one and Bess Armstrong probably ruined her carreer. Michael Cane missed picking up his first Oscar in person because he was filming Jaws 4. He was wasted in that film. He should have gone to the Oscars, finished the film, and fired his agent.). Fair warning. Jaws 2 may not be the greatest sequel ever made, but like Damien Omen II, it is a worthy sequel to a classic film; it has a good cast, good performances, it is well made, it is entertaining, and yes, very scary. I must say also that I loved the original tag line just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.... That was simply brilliant!! Since I last saw this film on widescreen laserdisc, which at least restored the aspect ratio, Jaws 2 has been released on DVD. I waited about a year or so and just recently bought it. I must say the film looks great, even if the sound is the original mono, and the bonus materials are superb!! I particularly liked the two making of documentaries and the worn-looking, nostalgia inducing theatrical trailers. I also recommend reading the novel, if you can find it. As a film collector, I am more than happy to include this film in my library next to its classic predecessor.

But I'm a great fan of James M. Cain's pulp crime classic 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', and this superb retelling of it fascinated me from beginning to end. A few crucial plot points are changed, an interesting supporting character (The Spaniard) has been added, and the movie has a very different tone from what Cain fans might expect.  The original novella, and the subsequent Hollywood versions of it (in '46 and '81) are thrillers, 'Ossessione' isn't. It's more of a story of a doomed love affair. The basic plot is the same - a drifter has a passionate fling with an unhappily married woman and helps her murder her husband - but Visconti approaches the material in a very different manner. The movie is brilliantly filmed, and the acting by the three leads are first rate. You really get a genuine insight into 1940s Italian working class life. The character of The Spaniard adds an interesting touch to the story with a possible homosexual relationship between Gino and himself. It's very subtle but it's there if you look. I thought making Giovanna pretty but not a complete bombshell like Lana Turner added to the realism and credibility of the story. I also was impressed by the small role played by the dancer\/part time prostitute Gino buys an ice cream for towards the end of the picture. She doesn't get much screen time sadly, but she is really wonderful.  The movie is surprisingly frank for the time and period (Mussolini's Italy), much more realistic and earthy than Hollywood movies of the same period. If you are looking for a straight forward thriller then the Lana Turner\/John Garfield version of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is probably the better place to start, but if you want to see a brilliant drama then this is the superior movie in my opinion.

I admit that only discovering this little movie only months before the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded was due to come out. I rented the DVD not knowing what to expect. I knew the storyline but nothing too deep other than the most basic of information. I sat through the film's 136 minute running time, watching carefully. After the movie, I took the DVD out of my player, put it in it's case and walked out the door, remembering absolutely nothing. Ouch.The Matrix is a science fiction tale of a computer program writer called Thomas Anderson AKA Neo (Keanu Reeves), who learns from a band of rebels that the world he lives in is a digital simulation. The world he sees, the world we see is in fact a virtual reality created by an entire race of machines to keep humans under control and giving those machines energy for them to survive. After learning the truth from the mysterious man known as Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and leather-clad, ass-kicker Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo is released from the virtual prison known as the Matrix and finally witnesses the real world. But there's something more to Neo than meets the eye Is he possibly the One, the only person in all of mankind that can destroy the Matrix and free the human race? The answer? Probably.The main source of entertainment in this movie are the fight scenes, which zip by like a six-year-old having a sugar rush. I admit that these fight scenes are spectacular, crafted with the most seamless special effects I have ever seen. There is a particularly impressive hand-to-hand fight between Keanu Reeves and Australian actor Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings) in a subway and even a more impressive one between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne in the first hour of the film, taking place in an old dojo. It was hard to believe that Keanu performed all of his fight scenes himself, or that he had the brains to remember the moves! Sure, pretty-looking fight scenes are abound in this film but that's where my investment in this film stopped dead.The Matrix's fatal flaw is that there is not one likable or colorful character in all of the film's bloated 136 minutes. The only character that comes even remotely close to being likable is Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity. All other characters are ultimately forgettable and not really worth caring about. Some characters just drove me out of my mind! I found most of the crew of the Nebachanezzar annoying and pointless. What's worse is that most of them have the worst dialogue of the whole movie. Digital pimp hard at work! Are the Wachowski's eighteen or something? I know this movie is marketed to teenagers as something cool. In fact, I'm only fifteen years old and I didn't think the movie was all that cool. Instead of cool I found it cliched, silly and lame. I admit, Keanu Reeves' character was decent and somewhat interesting considering the fact he didn't look like he could figure out what everyone is saying. You know a main character is not worthing giving a damn about when everyone around him must constantly explain things to him, often slowly. Actually, I found the whole movie to merely being an introduction to this concept. There WAS no story.But alas, there is a saving grace and that is the new world unraveling before our very eyes, often with the most spectacular visual effects. They're not much of filmmakers, but the Wachowski's are certainly digital wizards, able to magically create dreams out of the latest of technology. The CGI used in the real world is particularly impressive, probably more impressive than most things out of that other big-budget release of 1999, called a little something like Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace. But I found the Phantom Menace much more entertaining! Like Star Wars, there is never really a moment in this movie that special effects are not used. Sure, these special effects are great to look at, but a movie should not be reliant on special effects. That's why most indie films end up being some of the best movies of all time. They are about writing, directing and acting. Films like The Matrix are only made to show out the latest technology. Now make no mistake, I didn't watch this film expecting it to take home the Best Picture award from the Academy, but that's doesn't stop it from being disappointing.Many people claim this film for being deep yet I see nothing deep about it at all. There is no spoon. Yeah, I already remember Laurence Fishburne's character blabbing about that earlier in the film for immense amounts of time. And I hear Reloaded is just one big Philosophy 101 lesson! The philosophy found in this movie I think is trying to be subtle but in the end simply bogs the film down. I commend the Wachowskis for trying to take action films to another level, but maybe that just won't ever happen. The only movie that ever actually came close to being something more was 1991's Terminator 2 Judgement Day, which happens to be a much better movie than The Matrix, action film or not. And don't give me that You just didn't understand it! crap, because I understood the whole thing perfectly and believe me, there is nothing special about it.I think the real thing that made The Matrix loved by millions of viewers is that it glorifies computer geeks and school nerds. The real problem with me is that I'm neither of those things. I guess that's why it never touched me, or the story just never moved me. Sure the action scenes are spectacular and the special effects are great to look at, but in my opinion, special effects should not drive the story. It should be the other way around. Combine that with one-dimensional characters and uninspired dialogue, there is nothing here to entertain me. A movie can be the greatest movie of all time but if it doesn't entertain, it does nothing for me. That's exactly the definition I would give The Matrix.

This is it in a nutshellThe WeaponsThe thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticeable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.The SniperThe sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.The UniformsThe field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticeably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.The Battle ScenesEvery one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less gory than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompson's was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder\/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.The CharactersThis is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the war. These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the Green Berets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch They Were Expendable. To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.The PlotI could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.What I did likeThe cinematography was superb. The sound was great. It was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire I have heard on film to date. Still, this wasn't consistent throughout. The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people. Real war is much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing.

The reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date. I think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people. Real war is much worse than Spielberg shows. I like the fact that in spite of what Spielberg's political agenda may have been, people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free. That is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing.

This is it in a nutshellThe WeaponsThe thing I noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used. It was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear. Especially noticeable were the Garands. Very old, aged, wood for instance. For as much money as they spent on the film, they could have done better.The SniperThe sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations. The scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didn't make it. Most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character. Shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts. I have never seen any trained shooter operate like this.The UniformsThe field jackets were a more faded color of OD than the originals. I know this is nit picking, but I had one of these when I was a kid - 82nd Airborne too - and the color was noticeably brighter. Also, everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insignia.The Battle ScenesEvery one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked. One guy did say there was not that much blood in real life (the sand absorbed it). Some others I have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far. But comparing it with the real stuff I have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle; and photos and film done at the time, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less gory than real life. For me, the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nest.The scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving Germans who were then hosed down by two GI's with Thompson's was over the top, credibility wise. Gimme a break. This film is still Hollywood enough that the valiant American soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive; the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity. All of the Germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance; all fall to one-shot stops and there are no heroes, no gritty determination on the part of any of the Germans except for the guy with the bayonet. There were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladder\/bowel emptying phenomenon ... I guess Hollywood wasn't quite ready for (oops) that. How many movies have you seen *that* in... one that I can recall ... perhaps no more ... they did so good with the sound, too bad they couldn't recreate the stench.The CharactersThis is what bugged me the most. I grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of WWII combat vets. My dad, a disabled Navy vet, moved the family to one of those giant new GI housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area. I knew these men; Army, Air Corps, Navy, Marines. What they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended. VFW and DOD union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the war. These men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why. They harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies. In this regard, this film did these men a great disservice; it made them look weak and cloying by comparison. The real men were the genuine article. Not fearless or supermen either, but their attitude was entirely different, their vocabulary was different, their demeanor was different. The guys in the hastily contrived unit the Hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced Rangers. These were the real meat-eaters of the Army in WWII - the fore-runners of the Green Berets and, as such, were even less likely to act in the way the film showed. These groups were some real tough S.O.B.'s. To top it off, everyone's haircuts were not period. If you want to see something closer to the real deal, catch They Were Expendable. To these performances, add lots of very creative profanity.The PlotI could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission. Then, the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic (more Hollywood). I could have done a better plot in my sleep. The disobedience Ryan showed to the stated orders would not have happened. In real life he would have been ordered by the Cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been that.What I did likeThe cinematography was superb. The sound was great.

The idea was interesting and unique.  I will admit that some of the acting was lame and some things were rather overdone but it was still a good watch. The sets were amazing (SPOILERS?)especially when we were in Carl's mind.  Talk about creepy.  I can't tell you how much I was affected by some of what I saw. The 'Gallery of Dolls' (as I call it)and the scene with the purple cloth were some of my favorites. (SPOILERS OVER) I have to say though, that the main reason I got this film was Vincent D'Onofrio.  He's an amazing actor and even though the movie wasn't the best, his performance certainly was.(CAUTION, *SPOILERS*) In fact, I think that the best scene was the one at the bathtub when Carl talks about his first kill, the baptism thing and his father.  It was a very disturbing scene. I loved the spare gloomy set, the odd intercutting, and above all, Vincent's acting. (END OF SPOILERS)All in all, it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it's well worth watching if you're into movies like The Silence of the Lambs.
