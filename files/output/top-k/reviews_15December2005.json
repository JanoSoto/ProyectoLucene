On the one hand you can't help but like his reliance upon the florescent light, lighting in general, and his slow set-work, set-piece films. And this is a film filled with fine leading and character actors, as well, quite obviously. And the latter alone often makes a film. So I want to dislike Kubrick. But I keep coming back to the DVDs, appreciating one or two things I had not previously. Kubrick, the late Kubrick, cannot be dismissed.On the other hand, having said that, Kubrickism is also infantilism, adolescent fixations upon sex. It's crude jokes. Kubrick is the father, and it's not too much of a stretch to say, of Beavis and Butthead, and South Park (the Comedy Central mushmouth voice animation with cutouts). It's said that 'theater people' never really mature. They don't grow up.Well, seen in that way, Strangelove is more a play-acted cartoon, like some FOX comedy of the 1990s. It's more farce than drama. 'Black comedy'? It doesn't come up to that. I don't think Kubrick intended such. And that was his mistake. It's because the farce is so cartoonish it overwhelms the drama. Drama there is. The set-piece interior of the B52 is striking, particularly for the era and the real cold war and desire to keep such military secrets. Pickens and the rest play it straight, mostly. So the Dallas\/Vegas joke almost brings a laugh, in that context, but only because the tone is serious. Toe to toe with the Ruskies, like other absurd phrases, passed into the popular banter for decades afterward. There is suspense, action, and fear. These scenes make the film, and perhaps in spite of the farce and forced comedy ending.Because back at the base rooms, even what subtlety is absent. It's nothing but madness at the AF base with the 'funny' name, and the spinning tape drives. Peter Sellers has a string in his leg. A what? You mean to threaten a brother officer, he asks, obviously upset but too weak to attack and shake the 'code prefix' out of the insane Ripper. The South Park folk would have a name for Mandrake. So it turns out that Ripper concocted some leftwing conspiracy theory about fluoridation based on his own failed fornications, his impotence. And so the solution, ultimately, is to abandon monogamy in the mine shafts, with Sellers' Strangelove compulsively saluting Adolph Hitler, and all of it's Kubrickian.Stated another way, the clichés come fast and furious, just as in a recent film of that name. It's thoughtless. It's non sequitur. It's all too easy, and not generally funny. The work is put into the sets, not into the script. He's trying to make a point at odds with the very history of the time. The 'crisis' wasn't about reckless US action, but reckless Soviet action. And they literally had to loop or dub in Pickens as he originally jokes - Dallas - not Vegas. The President, in real life, had been assassinated. But even worse, the moral of the story is don't trust the Americans. They have no real control over their commanders or weapons. Not the 'Ruskies', as Pickens has it. Just as in the insane mocu-drama, Crimson Tide, America is reckless in its plans, in its commanders, and Russia, crazy as it may be (building a domesday device in this film), can always be trusted to keep the lid on. The good ole Ruskies. That's as much the vapid cliché as any. But Kubrick doesn't get it.Again, the sets were great. But the Kubrick insisted that Scott, later to only slightly ham it up as Patton, should be shown falling over himself, and otherwise behaving as a spoiled child, or slapstick comic - everything, one might say, but that pie fight. And Scott may not have appreciated it then, or later. And I don't, now, in the 21st century, looking at this film, yet again.For all that, one has to say that it is still a landmark film. It certainly doesn't merit a high rating on IMDb (and which is unusual given the age of the film). But it is good. It's good, again, not just for those sets, not just for the lead and supporting cast, but for the serious moments. It's good not for the concluding Nazi-farce scenes, which can lose the audience, but for the fight on the base. It's not good for the Hayden\/Sellers play in the room, which is 'black comedy' much more with the low light on Hayden, than the close-ups of Sellers' Mandrake. It's good for the interplay of the crew on the B52.Kubrick, in short, was wrong. This didn't play better as a farce. It could have worked better as a comedy. It didn't need Nazi-farce in a wheelchair. It didn't need the infantilism and 'bodily fluid' conspiracies. It didn't need Scott\/Turgidson as buffoon. It's played at worst as a live-action cartoon. And so it continues to appeal to the adolescent, and few more than that, and always will. Where it's played for suspense and drama, I think it still appeals to all. But to those more experienced, and more intelligent, the film surely seems flawed, important for its historical importance and historical place, but not so much as a film for the ages. It surely made its points, however taken by whatever activists then and later. But it just doesn't play honestly. It doesn't make sense. And as for laughs, most any similarly adolescent 'britcom' is going to be funnier.

When the Indian warriors were engaged in hand to hand combat there was no drawn out flashy choreography, it realistic and brutal. To show the emotion of the actors at moments of intense drama the camera was very close in to establish personal feeling for the actors. Most action scene were mid-shots to extreme close even in a scene were you may want to see the action the camera was close to the faces. I was on the edge of my seat during every action scene and I enjoyed in drama I felt a degree of ambivalence when certain characters were killed because if felt like I knew them on a personal level or I may feel like I was them. The director, I think did a good job of building relation ships with the audience and the actors in a short period of time. He was able to reveal that history of the individuals in a way that was personal.After observing this film several times I couldn't help but notice the way each scene was approached in a way that enabled a smooth transaction from the relatively lengthy dolly shoots into the intense action scenes. This also made a devastating impact on how the characters interacted with each other and how they viewed each other; for instance when the British officer was talking to the Indian scout. The officer was on a horse and on the right side making him appear dominant to the Indian; not only that but yet another example, when the officer was being led by Hawkeye to the fort. They were walking from the left while in the background a raging river flowed against the way the characters were walking, symbolizing the struggles they would encounter and the flood of events that lay on the horizon. The action in the movie was not superficial in the way that some action adventure films are made. Even in the movie The Patriot the fight scenes tended to have a scene of mysticism that the brutal fighting and rigid choreography of Last of the Mohicans did not have. the extreme solidity of the motions pertained to real life combat. The choreography and the special effects department must have work tirelessly to show the rawness of the French and Indian war. Nobody was flying through the air and punching each others heads off. It was grounded hand to hand fighting. In the battle field scene they used real people and not digital effects most of the extras were professional re-en-actors.In the action scenes despite choreography the camera was kept close to the actor's face, now and then it will go to a mid shot or a full shot. This technique allows the actors to show the emotion with their faces, as in the silent film era, forcing the audience to feel the same feelings or contrary ones.

All the characters are extremely likable, and even though it runs a tad long at 127 minutes it's never boring!, plus the supporting cast is very good as well!.

Sydney Pollack does a great! job here with very good camera work, and just keeping the film at an engrossing pace. The Acting is fabulous!. Harrison Ford is amazing as always and is amazing here, he has a grumpy sort of character, but you can see his character progress in the 2nd half, and see the changes in him, he also had wonderful chemistry with Julia Ormond, and was as always fun to watch! (Ford Rules!!!!!!!). Julia Ormond is wonderful here as Sabrina, and while I can't say she is better then Hepburn or not because i haven't seen the original, however i did really like her performance here, she was charming, beautiful,and did a perfect job!, she was great. Greg Kinnear is amusing as David, and managed to get some laughs out of of me, he had a weird sort of charm that I just couldn't help but like. Nancy Marchand is fantastic as Linu's and David's mom, I really liked her. John Wood is great as Sabrina's dad and added class. Richard Crenna does what he has to do well as Elizabeth's dad. Angie Dickinson is also good as Elizabrh's mom. Lauren Holly is hot, but didn't really have much to do, she was OK. Rest of the cast do fine.

This is an absolutely charming remake, that's throughly enjoyable and very well made, with wonderful performances and a really neat ending and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. Sydney Pollack does a great! job here with very good camera work, and just keeping the film at an engrossing pace. The Acting is fabulous!. Harrison Ford is amazing as always and is amazing here, he has a grumpy sort of character, but you can see his character progress in the 2nd half, and see the changes in him, he also had wonderful chemistry with Julia Ormond, and was as always fun to watch! (Ford Rules!!!!!!!). Julia Ormond is wonderful here as Sabrina, and while I can't say she is better then Hepburn or not because i haven't seen the original, however i did really like her performance here, she was charming, beautiful,and did a perfect job!, she was great. Greg Kinnear is amusing as David, and managed to get some laughs out of of me, he had a weird sort of charm that I just couldn't help but like. Nancy Marchand is fantastic as Linu's and David's mom, I really liked her. John Wood is great as Sabrina's dad and added class. Richard Crenna does what he has to do well as Elizabeth's dad. Angie Dickinson is also good as Elizabrh's mom. Lauren Holly is hot, but didn't really have much to do, she was OK. Rest of the cast do fine.

There is not another actress alive today who can compare with her. She has beauty, class, sex appeal, sensitivity, depth, intellect, poise and a keen spirituality. In an acting career spanning almost 6 decades she has delivered some of the most impressive film performances of any actress ever to grace the screen, and The Innocents is the epitome of her body of work.The Innocents (1961) is based on novelist Henry James' (Wings of the Dove, Washington Square, Portrait of a Lady) classic story of the occult and the possession of two children. According to the Bible, devils (demons) *do* exist, and they can enter into a person and often manifest themselves in sexually deviant ways. To understand this story you *have* to comprehend these basic biblical facts. Otherwise you will puzzle over this story, try to modernize it, and believe the governess, Miss Giddens, is imagining everything that goes on; you will attribute her behavior to psychosis or other mental deficiency.Since this is a story of the 19th century, when more people read and believed the Bible, and the major character in the story is the daughter of a bible believing Parson, she would of course immediately sense the demonic oppression which pervades the house and lands where the two demons (devils, not ghosts) are masquerading as the dead spirits of the former valet and governess, Peter Quint and Miss Jessel, respectively. These are really spirits, but to repeat, they are *not* ghosts, they are demons (called devils in the Bible). These types of spirits show up many times in the Bible, and many times Jesus is shown to cast them out.So Miss Giddens believes that if she prays hard enough and if she forces the children to confront these devils that they will similarly depart. She ignores Mrs. Grose's wise counsel to avoid confronting the evil herself, for the children's' sake. However Miss Giddens is *not* Jesus, and perhaps only has an intellectual understanding of the biblical matters she deals with here, not a real spiritual discernment, hence the devils do not depart with prayer. Miss Giddens is above her element here dealing with this alone, and should have sought counsel from others more experienced in demonic possession immediately, once the children began to behave in odd and abnormal ways. Her pride proves to be her downfall...and unfortunately the downfall of the children.Miss Giddens herself appears to become possessed by these devils, such is their power over her and the children. She almost seems to be jealous of the devil impersonating Miss Jessel, and her influence over Flora.The two long mouth kisses she shares with the little boy Miles are indicative of this possession. It was not normal behavior for a governess and her charge to kiss each other in this manner, and there is evidence of pedophilia here, another aberrant behavior common to satanic oppression\/possession. With the first long kiss they share like this, instigated by the devil through Miles, she appears to be both horrified yet pleasured by it. Watch her face closely. The second long kiss occurs at the very end and she is the one who initiates it. It is a lover's kiss. Miss Giddens is now fully possessed AND no longer in her right mind.The first time I watched The Innocents I was puzzled by Miles' actions at the very end, when he jumps up and screams that Miss Giddens is insane. I thought, This means that she MUST be insane, because of course a child has to be right. But then I reconsidered. No, not necessarily. Miles himself *has* to believe Miss Giddens is insane, because he is simply not aware he is possessed. When people are possessed by devils they are not fully aware of what they are doing while under the possession; they are not morally responsible for their actions, the devils are responsible. Miss Giddens understands this. That voice, those words, they weren't yours. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of The Innocents is its abrupt end. We sense that Miss Giddens will continue to be haunted by these devils until at some future date she understands she requires an exorcist to expel them from her life and spirit. She makes tragic mistakes during this story, and we are left to wonder if she will continue to make them in future, or if she will finally find peace.The performances here are all top-notch, including Miss Kerr's, Megs Jenkins, Martin Stephens, Pamela Franklin, and Michael Redgrave. The black and white cinematography is evocative and lovely. I feel sorry for people who say they don't watch black and white films. What they are missing! Some of the best films of all time were made in black and white and they often give a much more realistic feeling than color films, which can fade with time. The music is romantic and haunting. The song Willow Waly is not an old folk song, it was written for the film, but the composer wrote it in typical 19th century style, and it fits here very well.A disturbing film, but if you approach it with a biblical understanding you will see it more clearly than if you approach it as a modern study on psychoanalysis. That just doesn't work. The devils are too real and the behavior of all involved too strange. Chances of ALL the major characters being mentally ill at the same time is nil. No, it is demonic oppression\/possession, not a ghost story, and not a tale about insanity.

I always genuinely believed that Coogan's legendary comedy character was based on Richard Madeley but watching the real Tony Wilson's pretentious egotistical and painfully insincere conversations on television I suppose there is a bit of Wilson in Partridge - Or is the fact that Coogan plays Wilson in this biographical movie something that prejudices my view ? Come to think of it Wilson's body language and hand gestures remind me far more of Tony Blair than anyone else .

Timothy Dalton had proved that he had the acting chops to play 007. HIf Dalton was easily visualized as Bond, he IS Bond in this film. He isn't the tuxedoed super hero of the Roger Moore films. Just look at the scene where Bond finds Della dead. Only Timothy Dalton could have given the proper emotion in the frantic cry of Della! and his reaction to looking over her body is classic Bond. He has studied the Bond character enough to get inside the characters' head and become him. It's true that bond appears out of his usual attire in the film and that Dalton looks uncomfortable in them, but Bond doesn't dress in that attire and Dalton is simply acting in the role. Dalton looks well in the scenes with the Bond girls and his scenes with Sanchez are among the best Bond-Villain scenes since From Russia With Love and the early Bond films.The weak point in the films main characters is the girl Pam Bouvier. Though she is a very strong character and Carey Lowell acts well in the part, the character seems out of place in a Bond film. Perhaps it is for the better that the character is tough and resourceful, the character seems to be more of the usual 80's tough woman action hero, ala Aliens and the like. Not that the character is a bad thing, but does that type of character belong in a James Bond adventure? She is a modern and tough woman; though as I said maybe a little too tough for a Bond film. Overall, Pam is a good character and Carey Lowell does a good job playing her.The villain, Franz Sanchez, is among the best villains of the series. He is also the more realistic of the series' villain, a drug lord from South America and in many ways a mirror, albeit evil, image of 007. Sanchez's loyalty issue lead to the self-destructive paranoia that leads him to do Bond's bidding by killing off most of his own inner-circle. Robert Davi does incredibly well in the part and is very believable and at times one has to wonder whether or not he really is the character he plays.Talisa Soto does well in the part of Lupe, though it is hard to feel for her character due to her limited time on screen, despite the limited time on screen. David Hedison makes a fantastic return as Felix Lieter.. When the shark maims him, we're shocked at it and even more shocked when bond finds his bloody and barely alive body at his house. Mostly the goons of Sanchez make up the rest of the supporting cast, led by a young and very impressive Benicio Del Toro, whose talents have improved since this film came out. The characters of Truman-Lodge, Heller, and Krest are great characters. The character of Joe Butcher is a fun character and well played by Wayne Newton, though a little out of place in this Bond film. Desmond Llewelyn gets the largest Q part in the series and shines in the process. Robert Brown returns as M and finally manages to step out of Bernard Lee's shadow for the scene at the Hemingway house in Key West. Caroline Bliss returns also for the second and final time as Moneypenny and doesn't spend enough time on screen to make an impression.The film's action sequences are among the best in the series. The film's opening teaser sequence while not as good as the one in The Living Daylights, is inspired and finds Bond, for the first time, not on a mission for MI6. The underwater\/water ski\/airplane sequence that takes later in the film is another inspired action sequence that showcases some of the best stunt work in the history of the series. The final action sequence in the film, the truck chase, is great. The stunts are unbelievably original and seeing an eighteen-wheeler truck doing a side wheelie is among the most amazing stunts seen on film. The various fights in the film are also good, especially the bar fight and the fight on the back of the runaway truck between Bond and Sanchez. The film has less action then The Living Daylights, but manages to surpass those action sequences and the plot never suffers.The film's plot is among the most original in the series. It uses many elements from the Fleming stories, particularly Lieter's maiming by a shark in the Live And Let Die novel, The sub-plots of the Japanese drug lords and the Stinger missiles help to complicate the film.If there is a bad thing about this film, it's the score and songs. When John Barry came down with esophagus cancer, EON hired the late Michael Kamen to do the score. Unfortunately, Kamen produced one of the worst Bond film scores. Like Monty Norman in Dr. No, he makes way too much use of The James Bond Theme in the score.. The film's songs are, for the most part, a letdown. The main title song, performed by Gladys Knight is instantly forgettable. The only good song to come out of the film is If You Asked Me To and is a pretty good song, though it does kind of feel out of place in a Bond film.Despite a terrible score, License To Kill is a great Bond film. With the best Bond performance of the series to date, a great villain, a good supporting cast (though some of them are out of place), good action sequences, and a good plot, License To Kill is a classic 007 film that ranks in the top five best Bond films.

The story is great because it's filled with lots of sweet action. This movie also gives Harrison Ford, who is a great actor, a great character. But you might want to watch the other Indiana Jones movies first.I remember watching this movie when I was just a little kid and loving it I didn't really remember any of the story line or anything I just remember watching it and then last summer while I was fishing on my dads fishing boat we went to blockbusters and bought a bunch of used movies. One of the films that I chose was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I must have watched that movie over a dozen times last summer on the boat. And now I see why I liked it so much.The story in this movie is awesome Indiana Jones goes into an evil palace and has to steal back a sacred stone from a human sacrificing cult and free the children of the surrounding villages who have been kidnapped for manual labor. Its great it has all kinds of really cool parts in it. There are so many instances of good action in this movie it is hard to pick a few that give a good representation of just how great it is. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Jones Shorty and Willy jump out of a crashing plane and use an inflatable life raft to cushion there fall and then sled down a mountain in it. Another part that I really liked was when the evil priest puts his hand in the slaves chest and rips his heart out that is awesome. The fight that he has with the huge slave driver down in the mines underneath the palace is great.I think that one reason that I like Harrison Ford so much is he has gotten in some great films like Apocalypse Now and American Graffiti but he has also had some pretty awesome roles to play when you think about it. I mean the guy played Han Solo in the star wars movies and Rick Deckard in Blade Runner. I think that is pretty good for any guy but he also plays Indiana Jones and I cant think of anyone that could do it better. Ford is perfect for it if you think about it Jones and Solo are pretty similar characters and Ford plays the adventurer He is pretty much a normal looking guy physically he might be a little bit more fit than the average guy but he is not some supper ripped Vin Diesel or The Rock type. So its cool you get the feeling that he's a real person but he is still a bad ass because he's smart and tough. Not tough like he can go pick guys up and throw them around but tough like he can take a lot of abuse.The only thing that I would say to someone if they asked me if they should watch it is that they should watch the other ones first. The movies stories do not depend on each other at all but the character of Indiana Jones is set up a lot more in The Search for the Holy Grail and somewhat in Raiders of the Last Arc. Temple of Doom sort of just jumps straight into the story where as The search for the holy grail does a really good job of setting up Indiana Jones by giving a excerpt from his child hood and showing how Indiana is driven by the same ideals and goals.This is probably one of my top ten favorite films of all time and everyone needs to have seen it.

I don't know if you have ever had an ex-girlfriend or anything like that. But I do know that people who have had bad break-ups, claim to hate the person that they broke up with even though they really love the person. The love is very strong, yet they can no longer be with the person that they love which leads to feelings of hatred that are actually sourced in love.This movie really played on Danny's relationship with God in a similar way, and this is just one of the ideas that The Believer provoked. In the movie Danny, as a child, dumps HaShem (literally the name--the Jewish God) right in the middle of the classroom. While he hates God on the one hand, on the other hand he loves God and desires to think about Judiasm and Torah all the time. Thus he becomes a Nazi. He can obsess over God and Judiasm, yet still claim to hate them both. This is an extreme version of a dynamic which is at play amongst many Jews and non-Jews today. They spite religion, hate practitioners, and despise God. The movie really outlines this idea well, and it really answers how one can come to love God without this hatred. One must lose his ego and submit to God and his faith based Law. Because of the protagonist's hatred for God and Torah he believes in the anti-thesis of the Jewish God and Torah--that is Nazism. Yet in order for him to hate God, the Jews and Torah, he must first love it and assert its truth. You can't hate something you don't even believe in. Thus it is absurd to call Danny an atheist in any sense. His hatred presupposes a strong belief and a strong love. When he sees the Torah being desecrated he realized this dynamic, this love-hate relationship between God and himself. His obsession with Jews, God, and Torah was his love not his hatred, but yet he could not lower his own ego enough to say that he loves it. He could not submit God and the Torah. This happens to many Jewish people as well as non-Jewish people today. I hope that by making this dynamic explicit, people will read this article and realize that this dynamic is at play in themselves, and it will help them submit in love, rather than fight in hatred.

The love is very strong, yet they can no longer be with the person that they love which leads to feelings of hatred that are actually sourced in love.This movie really played on Danny's relationship with God in a similar way, and this is just one of the ideas that The Believer provoked. In the movie Danny, as a child, dumps HaShem (literally the name--the Jewish God) right in the middle of the classroom. While he hates God on the one hand, on the other hand he loves God and desires to think about Judiasm and Torah all the time. Thus he becomes a Nazi. He can obsess over God and Judiasm, yet still claim to hate them both. This is an extreme version of a dynamic which is at play amongst many Jews and non-Jews today. They spite religion, hate practitioners, and despise God. The movie really outlines this idea well, and it really answers how one can come to love God without this hatred. One must lose his ego and submit to God and his faith based Law. Because of the protagonist's hatred for God and Torah he believes in the anti-thesis of the Jewish God and Torah--that is Nazism. Yet in order for him to hate God, the Jews and Torah, he must first love it and assert its truth. You can't hate something you don't even believe in. Thus it is absurd to call Danny an atheist in any sense. His hatred presupposes a strong belief and a strong love. When he sees the Torah being desecrated he realized this dynamic, this love-hate relationship between God and himself. His obsession with Jews, God, and Torah was his love not his hatred, but yet he could not lower his own ego enough to say that he loves it. He could not submit God and the Torah. This happens to many Jewish people as well as non-Jewish people today. I hope that by making this dynamic explicit, people will read this article and realize that this dynamic is at play in themselves, and it will help them submit in love, rather than fight in hatred. That is why this movie is so good, it makes clear something so difficult to explicate. In order to get a lot from watching this movie one must really think about the psychological and theological dynamics that are at play. It is really very accurate and very thought provoking.

Not only would I recommend this movie for its endless comedic scenes, but also because of its refreshing story line. The combination of these two elements makes this film relatable to everyone for we seem to seek for movies that allow us to express amusement or for a new plot. Furthermore, the unique characters added to the overall appearance of the film.I watched the film Monster's Inc. at the comfort of my own home on Saturday, November 13th, 2005 at approximately five o'clock in the afternoon as I listed my twenty dialectics and worked on my Film Reflection Journal.I recommend Monster's Inc. to anyone for it contained many comedic parts. I believe that people of all ages would relate to this film because it achieved to have both humor for children and adults. It has the simple amusing scenes that children would laugh at for example when Sully gets stuck in the trash can and books fall on his head and there were also the new generation, hilarious scenes that adults would get such as the scene with the Abominable snowman. Its story line was another factor that would make everyone admires the movie. It was unique in the sense that everything that happened in the film was nothing like any other movies that I have seen. The beginning started out with Mike and Sully doing their regular routine of getting up, greeting everyone monster they pass by, and going to work where they would scare children for the sake of Monstropolis. Then a child from the human world comes into their lives, which will eventually affect the city of Monstropolis including theirs.The characters in the film were made for the purpose of having the audience see a whole different side of them rather than focusing on their appearances. People could relate to the characters for they showcased personalities that we would display. They showed traits like jealousy, greediness, love, caring, confidence, anger, and more. Being able to relate to these characters allows us to become more attached to the movie for we see ourselves in the figures that are in the screen. We tend to remember some parts of our lives when something similar occurs in the movie. The last parts of the film showed Sully and Mike getting chased by Randall, who was attempting to capture Boo. I remembered my aunts chasing my cousins and me as we rode around with tricycles in the Philippines. This brought back memories from when this happened to me.In my opinion, I think that the movie would relate more to children than adults for some reasons. First, the characters were full of life and animated, which would suit the likings of children. It included a lonely but friendly Abominable snowman who wanted to be accepted. Secondly, the character of Boo speaks for every child who watched the film. There were probably some children who felt the same way that Boo did and possibly even have dealt with a similar problem. I know that I related with Boo because she brought me back to my past time when I had dilemmas with monsters at night. If I could relate to Boo, I know that other children will as well. The way that the monsters went to work and used the doors of children to enter their realm and scare them was a brilliant idea. This concept really tied the whole movie together. It was a critical part of the film for this is where Sully and Mike met Boo. The way that they competed on who can gather the most screams from children affected the movie in a positive way for it added more comedic parts in it.If you are looking for an animated yet memorable movie to watch that contains drama and comedy, Monster's Inc. is the film to choose.

I have just made a quick look thru the comments on here about this movie. Most are by folks who have not the slightest idea about what the Vietnam War was like, but are quick to call this one of the best. Cimino 's choice of backdrop for the characters in the movie was very well done...However, he miserably fails in many aspects of the military service of the three characters. From Michael's full beard, to the inaccuracies of his uniform, to the amount of time lapse in the movie, it is all bothersome to me, not to mention the russian roulette sequences with Nick near the end...there doesn't seem to be evidence that this ever happened in real life. All the above having been said, I believe Meryl Streep gives a wonderful performance as someone who was left behind during the war and suffered from the effects. If one can overlook many of the flaws in this movie, there is a good story here. However, as being an accurate depiction of the Vietnam War it fails.

I have just made a quick look thru the comments on here about this movie. Most are by folks who have not the slightest idea about what the Vietnam War was like, but are quick to call this one of the best. Cimino 's choice of backdrop for the characters in the movie was very well done...However, he miserably fails in many aspects of the military service of the three characters. From Michael's full beard, to the inaccuracies of his uniform, to the amount of time lapse in the movie, it is all bothersome to me, not to mention the russian roulette sequences with Nick near the end...there doesn't seem to be evidence that this ever happened in real life.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"15 December 2005","score":"","review":" It's hard to imagine that maybe the most uplifting film of all time is set inside the walls of a prison but that is the case in The Shawshank Redemption. The film is about friendship, loyalty, and patience which may not seem like the most intriguing elements until you have seen them brought together in this film. Opening with the incarceration of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) for two life terms for the brutal killing of his wife and her lover the film seems to be heading into dark territory. Instead what we get is an examination of the triumph of human spirit. Shawshank Prison is the meanest prison around, or so says EllisRedRedding(Morgan Freeman) in an early narration. This is where Red and Andy first meet and where the development of one of the most rewarding screen friendships begins. Tim Robbins who plays Andy gives his best performance. He carries himself in a manner unimaginable considering his predicament. His patience and strength are a marvel. Morgan Freeman turns in the performance of his career as Red who narrates the film as well as provide the realism that Andy has suppressed back. Andy is a patient man who walks the yard of Shawshank like he doesn't have a care in the world. The film's success lies in the relationship between Andy and Red. Their friendship carries them through the struggles of the prison term and us through the film. One of the most memorable endings in film history comes from their life long bond. I am being vague on details because I do not want to spoil the film for anyone who has not seen it. As far as I am concerned it is something that you should do immediately. The Shawshank Redemption does so much well. But above all it is a story of hope. The ability to persevere through any situation is the hallmark of this remarkable film.
