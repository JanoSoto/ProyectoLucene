[{"date":"4 November 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Hollywood, in the days of the studio system, was not a haven for individualists. Much as film writers and egotistical filmmakers like to ascribe authorship to one person, in truth cinema is by its very nature a collaborative means of expression. Hollywood, in its golden age, produced many of the greatest pictures ever, because the studios were like well-oiled machines for making the most out of collaborations. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a great example.Let's look a bit at the history of this picture. Frank Capra, he of the name-above-the-title had had his biggest successes so far in partnership with a wonderful yet rarely remembered screenwriter called Robert Riskin. The story of Mr Smith Goes to Washington would have been right up Riskin's street, but unfortunately the writer, fed up with working in Capra's shadow, had decided to go his own way. Still Capra and Columbia wanted a picture that could be a loose sequel to Riskin's Mr Deeds Goes to Town, and would say about politics what Deeds and You Can't Take It with You (another Riskin script) said about wealth. A skilled and experienced writer by the name of Sidney Buchman was brought in to adapt a story by Lewis Foster. The result, while neither as witty or as charming as genuine Riskin, nevertheless made up for it with the devastating power of its message.Once you have your A-grade script, you must get the right cast. Nowadays typecasting is looked on as restrictive and unimaginative, but it's part of the beauty of classic era Hollywood. Look at Jimmy Stewart, with his innocent face and frame so spindly it looks like he might blow away in a strong gust of wind. And yet when he gets going he has this boyish enthusiasm that makes you believe in him all the way. Stewart had first come to public attention in the top box office hit You Can't Take It with You, and had had a number of lead roles since then. For audiences of 1939 it would have been like seeing a dear friend step into the senate, and any modern day viewer who has seen a handful of Jimmy's pictures will feel the same. That's how he works in the role, and that in turn makes the whole picture work.It's not just Stewart. Everyone appearing in this picture is perfectly cast, admittedly to type. Jean Arthur as usual plays the sharp-witted tomboy with a good heart, an ideal partner for the honest yet sheepish Stewart. The bulky, pointy-nosed Edward Arnold, in his tiny circular glasses, is the very image of the callous businessmen, and frog-voiced Eugene Palette is just right as his pompous stooge. All told, Mr Smith Goes to Washington contains a treasure trove of familiar character actors &#x96; Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Guy Kibbee&#x85; each doing business as usual, and it is the very acceptability of them as their typical personas that makes this picture feel so immediate.And what about Mr Capra? Let's not play down his contribution, even if it isn't quite worthy of having his name above the title. Capra is like the conductor of the orchestra. Not only does he coax some great performances out of his cast, but he arranges things superbly to give emphasis as and where it's needed. In many of the early shots of Stewart he is shown in long shot in large spaces, like a little boy lost in a world he doesn't understand. In the first few scenes at the senate, Capra pulls a nifty trick with perspective, framing Stewart so that the top corner of the room converges with his head. The effect makes him appear very small, like those optical illusions you can make with two equal lines that appear to be of different sizes. As Smith gains more confidence and his words more resonance, he starts to emerge from this corner. In their quiet and intimate scene at Capitol Dome, Stewart and Arthur are shown against a plain background, so all focus is upon them and nothing will distract us from their words. All these techniques look very simple, but it takes a master craftsman to know when and how to use them.Capra no doubt thought of himself as a Jefferson Smith-type character, a little man standing up and making a big splash through pluck and determination. That's why he fought to get his name above the title, and essentially marketed the Capra touch. But Hollywood is not congress, and even Jefferson Smith couldn't have done it without Saunders. No, this delightful and nearly perfect picture is the work of a wonderful, Tinseltown team.
