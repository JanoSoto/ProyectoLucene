The queue to the box office stretched beyond the horizon. It had been 16 years since a Star Wars movie played in the theaters and expectations were through the roof. But when watching the original Star Wars trilogy, did we ever wonder that much about the history of the world in that galaxy far, far away? Were we really that interested in how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and was it really that important to know all the details about the Jedi knights' engagements decades earlier?Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace revolves around the two jedis Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who through an unfortunate and improbable series of events find themselves stranded on the planet Tatooine along with some other people, where they for the first time meet the boy Anakin Skywalker. There's also the questionable story of the Trade Federation blockade of the planet Naboo which involves the evil Darth Sidious, who for some reason sends the almost as evil Darth Maul to assassinate queen Amidala of Naboo. I'm trying here to point out this movie's main problem. People's intentions and motives are often unclear and they don't get explained very well either. Events and circumstances that push the story forward seem implausible and highly unlikely most of the time. The story isn't dependent on the characters' accomplishments or their ability to solve problems, but merely on chance, which makes their qualities and personal traits unimportant, not that they were given any to begin with. Events seem to be detached ideas forced together to make out a coherent story line, and when the movie has ended it's actually quite difficult to account for what happened in it.Much of the feel and atmosphere of the original Star Wars trilogy comes from the fact that we don't know exactly what happened in the past. Obi- Wan mentions something about the clone wars and Luke's father being a jedi knight, and that's it. That small glimpse of history is what creates all the mystique and excitement we need. Luke's story is that of a forgotten legacy. The Phantom Menace is the first step out of three to take away a little of that great feel and atmosphere of the original movies, and for that I am a bit angry. Nowadays I have to disregard the new movies to be able to watch the old ones the way they deserve to be watched. Also, in The Phantom Menace the mystique and excitement is replaced by a bland feeling, and the story of the forgotten legacy turns out to be completely uninteresting, which some of us already had suspected. What's the point in telling a story that everyone knows the outcome of, anyway? (Yeah, the guy gets corrupted by the dark side and eventually starts to dress in black, wear a helmet-mask-thing and breathe funny. We don't really care HOW or WHY because it's not important!) The story in Episode 1 is also told in a very bleak manner which makes me care even less than I first did. The characters lack depth, it's hard to understand why they say what they say, and why they do what they do. Things are illogical and people are irrational. The only thing that prevents this movie from being a complete catastrophe is the performance and credibility of Ewan McGregor, but unfortunately the history of Obi-Wan Kenobi isn't especially interesting either.I had high hopes for the special effects in this one, but to me it seems that the special effects company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) has gone from being absolute pioneers in creating unbelievable, yet extremely good looking and realistic effects on the screen, to just being lazy guys behind a computer. The reason I'm saying this is because it appears ILM is under the impression that they can computer-animate anything and make it look real. I'm sorry to say that that is far from the truth. CGI-shots are easy to spot, and a lot of it in this movie just doesn't look good, sometimes even cartoonish. I expected more. The sound quality and sound design, however, was great.I also keep wondering what the target audience is. The slapstick humor delivered by Jar Jar Binks and the not-so-funny jokes presented by Anakin and his kid friends annoy the hell out of an adult audience, but the tactics and politics talk is way too boring and complex (and in this case, illogical) for a child to endure. Maybe the script is written by someone who has the reasoning of a child, is under the impression that he understands politics and warfare strategies but actually hasn't got a clue, and who doesn't know how to make an appealing movie for the intended audience.

One of the reasons may be because animals are so genuinely unpredictable, unlike most people in the movies these days. You can look into the eyes of most animals and not have a real clear picture of what they are thinking or feeling. So I sometimes find movie-animals more fascinating than movie-people. But the second&#x97;and primary&#x97;reason is because they bring me to admire the skills and patience that go into making a film. All movies are difficult to make, even the awful ones. That goes without saying. But there a number of them where the tremendous effort does not really paint itself on the screen, regardless of whether they are good or bad, absorbing or unbearable. I tend to be astonishing by animal movies for the same reason I tend to be astonished by movies featuring stop-motion animation I instantly become aware of the exhaustion the creators had to subject themselves to.To make The Bear, the filmmakers required their stars, two bears, one an adult, the other a cub, to crawl across landscapes, play around in water, and appear to grow close to one another. The cub is orphaned at the beginning of the picture when its mother is killed in a landslide; the adult is a territorial old male wounded by bear hunters. Now the bears had to perform just right before the camera. They had to not only appear convincing, but maintain continuity whenever the director would decide it was time to move the camera to another angle. I've heard of accounts where the director and trainer would wait all day just to get the bear cub to turn its head in the right direction for a subsequent shot and then keep its head there when they got to that subsequent shot.On that level, and others, The Bear is an absorbing movie-going experience. But it is also a glorious massage on the senses. First of all, it looks beautiful. The directing, which consists of numerous cuts, not just long documentary extreme wide-angles, is consistently interesting. Also remarkable is the sound design. The movie was probably shot, mostly, without any sound equipment, for the trainers would be shouting at the bears every second, commanding them what to do and when. So every footstep, every grunt, snarl, bird chirp, gust of wind, sound of a grasshopper, you name it, was developed and integrated in post-production. Yet it all feels so natural; it was not until after I saw the movie that I became aware of this, once again reminding me of how much stress the filmmakers had to put upon themselves.Just imaging the making of The Bear puts my memories of volunteering on The Boarder, a low-budget family drama shot in rural Nebraska, to shame.I also liked the movie for its human scenes. I guess that contradicts part of my opening statement, but then again, there seems to be an exception to every rule when it comes to the movies. The only humans in the movies are the two hunters chasing after the adult bear. Apart from the wonderful acting by Jack Wallace and Tcheky Karyo, I also enjoyed the level of detail given to them. The way, in the opening, the movie breaks down the process by which they hunt the bear. I particularly liked the touch where Mr. Wallace plucks some grass and lets it fly from his fingertips in the wind, so he knows just how much he needs to angle his rifle before he takes the shot. These are pretty interesting characters, and I actually did not mind it so much when their moral denouement at the end flew completely from the realm of predictability.The Bear only loses its head when it tries to get inside the mind of a bear. Literally. Animals dream. Anybody who has ever owned a dog knows that. But just what they dream or what they see in their dreams is anybody's guess. Now the movie does offer a suggestion a purple-tinted world with a quirkier-moving version of the animal wandering about in some strange surrounding. The dream sequences are handled through stop-motion animation the other movie-making process that astounds me. And also I certainly did not mind seeing the animation, it nevertheless broke the shape of the picture.

However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the graphics. However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as illiterates. I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea. I think they did the ending more or less perfectly also, and it redeemed some of the offence against conservatives.

(Sigh)I never thought the day would come when I had to write these words but this one is nothing but a narcissistic, pretentious, piece of nothing. Now, I know I'm not making any friends here, specially in the artsy crowd, but I don't write my reviews to make friends but to call them as I see them and what I see here is a waste of celluloid, a flick with no reason to exist. One thing that reveals well the mediocrity of this movie is the waste of great music in trite, meaningless scenes; that's what I'm referring to in my title, to the insignificance of the crowd scene where this Wagner piece is played, compared to the immensity of you know which. That came at about 10 min. into the movie and already I had come to the conclusion that Fellini had absolutely nothing to say at that time, nothing to show, but that he felt anyway compelled to make a film. Then it was the turn for the artsy-fartsy mob to consecrate it as a masterpiece and after that it was for the unwashed to fall into fake admiration and awe face to just another butt-naked emperor. Now, if you want to see a really good Fellini dealing with the same subject&#x97;the filmmaker seen during the shooting of one of his works&#x97;rather watch his far superior Intervista (1987), one greatly underrated at that.But you don't even got to spend 10 min. to realize that Fellini has fallen here&#x97;also!--into the artsy trap. Already during the first shots, a car burning on the road, you realize this will be a cinematographic wasteland; the kind of flick that leaves you the impression of having been made of assorted pieces of used film taken from the trash bin in the cutting room which are then glued together in no particular order. Because for a good 90 min. there's nothing holding it together plot, characters, psychological undercurrents, accumulating tensions, which is the clearest hint of a filmmaker&#x97;or a fiction writer&#x97;having nothing to say, show, at the moment in his life, with the inevitable result of his work coming out as nothing more than 2 hrs.--or 200 to 500 pg.&#x97;of emptiness and boredom. I wish I could say that what Fellini is doing here is simply exorcising his inner demons; or getting closure for a traumatized childhood during which he had to endure, for ex., all kinds of abuse from priests for watching a fat woman dance in a beach; or that he's metaphorically getting even at women for the disproportionate role they play in his life&#x97;I'm just supposing--but the banality of it all precludes that thought. Here there's neither the emotional intensity, the visual confusion, the complexity of situations that a good director uses to illustrate memories, specially traumatic ones. For ex. I remember a hauntingly beautiful dream sequence in Buñuel's Los Olvidados, one that I felt like living it also, that I haven't forgotten yet, thanks to his masterly use of light and darkness, of the movements of the characters. Obviously Fellini had the talent to shoot such scenes, if what he wanted to show was the filmmaker scratching his own inner dungeons, corridors, trying to use what he's retrieving there into the open to use it as material for his plot, yet it seems as if instead he purposely chose to make of 8 ½ the most banal, trivial, movie of his career. There are lots of serious subjects brought up here&#x97;adultery, mid life crisis, sexual insecurity and repression, social conformism, machismo, misogyny, etc--yet they are all treated just as jokes&#x97;like the ultra misogynistic way Guido treats his harem--or like mere afterthoughts, with no one of them being developed further, taken in a more serious and profound way. There are even some sequences showing great promise, most concerning memories&#x97;-Guido's parents, the Catholic school, the communal bath, etc&#x97;but all lead nowhere, none of them is developed further and linked to his present conundrum as a director.Still, despite it all, there is one saving grace for 8 ½ and that can be said in just two words Anoux Aimée. What a charisma of this woman! Without being a flashy, Bardot kind of beauty, she becomes the focus of each one of her scenes. She just has to stand there, doing nothing, to fill the screen. Well above Milo, Cardinale. I know she was famous in the 60s but I never imagined she was that good. She is the one singlehandedly preventing this film from being a total dog, giving it the last 30 min. the psychological and emotional depth 8 ½ was sorely needing, even giving the rather vacuous, inconsequential Manstroianni's Guido a similar depth. If you watch it, keep an eye on her, specially during that terrace scene (90 min.), where she is truly formidable. BTW, Guido must be a true cinematographic genius as his producers have such patience with him, tolerating all his moods and antics, while we don't get to see squat of his talent. I know he plays Fellini, and I know the movie refers to filmmaker's block, but man, even blocked masters are still masters. I just could't see the great Fellini anywhere in this man, like it was the case all over Intervista.In all, a Fellini that you can give a miss. Just Anoux's scenes worth watching.

","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"20 October 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Buñuel was trying to say. And if you asked Buñuel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Buñuel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative.Buñuel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Buñuel's protagonist, Séverine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Buñuel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on Séverine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967.But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Buñuel is committed to shocking us again. Séverine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as Séverine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations.In reality, nothing is normal for Séverine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Renée, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how Séverine finds out about Madame Anaïs' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl.While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Buñuel is more interested in contrasting Séverine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Buñuel takes great pleasure in emphasizing Séverine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). Séverine also expresses disgust to Madame Anaïs. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies.Buñuel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who Séverine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with Séverine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive.Buñuel comes full circle playing with his audience. If Séverine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that Séverine refers to Pierre's accident as he sits in his wheelchair. An accident seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an accident (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of Séverine's imagination.The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and Séverine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Buñuel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now Séverine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on Séverine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death.For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.
