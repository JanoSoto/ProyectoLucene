I saw the movie first and years later read the book. The deviations from the book story actually make for a better plot than the original. Stephen King, as usual writes stories that scare the daylights out of you. As if that were not enough, the casting of Jack Nicholson in the lead role is inspired. Nicholson is so convincing in his role that I wondered whether or not he was really off his rocker. I saw the movie in Germany, in German and I've seen it in English and they translated it true to the original script. On my way home after the movie, I walked through a church cemetery, which was on the way to my apartment. Big mistake! I was convinced that Nicholson was waiting behind some headstone, complete with fire ax, waiting to kill me. No film has ever scared me more.

Sure, it's got the classic action sequences and all the beat 'em up elements, but it's done with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek humour and over-the-top comic book antics, that it's weighed out into something real special. Only Carpenter could pull off this B-movie (on purpose), that really sets the stakes for an all-time classic and of course, your enjoyable adventure flick.Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is a trucker who gets caught up with his friend Wang (Dennis Dun) in a downtown Chinatown conspiracy. An age old Magician called Lo Pan is planning on returning from the spirit world and needs to sacrifice a girl with green eyes to do so. Wang's girlfriend fits that exact description, and she's caught and it's up to him to rescue her. Of course, Wang owes Jack money so Jack decides it's best to stick with Wang until he's paid up, but gets caught up in something out-of-this-world. Teaming up with some strange and memorable characters, Jack and Wang hit the underground warehouse for Lo Pan's operations, and involve themselves in a mission that will save Chinatown for ages to come! It really is spectacular, with everybody performing to their best of ability. It's hard to explain the feeling you get from watching this movie, but it's a good one. Never before has an adventure made me feel so alive. In fact, it makes me want to go on this particular quest myself! I recommend it to the highest heavens you won't be disappointed with John Carpenter's 1986 classic, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA.Overall The greatest adventure movie of all time cinema at it's best.

She eliminates a group of teenagers who have come to reopen the camp, but in the end she dies. Then in the second chapter her son comes back as a grownup (masked) man taking revenge for his mother. (In my view since sequels II-III-IV occurs on same continuing periods, they can closely consider as F13th SECOND PART TRILOGIES!).This sequel starts from where the previous film left off, continuing from same day of the last movie, Jason wakes up from the machete stabbing then walks towards for the next mission. With a body count of 12 and some chilling 3D promoting camera works with very excellent unexpected scary moments, this sequel features a different tone on Friday franchise.Scripted by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson, did their best for extending Jason's image as a horror icon. The killings, the camera pans, and the situations they wrote for the screen were good but the problem comes from the story narration. There are lots of boring moments, stupid dialogues, and silly cheap suspense we have to go through for getting some thrilling scenes. Or did they aped those 80's usual suspense tricks.Soul of the movie is provided by Harry Manfredini, in this chapter he done a nice job for creating tensions especially in those chasing scenes. Editing by George Hively was not good but O.K when it comes to 3D setting views.And as for the second chance of Jason, the man behind the mask, Richard Brooker did a great tremendous work. His effort to play Jason by keeping that character as the same maniac, but adding an unexpected scary element was just outstanding. Having an historical importance, in this movie Jason first time wore the now-familiar hockey mask.Richard Brooker was the first one to appear in the most appreciated outfit of Jason. He was good on that mask, and also in unmask scenes. Last moments while he appears with his own JASON face, totally AWESOME! Brooker was the first one who added the Scarier element to the HORROR ICON Jason.Overall it's a great movie if you can bear with some uneasy boring moments. The last 30 minutes have the best moments, especially Chris (Dana Kimmel) boat scene seeing Jason in the window was the greatest moments in this movie! But anyway I can't take it's typical 80's boring suspense works so I give this movie 1 out of 10.Friday the 13th Part 3 3D = Scarier this time, but Sucking, same time.
