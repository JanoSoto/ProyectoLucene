She's indeed not just a fantasy but a real person as the final scene confirms. I think the combination and interaction of these two characters makes this film much more intense than Jacob's Ladder.

I actually own this movie, don't ask me why. I am still wondering why this movie didn't follow the second movie better, who is Gus Cantrell and how does he know the guys from the first two films without being in them? I assume this is supposed to be Jake Taylor's character an old washed up ballplayer??? Why is Bob Uecker announcing for a minor league team, I assume he might have got booted down for being a drunk? What happened to the Cleveland Indians and how did the Minnesota Twins get involved here? I liked this film, but was disappointed by the lack of effort to attempt to follow the first two films, it leaves alot of questions unanswered. I would watch this if I haven't seen the first two Major Leagues, but there aren't many people who haven't seen those somewhere on Tv or on video by now. WAR Ted McGinley and his ridiculous hair.

The whole idea and certainly the credit goes to Giger and Scott for starting the series off to a fine start. Alien was awesome and creepy and with Ian Holm playing Ash, those scenes you will never forget! Awesome. Then Cameron came in, threw in his knack for action and drive, sped Aliens up and delivered to both fans and the box office. Can anyone forget Paxton's nervous soldier and priceless witticisms. Then new guy Fincher stepped up to the plate and delivered a different approach. Poor Fincher has been bad mouthed for some time about his delivery of Alien 3, although I, for one, really enjoyed it. It certainly went a different direction, but directors are not responsible for story framework, as that comes from the writers. I felt that the story was indeed interesting and Fincher filmed it flawlessly. Bravo Fincher, why on earth he was not re-enlisted to the Alien series, I will never know. Then comes AlienResurrection....well, what can you say about this disaster. While I certainly don't mean any negativity towards Sigourney, I would have to suggest to Ms. Weaver that after reading such an abomination of a script, she should have passed, and perhaps the movie would not have gone forward without her, instead waiting for a good approach for the fourth movie. While I enjoyed the directors movie, City of Lost Children, he certainly was not the person to have helmed Alien 4. But the true guilt and fault lie with the script. This series has never been so humor-laden as in Resurrection and certainly did not need to be. This series needs very little humor, something that I feel fans will agree on. And whoever cast Dan Hedaya in this movie, please quit the business and see if Burger King is hiring. Dan, if you are listening, STAY OUT OF ACTION MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!!! You are a funny guy at times, but the Alien series is no place for it!!! And Winona, next time you attach yourself to such a horrorible piece of filmwork, please shoplift the script before shooting starts and explain to the world that you were saving it from the cruelty of this picture. Bottom line, this movie is right there next to Dude, Where's My Car, also known as Someone Was Doing Some Major Crack When They Green-Lighted This Movie And Will Smoke A Turd In Hell Because Of It.
