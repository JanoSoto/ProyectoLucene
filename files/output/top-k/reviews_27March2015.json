Indeed Return of the Jedi is off to a bit of a bad start because it's intention is to finish off this particular trilogy and saga, and thus we all know the ending will involve the heroes saving the day and destroying the baddies (although it could really have taken us for a ride of confusion by having the bad guys winning instead, but that may have been a bit too dark as closure to the Star Wars saga). Indeed the dark ending to Empire Strikes Back took many by surprise, with the good guys essentially not winning, but that's what many consider to be the winning trump card of that film, the fact that it didn't take the conventional path of stopping the villain and saving the day, but this doesn't make Return of the Jedi a bad movie, in fact it's the exact opposite.So what's the blurb? In the years following Episode V, the Empire has created yet another Death Star, and prepares for the arrival of their illustrious leader, the Emperor. Meanwhile, Luke and the gang are on a mission to rescue Han Solo from the clutches of the evil gangster Jabba the Hutt. After rescuing him, the group once again go their separate ways as Luke returns to Dagobah and an ailing Jedi Master Yoda to complete his training, whilst Han and the group join the Rebel Alliance fleet, destined to launch one last desperate assault on the Death Star to destroy both it and the Emperor.To my mind, there is very little wrong with this movie. Again it takes elements from the previous films and takes them up a notch like a good sequel should. The action is just as fun, and the effects have once again been improved no end to give us a thrilling final battle in the skies above Endor. At the same time the characters continue to be developed and their relationship between one another remains true, making you want them to succeed all the more. Indeed a few added elements could be perceived as unwelcome, such as Leia in her scantily clad harem outfit, and the Ewoks being able to take down a mechanised army of gun wielding Stormtroopers and AT-ST walkers with rocks and sticks, but to be brutally honest I didn't find them too distracting, not detracting from the overall story, which is indeed the best part.The story is largely based around the redemption of Darth Vader and bringing him back from the Dark Side. The section towards the end in the Emperor's Throne Room is especially intense, and there is a true amount of tension between the characters, especially Luke, who must try to rescue his father from evil whilst not allowing himself to be consumed at the same time.Overall, this is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie, perhaps not as dark as Episode V, but with a gripping story and amazing special effects that will keep you glued to it for the entire running time. As a kid I loved it, as an adult I love it even more, and I'd recommend it to you all!

While many consider it to be a dumbing down of the movie it was based on, the 1987 art-house film called 'Wings of Desire', there still are a few touching elements to this film that keep it afloat. But at the same time there are a lot of things that really don't do it any justice.So what's the sketch? Nicolas Cage plays an Angel named Seth, who, like the other Angels, watch over humanity and act in many different ways to protect them. In one of their many roles, Seth plays the Angel of Death, taking the spirits of those who have passed and guiding them to everlasting paradise. Whilst overlooking the desperate attempts of a surgeon named Maggie (played by Meg Ryan) to give a man life-threatening surgery, he is amazed by her determination to keep the man alive, even though her efforts are ultimately in vain. Seth soon forms an attachment to her, and makes himself known, soon desiring to give up his Angelic stature to become human so he can live his life with his new found love.First, let's talk about the bad stuff. Nicolas Cage, although a very good actor, wouldn't have been my first choice. He doesn't really look or sound the part, my preference being to him in action movies such as the Rock and Con-Air. His scenes come off less romantic and more, well, creepy. Meg Ryan plays her part well though as the determined surgeon, pulling off her lines and role in a way you can find believable.The next big problem is the story, which is quite literal and not particularly subtle. Although there are quiet moments and subtle scenes in it, these are offset by Seth taking a literal fall from a tall building to denote his Fallen Angel status, truncated moments later by a brutal mugging. The ultimate goal of Seth is also a bit more 'shallow' to my mind, with his motivation to be with Maggie not being based on a long lasting and loving relationship, but immediately with them losing their clothes and making friendly under the covers. Indeed sex is one of the most serious commitments to any relationship short of marriage, it does seem like a bit of a rush to that particular finishing line, which I found rather jarring.But what about good stuff, of which there is quite a bit. The emotional scenes are played really quite well, especially the death of a young girl at the beginning and her guidance to Heaven by Seth, as well as a tragic but somewhat predictable passing later in the movie.But for me the best part of this entire movie is the soundtrack, with the absolute gem that is Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls being well worth the price of admission!So, to summarise, this movie is really a movie with its heart in the right place, but some of the routes taken to that particular heart being a little, well, risky. Whilst Nicolas Cage, the unsubtle nature of the story and some of the predictability can take you out of it, the emotional scenes, human interaction and that fantastic soundtrack was enough to see me through this film!Definitely a brain-disengaged movie, but a good film for a rainy Saturday afternoon!

Everything in it, the story, the acting, the action scenes, just seem to be bog standard and on autopilot. Characters have no emotion, the relationship between them is impossible to believe, the story is like a road trip that takes us from planet to planet, truncated by unrealistic love scene or the occasional CGI action scene, and there's just nothing you can really take home from it, no quotes, no memorable moments, it's just dull.What's the story? 10 years after the Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker has grown to become a Jedi Padawan under the wing of Obi- Wan Kenobi. After arriving from Naboo, former Queen Padme Amidala's ship is destroyed and her guard killed in an attempted assassination attempt. Very soon the Jedi duo are split up, with Obi-Wan tracing the assassin, and Anakin sent to watch over Padme, whilst a rather sporadic love blossoms between them.So what specifically is wrong with this movie. Well, the characters are the most jarring part. Nothing about them seems to be human. Obi- Wan's relationship with Anakin as the supposed 'Good Friend' mentioned in Star Wars Episode IV only lasts about 20 seconds in the elevator at the beginning before Anakin turns into a back-chatting and easily aggravated monotone teenager, rather than the timeless and noble warrior we'd previously believed. He loses his temper over everything, anything he's questioned on he challenges and apparently has a real problem with authority figures. He acts more like a 15 year old with headphones stuck to his ears playing The Smashing Pumpkins on a 24 hour loop!Next, the love story. We're meant to believe that Anakin and Padme are to have a loving relationship, even though it's forbidden as Jedi aren't allowed to fall in love. Apart from the obvious 'why can't Jedi fall in love?' question, which Yoda answers (to a point) in the next film as attachment has something to do with greed, and fear, and yadda yadda yadda, this relationship of theirs has absolutely nothing to make us believe it. Anakin acts angrily to everything, and moans about how he's being torn apart by love and duty, when in fact love is much more complicated than just reciting basic Romeo and Juliet. The most believable love is where two characters get to know each other over the course of the movie, and eventually start to commit themselves further about three-quarters of the way through.In this film, their relationship seems to be based solely on physical beauty rather than personalities and character traits, of which they have none apart from those used to further the story, which does take you out of it somewhat!As for the story, it's pretty standard. Catch the bad guy, jet across the ocean of stars, etc, etc. Some of the action scenes, while intense and still maintaining a fairly good bit of CGI, do go on a touch, especially towards the end in the Arena and the Hangar bay fight. Speaking of which, who the heck was Count Dooku?! Was he a baddie? I mean, he gives away the fact that Darth Sidious is controlling the Senate to Obi-Wan, and then asks Obi-Wan to join him to destroy the Sith. I know it's all a big con, but it just comes right out of nowhere, and also, how come Obi-Wan and the other Jedi don't pickup immediately on his statement about the Senate? I mean they may not like to believe that Chancellor Palpatine is a Dark Lord of the Sith, but they could always check, it may turn out to be rather enlightening, and would perhaps stop your entire religion being wiped out in the next movie!Bottom line, this movie seems to be on a nonsensical autopilot. The story is standard, the love story is impossible to believe, the relationship between Master and Apprentice is based on sarcastic jives and adolescent rage, and the action scenes are a bit of a drag.

Apart from the obvious 'why can't Jedi fall in love?' question, which Yoda answers (to a point) in the next film as attachment has something to do with greed, and fear, and yadda yadda yadda, this relationship of theirs has absolutely nothing to make us believe it. Anakin acts angrily to everything, and moans about how he's being torn apart by love and duty, when in fact love is much more complicated than just reciting basic Romeo and Juliet. The most believable love is where two characters get to know each other over the course of the movie, and eventually start to commit themselves further about three-quarters of the way through.In this film, their relationship seems to be based solely on physical beauty rather than personalities and character traits, of which they have none apart from those used to further the story, which does take you out of it somewhat!As for the story, it's pretty standard. Catch the bad guy, jet across the ocean of stars, etc, etc. Some of the action scenes, while intense and still maintaining a fairly good bit of CGI, do go on a touch, especially towards the end in the Arena and the Hangar bay fight. Speaking of which, who the heck was Count Dooku?! Was he a baddie? I mean, he gives away the fact that Darth Sidious is controlling the Senate to Obi-Wan, and then asks Obi-Wan to join him to destroy the Sith. I know it's all a big con, but it just comes right out of nowhere, and also, how come Obi-Wan and the other Jedi don't pickup immediately on his statement about the Senate? I mean they may not like to believe that Chancellor Palpatine is a Dark Lord of the Sith, but they could always check, it may turn out to be rather enlightening, and would perhaps stop your entire religion being wiped out in the next movie!Bottom line, this movie seems to be on a nonsensical autopilot. The story is standard, the love story is impossible to believe, the relationship between Master and Apprentice is based on sarcastic jives and adolescent rage, and the action scenes are a bit of a drag. I wouldn't recommend this movie outside of it being just a film you can turn your brain off to and enjoy the pretty images.

Clark receives a psychic call and goes to the farm, where he finds a green glowing crystal. and decides to leave for the Arctic, where he throws the crystal into the distance and watches as it builds the Fortress of Solitude. after 12 years of education, Kal-El leaves the Fortress with his powers fully developed. and this is where the stupidity starts, as he is hired at the Daily Planet while meeting Lois Lane. Clark develops romantic feelings for her, but Lois sees him as awkward and unsophisticated.
