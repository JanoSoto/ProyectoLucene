First off, Scream was a horror-savvy thriller about a killer terrorizing teens in a small California city by quizzing them on horror movies by cell phone.  I Know What You Did Last Summer does feature teens getting stalked and slaughtered, but the circumstances are completely different, so it may be a bit unfair to compare this to Scream.You all probably know the plot four beautiful teens, Julie (JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT), Helen (SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR), Barry (RYAN PHILLIPPE) and Ray (FREDDIE PRINZE, JR.) are making out on a sandy beach on the night of July 4 while celebrating beauty queen Helen's Croaker Queen win in the seaside fishing village of Southport, North Carolina.  On the drive home, the drunken Barry distracts Ray, the designated driver, and they do something unspeakable they hit someone.What follows is where the four have to decide their fates and futures. Should they turn themselves in and ruin their futures?  Or dump the body and vow never to speak of this incident again?  Predictably, they choose the latter.Cut to early July, one year later, and Julie returns home to her lonely mother and an ominous note bearing the titular words.  Julie, in a panic, tracks down her cohorts-in-crime and they soon come up with two major suspects Max (JOHNNY GALECKI), a loser fisherman with a thing for Julie, and Elsa (BRIDGETTE WILSON), Helen's bitchy and jealous older sister. After some perfunctory detective work, the two girls add another name to the list Missy Egan (ANNE HECHE), the saddened sister of the man they hit.A lot of things happen that tell the teens that someone does indeed know what they did last summer and is exacting revenge.  Barry is run over by his own car, Helen's hair (her most prized possession) is chopped off, and Julie gets a gruesome surprise in the trunk of her car.  Now, as the Fourth of July approaches once again, the four must find out who knows what they did last summer...The acting is a mixed bag.  Jennifer Love Hewitt (and Her Cleavage) does a pretty good job in the first half of the movie, anchoring it with a nice solid turn as the troubled Julie.  Unfortunately, the second half allows Julie to do incredibly dumb things as well as making her so uptight we can barely stand her.  The same goes for Sarah Michelle Gellar (and Her Cleavage), as she plays Helen as the confused beauty queen who's never had to face such a stressful situation before in her life, but then as just another generic ditz from any 1980s horror movie.  Ryan Phillippe (and His Pecs) plays his part with some flash as the guy with the most unrealistic attitude.  Finally, Freddie Prinze, Jr. (and His Pecs) as Ray seems to have trouble emoting and his dialogue seems wooden coming out of his mouth.Strangely, I found the supporting characters more interesting and wished they were fleshed out more.  Johnny Galecki as Max is surprisingly good as the bitter guy longing for the girl he can't get.  Bridgette Wilson is little more than an extra but, for some reason, her jealousy to Helen seemed justified and I found myself wishing at the end of the movie that both Max and Elsa survived.  Finally, Anne Heche gives the best performance in the movie as Missy in only two scenes and five minutes of screen time.  The four central teens aren't entirely innocent and they do deserve some punishment, but the deaths of Max and Elsa are unjustified, since both of these people have done nothing wrong and are completely innocent and oblivious to the car wreck.The direction of the movie by Scotsman Jim Gillespie is quite slick and the first half is quite good at showing us these multidimensional '90s teens with their bright futures whose lives are suddenly shattered with the car wreck.  The standoff between the four where they have to decide their futures is the most tense scene in the movie and Gillespie handles it very well.  Unfortunately, the only notable bit of the second half is from Helen's climactic and ultimately tragic chase scene in her family's department store, and the killer's revelation makes almost no sense.  The movie presents itself as a whodunit mystery, but then the killer turns out to be someone we've never even met, let alone suspected.The movie's big flaw (since it IS horror) is that none of the scares are built up.  It's always just a series of jump scenes punctuated by loud musical cues (supplied by John Debney), and none of it equals real terror, which is slowly built up, as in Scream or Halloween.  The movie isn't entirely bad, it just needs work.  I saw this on opening day in October 1997, and like most other Scream fans, was a little disappointed since it turned out to be the type of film Scream mocked.  I did have fun watching this, as I think everyone else most likely will too.  So do yourself a favor and rent this, just don't expect a horror masterpiece.

Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight,' written and directed by Karyn Kusama.  Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn, facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester.  She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go.  She lives with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom she has a very tentative relationship, and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago).  With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.  Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons.  When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money.  Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.  It's an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better.  And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in `gender blind' competitions, does not faze her in the least.  Diana has found her element.\tFirst time writer\/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere.  And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, `I was a fighter once.  I lost.'  Then, looking around the busy gym, `Like most of these guys, they're going to lose, too.  But it's all they know--'  And it's that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is.  It's a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.\tMaking her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves.  She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?  Whatever it is, it works.  It's a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation.  She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.\tAs positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there's no indication of where she's headed.  Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?  After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it's arms to women.  And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate.\tThe supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira).  Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of `Girlfight,' that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring.

Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight,' written and directed by Karyn Kusama.  Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn, facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester.  She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go.  She lives with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom she has a very tentative relationship, and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago).  With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.  Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons.  When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money.  Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.  It's an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better.  And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in `gender blind' competitions, does not faze her in the least.  Diana has found her element.\tFirst time writer\/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere.  And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, `I was a fighter once.  I lost.'  Then, looking around the busy gym, `Like most of these guys, they're going to lose, too.  But it's all they know--'  And it's that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is.  It's a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.\tMaking her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves.  She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?  Whatever it is, it works.  It's a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation.  She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.\tAs positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there's no indication of where she's headed.  Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?  After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it's arms to women.  And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate.\tThe supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira).  Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of `Girlfight,' that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring.  That aside, it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience.

The story is really secondary, and only serves as an excuse for some decent martial arts action (which nevertheless doesn't, thankfully, take over, and for some frivolity between Chan and Owen Wilson (playing the outlaw Roy O'Bannon, with whom Chon Wang teams up.)There are some decent enough laughs here (I especially liked the drinking game O'Bannon plays with Chon while in the bathtub), and you have to give some credit to a movie that allows you to fall asleep for ten minutes (I confess that I did) and pick right up without feeling as if you've missed a beat. (At the same time the wordplay on Chon Wang\/John Wayne got very old very fast.)Lucy Liu was, I thought, unfortunately underused. She was extremely well cast (mind you, that was probably not difficult since there are not exactly scores of young, attractive Chinese actresses in Hollywood.) Liu possesses a mysterious and exotic beauty that lends itself to the image of royalty, but she wasn't really given very much to do in a movie that revolved around Chan and Wilson.By all means take a look at this. It's enjoyable, funny, has plenty of action. Not a classic by any means, but I still rated it 6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"24 April 2001","score":"","review":"  This is a good movie.

My anime-loving friends urged me to introduce myself to the genre with either Akira or Princess Mononoke or even My Friend Totoro. Since my friends only had Akira on video, I chose that. I watched this in November 2000, so please forgive me for forgetting the character names.Right away, my viewing frame of mind fell once the English soundtrack came squealing its way through my sound system. What is it about US distributors of Asian movies? Why do they think we want to hear grown women talking in baby imitations? I'd much rather read subtitles and hear the original soundtrack than these peevish, cartoony caricatures.When my friends had hyped the incredibly detailed, fluid animation style that put American animation to shame, I looked forward to seeing it. In fact, every review here seems to glorify the skill and talent of the animators. Although the frames did contain a lot of detailed artistry and a large number of independently animated objects, the movement was jerky as all hell. It was very easy to see where the frames were linked. It was like playing an action game on a PC when it gets overloaded trying to keep up with the game. Disney may be pablum for the masses, but its theatrical releases certainly are a hundred times more smoothly animated than Akira.I had to put the viewing experience aside and concentrate on the plot, theme, and characters. I've done it enough times in the age of VHS rentals, so it was no problem here. I found that the character development for everyone except the protagonist was weak and shallow. I never could understand any motivation for the erratic behavior of the friend. Now, this is more like an American movie than some cutting-edge Asian import.The plot.. well, very poorly explained, especially the last 20 minutes. I think I understood the ending of 2001 better the first time I saw it. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is no explanation for what happens at the end of this movie. Those of you who have seen it will understand... bigger and bigger and bigger... why? Just to be grotesque?Finally, the theme made sense to me. Our world faces great danger from our misunderstanding of technology and humanity's preoccupation with it. We will be our own downfall if we are not careful. Good message, I get it.So, overall, I gave it 4\/10. I thought it was sloppy in direction and the story was utterly lacking in interest. Those of you here (and on the video jacket) who compared this film favorably with Blade Runner are, in my opinion, not paying very much attention to Blade Runner. That is a hugely superior film to this.Finally, as to My Friend Totoro, I saw it too. It had the same problems with animation jerkiness as this does. Is Princess Mononoke going to let me down too?

There is an unbuilt conflict in Conan  Doyle between 'Watson' and 'Holmes', which is given a twist by the real author's notorious dissatisfaction with his creation, and his many attempts to murder him.  Although Holmes is often seen as the archetypal figure of order, the reassuring interpreter of chaos and crime, he is also a creature of the fin de siecle, a drug-taking, atonal violin-playing, mad-scientist decadent.  This duality was the theme of Wilder's masterpiece 'the Private life of Sherlock Holmes', with which this film shares a comic, revisionist tone, and at least one plot twist.  Both films emphasise the figure of Sherlock Holmes as a role, something to be played for the public, masking a real person at odds with both role and his society.  In 'without a clue', there is no 'real' Holmes, he is literally a role played by the inept theatrical ham, Reginald Kincaid, the sort of character Vincent Price played in films like 'Theatre of Blood'.  The allusion is not gratuituous - both films make the theatre their central thematic motif, climaxing in an old theatre, site of the actor's greatest humiliation, in which he attempts  redemption.

The film's best scene occurs when Watson dies - an eerie, nocturnal scene that moves from misty Victorian Conan Doyle to the metaphysical world of Borges; Holmes the role must live as a man without his creator, in a Godless world.

These two sets of metaphors - religion and theatre - culminate in the finale, set in the Orpheum, named after the poet who ventured into the underworld (a pun here on hell and the criminal fraternity), host to Kincaid's last performance, 'Shadow of Death', a multi-reference to the Psalms, Holmes himself (one of Basil Rathbone's films) and, again, a whiff of Borges.  The ceiling of a theatre, from which Holmes descends, and which constantly defeats Leslie (herself playing a role) is called the 'gods' the lighting by fire and the ultimate conflagration suggest hell.That this rich stew - about acting; creating; the role of the popular press; the police; the link between detection and voyeurism\/misogyny; metaphysics; identity and gender; doubles (after all, Watson the creator, must play a role as the 'dim' sidekick); the Victorian age ('respectable' society's reliance on 'irregular' help from 'urchins'; Watson's strait-laced austerity contrasted with Holmes' indulgence of every appetite) - should result in such a funny film is remarkable.  Its true entertainment lies less in the filming (at one stage a boom glares at the top of the frame in a porto-Dogme moment of self-referentiality), the 'economic' recreation of 1900 London, or the tendancy to caricature in supporting roles, or the sometimes ill-advised 'visual' humour, than the two marvellous, gleeful central preformances, Kingsley's clipped, constipated, infuriated genius, and Caine's wonderfully lecherous, hammy drunk.

Well congratulations, Burt, on number three.`Driven' is so awful on so many levels, it's actually hard to remember all of them after the movie's over. First of all, there's the characters. They could be cardboard cutouts, except someone forgot to cut them out in other words, although their lives are as clichéd as their dialogue, we're not even given enough details about them to fully form the clichés.To start with, there's Stallone's character, an ex racecar driver who blew it on the track and at home. He apparently caused some big accident which ruined his career, and which may or may not have paralysed his old friend Burt Reynolds, who now owns a racing team. The exact details are never made clear. He also apparently walked out on his wife leaving her bitter and resentful, although again, exactly what happened is never explained. Then there's Jimmy Bly, played by the guy from `Remember the Titant', the hot young driver who just can't take the pressure because he's not `doing it for himself', although exactly why he can't take the pressure is again, never fully explained. And then there's Simone, played (nominally) by Estella Warren, who supposedly works for this other driver but never appears to actually do anything. Oh yeah, and there's a journalist woman, played by nobody,  who falls for Sly after he woos her over a hot game of pool, a cinematic device that hasn't been used in, oh, about three days.Part of the problem is that the characters never get to interact with each other for more than about three seconds before being interrupted by either another gratuitous title card (Japan Three Days Before the Race, Italy Six Minutes Before The Race, etc) or another car accident in which bad CGI junk flies toward the camera and Renny Harlin indulges in sub-John Woo camera tricks which don't work.Then there's the acting. Stallone and Reynolds look awful. Stallone's face resembles a grocery bag that's been kicked around a parking lot for a couple of hours. Burt's had so many facelifts his skin no longer moves. Not that the script helps, but both are awful. So are Estella Warren and the guy from 'Remember the Titans' there's this hillarious scene where they flirt by a swimming pool and since neither has any charisma to speak of, they just talk in monotones, looking morosely pretty, and the overall effect is like watching a CK One ad in hell. Only Gina Gershon comes out of it OK, using her one decently-written scene as Sly's ex-wife where she rages at him to show us she can act. After that, her character turns into a TURBOBITCH!!!!!! And she gamely plays along, chewing the scenery and wearing her TURBOBITCH!!!!!! hat with style.But the funniest scene in the whole movie comes when there's a car crash during a race and the guy from `Remember the Titans' turns his car around, drives back up the track, dodging all the oncoming cars, pulls up and saves the other driver BEFORE the emergency crews get there. The car stuff doesn't even bear talking about there are so many factual and continuity errors (you can't drive racecars on public roads, the tyres will explode, a car that's already exploded will not explode again because all the fuel in the fuel tanks will have burnt off, etc) that all the sequences are laughable. The CGI is really obvious too.Perhaps Sly and Burt could team up again for `The Cannonball Run III' after all, a cannonball is only one step away from being a bomb, and they seem pretty damn good at making those.

It is perhaps doubly disappointing then that after more than five years in pre-production all they have managed to come up with is this relatively mediocre road-trip movie which exalts Karaoke's power to change people's lives for the better. Directed by Gwyneth Paltrow's father Duets tells the story of six desperately unhappy individuals who decide to cast off the shackles of their pre-determined lives and look for something better. The metaphor for all this we are assured is Karaoke the courage to stand up, sing up and be heard.Taking a big leaf out of the Robert Altman book of filmmaking Bruce Paltrow has chosen to split Duets into three separate storylines There's the story of Liz (Gwyneth Paltrow) an unbelievably naive Vegas showgirl who has to learn to build a relationship with her long-lost hustler father Ricky (Huey Lewis) after meeting him for the first time at her mother's funeral. Then there's the tale of Suzi (Maria Bello), a streetwise hussy who will do anything to make it big and Billy (Scott Speedman) a down-on-his-luck taxi driver she convinces to drive her halfway across the country in search of stardom at any cost. And last, but by no means least, there's the hilarious story of Todd (Paul Giamatti) a burned out travelling salesman on the edge of a nervous breakdown and his unlikely friendship with Reggie (Andre Braugher) an escaped convict with the voice of an angel and a chip on his shoulder the size of Texas. Inevitably all involved wind up crossing paths in Omaha, where a big Karaoke Contest is offering a Grand Prize. The question is who will win and unlike many films of this elk one is never really sure.All six principle actors turn in better than average performances and all except Braugher, who couldn't reach some of the higher notes, sing unaided. The chemistry between Paltrow and 80s pop star Lewis works well with Paltrow more than holding her own on the musical front.  Relative newcomers Bello and Speedman also do well, both showing signs that suggest we'll be seeing a lot more of them in the future. But the film's spotlight is taken by the fantastic pairing of Giamatti and Braugher. At first their characters appear to be too at odds to ever really hit it off, but as the movie progresses it soon becomes clear that they share a deep affinity, they both know what it is like to have lived in a cage, Braugher in prison and Giamatti in middle-class suburbia. Places neither of them ever want to return.Considering this is Bruce Paltrow's first major film Duets has turned out surprisingly well. The direction is relatively unobtrusive and the stories that unfold are often amusing, sometimes compelling and always entertaining. Indeed, the one scene in which Giamatti and Braugher offer their rendition of Ottis Reading's Try a Little Tenderness is truly spell bounding and well worth the price of admission alone.However, Paltrow's clear favouritism for certain characters over others and the fact that the performances of Giamatti and Braugher are light years ahead of the rest means that the film often seems unbalanced and a little disjointed, kind of like a duet between Jane MacDonald and Madonna.
