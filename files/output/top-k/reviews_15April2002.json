I can't really justify it because anyone would be hard pushed to acclaim Waking the Dead as the GREATEST film of all time (ever...TM). And I've had many friends sit and watch it and then personally throw insults at me because they hated it so much. But I don't care because whenever I watch this movie it gets me every time.The first time I saw it I was really moved by it (and I HATE spurious romantic movies) but I still had some serious reservations. Large parts didn't make sense to me, many questions remained unanswered why did Sarah leave Fielding if she loved him so much? If Fielding really was going crazy during the senatorial campaign then how did he keep it together? Why did Sarah return to Fielding at the end only to leave him again?The end part just didn't sit right and I thought that that was a bit slack for a film that marketed itself as intelligent take on a romantic drama.But having watched it a couple more times I'm satisfied that there is nothing wrong with the film at all. I think the way Sarah drifts away from Fielding is very realistic, and if you watch closely it certainly doesn't just happen out of the blue. Certainly, it's quite unfair on Fielding as he is put in some very difficult positions because of her. She is continually testing him to explore the level of his political hypocrisy and self-deception when it comes to 'doing some good' when he gets to power. And he fails every time...Some people have complained that it is stupid and unrealistic that Sarah would fake her own death (admittedly a supremely deceitful act) and risk losing Fielding for ever. But its clear that she thinks she's lost him to the corridors of power by the time she takes the fateful trip to Minneapolis. Anyone who thinks it unlikely that someone would choose political conviction over a lover is clearly a product of these intensely depoliticised times. Bear in mind that Fielding would have entered an administration that had engineered and sustained the Chilean regime that was responsible for countless crimes against humanity that Sarah had witnessed and which Fielding largely chose to ignore.What raises this movie above any other romantic drama is the utterly extraordinary acting. Jennifer Connolly is never any less than excellent in my opinion but she really outdoes herself here. If she hadn't been convincing in this extremely complicated role then the movie would have failed.One scene really stands out the scene where she verbally attacks Ellis, the guy who wrote an article defending the Pinochet regime in Chile. Literally trembling with anger and frustration, Connolly launches into a tirade that is both brave and totally convincing. If this scene hadn't been so stirring then it would have looked like a callous attempt to wreck Fielding's career. But Connolly handles it so beautifully that she makes it clear that Sarah and Fielding's relationship is all but doomed. Billy Crudup, however, is even more amazing. Playing a normally very stable and upright person having a nervous breakdown is not easy but Fielding's sorrow, frustration and confusion is totally convincing, and at times, heartbreaking. The scene that really stands out here is the dinner scene where he loses control after the election. It's absolutely shattering. I know several people who have had breakdowns due to depression and from what I've seen Crudup perfectly encapsulates all the sadness and anger that is capable of driving people out of their minds.OK, OK... the end bit isn't too satisfactory. The idea that Fielding is doing 'some good' by answering a few begging letters is a bit of a cop out. If he was really doing the 'good' that Sarah wanted, then he would have been making some attempt to uncover the shady dealings of his pay masters surrounding Chile. It's also inferred that she may be in a relationship with Steve (the priest she works with) but this is never resolved. Why? It's clear that Steve loves her, but he remains a peripheral character. Also, Fielding would be unlikely to suddenly be cured just because Sarah came back to him for one night. If I was him, I'd be more screwed up then ever if she did that to me.Nonetheless, Waking the Dead remains one of the most beautiful, even handed and intelligent movies I have ever seen.If you're in love with someone, if you used to be, or if you just wish you were - watch it, you might learn something.

Well, Bill Paxton's FRAILTY is such a film and if you like thrillers that are weightier than your average Hollywood fare, there's a lot to recommend it besides its depth of thought. FRAILTY is a movie about a serial killer (God's Hands) and a man (played by Matthew McConaughy) who claims to know the killer's true identity. Most of the film is told in flashbacks while McConaughy tells his story to FBI Agent  Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe), recalling how his father (Bill Paxton) indoctrinated his brother and himself into his bizarre beliefs. One of the things that first time director Paxton does brilliantly in this film is that he is very careful about the way he depicts violence. There are more than enough opportunities to send even the sturdiest filmgoer screaming from the theater in disgust, but Paxton downplays the visual side of the violence in all but a couple of instances, focusing instead on the reactions of the characters to the murders. Paxton chooses not to go for the cheap gross-out, opting instead to disturb us on a far more subtle level.And, to talk about the subtleties of the film, you have to deal with the performances. Paxton, McConaughy and Boothe may be the stars of the film, but the film's best (and most disturbing) performances come from the kids. Paxton manages to coax performances from child actors Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter that are not only heart-wrenching, but totally believable, a job that is worthy of praise from any director. The boys' characters never seem forced and their reactions to the horrors they are presented with  are very different.. and very telling.Another of the `firsts' in this film, aside from Paxton's directorial debut, is a screenplay from Brent Hanley, who gives us a screenplay with as many twists and turns as a good Texas back-country road, which also happens to be where Hanley sets his story. Going into the film, this was an aspect of FRAILTY that I was very interested in. Since Paxton, McConaughy and Boothe are all three Texans, I was curious as to how the Lone Star state would be depicted. Later I was disappointed to find out that the entire movie was shot on location in California, but many of the scenes in the movie look a lot like what you might really find in Texas. If you were to squint really hard, that is. But when all is said and done, what matters most is that FRAILTY leaves you thinking about some important questions and the fact that it doesn't give any easy answers. In fact, some of the questions are deliberately (or so I suppose) left hanging, making this a film that will stick with audiences a long time after the lights have come up.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"15 April 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"       Werner Herzog is a hard filmmaker to pin down.  Not overtly political, like many of his contemporaries in the New German Cinema, it is also difficult to figure out what exactly Herzog's films are about, other than what we see on the surface.  Actually, Herzog's films are so ravishingly poetic, so mysterious and awe inspiring, that we know they must be about more that what we are seeing on screen, even though he gives us very few overt clues as to what his message is.  To me this makes him a very intriguing director.  Of course not every one holds my opinion, many people, including friends and other people I respect, have criticized  Herzog as self indulgent and\/or regressive. I understand how they could see this, although I strongly disagree.   However, this is not a gushing appreciation of Herzog or an attack on his critics.  This is just a way for me to explore one of my favorite films, &#150; The Vampyre and find out how it is way more than just the story of a lonely vampire looking for love.      Herzog's film is, of course, a remake of\/homage to F.W Murnau's silent classic, Nosferatu &#150; A Symphony of Terror.  But where the first film is a simple (although beautifully told) tale of good versus evil, Herzog uses the first film as a springboard for a commentary on (among other things) the Expressionist and Romantic art movements.  It is on this that I will focus my journal entry.  The original film, although considered a milestone in Expressionist film making, actually contains relatively less expressionistic traits than most other works of art from the movement.  One main feature of expressionistic art was the distortion of perspective, usually created through the use of clearly artificial sets.  Murnau creates the feeling of distortion not through the sets, but through the way in which he films them, and the stylized acting.        Today's remakes of popular films are made to cash in on nostalgia, but Herzog's version of Nosferatu is like a class on the nature of expressionism, without actually being an expressionistic film.  Visually it borrows much more from the romantic traditions of art, with its use of chiaroscuro lighting and use of deep, rolling landscapes.  However, the presence of expressionism is felt throughout.

Not overtly political, like many of his contemporaries in the New German Cinema, it is also difficult to figure out what exactly Herzog's films are about, other than what we see on the surface.  Actually, Herzog's films are so ravishingly poetic, so mysterious and awe inspiring, that we know they must be about more that what we are seeing on screen, even though he gives us very few overt clues as to what his message is.  To me this makes him a very intriguing director.  Of course not every one holds my opinion, many people, including friends and other people I respect, have criticized  Herzog as self indulgent and\/or regressive. I understand how they could see this, although I strongly disagree.   However, this is not a gushing appreciation of Herzog or an attack on his critics.  This is just a way for me to explore one of my favorite films, &#150; The Vampyre and find out how it is way more than just the story of a lonely vampire looking for love.      Herzog's film is, of course, a remake of\/homage to F.W Murnau's silent classic, Nosferatu &#150; A Symphony of Terror.  But where the first film is a simple (although beautifully told) tale of good versus evil, Herzog uses the first film as a springboard for a commentary on (among other things) the Expressionist and Romantic art movements.  It is on this that I will focus my journal entry.  The original film, although considered a milestone in Expressionist film making, actually contains relatively less expressionistic traits than most other works of art from the movement.  One main feature of expressionistic art was the distortion of perspective, usually created through the use of clearly artificial sets.  Murnau creates the feeling of distortion not through the sets, but through the way in which he films them, and the stylized acting.        Today's remakes of popular films are made to cash in on nostalgia, but Herzog's version of Nosferatu is like a class on the nature of expressionism, without actually being an expressionistic film.  Visually it borrows much more from the romantic traditions of art, with its use of chiaroscuro lighting and use of deep, rolling landscapes.

I turned the tables on her, however, my enjoying this movie, and with good reason.I have never read the book, and in either case I have no idea what correlation exists between the title and the story, but I do know this about the movie, it is a good story that is competently acted by the principals.  Shane West is good at pouting at authority and even better at showing steely resolve when someone dares to believe in him.  Mandy Moore easily sells her role as the quiet but confident church mouse, but I think she cheats by having those big brown eyes.  The dialog is not perfect but manages to make its point and move the story forward.  Personally I think if dialog is good enough you need to go back and make it great, but the story itself, while a bit cliched and contrived, glosses over the holes in the dialog.The movie starts off rather hard-edged and typical of Varsity Blues-type teen movies, but the opening scene is an antithesis to the rest of the story.  It is so disjointed that it almost seems out of place, probably because it was not in the book (I'm told), but it can be dismissed as necessary to get us acquainted with the fact that these teens are going headlong down the path to trouble.  Once that's out of the way, we can actually start examining the characters.West seems angry at everybody, probably because his dad left him and his mom is Daryl Hannah in a bad wig.  Add his desire to be cool with his friends, mostly by pretending not to care what people think (a dichotomy that only makes sense if you're cool), and you have a kid only to happy to glare at everybody.Moore is a preacher's daughter who inexplicably sees West and finds in him an inner strength that no one else sees.  The film suggests that it's because nobody else is looking for it, a subtle undertone about the times.  It goes without saying that they fall in love, and there is a major tragic plot twist in the final third of the movie that has the whole theater blubbering by end credits.The dirty little secret of this movie is that the story is not about the couple, but about West and his character's redemption.  The undertones of faith and charity scream for a religious message, but for better or worse, there is no actual conversion process in the film.  I was personally disappointed by this, as it seems to suggest redemption by proxy, which is both unbiblical and impractical, but in an age where religion is immediately and unfairly linked with prosletyzing, it's a compromise I will have to live with.Having said this, the final portion of the movie seemed a bit drawn out and misdirected.  Time spent languishing over the principals, their tragedy and their resolve (a bit mature and dry-eyed for 18-year-olds), could have been invested in West's interaction with supporting characters.  In fact, the supporting cast has been sentenced to the periphery in this film, appearing only now and again to remind us that West and Moore are not the only two people on earth.  Perhaps truncating the later scenes and replacing them with longer scenes involving the supporting characters would have fleshed them out more, and as a result, made the principals more three-dimensional as well.  A good supporting role does not supplant the main story or give the audience something to do between car chases, it enhances the main story.  A bit more of this would have made a really good movie into an outstanding portrait of humanity.I highly recommend anyone who dares to believe, in God, in themselves, in each other, go and see this film.

I remember that every Saturday I would go to the Blockbuster Video and rent Godzilla vs. Gigan or otherwise known as Godzilla on Monster Island. It was my favorite Godzilla movie for numerous reasons.  Along side that, I also rented Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, Terror of Mechagodzilla, Godzilla 1985, and Godzilla vs. Biollante.  After that, as the Internet was growing increasing popular and easier to use (this was just about four years ago), I would often go to different web sites and basically catalog anything I could get about Godzilla and every single other monster that the Big Guy has ever been affiliated with.  Then, during one of my usual cataloging sessions, I somehow came across an advertisement for the new Americanized version of Godzilla.  I automatically knew that this was going to be good.  I also knew that since this was coming from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin whose two previous films Universal Soldier and Independence Day I was a fan of.  The movie was also going to star Matthew Broderick, who I had been a very big fan of since Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Anyway, I eagerly waited for that special day (May 19, 1998) to come. Finally, the big day came and I went to see it.  Boy I was blown away by this masterpiece.  It had everything I expected from it action, more action, and the brand new Godzilla.  I came out of that movie theater a very proud customer.  During this films run at the movie theaters, I saw Godzilla a total of six times, each time getting better and better. Also during this time, I grabbed up every single piece of literature about the movie as I could get as well as the films soundtrack, which featured music from P. Diddy (who people need to just back up off of) and The Wallflowers. I even bought the action figures (only the Godzilla and his offspring, forgot the human action figures).  Then I patiently waited for the VHS to be released.  That day came and I got the VHS.  It was just as good as it was in the theater.But that was then (1998) and this is now (2002).  That is four long years and believe me, a lot happened during this timeI've recently and very carefully looked back at those years (1990-1998) and I wonder, what happened?  You must also remember that this is coming from a DIE HARD Godzilla fan.  Ever since all the hype from this movie died, I feel so did a piece of my childhood (I'm only 16).  I've been reading some of the bad and good things about this film and I feel that I agree with some of them.  My readings have brought me to several of the following conclusions about this movie.  My first realization is how Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have tarnished the Godzilla name.  Godzilla has been one of the best things to ever happen to western audiences during the 1950s through the 1990s.  Despite the hilariously bad dubbing and some corny story lines, somewhere inside, there was a lot of fun to be had and some serious topics to be discussed.  Since 1954, Godzilla has basically become an icon and has stood as a testament to the post-World War II era in which nuclear testing on Pacific islands was very common.  Godzilla himself, who is a product of nuclear testing, has stood as a symbol and as a constant reminder of man's tinkering with things that should not be tinkered with.  Godzilla is a menace plain and simple, but somewhere in the mayhem, we saw a truly tragic creature that was only doing what it could to survive simply because of man's carelessness.  This explains why Godzilla acted so fiercely towards newcomers such as King Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla, because he was defending his home.  This brings me to the new Godzilla, which in the movie is nothing more than just a big lizard who eats a lot of fish.  I heard that in an interview with Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, that they had attempted (and with very poor results) to make this Godzilla more like animalized. This basically means that they had tried to make Godzilla seem like the animal he is a lizard.  This Godzilla only defended himself when he felt threatened, ran at the sight of the army instead of stomping them down, was vulnerable to attack (the original wasn't), and lastly, what the hell happened to his atomic blast?  Oh yeah, it was the fire.  The biggest difference between the two Godzillas was the whole with thing with reproduction.  The old Godzilla had only one child, while this Godzilla laid eggs.  What the hell?  I've heard a lot of people pan this, saying that the baby Godzillas look a lot like the raptors from Jurassic Park.My second realization was the somewhat questionable casting.  Matthew Broderick is arguably an obvious choice for this film.  Even with his somewhat geeky looks, he does have the wit and charm of someone who could play a scientist.  Jean Reno plays a French mercenary who is on assignment in New York, who is there to clean up his country?s mistakes, that being Godzilla and his offspring.  Jean Reno is good as a hit man like in the The Professional but not as a mercenary whose only role in this movie is to serve, as someone Matthew Broderick's character has to look to for help. Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who both regularly play characters on the animated show, The Simpsons, are good as the cameraman and sleazy news anchor.  My biggest problem with the both of them is that they aren't given a lot to work with in this movie.  Hank Azaria seems only here as a little comic relief and Harry Shearer is only here as someone to laugh at when he gets told by Maria Pitillo's character.Godzilla is really at best, failed potential.  In the hands of another action director like John Woo or someone around those lines, then maybe this movie may not have turned out to be something so bad.  I mean, I really used to like this movie, but I question the motives behind it.  Aside from all the recently discovered faults that I've found with this movie, I still give it a six out of ten for providing me with the entertainment that I found necessary to satisfy my interests in Godzilla.I still reflect on those days when Godzilla was my idol, my only escape from reality, and the only thing that primarily interested me.

I remember that every Saturday I would go to the Blockbuster Video and rent Godzilla vs. Gigan or otherwise known as Godzilla on Monster Island. It was my favorite Godzilla movie for numerous reasons.  Along side that, I also rented Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, Terror of Mechagodzilla, Godzilla 1985, and Godzilla vs. Biollante.  After that, as the Internet was growing increasing popular and easier to use (this was just about four years ago), I would often go to different web sites and basically catalog anything I could get about Godzilla and every single other monster that the Big Guy has ever been affiliated with.  Then, during one of my usual cataloging sessions, I somehow came across an advertisement for the new Americanized version of Godzilla.  I automatically knew that this was going to be good.  I also knew that since this was coming from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin whose two previous films Universal Soldier and Independence Day I was a fan of.  The movie was also going to star Matthew Broderick, who I had been a very big fan of since Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Anyway, I eagerly waited for that special day (May 19, 1998) to come. Finally, the big day came and I went to see it.  Boy I was blown away by this masterpiece.  It had everything I expected from it action, more action, and the brand new Godzilla.  I came out of that movie theater a very proud customer.  During this films run at the movie theaters, I saw Godzilla a total of six times, each time getting better and better. Also during this time, I grabbed up every single piece of literature about the movie as I could get as well as the films soundtrack, which featured music from P. Diddy (who people need to just back up off of) and The Wallflowers. I even bought the action figures (only the Godzilla and his offspring, forgot the human action figures).  Then I patiently waited for the VHS to be released.  That day came and I got the VHS.  It was just as good as it was in the theater.But that was then (1998) and this is now (2002).  That is four long years and believe me, a lot happened during this timeI've recently and very carefully looked back at those years (1990-1998) and I wonder, what happened?  You must also remember that this is coming from a DIE HARD Godzilla fan.  Ever since all the hype from this movie died, I feel so did a piece of my childhood (I'm only 16).  I've been reading some of the bad and good things about this film and I feel that I agree with some of them.  My readings have brought me to several of the following conclusions about this movie.  My first realization is how Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have tarnished the Godzilla name.  Godzilla has been one of the best things to ever happen to western audiences during the 1950s through the 1990s.  Despite the hilariously bad dubbing and some corny story lines, somewhere inside, there was a lot of fun to be had and some serious topics to be discussed.  Since 1954, Godzilla has basically become an icon and has stood as a testament to the post-World War II era in which nuclear testing on Pacific islands was very common.  Godzilla himself, who is a product of nuclear testing, has stood as a symbol and as a constant reminder of man's tinkering with things that should not be tinkered with.  Godzilla is a menace plain and simple, but somewhere in the mayhem, we saw a truly tragic creature that was only doing what it could to survive simply because of man's carelessness.  This explains why Godzilla acted so fiercely towards newcomers such as King Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla, because he was defending his home.  This brings me to the new Godzilla, which in the movie is nothing more than just a big lizard who eats a lot of fish.  I heard that in an interview with Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, that they had attempted (and with very poor results) to make this Godzilla more like animalized. This basically means that they had tried to make Godzilla seem like the animal he is a lizard.  This Godzilla only defended himself when he felt threatened, ran at the sight of the army instead of stomping them down, was vulnerable to attack (the original wasn't), and lastly, what the hell happened to his atomic blast?  Oh yeah, it was the fire.  The biggest difference between the two Godzillas was the whole with thing with reproduction.  The old Godzilla had only one child, while this Godzilla laid eggs.  What the hell?  I've heard a lot of people pan this, saying that the baby Godzillas look a lot like the raptors from Jurassic Park.My second realization was the somewhat questionable casting.  Matthew Broderick is arguably an obvious choice for this film.  Even with his somewhat geeky looks, he does have the wit and charm of someone who could play a scientist.  Jean Reno plays a French mercenary who is on assignment in New York, who is there to clean up his country?s mistakes, that being Godzilla and his offspring.  Jean Reno is good as a hit man like in the The Professional but not as a mercenary whose only role in this movie is to serve, as someone Matthew Broderick's character has to look to for help. Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, who both regularly play characters on the animated show, The Simpsons, are good as the cameraman and sleazy news anchor.  My biggest problem with the both of them is that they aren't given a lot to work with in this movie.  Hank Azaria seems only here as a little comic relief and Harry Shearer is only here as someone to laugh at when he gets told by Maria Pitillo's character.Godzilla is really at best, failed potential.  In the hands of another action director like John Woo or someone around those lines, then maybe this movie may not have turned out to be something so bad.  I mean, I really used to like this movie, but I question the motives behind it.  Aside from all the recently discovered faults that I've found with this movie, I still give it a six out of ten for providing me with the entertainment that I found necessary to satisfy my interests in Godzilla.I still reflect on those days when Godzilla was my idol, my only escape from reality, and the only thing that primarily interested me.  I really hate to say it, but this movie unfortunately did it for me.  But, despite my newfound un-interest in Godzilla, I still have all of the information and collectibles that I gathered over the years and I occasionally look at them.

I'm not usually a big Kevin Kline fan, Kristin Scott Thomas is WAY too scrawny, and who in the world is Hayden Christensen? (Yes, I live in a cave and didn't know until I looked up info on Life that Mr. Christensen is the next Anakin Skywalker - I have a 4-year-old and don't get out much).SPOILERS COMING UPWhat a movie, though.  I had no pre-conceived notions about Hayden Christensen - I was blown away by his performance.  The change in his character from Goth to (kind of) normal I feel occurred in the 2nd, ahem, shower scene.  You can see Sam's beginning self-awareness of the power to bring pleasure to another person surge through his body, especially the shot through the shower door - tentative kiss to commanding, no other physical contact to full-body embrace.  Come on, we've all been there, totally unsure until we realize, hey, this is pretty great, and the other person seems to be into it too.  With Christensen's good looks, I think it's safe to say he's not so inexperienced in real life, but I was totally convinced of it in his portrayal of Sam.  I'm usually way turned off by seemingly gratuitous sex in movies, but this was truly a character-defining moment.Speaking of which, I could have done without seeing Mary Steenburgen naked. Great actresses like her shouldn't feel the need to get stark naked.Kline and Scott-Thomas were both admirable in their roles, but the movie really belonged to Christensen.  I'm (ouch) 34 years old, and I watched the movie a 2nd and 3rd time, but fast forwarded over the grown-ups parts to see Christensen again.  Maybe Christensen reminds me too much of a guy I knew in high school, the rebel who's really crying for help, a kid caught up in circumstances that are beyond what a kid should have to handle, even if he brought the trouble upon himself.  What 16 year old wants to feel like he has to partially asphyxiate himself in order to deal with his life, or sees homosexual prostitution as a quick way to make money to feed a drug habit?I was dreading my husband dragging me to see Star Wars Episode 2, but now I can hardly wait to see Christensen perform again.Overall, nothing spectacular - just a good, quiet story - no over-done explosions (real or emotional).

When his father, Vance Wilder (cameo by Animal House frat boy Tim Matheson) arrives and informs his son that he stopped payment on his tuition check, Van will do anything to make money to pay for college, as well as win over the affections of Gwen (Tara Reid), a school newspaper reporter looking for a big story. This movie was by far a ridiculous concept, but like all National Lampoon movies before it, it was way too much fun to resist watching.  Not only was Reynolds a hottie, but he was fun!  He is almost like a young Jim Carrey. Although some of this film was, at times, disgusting, I loved it!  The bulldog walking around with the disturbingly huge balls was outlandish and comical.  I feel bad for the poor animal, the hapless soul who had to drag those big sacs around. My favorite parts were when Van was interviewing new assistants, and they kept showing Erik Estrada, whose toupee kept coming off.  Yuck!  get rid of him, **spoiler**when the old Oriental lady was bent over in front of Van's crotch sucking on something, and he was saying over and over again You do great work.  Keep your eyes on it, not on me.  We then realized that she was sucking on a lollipop and was measuring his inseam, but us deviated perverts took it completely out of context.  Also the part with the dog masterbating into the pastries was disgusting, but you couldn't resist looking away.  There were so many funny parts to name, and limited space to do so in. As a college student, I couldn't say that I ever met anyone like Van Wilder, but I would sure love to, because he was so funny.  IAll in all, this was a great film, with plenty of memorable moments.  Look for cameos by Booger from Revenge of the Nerds and the Principal from Breakfast Club (You know, the guy raided Barry Manilow's wardrobe).  I garuantee that you will enjoy this film. Don't graduate, celebrate!  Wow, taglines are good!  ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"15 April 2002","score":"","review":"  A couple more words on A Walk to Remember and I'm off my soapbox.1).

It has either been praise or the exact opposite - the feeling of being let down. I personally loved this film. When I first viewed it I too was not enthralled by it - but after I purchased it on dvd and watched it several times I found myself truly overjoyed with this film. Firstly, I am a child of the Star Wars era. I can remember when my mother bought me my Darth Vader figurine. I remember the shock of discovering that Luke and Leia were brother and sister and being dumbfounded that Darth Vader was Luke's father.  So naturally episode 1 was an experience I could not wait for. This film has a terrific storyline - we begin learning of the trade dispute and are introduced to the bad guys in the federation, Darth Maul and the future emperor Palpatine. It leads to the Gungans (a new race introduced by George Lucas) vs Droid battle. Also it has the beautiful heroine, brave warriors (Qui-Gon and Obi Won),a child blessed with the force and of course Joda.  I was spellbound by the special effects - the breathtaking pod race and the ultimate jedi battle. Wonderful, expressive characters like Watto - the owner of the slave Anakin and his mother - was great comic relief. I love that we learn that Darth Vader was a boy genius full of love and care for others and that makes you ponder that had he not met the Jedi he may not have caused all the problems he does in the galaxy. We also see Anakin being introduced to the mother of his children Padme. How thrilling. I suppose the only fault I can find is Jar Jar Binks, whilst hats off to Mr Lucas for thinking up such an interesting character I found his accent and his clumsiness a little hard to watch and not amusing.  That would be my only complaint. You don't however watch a Star Wars film for Oscar calibre acting - you watch them for the thrills and spills of the special effects and inventive storyline. The lead actors Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiamond supply the acting that is both subtle yet perfect for this film. Not to forgot Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker bringing back old favourites C3p0 and R2d2.After watching this film I am left breathlessly waiting for the next episode (Episode 2) to arrive. I will be there on opening night awaiting this film to open.

All the actors have the right age and -when it comes to appearance- the right beauty. Butterfly is a young girl in the story, and in this movie she looks as one (and she is only in her early twenties). Nevertheless she does all the singing herself. She has won prizes in opera competitions and is very convincing. She is from China, not Japan, and has the perfect voice for the part. Who would ever find this story believable with a 40-years old soprano? Now with this young Asian actress\/singer one is moved as one should be. Not only the singing, but also the emotions are clear and real. This could never be achieved in play-back from a different singer. All the other main characters are (very) good actors and sing their own parts (very well). The setting is beautiful, though not in Japan, but in Tunisia (I read afterwards). The orchestra plays well (under James Conlon). In fact everything is good. Only a few minor parts are sung by different persons than the (Asian) actors.

The classic story is completely corrupted by this version.  The stunts don't fit the period and are so unrealistic it is sickening.  I actually got tired of them.  They only thing good about them is that they were put together well.  However, they don't fit the time period, or any time period for that matter.  It was as if they belonged to different movie.  The other part that really bothered me was Justin Chambers character of D'Artagnan.  His bad boy attitude also got on my nerves.  It was so bad you really don't want to route for him.  By the end of the film I really did not care who won the final fight scene.  If you are looking for a good film about the Musketeer's, don't rent this one. See the Disney version, its better than this one.  This is not very good (3 out of 10).
