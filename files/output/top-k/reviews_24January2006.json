I'm partial to W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd... Chaplin is a little too stylized and feminine for my taste, but this is an interesting film for a couple of reasons One, it's presented as though a SILENT film from the earlier days of movies &#150; yet was more than a decade past silence by then. Two, the sets, costumes, and locations are pure 1936 middle and upper class Art Deco, which is a pleasure to peruse. WHY was Modern Times done as a silent? It HAS music and dubbed tracks of all sorts, so it's NOT actually silent, but all the dialog IS, with the old style use of caption cards. I think the film tried to straddle eras and audiences. It was the middle of the Great Depression. People needed laughs, and comfort food - so to speak. Presenting a new film in the old style took the audience back to BEFORE the stock market crash of 1929, if for no longer than 90 minutes. I also wonder (and have not researched) if Chaplin, though still famous, was by then something of an anachronism, and could not make the full transition. This WAS the last appearance of his Little Tramp character. LOTS of actors lost their careers when Talkies came along. They did NOT have good voices. Valentino apparently sounded like a girlie-twirp. Chaplin also got himself into trouble with the Government - OUR free speech Government &#150; by espousing unpopular politics. There are other reasons I enjoy this film the black\/gray\/white value range is lovely, and so is the leading lady, a young Paulette Goddard. What a babe! She could easily be Courtney Cox's genetic Great Grandmother. Oh, and I laughed out loud a few times...some of the wit still holds up.

Brown has a real gift for physical comedy and black humor, and he does a great job portraying a shambling revenant...he just radiates savage, hateful glee, and very effectively comes across as a...THING masquerading as a man, an agent of chaos and misery just barely keeping it together long enough to extract his revenge. PS II is worth watching just for his performance.I enjoy the way the plot spirals out of control after the opening events, as the two boys try to fix things early on by using the Pet Semetary to cover up their, um, mistakes, only to find themselves completely over their heads.There are individual moments of mean-spirited gallows humor that are a lot of fun, and even a few good one liners - No brain, No Pain; Think About It, Won't You? was a screamingly funny line in the context it was delivered in.

The glumness, the sense of oppression and airlessness and dread, the rot and gore and malice from beyond the grave are simply too much for the average film goer; if the director had backed off a little, and allowed a little more light into the mood and not rubbed our noses in the gore and blood and maggots quite so much, I think the results would have been more accessible for a lot more people. There a moments where I wish that we didn't have to see quite so many spurting wounds and decaying flesh and that not quite so many characters had gotten killed in the last 20 minutes.So...I think the movie was what the creators intended to make, but they may have misjudged the reaction most people would have to their creation.

This is a wonderful movie that I just don't know how anyone can not absolutely love when they see it. John Cusack leads the way in a role he was born to play, the humble, loyal, kind, soft, gentile, uncertain, young man with a heart of gold Lloyd Dobler. He is a likable kick-boxer with no idea about what his future may hold. It's wonderful to see a teenager like this one in a movie give a message that it's okay not to know what you want to do, as long as you go with your heart.Ione Skye is the sweet, smart, loving, warm, amorous, and don't forget, beautiful, Diane Court, who steals Lloyd's heart. She is the class valedictorian who wins a fellowship to study in England. John Mahoney is equally convincing as a loving, insightful, concerned, but overprotective father, James Court, who will do anything for his daughter, the latter which proves to be his undoing. He runs a nursing home and cares for people, but he has a dark secret that is revealed by the end of the movie.Lloyd is smitten by the beautiful Diane Court, he wants very badly to take her out. He is somewhat shy, and, as his friend points out, he has this nervous talking thing. He calls Diane, and his persistence pays off, as she seems to like his wit and tenacity and agrees to go the big graduation party with him.This is where the movie really begins, and also where we begin to identify with the characters fears, feelings, and pain. Diane is thrilled to finally be a part of the social life she missed out on, yet sad that she kept everybody at a distance. She sees what she could have, and perhaps should have, been a part of. Lloyd is scared and uncertain about the future, with no career plans. Diane's father is feeling threatened that Lloyd will take his only daughter away from him.Diane begins to fall for Lloyd because she trusts him and feels safe with him (pay close attention to the scene where he drops her off at her house after the all night party). Lloyd admires Diane because he finds her interesting, smart, and beautiful. The only problem is, Diane's father doesn't approve of Lloyd. He has the typical father's reaction no one is worthy of being with my daughter. What I loved about her father is that he isn't an idiotic parent who can't understand the feelings of his daughter or other teenagers. When Diane and Lloyd spend a night together, and she comes home late without calling, her father is upset and angry, but wise and caring enough to discuss the situation with his daughter.We later learn a secret about Diane's father, that I will not reveal, after the IRS comes knocking at his door. What made this aspect of the movie so insightful, was that it didn't make us hate Diane's father. It simply portrayed him as a good man who made a mistake. Sometimes good people can do bad things for a good reason. It doesn't make it right, but it makes it understandable. The movie makes that very clear.Say Anything's biggest strength, though, may be that it gives a subtle message about listening to your instincts. When Diane breaks up with Lloyd after being pressured by her father, we can see that she is going against her feelings. Lloyd seems to know this too, and makes a reference that she is just blindly following her father, and not her heart. This is one of the scenes that makes us fully aware Lloyd's inarticulate side, and how a lot of the time his words are being wrung from his emotions. We feel the pain that both of them are going through.Lloyd uses every tactic to get Diane back, from playing Peter Gabriel on his boom box outside her bedroom window, to long-winded (and funny) phone machine messages. Eventually, she has a change of heart, and realizes that Lloyd is everything she imagined, and her father is not. I liked when Diane went to defend her father, and an IRS agent she spoke with was kind enough to detach himself from the situation and give her advice. Don't let your father's business affect your life. He later tells her, very kindly, if not very wisely, if I were you, I would take that fellowship. When Lloyd finally wins Diane over, it is one of the film's sweetest moments, and we know that all will be well for this unlikely, wonderful pair. Perhaps the greatest line is spoken by Lloyd, when Diane tells him that nobody ever thought there relationship would work, and nobody gave it a chance, he replies You've just described every great success story. I loved that line, because it's the truth, and great writers can say it all with one line. Say Anything made me laugh, cry, and see what life is really about. It was released in the spring of 1989, the tale end of my high school career. This made me love it all the more because I could identify with teenagers and high school in the 1980's.

I liked when Diane went to defend her father, and an IRS agent she spoke with was kind enough to detach himself from the situation and give her advice. Don't let your father's business affect your life. He later tells her, very kindly, if not very wisely, if I were you, I would take that fellowship. When Lloyd finally wins Diane over, it is one of the film's sweetest moments, and we know that all will be well for this unlikely, wonderful pair. Perhaps the greatest line is spoken by Lloyd, when Diane tells him that nobody ever thought there relationship would work, and nobody gave it a chance, he replies You've just described every great success story. I loved that line, because it's the truth, and great writers can say it all with one line. Say Anything made me laugh, cry, and see what life is really about. It was released in the spring of 1989, the tale end of my high school career. This made me love it all the more because I could identify with teenagers and high school in the 1980's. How can you not love a movie like this? What a gem of a film.

That battle was won by mere seconds, as our bombers beat the refueling Japanese bombers to the attack by a whisker.The film is a good way to show a historical event to a young audience that can smooth out the inaccuracies in the history books or on the internet. The cast could have been stronger, but Affleck (Rafe), Hartnett (Danny), and Beckinsale (Evelyn) do not drop the ball while carrying the film. Jennifer Garner as the mousy Sandra was an interesting performance, especially in light of her future stardom. Dan Akroyd as the decoder was convincing as only he can be.

The film was an entertaining, nostalgic and highly commercial action movie from a time past.....and on a base level I just plain enjoyed it. It made me smile! The trailer reminded me of a video game called Freedom Fighters (set in New York, you play the part of a plumber leading a resistance force against a Russian invasion) which I had enjoyed too, i liked the premise, so my flatmates and I (2 English, 1 Irish and 1 American) sat through the movie last night. Once the giggles from the girls had subsided (yes Swayze and Sheen look like babies and have not aged too well!) the opening parachute invasion got quite a buzz. Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in, but once over that the premise really started to work, and you could actually begin to empathise with the kids in their situation. The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic and the acting was...well....not there really, but I don't think that was down to a lack of talent. But it hung together, and we all enjoyed it. Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea. I understand that America has it's extremists who hide in the mountains, stash mountains of weapons and food for just such an event, but the movie certainly doesn't satirise them. The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys cold, dead hand falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states. The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water. The movie is and was just a great what if.....? and an amusing 80's Hollywood schtick action movie, no more, no less.

The trailer reminded me of a video game called Freedom Fighters (set in New York, you play the part of a plumber leading a resistance force against a Russian invasion) which I had enjoyed too, i liked the premise, so my flatmates and I (2 English, 1 Irish and 1 American) sat through the movie last night. Once the giggles from the girls had subsided (yes Swayze and Sheen look like babies and have not aged too well!) the opening parachute invasion got quite a buzz. Handled clumsily and probably with an extremely limited budget it took a good 20 minutes for the B-movie ethic to settle in, but once over that the premise really started to work, and you could actually begin to empathise with the kids in their situation. The story became a bit strung out in places, the action was cardboardy and basic and the acting was...well....not there really, but I don't think that was down to a lack of talent. But it hung together, and we all enjoyed it. Where peoples readings of political messages come from I have no idea. I understand that America has it's extremists who hide in the mountains, stash mountains of weapons and food for just such an event, but the movie certainly doesn't satirise them. The joke in the film of the NRA bumper sticker and the dead guys cold, dead hand falls flat if it was intended as a purposeful message and therefore seems more to be an attempt at acknowledging the certain irony of such events in the states. The rhetoric of the kids in their internal arguments is hollow and situational, not political, and just about manage to hold some water. The movie is and was just a great what if.....? and an amusing 80's Hollywood schtick action movie, no more, no less. If a backstory of a continued Cold War was introduced I can well see this being ripe for a remake, and perhaps then you can apply your knee-jerk reactionary theories to it with more basis then...who know?

Dr. John Van Gelder (Marius Weyers) is in charge of overseeing the construction of a missile platform, scientist Dr. Scarpelli (Nia Peebles) has more noble intentions on her mind while Capatin Phillip Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) is in charge of the whole damn thing. Officer Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard) has discovered that beneath the proposed missile platform location there just happens to be a cavern, Van Gelder orders it to be blown up (?!) so general dogs-bodies Hodges (Thom Bray) & Osborne (Ronn Carroll) get in their underwater vehicle & set the explosives using a remote arm. Unfortunately the resulting blast annoys & releases something within the cavern, something big, something nasty & something with an appetite for human flesh...Co-produced & directed by Sean S. Cunningham I personally found Deepstar Six to not live up to my already meagre hopes. The script by Lewis Abernathy & Geof Miller plays more like an underwater disaster film like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) in the sense that the biggest threat our stranded protagonists face are of a technical nature like the little base thing hanging over the edge, water pouring into the base, pressure lines being ruptured so the crew cannot depressurize & escape to the surface along with the fact that the reactors are overheating & will blow up destroying the base. The monster aspect of the film felt almost secondary to me, for over an hour the monster remains totally unseen & just swims around outside until it follows someone in through the airlock after which it never leaves the confines of one room anyway, it's just that's the room where the pressure lines are otherwise the remaining crew wouldn't have to go anywhere near it. I must admit that I'd have preferred the monster to be introduced a lot sooner than it was & for it to stalk & eat the crew, unfortunately it only eats one & a half people. As a whole I found Deepstar Six very slow going & at 100 minutes long it could have done with maybe 10 or 15 minutes shaved off the running time. I wasn't impressed by some of the logic either, why blow a cavern up? The cavern was heading down into the ground so it would just have collapsed in on itself surely?Deepstar Six was one of three underwater sci-if\/horror\/thriller films from the same year along with James Camerons The Abyss (1989) & Leviathan (1989) & is surely the worst of the bunch. Director Cunningham does a reasonable job but the monster is barely used & the film has little tension, excitement or atmosphere. Some of the model shots look very, well like toy models. There are a couple of decent gore scenes, someone starts to burst as they get a very bad case of the bends, death by oxygen pellet which makes someones chest explode, someone is bitten in half with lots of stringy red stuff hanging down from the upper torso & the monster itself looks quite cool but I'm not sure why it would need claws (when was the last time you saw a fish with arms & claws?) or eye's (that far down it's total darkness anyway, right?).Technically the film is well made & apart from some fake model shots it has a certain polish about it. The acting was OK by a largely unfamiliar (to me) cast with Miguel Ferrer as Snyder who is known to everyone as 'that guy from Robocop (1987)' putting in a nice over-the-top performance.I was throughly disappointed by Deepstar Six, maybe I missed something but I thought it was meant to be a monster film. No such luck, if you can make it too when the monster shows up it becomes decent but I just can't get over the preceding redundant & totally dull first 70 odd minutes. Not recommended.

The court scenes are actually pretty interesting, and this one works more on story then War action, plus it's very well made and written as well. Don't expect Bruce to be the main star in this film,granted he does have a fair amount of screen time, but Colin Farrell is definitely the star in this movie, plus Terrence Howard is especially good in his role as Scott!. I did find it a little strange that the Nazi's were so nice to the soldiers, and it did drag in certain spots, but it was never boring, and quite engaging most of the way, plus it will keep you guessing throughout. This is a very solid war film, that's quite engaging, with a good story and fantastic performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!.

Obviously, he forgot to mention the importance of family, Mother Ellen and sisters, Suellen and Carreen. Or if he did she wasn't listening. When it came to their wants, needs or relationships, Scarlett wasn't interested unless it was someone she needed. The only heart she showed was during the the war, while fighting to get herself, Melanie and Melanie's baby to safety. But we must remember that Rhett had left them and she, too, was hungry and scared. That can bring out the 'nobility' in most of us.(Clark Gable IS Rhett Butler.) But Rhett doesn't do enough to put Scarlett in her place from the very beginning. After the war he gives her everything she wants, unless it interferes with his wants. But it's obvious he enjoys her fiery spirit (and ducking thrown vases) but he needs to be more firm about her attitude towards her others. Let her know it's not necessary to be so high-handed or self-center all of the time. As the movie progresses he becomes more cruel to her...a cruelty mixed with loathing. But I must say that he does a great job of standing around and looking very much the southern gentleman.Then we have Ashley and Melanie Wilkes (Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland). Ashley is just plain wishy-wash. He doesn't have the testicular fortitude to come out and tell Scarlett he loves Melanie and that's that. But, of course, that might end the story right there. And Melanie is Scarlett's best buddy no matter what she's accused off.. That's because of all Scarlett does to get them home. The worst case of hero worship I've ever seen. But that I can understand.(Hattie McDaniel plays Mammy to perfection.) Mammy, a wise strong woman of color, who tries to raise the girls right; this especially comes true after Miss Ellen (O'Hara) dies. We, still, have Gerald to care for his daughters, but with Miss Ellen's death, he's pretty much out of it. It will be Mammy the girls' nurse who will take over there. She is a 'slave' (in body only, NOT in mind of spirit) who loves her 'family' and does all she can for them, but in spite of her obvious love, wisdom and dedication, a deaf ear is often turned towards her advise.(Butterfly McQueen as Prissy.) She don't know nothing' about birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett!. It's amazing, that in spite of her flightiness she sure learn's fast. And Ashley and Melanie's child is born.They make it home. With the Civil War ended, we have a long drawn out Reconstruction Period. It wasn't handled as President Lincoln wanted it to be. He wanted the two halves of the nation to come together peacefully and rebuild the South. But his assassination stopped that plan.During that time, because of Scarlett's selfish actions, we get to see the activities of the KKK. This because she wouldn't listen to the men about staying out of town and away from the undesirable element. No, she 'decides' to go to work and gets roughed up on the way. The men take over avenging her honor. Which brings about tragic results. But we do, finally, get to meet Belle Watling (Ona Munson), owner of a house of ill-repute and a friend and business partner of Rhett's. What happens next? So much more than I can express here. Do Rhett and Scarlett finally get together? Does her infatuation with Ashley ever die? See the movie if you don't mind wasting 222 minutes of your life. Or better yet read the book. You can put it down when you need a break to figure out the threads that link the relationships. And there are many more relationships to solve in there! I've given the reader of this comment my perspective on a famous novel\/movie. The actors did well and I tried not to give out any spoilers. Here are some little asides 1) When Margaret Mitchell was ask who should play Rhett Butler? Her calm, straight-faced answer was, Groucho Marx. 2) Margaret was born November 8, 1900. She died August 16, 1949 after being struck by an automobile in a crosswalk in her home town.3) She received $50,000 from David O. Selznik for the original film rights to her book. Then another $50,000 through another business transaction from Selznik.4) After she passed away her brother, Stephen Mitchell, held the copyright to the book until his death. He didn't allow for a sequel.5) In the 1990's Alexandra Ripley was chosen to write the sequel Scarlett It was done as a TV mini-series in 1994. Margaret and Stephen must both be spinning over in their graves now.

They are Gary Oldman (as Dracula) and Anthony Hopkins (as Professor Abraham Van Helsing).Other than that the negatives regarding this movie are seemingly endless. I'll touch of the main problems.1. This movie had beautiful costumes and sets, but I was unable to enjoy them with the herky jerky camera editing that the director Francis Ford Coppala decided to go with. I got a headache trying to focus on the action.2. Many movies have been made based on books. There are varying degrees of staying true to the original story. However, if you title your film BRAM STOKER'S Dracula, then you better stay true to Bram Stoker's version of the story. I had just read the book, and was eagerly anticipating the film. It didn't take long to see that most of the original story is either simply ignored or actually changed. I'm not talking about minor details. I am talking about major themes in the book that are totally destroyed. The movie should have been named Coppala's Vampire, then I wouldn't have wasted my money on going to the theater to see it.3. This movie, in my opinion, has to be one of the worst cast films in the history of movie-making. At least, when you consider that the two main characters are played by Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider. They are two of the most limited actors in Hollywood, and should never have even been allowed to read the script in the first place. As bad as they are, they do not even give a good performance even by their standards, most likely due to the poor matching of script to abilities.Watching this movie is literally one of my least favorite movie-going experiences ever. It's basically a case of three strikes and you're out, because of the poor acting\/casting, lack of staying even close to the original story & irritating editing that leaves you straining to focus on what's happening.
