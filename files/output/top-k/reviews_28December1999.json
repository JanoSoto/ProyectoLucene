I can only assume that the film seeks to provide insight into the life of Andy Kaufman (Carrey); show something of the man behind the act.  If that's the case, I am also forced to assume that writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski just didn't have much information to work with.    For example, we learn very little of Kaufman's relationship with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  And as for the film's habit of revealing every single one of Kaufman's acts as fakes, mere practical jokes on the viewer, there aren't many people left who don't know that for themselves.    The main problem with the movie is that much of it is simply recreations of Kaufman's varied acts, from the Saturday Night Live Mighty Mouse routine, to different clips from Taxi, to his wrestling performances with Jerry Lawler.  Carrey is an admirable Kaufman, becoming the late comedian so well that one forgets it's Jim Carrey up there.  But so what?  Anyone going to see the movie is probably familiar with Kaufman's act, and if they're not they probably won't find it that funny.    I don't have much to say about this movie.  The basic plot simply runs through Kaufman's life from the time he gets his big break via George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), through Taxi, which he never really wanted to do, through his (entirely staged) run-ins with Jerry Lawler, and finally through his death.  The movie's ending is left intentionally ambiguous.  Did Andy Kaufman fake his own death?  Is the king of convincing pranks pulling a huge one on the world?  Probably not.  But it's something to think about as you leave the movie.    Because not much else in it is particularly thought-provoking.

Jim Carrey obviously threw himself into the role and gave it everything he had, and did a dead-on impression of him. But I guess I am one of the few people who couldn't forget that I was watching Carrey do a dead-on Kaufman, and also thought from time to time, Edward Norton resembled him much more. Carrey is just too good-looking (he is a really handsome guy, when he's not making some horrible face) though he obviously gained weight, looked as unattractive as possible, etc. There was just the usual problem that biopics have, where you can't help but notice that the person playing them is much better looking ( though there are some exceptions to this rule). That being said, I still had a great time, and am not sorry I went to see it- I was quite entertained. (though I wish they'd included his sobbing-playing-the-bongos routine). A good movie to see on Christmas Eve like we did, with the Carnegie Hall scene and all, and it did actually make me teary. DeVito was great as his frustrated manager. Courtney Love was in it less than I thought, fortunately. SO, to sum up, though I'm not a big fan of Kaufman, (don't dislike him, just can take him or leave him) I recommend it for the performances and filmmaking. Also, it was fun seeing the cast of Taxi back in their old roles-Marilu Henner was the only one who couldn't pull off being 20 years younger (not trying to be catty- I really did think she'd look about the same, but it was obvious she'd lost weight and had some 'work' done on her face). There were some very funny scenes, and some touching ones - not a bad way to spend a few hours. But I don't think it was Oscar-worthy.

Carrey does Andy Kaufman justice in a movie that makes you wonder what's a joke and what's true in the world of comedy.  This film isn't for everyone but it is a movie worth watching.  I like the final half hour of the film were Kaufman makes his comedy more positive.  I kinda would have liked to see his Saturday morning show he was planning.  Taken before his time.

So in my opinion, this movie is my #1 of all time. This movie had a huge impact on me. The movie, based on the wonderful book I, Tina written by Tina and Kurt Loder, is simply fantastic. It shows what kind of person Tina is strong. As a little Anna Mae Bullock, she was abandoned by her parents. She stood by her husband Ike, despite the fact that he did drugs, slept with other women and beat her. But enough is enough. Tina couldn´t stand it any longer. She left Ike and finally got a divorce. Tina started to rebuild her career as a solo artist but it wasn´t an easy job. After years of working and touring, finally in 1983 Tina hit the charts with the cover of Al Green´s Let´s Stay Together. Tina made the greatest comeback ever. She became the greatest singer of all time, the Queen Of Rock, Female Lioness, Female Tiger Of Rock, Mega Diva... She became the biggest female rock star ever. She became thebest-selling female live performer in history. She became a legend. And even now, after 40 years in business, she´s one of the most beloved artists out there. And this movie salutes this wonderful woman. Angela Bassett shines in her role as Tina. She is simply sensational! Ike´s role is played by Laurence Fishburne and he does excellent job as well. Bassett got a Golden Globe for her role and both Bassett and Fishburne were nominated for Academy Awards. Unfortunately, they didn´t won but it´s an award to be nominated as well. This film includes violent scenes in which Ike beats Tina. They are not nice or easy to watch and we can only imagine what happened in real life during those years Tina was with Ike.This movie also includes fantastic music. Tina herself re-recorded some old songs for this movie and they can be heard in the movie and on the fantastic soundtrack. A Fool In Love, It´s Gonna Work Out Fine, Nutbush City Limits, River Deep - Mountain High, Proud Mary, Shake A Tail Feather, (Darlin´) You Know I Love You, Disco Inferno, Tina´s Wish plus What´s Love Got To Do With It and I Might Have Been A Queen - All these fantastic, irresistible classics!!! The music scenes are wonderful to watch (if you have seen Tina in concert you´ll know why), especially the live performances of Shake A Tail Feather and Proud Mary. The movie ends with Tina´s ´93 recording I Don´t Wanna Fight which is a really good song as well. If you are a fan of good music, this movie is for you! This is a perfect movie. Great story, great music, great performances. Tears came in my eyes many times during the violent scenes but especially in the end. Tina becomes a mega star and the real Tina is singing What´s Love Got To Do With It in her 1985 concert. She gives that wonderful smile and looks so happy... Then I Don´t Wanna Fight starts playing and at this point, tears are flowing on my cheeks. Tina Turner is simply the best. This movie is simply the best. See it. Now.10 out of 10.

Much of over-length for a few Deutschmarks, in that sense it was a good deal.The story of Death coming to Earth as a person bears many possibilities - none of them was used. There are many long scenes with dialogues like who are you I'm Joe Black but who are you? taking five minutes' time. Sometimes even nothing was spoken, and the poor actors had to grimace endlessly to make it through the scenes. You see beautiful people in beautiful locations - but that does not make a movie! With 30 frames per second, you *are* allowed to move!I never leave a movie after half the time, but this time I almost did, if not for my friends with whom I watched this thing. Finally, we just thought F*** her, and let us go!. And what the heck were the scenes with the black woman in the wheelchair speaking a strange language (in the German version, it sounded like Dutch) *without subtitles* ??? For ten minutes, I didn't understand a word, and nobody helped!This was bad. Worse than anything else. Even after bad movies I usually think, ok, I've seen it, I can talk about it. But this time I regret wasting 16 Deutschmarks and three hours.

To enjoy life- to remember that we are all food for worms, is a universal theme. I enjoyed all the performances. Especially Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani. I rather liked Brad Pitt's totally innocent approach to everything. The love scene was especially nice, aided by the music. Instead of being the usual groping romp, this scene briefly touched upon the sanctity of sex with someone you love and how special it is. The only part of the movie that I didn't care for were the long parting scenes. They could've accomplished more with less here. All in all, a great movie about love, honor, life and death.

I hated the fact that the serial killer was leaving clues on who and where he would kill next. i would much prefer a straight out killer who had to be caught like in Seven. I've heard that the book was much better and a  lot of sequences from the novel were left out of the movie which were great parts in the novel. The story follows a serial killer who is a taxi driver. He is kidnapping people and killing them, copy-cat a serial killer immortilized in a book called the bone collector. And a paralised Denzel Washington and a young street cop Angelina Jolie have to stop him. I also hated the fact that in some scenes were he would go well there this and this and then there this so that mean he going to kill here and kill this person that is total BS.
