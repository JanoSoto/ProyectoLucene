I won't give too much away, but the movie is NOT three versions of a tale with different endings.  If that is what you think, you missed it.  The movie is about how love, devotion and will can transcend space and time.  Imagine having 20 minutes to save the most important thing in the world - would your will be strong enough to force another chance if you failed? If so, how would you approach the dilemma the second time?  Lola does this, she bends time and space for the man she loves.  Make sure you read the quoted text preceding the opening shot.  The quotes tell it all if you are willing to see.  It is a profound version of Groundhogs Day.  Great casting, great acting, great direction, great movie.  I need to watch it a few more times.
