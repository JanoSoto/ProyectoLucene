I can certainly be objective about them now though, lets dig into the The Phantom Menace. So here we are, the beginning of the epic Star Wars saga, I gonna start with my biggest problem with this film, it should never have existed. By that I mean that I think the prequel trilogy should have started where Episode 2 did, we didn't need to see Anakin as a child, the film did a good job of showing him as kind and selfless this could have been done another way. The central conflict of the movie, the invasion of Naboo, also comes off as kinda pointless, it's a very contained incident that has little to do with what happens in the rest of the trilogy. The issues are further exacerbated by the time jump between this film and Episode 2. That said though, if you pull your focus in, the story isn't so bad, classic fight for freedom just on a planetary scale instead of the galactic stakes we're used to and with way more boring politics that we're used to as well.It's really hard to rate the cast in this because they are all saddled with such terrible dialogue most of the time, that being said though I really liked Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. There was a great nobleness to his character and he was better at delivering the bad dialogue than most. Ewan McGreggor was equally good here, he brought the youthful side to a character that we had only known as old and wise before, his relationship with Qui-Gon was also a highlight. Natalie Portman was alright but what was the deal with her put on Queen voice, it was odd, also I don't buy her as a 14 year old nor do I get why a society would ever elect a 14 year old as the ruler of an entire planet.Jake Lloyd is about as terrible as child actors come but again, woeful dialogue is to blame a lot of the time here too, he does sell the goodness of Anakin well enough though. Ian McDiarmid is a highlight, reprising his character from the original trilogy, watching his manipulations of everyone around him is one of the highlights of the film and the trilogy as a whole. Anthony Daniels, I think the only actor to be in all six films is pretty good as usual, he knows the character of C-3PO inside out at this point. Having Anakin be the creator of C-3PO though is a huge mistake and an unnecessary attempt to tie the universe together, all it does is make the universe seem smaller.The best thing about this film, Darth Maul, what a bad ass, he was truly a menacing villain. He didn't say much which made him appear even more scary and the actors martial arts skills really put the action on another level. Speaking of the action, it was pretty good, the final battle was pretty great, it intercut between the ground battle, the space battle and the now famous lightsaber duel much like Return of the Jedi did. That duel is really impressive still, it's not as overly choreographed as some the duels that followed it and it has a great emotional ending with Qui-Gon's death and Obi- Wan's rage fulled assault on Maul, definitely the high point of the film.Why was Darth Maul killed off though, that has to be the biggest misstep of the film, he should have been kept around for the whole trilogy, what a waste. At least he has since been resurrected in cartoon form.A big talking point around the prequels has always been the overuse of CGI, and while there was a lot more miniatures and model work than a lot of people realize there is also a ton of CGI. That CGI has not aged well in a lot of places, especially in characters like Watto and Jar Jar.Jar Jar almost doesn't deserve the dignity of being mentioned but I will, I don't know what Lucas was thinking when he dreamed this guy up. He's supposed to be the comic relief but he is so painfully unfunny and cringe worthy that he's hard to watch.

No, this film makes a lot of the same mistakes as The Phantom Menace made and it also makes whole new ones. Back is the terrible dialogue, wooden acting and even more CGI, though this time it has aged a little better. They are joined by the truly terrible performance of Hayden Christensen as Anakin, the worst love story in the history of film and the unnecessary ruining of Boba Fett, let's get into it.We all know that Lucas likes to cast unknowns and this is usually a good idea as you only see the character but for the love of god, cast unknowns who can actually act. Hayden's performance is so bad, there is no subtlety to him at all, he's always shouting and my god, I'll talk about his creepy romantic face a little later. The only moment that he is good in is his scene with his mother as she is dying and his subsequent murdering of the Tusken Raiders, this is a truly great moment that still gives me chills a little. It's ruined a little though by the scene after it where he tells Padmé all about it and his acting goes back to its usual standard. Lets talk about that love story, this is truly terrible, first we have the fact that Anakin has been obsessively thinking about her for the last 10 years and when they do finally meet up again he's a complete creep. It's even implied early on that he was spying on her in her bedroom on the security cameras. Once they get off to their romantic retreat on Naboo things only get worse, Lucas seems to think that the primary ingredient to falling in love is just beautiful surroundings, which admittedly they are. The big issue though is the complete lack of chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman and the fact that every word they have to speak to each other is terribly written. Another thing, the love theme that John Williams composed for these two is absolutely beautiful, its a shame its wasted on them.Another thing I feel is a big issue is that while these two are off on this romantic interlude Anakin is separate from Obi-Wan. They spend most of the film apart and when they are together they are bickering and moaning at each other. The film and the trilogy as a whole would have been better served by building up their relationship more and showing some camaraderie between them.Anyway, what's Obi-Wan up to when all this garbage is happening. He's on his own little detective side quest that's actually really entertaining. He winds up on the planet Kamino where a mysterious clone army has been made without anyone knowing about it. This all seems highly suspicious but everyone just goes with it and doesn't question it, stellar writing George. We meet Jango Fett and much like C-3PO's link to Anakin this is George making the universe smaller again and ruining the mystique of Boba Fett in the process, it does lead to a pretty sweet fight between Obi-Wan and Jango though.Speaking of C-3PO, he makes a return and takes Jar Jar's place as the comic relief that is completely unfunny, the scenes of his head attached to a battle droid's body are painful to watch.While all this is going on we are hearing about this Count Dooku but never seeing him, in fact he doesn't show up until over halfway though, which is a little odd but when he does he is pretty cool. Christopher Lee is a class act and has a great screen presence, all this leads to the best part of the film and its primary saving grace.A massive battle happens and we get to see the Jedi in action as a group for the first time ever and it's spectacular, it's a long final act that has heaps going on. It's probably the best ground battle in the whole saga, there is a particularly awesome shot of a ship falling from the sky and kicking up a huge dust cloud. We see the view from inside the cloud of droids and clones shooting at each other and it is visually very impressive.Of course it wouldn't be Star Wars without a duel at the end, we get Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting Dooku and its a bit lackluster and over very quickly but that's because they were just the warm up act. Yoda shows up and a pretty cool fight ensues, I never had an issue with Yoda fighting with a lightsaber like some have but I'm not a huge fan of the way he screams as he's jumping around.We also get a couple of scenes between Anakin and Palpatine and we see that Palpatine is grooming him and has become a sort of mentor to him, this is great, Palpatine's manipulations are even more entertaining to watch here, we see that he is playing both sides in the war to his own ends and it sets up the final film of the trilogy well.There ends Attack of the Clones, the clone wars have begun and Anakin has taken his first steps towards the dark side.It may have sounded like I was tearing this film to shreds but I actually prefer it to The Phantom Menace, I think, the end action is really awesome.

This film set the benchmark for every single audacious sci-fi film to date.A tiny consular ship flees from a domineering Star Destroyer, teaching us pretty much everything we need to know in a single scene. The Empire has bigger guns and more of them, and they're always closing in on the Rebels. Then we get the beautiful reveal of Darth Vader, whose black armour and cape contrasts starkly with the white (but no less ominous) Storm Troopers. We know immediately that this is a guy not to be messed with. Vader is so much of the soul of Star Wars - a flawless combination of David Prowse's physical presence and James Earl Jones' menacing voice work. In stark contrast is the orphaned Luke Skywalker, played iconically if not necessarily masterfully by Mark Hamill. Luke, dressed all in white, is hurled suddenly into the world he had always dreamed of in circumstances he never necessarily asked for. Luke undergoes a remarkable adventure in this film but his determination never wavers and that makes him a terrific protagonist. Han Solo, played by the irresistibly charming Harrison Ford (remember when he looked like he had the will to live?) is an excellent foil for Luke, and Carrie Fisher plays the classy and surprisingly tough Princess Leia, creating a character who is iconic in her own right, not just as the love interest of one of the leading men. Surprisingly, the character I enjoyed most on rewatch is C-3PO, again captured by unmistakable voice acting, this time by Anthony Daniel. Threepio is a pretentious snob and a complete sycophant, always willing to chide the more rebellious R2. He is responsible for much of the film's humour, and surprisingly undergoes a subtle arc himself when he desperately volunteers his own circuits for R2's repair. See Lucas? No need for Jar Jar to be funny.The sound effects are impeccable and probably the most iconic in the history of film. Whether its a the hum of a lightsaber, Darth Vader's mechanical breathing or the screech of a TIE Fighter zooming up the Death Star's trenches, you know a Star Wars sound effect when you hear it. Same goes for visuals, except those clunkily included in the remastered edition, which stand out like a sore thumb. In one scene, a Bantha has been created by draping a costume over an Asian elephant, whilst in the scene before that, noticeably underdone slug-horses are trudging around Tattooine. By and large, though, visuals are amazing - ranging from an exploding Death Star to a simple jump to light speed. Costumes? Forget about Vader, Chewie and Threepio, I bet one in every three humans could probably pick the costumes of Luke, Leia and Han as well! And John Williams' score - well just go back to my prequel reviews to read my raves about that masterpiece. Williams' glorious triumph is the beautiful scene in which Luke looks out to the two suns of Tattooine and the audience has nothing to do but soak up his beautiful music.The screenplay is filled with delightful dialogue (especially in the hands of Ford). Moreover, it has an impeccable narrative - it creates backstory without extensive exposition, sets up for a sequel without leaving the film unresolved, and creates what is ultimately a very funny, smart and enjoyable adventure. If there's one word to describe Star Wars, its an adventure.

Forget about Vader, Chewie and Threepio, I bet one in every three humans could probably pick the costumes of Luke, Leia and Han as well! And John Williams' score - well just go back to my prequel reviews to read my raves about that masterpiece. Williams' glorious triumph is the beautiful scene in which Luke looks out to the two suns of Tattooine and the audience has nothing to do but soak up his beautiful music.The screenplay is filled with delightful dialogue (especially in the hands of Ford). Moreover, it has an impeccable narrative - it creates backstory without extensive exposition, sets up for a sequel without leaving the film unresolved, and creates what is ultimately a very funny, smart and enjoyable adventure.

This film set the benchmark for every single audacious sci-fi film to date.A tiny consular ship flees from a domineering Star Destroyer, teaching us pretty much everything we need to know in a single scene. The Empire has bigger guns and more of them, and they're always closing in on the Rebels. Then we get the beautiful reveal of Darth Vader, whose black armour and cape contrasts starkly with the white (but no less ominous) Storm Troopers. We know immediately that this is a guy not to be messed with. Vader is so much of the soul of Star Wars - a flawless combination of David Prowse's physical presence and James Earl Jones' menacing voice work. In stark contrast is the orphaned Luke Skywalker, played iconically if not necessarily masterfully by Mark Hamill. Luke, dressed all in white, is hurled suddenly into the world he had always dreamed of in circumstances he never necessarily asked for. Luke undergoes a remarkable adventure in this film but his determination never wavers and that makes him a terrific protagonist. Han Solo, played by the irresistibly charming Harrison Ford (remember when he looked like he had the will to live?) is an excellent foil for Luke, and Carrie Fisher plays the classy and surprisingly tough Princess Leia, creating a character who is iconic in her own right, not just as the love interest of one of the leading men. Surprisingly, the character I enjoyed most on rewatch is C-3PO, again captured by unmistakable voice acting, this time by Anthony Daniel. Threepio is a pretentious snob and a complete sycophant, always willing to chide the more rebellious R2. He is responsible for much of the film's humour, and surprisingly undergoes a subtle arc himself when he desperately volunteers his own circuits for R2's repair. See Lucas? No need for Jar Jar to be funny.The sound effects are impeccable and probably the most iconic in the history of film. Whether its a the hum of a lightsaber, Darth Vader's mechanical breathing or the screech of a TIE Fighter zooming up the Death Star's trenches, you know a Star Wars sound effect when you hear it. Same goes for visuals, except those clunkily included in the remastered edition, which stand out like a sore thumb.

The short of it that I know for sure is that the Vietnam war didn't stay completely within its borders, but rather spilled over into Cambodia, with the kind of guerilla warfare being raged, but more crucially (along with Nixon's own butchery intentions) rival gangs and groups were looking to gain control - and all of this at the cost of thousands of lives, mainly civilians' lives. What's good about the film politically is that it doesn't ask you necessarily to take a big side on one or the other in the Cambodian conflict, except as far as Pol Pot making madness and chaos even more extreme, and that the violence of these street gangs made into larger forms was horrible. But what's even better is that the emotional core, the pathos, is strong this is a movie about friendship (writer Bruce Robinson, coincidentally, would make another key movie about friendship in the 80's in Withinail & I, on a totally different context of course).The friends - one might almost say lovers in the non-romantic, heterosexual sense - is author Sidney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Hang S Ngor, who won a deserved Oscar for his acting, which often feels very raw and wholly convincing, basically as though he was\/is there). Sidney is there in Cambodia to get the scoop as a New York Times reporter, and not only won't soft-pedal anything, he despises the reporters sent\/allowed in who will. Pran is nominally his translator, but he is a reporter as well (we don't see much of that aspect, but it's not difficult to see his serious intentions to get things down as they are). The two of them finds that they're stuck in the country as things become even more harried; the greatest tension and suspense of the film isn't even about being under the barrel of guns held by certain guerilla soldiers (though that's part of it) - it's simply how to get Pran out of the country.One may ask why Sidney just didn't get Pran out when he does, in fact, get Pran's family out. Maybe there was just more work to do. Maybe it was simpler that way and for Pran to stay it was necessary for the very on-the-street-on-the-run reporting that Sidney was looking for. But whatever the motivation, the centerpiece of the film for me all comes down to a photograph - this is what's needed for Pran to get a passport and go along with the Americans and French out of the country (it is explained why Cambodians can't leave, but it's not completely clear, or at much as it could've been for me). We see how Malkovich, as a photojournalist, takes the painstaking task of taking pictures on a beat-up, nearly broken camera, and has to develop the film in a very cramped bathroom with unlikely chemicals. It's not totally a spoiler to say it doesn't end up working - for half of the film, Pran is in a prison camp and it then becomes a 'how-does-he-escape' scenario - but this section is for me the most effective trumping the violence of the world through the process of photography (if not art, then close enough), and just seeing the moment-by-moment events of that sequence is staggering.Of course, there's much violence here, and in a way this was a nice antidote to the barrage of mindless, at best usually guilty-pleasure action fare of the 1980's. Instead of something like Rambo 2, where one man goes in and single-handedly takes on the entire Vietnamese army, this is more like 'hey, you really have to be very, very careful here, because the one wrong thing said or done can get you shot in the head, immediately, or, if in prison, worse via torture'.Some of the events in the first act move rather quickly, but the important thing is that we get to learn who these people are, especially Sidney and Pran, and this is crucial for the emotional stakes will they be torn apart, and if they are, can they reunite again? I kind of wish I hadn't looked up the trivia for the film ahead of time as I got in a way spoiled as the ultimate outcome (one hopes for the 'happy ending', though here that's especially relative). The tension mounts so well in the second half because we know, as capable as Pran is at thinking on his toes and acting quickly, he's up against a truly formidable, horrifying presence in these soldiers, all trained to the gills for brutal executions.If there is a political message it comes in a rather operatic moment Sidney is back in New York and watching what looks like a primitive version of a VHS tape of some old news broadcast; it talks about Nixon's message to the American people about what the plan was for Cambodia, and how it was not the bill of goods he was selling. One almost gets the sense that had Nixon really had his way, Pran could've been wiped out by a barrage of bombs. But, again, The Killing Fields is interested in politics only up to a point the power of the film comes from its male bond, and its depiction of survival and how one can keep a head when surrounded by death and destruction.

It is flawed, certainly, it has lots of 70's argot and culture in it that have not aged well. You know, the psychedelic clothes, Woodstock movie, the giant Afros and hideous decor but hey, at least you didn't have to grow up in it, like me, be grateful for that much. Zerbe steals the movie as Matthias who adds credibility to the story by refusing all the other members of The Family's repeated demands to use technology to destroy Neville. The makeup is excellent, who will forget when they show him what the virus did to them? My favorite scene has always been when he forgets what time it is, the sun is on the horizon, and he has to get home. The director shoots this so well, the way they pop out on him is one creepy scene. Also, the deserted city is done very well. Like Night Of The Comet, the camera is centered so you only see a few blocks. When he is searching the city, watch the upper right corner of an apartment building for the person they missed in a distant window.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 September 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Spielberg once stated that Schindler's List is not about the millions that were killed during the Holocaust, but rather about the one thousand that were saved. It's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. There have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the Holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. Schindler's List doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. It is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. Even so, the film does attempt to place itself within the reality of the events and create some sense of authenticity. Apart from the powerful bookends which are drenched in colour, the black and white documentary approach serves its agelessness and heightens the intensity of some scenes; the first look we get at the enigma of Oskar Schindler, catch-lights hitting his twinkling eyes at the party, or when a little boy attempts to hide in the underground box full of sewerage. Hand- held is also used intensively and to great effect - the rounding up of naked Jews, the extended liquidation scene, scrambling around the camp in madness in avoiding a psychopath with a sniper rifle. Spielberg doesn't overdose the film with visual tricks but shows it for what it is (the lack of storyboarding aided this), making those little touches all the more effective - quick match cuts to show the various inept secretaries that are hired anyway, Kingley's distant voice-over as Goeth executes lined up boys silently and mercilessly, and the most powerful motif of them all, the girl in the red coat, a symbol of innocence lost and atrocity committed. There are two exceptional performances here. The first is of course Neeson, who brings to the table a great charisma and pragmaticism that later dissolves into sympathy and great courage. We first are charmed like the German officers at the party (I love the great touch of the officer moving forward to get closer to Oskar in the photo, obscuring the pretty girl he was initially wooing), and through voice-over and a photo we receive those charms again through the lavish gifts of champagne, caviar and sardines. Spielberg does not create a moment of realisation or change; it is a gradual and subtle process that Oskar goes through. He is not the morally pure and idealistic man we look for in a Hollywood production such as this - he initially hires an entire group of secretaries not to save them, but to further his womanising and marital affairs, and when a one-armed man comes to thank him for saving his life, Neeson's face is struck and visibly confused; we wonder if he has ever been the receiver of such sincerity and gratitude. But that changes when he realises the gravity of the situation (He was a metal press operator). Oskar's front is of course the affable German business man, concerned only about profit, but in glimpses he shows his true humanity and courage in front of the Nazis a long kiss on his birthday, a determination to see worker's thirsts quenched, and in that final teary-eyed heart wrenching monologue, a complete reversal of his ambitions. John Williams' iconic violin theme is stirring and most evident here. The other is Fiennes' Goeth, who takes a despicable monster and adds tiny tinges of humanity that make his character all the more terrifying. His introduction is telling, a faceless POV in the back of the car before we reveal him, not some intimidating figure, but an irritated man with a cold Ja, why is the top down? I'm f*cking freezing. Another one of these moments is a brilliant scene where he corners Helen in the baseless, shivering and terrified. Goeth ignores this, constructing a rather tender conversation in his mind, and we witness a insatiable conflict in his mind, unbelieving that he has fallen for a jew bitch. He almost gives in, but his Nazi sensibilities come back to him and he strikes her. This segment is brilliantly inter cut with kisses of another location, the modest Jewish wedding and the lavish birthday party where Oskar kisses many. This man is truly barbaric, and even a clever appeal to his ego from Oskar (I pardon you.) does not satisfy his cold murderous streak. What Fiennes does is give us a tiny bit of insight into a man like Goeth, because to us it seems inexplicable that such a man could do such sadistic things and be instrumental in genocide. And so, he loses Helen over a game of 21. They bargain over the life of these essential jew workers, and Goeth's question to Schindler is perhaps a moment of realisation of what he must do. One little moment in the montage of compiling the list is a overlooked appearance from another Righteous Among the Nations, Julius Madritsch, who save thousands of Jews himself. I am struck by how his story and many others could similarly be rightfully portrayed as a compelling act of bravery in the face of such evil, much like Oskar Schindler's. His story was almost never told; a fateful encounter between writer Thomas Keneally and a Schindler's Jew in Poldek Pfefferberg was the basis of a book and later this film. Pfefferberg's own words are particularly telling about this great man Schindler gave me my life, and I tried to give him immortality. And in this film, he has achieved it.

Screenplay by Polanski and several others. The flaws are Peter Coyote's acting, which almost sinks the movie (sorry for the pun, as it takes place on an ocean voyage). He is just so wrong, as the star of this movie. He barely has any normal speaking inflection, and is not present, as an actor, as he is not acting here; not sure what he is doing, actually. I am surprised Polanski put up with him. No doubt there is more to that story. His performance is all the more obvious and sad, esp when playing against the very capable and professional Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas. I am sorry to say that Mrs. Polanski (Emmanuelle Seigner) does not come off well, either, at least in her very emotional scenes, although the lack of depth there does fit her young character. I have seen much better performances from her, to be fair. Great set dressing, makeup, and fashion (Scott Thomas' gown in the last act is brilliant; I want!), well suited for the period (late 70s). The music, composed and directed by Vangelis, is subtle but fitting, and the popular songs are well chosen for the period. This is a meaty psychological story about infatuation, love, sex, and obsession. And being careful what you pray for. Some quite nice dialogue and a return to the creative and gritty screen writing of earlier cinema (with very modern dialog, so watch before your kids). It is also a captivating film, spare, nothing wasted, wonderfully edited. It will grab you from start to finish (if you can stand Coyote), and the finish has a clever twist. Although the final scenes will be anticipated by some viewers. If you are a Polanski fan or just into film or film history, this is a must see and a fine example of film-making.

Anyone who has been treated like crap at the airport needs to own this movie. It earns its R rating for one scene where Neil turns into Scarface after being left miles from the terminal with a missing rental car as the company's bus drives blithely away as he chases it yelling. Sorry, it is vulgar but the F bombs have never demonstrated the efficacy of the word better in a movie. The movie follows two men, complete existential opposites, forced to be companions growing to become friends quite slowly I might add. Neil detests Dell for the majority of the movie until the end, starting with Dell costing him the cab that would have got him to his plane on time with his giant chest on the ground. Dell is a motor mouth who would get on anyone's nerves. A shower curtain ring salesman whose banter is unceasing until Neil snaps several times. It has a homophobic scene where there must share a bed at a booked up motel with some music and raised eyebrows, by Candy, and where they freak each other out waking up in each other's arms. They talk about football right away.

After the first reel, which now seemed plodding, it all rushed back to me why this film was dark It seemed that Mr. Capra had lost his naïveté, and filmed why he lost it.Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) is a famed drama critic for a New York paper. But mostly, he is known for his stance against marriage and the many books he has written mocking the institution. One Halloween, in which the Brooklyn Dodgers get into a real row of a fight, Mortimer and the love of his life &#x96; the girl next door, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) &#x96; get married. Mortimer, fearing the deluge of negative comments of the famed bachelor tying the knot, brings Elaine by their folks' houses to announce their marriage before they sail away for a two-month voyage. It is here where Mortimer's life falls off the cliff. When he tells the kindly old Aunts that raised him, Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair) Brewster, the news, he discovers that the nicest people in Brooklyn have been putting arsenic in their homemade elderberry wine, and knocking off lonely old gentlemen. The news gets worse. It seems that Mortimer has repressed memories of the violence that was done to him by his brother, Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), when he was a child. Plus, there is the delusional uncle who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt. In all, after a half-hour, Mortimer now fears for Elaine's safety, for he believes he is as loony as the rest of the Brewsters.By the way, this is a comedy. It was adapted from a hit Broadway play starring Mr. Frankenstein himself, Boris Karloff. He actually was supposed to be in the movie also, but couldn't leave the play. Frank Capra directed Arsenic and Old Lace in the genre of the screwball comedies of the thirties. He shot it five months after the play premiered. He had previous success in the field of screwball comedies with It Happened One Night. Old Lace also could be considered a film noir piece with the abundant nighttime location shoots, and very dark interiors. The Brewster house provided for very ominous, long shadows. But if this was a noir film &#x96; I say it is &#x96; then it would be Capra's first. And the question would be Why?It was an obvious choice to cast Cary Grant, who had drawn crowds to several screwball comedies since his first screen role in She Done Him Wrong. In every one of these genre roles, he played the straight, sane one&#x85;the one who gets more insane as the plot progresses. (Of particular note, in later years, Grant held a very low opinion of both She Done Him Wrong and Arsenic and Old Lace. He found She Done Him Wrong and Mae West to be too sexual. And he found Arsenic and Old Lace to be too dark and cynical.) At the time of the play's release, America was in the beginnings of WWII. And maybe dark themes were all that could be tolerated by an entertainment seeking public. It and Sweeny Todd are definitely the darkest of the light theatrical subjects. And strangely enough both plays were released around American wars. Maybe funny comedies had to show a dark sense of humor. Or light musicals for that matter had to explore horror.

Yet at the same time he recycled some of the ideas from the 1934 flick, like the pronunciation of his last name (accent grave over the e, Souse\/Bissonette), the irritable wife and a willingness to beat his kid to prove how much he loved him or her.

It was derived from one of Fields' sayings when he was getting ready to perform. He would ask for 'My hat, my cane and my shoes'. So a clever play on words, and as a word-smith, Fields sprinkles his story liberally with uncommon words like moon calf and jabbernowl.

The Dude gets entangled in a twisted kidnap\/ransom plot that introduces a wide variety of personalities. Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) adds energy to the conflict with his crazy rash behavior. Walter's nutty actions help to reinforce The Dude as the position of reason. his's antics drive the ransom scenes and help insert excitement into a meaningless sequence. Walter and The Dude escalate the situation by not completely following the kidnapper's directions. The situation snowballs as the truth is slowly revealed. Donny (Steve Buscemi) does little to influence the plot and is included mainly as comic relief for the first part of the movie. His conversations seem distance and irrelevant, but in the end, his character helps to ground the story and remind of us what really matters in this world.

Maude is used in this film to convey information about her father, The Big Lebowski, played by David Huddleston. Although her role is very helpful, her demeanor and snooty personality distracts and pulls attention from the flow of the theme. As I watched this great film, I felt this sequence could have been routed a bit differently to help the plot instead of hinder it. The German's added a good amount of comic relief as their characters helped to tie the whole kidnapping ploy together. The Nihilist's added another dimension to this theme that was meant to make light of the whole abduction. This film has a lot in common with the movie Raising Arizona. Both films revolve around attempts to extort the rich for money, while outlasting crazy and funny events. Both films become grounded in the end by life and death. The lighting in the ransom delivery sequence was extremely appropriate and seemed to mimic the typical suspenseful car ride. The music and even the color of Walter's glasses help to add to the adventurous feeling we were intended to experience in this scene. The shot angles during the bowling scenes definitely helped the music to calm our emotions from the conflicts of the kidnapping and peacefully install us back into the mind of The Dude.

The Dude gets entangled in a twisted kidnap\/ransom plot that introduces a wide variety of personalities. Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) adds energy to the conflict with his crazy rash behavior. Walter's nutty actions help to reinforce The Dude as the position of reason. his's antics drive the ransom scenes and help insert excitement into a meaningless sequence. Walter and The Dude escalate the situation by not completely following the kidnapper's directions. The situation snowballs as the truth is slowly revealed. Donny (Steve Buscemi) does little to influence the plot and is included mainly as comic relief for the first part of the movie. His conversations seem distance and irrelevant, but in the end, his character helps to ground the story and remind of us what really matters in this world. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) introduces herself to the situation and gives us some insight about the kidnapping. Maude is used in this film to convey information about her father, The Big Lebowski, played by David Huddleston. Although her role is very helpful, her demeanor and snooty personality distracts and pulls attention from the flow of the theme. As I watched this great film, I felt this sequence could have been routed a bit differently to help the plot instead of hinder it. The German's added a good amount of comic relief as their characters helped to tie the whole kidnapping ploy together. The Nihilist's added another dimension to this theme that was meant to make light of the whole abduction. This film has a lot in common with the movie Raising Arizona. Both films revolve around attempts to extort the rich for money, while outlasting crazy and funny events. Both films become grounded in the end by life and death. The lighting in the ransom delivery sequence was extremely appropriate and seemed to mimic the typical suspenseful car ride. The music and even the color of Walter's glasses help to add to the adventurous feeling we were intended to experience in this scene. The shot angles during the bowling scenes definitely helped the music to calm our emotions from the conflicts of the kidnapping and peacefully install us back into the mind of The Dude. I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. This crazy adventure has a little bit of everything exciting, sex drugs and rock and roll, but also remains grounded, expressing the trials of life and death.

But the sets were great, dialog was spot on, and it didn't hurt to have a few pretty women in the cast.I'm not sure I could write a spoiler for this movie. I may have watched this movie five or six times but there is so much plain cowboy to this movie that I never paid much attention to the story line.This is classic John Wayne. He is wise, a great shot, seems to know everybody, and is respected by the other characters. Robert Mitchum can't help but bring some comedy into any role, even when he's trying to be serious. I never actually believed Mitchum was a great actor, but it didn't matter. He was so likable and steady he was a great addition to any movie. What Mitchum brought to the movies was... Mitchum.This may be one of the best James Caan roles ever. He portrays a young cowboy with a chip on his shoulder and is perfect in the role.Charlene Holt in that lingerie getup - wow. All she had to do was stand there.Paul Fix must have been in 200 movies. Such a recognizable face and perfect for cowboy movies. He had a role in the original Battlestar Galactica too. He added character to every role he played.Michele Carey as the cute young reckless daughter.The list of well known character actors goes on and on in this movie and each had a chance to strut their stuff.You see the story line really doesn't matter that much. Just watch the movie to see each of the actors and how they add to the movie.Great stuff. Easy watching. This will never be repeated.

As an avid fan of RE-ANIMATOR and Lovecraft's writing, it seemed this was a natural, but as I skimmed sites like this for user reviews they always seemed to be quite mixed. After finally viewing this movie, it makes total sense why the reviews are mixed because the movie itself is a mixed bag.The basic premise of the movie is a standard horror trope. A family that's already being torn apart by familial strife due to some past trauma finds themselves in the middle of some supernatural terror. In this case, an alcoholic Combs, his pretty wife and blind daughter move to a castle in Europe that he finds he's inherited, but may already have a resident deep in its' bowels. The problems start with the look of the film. The viewer can see that Stuart Gordon (the director) has some genuine talent when it comes to creating a shot, with a heavy inspiration from the Hammer era of horror. The movie evokes, images of dark, romantic paintings and has moments of pure shivery chill. It's all ruined, though, by a muddy, dull color palette in the film itself. This thing looks like 80s PBS drama and gives the movie an appearance of being far older than it really is. The film quality ends up spoiling any true beauty.The problems continue into the acting. I am a huge fan of Combs. His roles in THE FRIGHTENERS and WOULD YOU RATHER are some of my favorite characters in horror. He brings an intellectual insanity to his villains that is fun to watch. On the other hand, he's just given too much room here and too much drama. The same goes for Crampton. Large chunks of the plot in this movie steer away from the terror in the dungeon to focus on the forces tearing the family apart (alcoholism, loss, infidelity). I didn't find either actor to be completely up to the task of pulling off these moments of dramatic dialog. Some of the weight of that error falls on the script itself, too, which is clunky.What saves the movie from being a disaster is the monster, the titular freak. He is gradually shown in slow reveals that lead up to the inevitable unmasking and he's a well-done creature design. The makeup looks good on camera, even in spotlight, and he inspires some terror. The movie isn't afraid to shed some blood, either. Buckets full of gore are thrown around, complete with raw, torn up skin effects that look great for low budget horror. WARNING to those who may be sensitive or unwilling to push the envelope some, there is a scene about halfway through the movie that will tarnish your images of oral sex, much like Gordon does in REANIMATOR.

Jennifer Rubin and Matthew Walker play Nick's girlfriend & boss while Kurtwood Smith and Gwynyth Walsh play Adrienne's parents and Amber Heard her neighbor.This belongs to the Lethal Lolita sub-genre of drama\/romance\/thrillers. These movies always involve a hot teenager who utilizes her freshly bestowed womanly powers to seduce an older man and create havoc. The Crush is actually better than Stanley Kubrick's revered Lolita (1962), which was the first of its kind (at least the first to popularize the topic anyway). In the early 90s these kinds of movies made a comeback with 1992's Poison Ivy starring Drew Barrymore. The Crush isn't haunting and artsy like Poison Ivy, but it's just as good and arguably marginally better. Poison Ivy has better style while The Crush is more straight-forward, sort of like 1987's Fatal Attraction, but with a teenage antagonist.Speaking of which, Alicia shines here in her cinematic debut. She was only almost-16 during filming, but easily commands attention throughout. Elwes is great as the protagonist with solid support from Rubin.These types of attractions happen all the time in real life (a teenage girl developing a crush on an older guy) and it's the responsibility of the adult to erect and maintain proper boundaries so the situation doesn't spin out of control, like it does here. If the adult lets things go too far the girl will either be so devastated she becomes nigh suicidal, like in 1976's Lifeguard, or she turns malevolently psycho.To me The Crush would've worked better as a bittersweet coming of age drama, like the subplot of Lifeguard, rather than a drama that morphs into thriller bordering on horror, like Fatal Attraction. The first half is strong as a coming-of-age drama before transforming into the latter in the second half with its contrived thriller\/horror mechanics.

Elwes is great as the protagonist with solid support from Rubin.These types of attractions happen all the time in real life (a teenage girl developing a crush on an older guy) and it's the responsibility of the adult to erect and maintain proper boundaries so the situation doesn't spin out of control, like it does here. If the adult lets things go too far the girl will either be so devastated she becomes nigh suicidal, like in 1976's Lifeguard, or she turns malevolently psycho.To me The Crush would've worked better as a bittersweet coming of age drama, like the subplot of Lifeguard, rather than a drama that morphs into thriller bordering on horror, like Fatal Attraction. The first half is strong as a coming-of-age drama before transforming into the latter in the second half with its contrived thriller\/horror mechanics. But they didn't ask me to write the script so I accept the movie as is. As a matter of fact, I feel it breaks the threshold of greatness for what it is.The movie runs 89 minutes and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia.GRADE A- ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"}]
