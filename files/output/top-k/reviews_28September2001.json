Hearts in Atlantis is based upon King's collection of short stories about kids living in the 1960s. The film mainly focuses on one story, Low Men in Yellow Coats, which was adapted by another master writer, William Goldman (whose next project is also a King adaptation -- Dreamcatcher). Lots of elements from the story are used -- from eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield's (Anton Yelchin, Along Came a Spider) Schwinn obsession, to a trip to the carnival where Bobby and his friends ride a roller coaster that makes them feel, as King put it, simultaneously sure they were going to live forever and die immediately. Bobby's childhood is not ideal. His embittered, widowed mother (Hope Davis, Mumford) is selfish and stingy. For Bobby's birthday she gives him a library card instead of the coveted Schwinn, but still manages to glean from her meager income enough dollars to spend on new dresses. Not unlike King's Stand By Me, Hearts' focus is on friendship and growing up, first kisses, bullies, the loss of innocence, and, a carrot of the unknown dangling just out of reach. In Stand, it was the search for a dead body allegedly rotting by the railroad tracks; in Hearts, it's the possession of a strange mental power that is never fully explained. The possessor of that power is Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal), a soft-spoken Englishman, and a newcomer to the neighborhood. In the short story, Ted is being hunted by yellow-jacketed men; monsters from King's Dark Tower novels who take over a shady part of town. In the movie, the villains are shadowy, trench-coated government MIB types. The pace is slow -- too slow at times, but that is the mark of director Scott Hicks (cases in point Snow Falling on Cedars and Shine -- both fairly good movies, as is Hearts, but not exactly rigid theatre-chair fare). The cinematography, by the recently deceased Piotr Sobocinski (Angel Eyes), is dreamy yet realistic. Everything seems just right for the period. The sets, the clothing, the dialogue, the soundtrack; it all works. What doesn't work is the supernatural element. It's been said every movie is really just a boy and his dog story, and perhaps one could say Hearts is the memoir of a a boy and his psychic, but to pull it off successfully, I believe the supernatural element deserved more attention. As it is, it's such a minor, undeveloped subplot that it might as well have been left out altogether. Aside from the sometimes numbing passage of time, one thing that irritated me about Hearts was the passed torch of repeated dialog from one character to another. Perhaps it was supposed to be touchingly ironic. Or perhaps it was done to make sure the audience hasn't nodded off. (I'm not saying that Hearts is a bad movie, and despite its languid, glacial pace, it's not boring; I just think it's better suited to home-viewing.) Truly the only reason to see Hearts in the theatre is Sir Anthony Hopkins. In my opinion he is one of, if not the, greatest actor living today. There is just something about him that makes you like him and want to know him, whether he is a cunning cannibal or a root beer swilling psychic on the lam. In the care of anyone other than Hopkins, much of the dialog and certainly the telepathic trances, would fly way over the top -- but Hopkins keeps things in believable check. Another reason to see Hearts is Mika Boorem (also from Along Came A Spider), who plays Bobby's budding young girlfriend, Carol. She projects a fiery yet playful character who is tempered by a sweet, refreshing innocence. It's a long time in coming but Goldman, experienced storyteller that he is, understands that eventually there has to be some conflict in a movie, so the loose knots of Bobby's childhood come undone. The people Bobby loves -- his mom, Ted, and Carol -- are all violated in different ways and desperately, valiantly, Bobby does everything in his power to help them. When the film comes to an end, there is little resolution of the conflicts; instead there's a leap forward into the present, in which grownup Bobby (David Morse, Proof of Life) has a completely implausible meeting with Carol's daughter, which, supposedly, is to give him closure. That courtesy closure, I'm afraid, isn't extended to the audience.

It is probably useful information to say that the plot has to do with assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia and involves a somewhat disturbingly funny funeral scene that overlooks the city of New York.

What makes ZOOLANDER important is that it is probably the funniest film of the year, at least for me.  Sure, its not as wholesome as BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, and it perhaps didn't have the unexpected charm of RAT RACE, and it wasn't as much fun as RUSH HOUR 2, and it wasn't as good of a film experience as SHREK.  However, it is perhaps the most consistently funny film I have seen, and the biggest laughs are probably the most creative of the year.  Overall, the film is so packed with cleverly conceived and executed ideas that just thinking about each individual scene provides entertainment in itself.

Most fans of Carpenter's work have never seen his 'The Classic Western Meets the LA of Today' or what then was considered to be today back when the film was introduced to audiences in 1976. What a shame it is to because perhaps 'Assault' is the very ocean from which so many of todays's 'action films' stem from.With a budget of around $100,000 and a very tight shooting schedule of about 20 days, Carpenter and company managed to pull off what many consider a second-to-none action\/western film. What makes the film so special? It's the fact that Carpenter has a real love and understanding of the subject matter at hand. Thus, knowing his limitations production wise, Carpenter once again establishes an excellent cast & crew to make up for what he lacked in legal tender and time.Many Carpenter 'regulars' show their faces such as Nancy Looms (of 'Halloween' fame) stars as the 'deer in the headlight' frightened switchboard operator whom later bites the big one and Charles Cyphers (also of 'Halloween' fame) who plays the straight-edged cop Starker. Whom, also like Nancy Loomis doesn't make it through the picture without taking a few 'pops' in the ol' back.  Also on board doing the films sound effects is long time Carpenter associate Tommy Lee Wallace. The very fact that Carpenter often tries to recruit the same group of actors and crew members to work with on his films has in and of itself become a style all it's own as well.Like many of the films in the late 70's this film starts out slow and is methodical. The very opening in which your presented with the usual Carpenter style synthesizer pulsation's and the way the credits slowly flash in red with a subtle black background, secretly encapsulating and setting the mood for the viewer as well as subtly giving a fortune of what is to come. You can't help but beware of the lurking dangers and suspense that will soon take hold.Cut to a beautiful sunny California day. Along walks a police officer that seems to be at the height of his day so early in the morning. Little does he suspect what terrors the coming night holds in store for not only him but also for the small band of others that will require his utmost attention and leadership skills in order to survive the hellish onslaught brought on by a vengeful gang called 'Street Thunder.' Now cut to a prison. Inside its cold and murderous walls sits a much feared and dangerous killer. A man who respects professionalism although not the law. Nor is he aware of the dangers soon lurking for him.

Everyone from the mysterious man that comes tumbling into the precinct after the murder of his daughter (Kim Richards) by the vicious gang, to the stumbling cops who near the end of the film, are being cursed by the audience for their incomprehensibilities.But what is no big mystery is the pure delight that is this DVD. No doubt the best format to which this film has never looked or sounded better. Given a new digital widescreen transfer (a first for this film) in its proper 2.351 aspect ratio, the film is clean and very sharp for such an outdated and low budget feature. The daytime scenes will have you sweating in your chair and the night scenes will have your eyes frantically searching for any signs of the 'Street Thunder' gang hiding in the bushes. If I were Carpenter, I would have been crying like a baby seeing just how beautiful this film can look given the proper time and care to transfer it correctly.While the film transfer is nothing short of spectacular, the audio is not as equally matched. Only mixed in 2.0 Dolby Surround, the audio is not what it could have been given a 5.1 or even a DTS mix. Still, though, I found it to be very effective with great bass response. Dialogue is always centered and clear. A vast improvement over the previous VHS incarnation. From the opening of the film you'll want to be sure to set your volume high as to enjoy the films great soundtrack.Extras are watered down to only a trailer and a chapter selection screen. The real highlight here however, is the audio commentary by Carpenter, which is very entertaining and informative.

The violence before the end of the movie does not qualify for a horror movie, which would make Hannibal a thriller, but saying Hannibal is a thriller wouldn't be fare to many thriller enthusiasts who rather wouldn't want to even hear about the ending.The ending truly chocked me although I had heard vague hints about it, and it is the ending that I want to focus on in this review. If you choose not to read ahead because of the spoilers, be aware that last part of the movie is not to be underrated of not being one of the most horrible scenes in movie history and I would advise strongly against young people (-18 or so) and everyone who are weak to blood and bizzare violence.WARNING! - Spoilers - Spoilers - SpoilersEating brains is of course a discusting subject, but feeding a human person with his own brain while still alive and too drugged to understand what he is eating is such a horrible thing that it makes you want to puked. Combined with the graphical ultra realism of the scene, I though I was going to faint for real. That hasn't happened for many years, although I watch A LOT of movies. It is not just the bizzarity of the situation and the visual grue that made me feel sick, but the psychology. Exposing the core of the human being and then partially ripping it away, decimating the very soul and the combined body functions of the person while he is awake but not conscious enough to understand what is happening... there are no words for it.

The scene haunted me for many hours and I still feel weak when thinking about it. I said erlier the scene looked ultra realistic and for you who didn't know in real life some brain surgery has to be performed on a person who is awake (and drugged), but that is in a clinical enviroment and of course doesn't involve eating or talking. It bothered me a lot that the ending didn't tell whether the victim of this bizzare act did survive or not. Removing the scalp and the membranes in an unsterile enviroment would probably be enough to kill the person in question, rather than cutting pieces of the brain, but I'm not quite sure. It probably takes a brain surgeon not to be bothered by the visuals. The very last scene when Hannibal feeds a kid with... well, you know... is also quite discussting and I couldn't help to wonder if that was the agent, and what really happened after Hannibal cut his hand off. Did Hannibal finally kill the agent after the struggle with Denice? Would she let him? Was that possible with a missing hand? Why did Denice go for the boat? There is a gap here. As I said before this is one of the most bothering and horrible (not meaning bad) endings in movie history. Because of it it is totally impossible to rate Hannibal.

Lyssa was the typical damsel in distress running around a fortress she has spent a few days in with perfect hair, make-up, and clean clothes. Colwyn must've been dropped on his head as a child he couldn't help grinning, even after his army had been wiped out like flies. Of course, I'm not sure if that's the way the character is supposed to be, or the actor's interpretation. Either way, it was a black mark against the name of every actor in that film (with the possible exception of Liam Neeson. He redeemed himself in Star Wars.)The last point I come to is the plot. There was not a single scene in that movie that I haven't seen before. The story made no sense, and a lot of the little side adventures were a waste of time.In conclusion, it is my opinion that this movie is suitable only as a substitution of the electric chair.

Lyssa was the typical damsel in distress running around a fortress she has spent a few days in with perfect hair, make-up, and clean clothes. Colwyn must've been dropped on his head as a child he couldn't help grinning, even after his army had been wiped out like flies. Of course, I'm not sure if that's the way the character is supposed to be, or the actor's interpretation. Either way, it was a black mark against the name of every actor in that film (with the possible exception of Liam Neeson. He redeemed himself in Star Wars.)The last point I come to is the plot. There was not a single scene in that movie that I haven't seen before. The story made no sense, and a lot of the little side adventures were a waste of time.In conclusion, it is my opinion that this movie is suitable only as a substitution of the electric chair.

And it was time well wasted. This movie is, without a doubt, the worst I have EVER seen. We were actually laughing at the credits, when the names of the Special Effects people were displayed. A moment when this is understandable At the very start, when Lyssa gets the fire from the water (?). It was so obviously VERY fake. Colwyn's torch was alight aswell, even though it had been extinguished in the water, and the fires were different colours!!A second example is when Ynyr is in that spider cave with that giant spider. The opinions within the class varied from a balloon model to a spider three millimeters long magnified.It wasn't only the special effects (or lack of).

It was without a doubt the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and those I saw it with disliked it possibly even more. I cannot believe that anyone could even stand it... there is something wrong with you people! It was of horrible quality, with no storyline, no theme, and no good messages. The character was boring, careless, and unintelligent. There was nothing good in this movie except for the occasional cartoon. It was SO LONG, and SO BORING. Seriously, worthless. We wanted to leave so badly.. not sure why we stuck it out. It was SO BAD, I can't stress this enough. I think these good reviews must just be a horrible prank to make people go out and see this unbelievably bad movie.

And there's no better example of this than the life and work of Woody Allen.Just underneath his completely fictious characters and situations may lie Allen himself.  As one watches his wildly fluctuating work, there's more than a tinge of sadness which emerges.Just the idea of a now mature adult who seemingly hasn't progressed beyond his inital youthful psychiatrist sessions, is more than a bit disturbing.Here we have the same phobias, questionings, confusions, and maladjustments of nearly forty years ago, still being spewed forth by this now-aging artist--with the gloomy cloud of press coverage from his real-life morals trial hanging over his later work.At the same time, Allen can write and deliver some of the most hilarious lines of anyone in the business, and his Sleeper for me remains one of his most successful.  In Deconstructing Harry, there's a kind of melancholia permuating the enactment, while the script ranges from brilliantly funny to depressingly gloomy.Guess I stand about midway between loving and not liking this creative performer.  While not being a fan, I certainly recognize his genius for utilizing his personal shortcomings in an artistic forum.  Sure, it may be self-therapy in which the audience becomes part of his search for fulfillment.  But the prolific results is more than a merely competant body of work.Allen cannot be easily dismissed; he's a master comedian and film maker who has fashioned some very memorable creations. Thanks to his having a very funny face and sense of wit, he's gotten us to laugh a good deal.  So, gratefully, we take the best, leave the rest and, well, wish him well during his fourth act.

Granted it was impeccably crafted and had great music & some amusing moments. But overall it seemed a bit too arch and pointless for my tastes. Which is why I am extremely pleased to report that the Coens have returned to the form by becoming serious again. The Man Who Wasn't There is throwback to classic 40s film noir. The script recalls classic James M. Cain & Billy Bob Thornton uncannily resembles Bogart (physically and in his economical delivery). The beautiful b & w work of ace DP Roger Deakins may represent a career high (and considering the astonishing quality of his work - that's saying ALOT) & easily gives the seminal work of John Alton in the 40s and 50s (T-Men, The Big Combo) a run for its money as the best b & w noir cinematography ever seen. What I was most grateful to see was the sober, existential tone of the film that largely skirted smirking, smug post-modern irony. Sure, there are plenty of oddball, surreal touches and the Coens' idiosyncratic sensibility is most assuredly present. But, the film and the filmmakers are definitely taking it seriously this time. The hero (or anti-hero)'s dilemma may harken back to classic noir heros of the 40s but he also reflect contemporary malaise.
