Some time later I saw the movie again, and thereafter I have watched it dozens of times (each time picking up on something I never noticed before).Christian Bale plays an Ivy League graduate working at a prestigious firm in mid-80's New York. He has everything going for him perfect looks, perfect job, perfect apartment, perfect fiancé played by Reese Witherspoon, but for every perfect element in his life comes a comparison to someone else with better looks (he is often compared another person as a mistaken identidy in which he is offended. Not even his lawyer calls him by the right name), better job (although they are all VP's of the company, yet Jared Leto's character for example always gets the good accounts), better apartment (more expensive, better location), or a better fiancé (Samantha Mathis' character being engaged to a seemingly obvious homosexual).Everything Bale and the rest of the cast of characters do revolves around fitting in. The night clubs, the coke habits, the luncheons at the best restaurants. In a large part of the scenes we see how society at that time behaves ($500 or so for a lunch in which they all say not bad and each provide a credit card, the memorable business card comparison scene which nearly gives Bale a heart attack). Culture and materialism is picked a part in the movie in a very comedic way.Bale spends most of his time pretending to be someone he's not (fake smiles, fake enjoyment at a Christmas party). However, the movie portrays that in his off time he is picking up hookers only to sleep with them (with praise of his good fortune expected) only to find himself enraged and compelled to murder his victims. Not limited to woman hating, he acts out on his jealousy towards a co-worker all while playing Huey Lewis soundtracks as he seems to be passionate about his 80's music and culture. A homeless man and various animals are even incorporated into his list of victims.He is able to withstand temptation of his friends and more surprisingly his secretary who he invites on a date only to let her leave unscathed. William Dafoe plays a detective who catches him in his lies and confusion.The film ends in a very eerie way as we don't know if any of the experiences with Bale were real or in his mind. He went from odd behaving to absolutely crazy and the facts are not even facts, but scattered thoughts or undefined realities.It's one of the few horror films I couldn't help but chuckle at throughout the entire sick and twisted duration.

The film is based in the 1950s and is about a group of four children, Gordy, Chris, Vern and Teddy, who are aged around 12 years old, who come from a small town in Oregon, called 'Castle Rock'. The title of the film is eye catching and reaches the inner depth of the film, as the four friends have not had the great start in life and they rely on each other for comfort and support.The film follows the children as they set off on a journey to find the body of a boy called Roy Brower who had gone missing. The journey of the boys is along a train track. They have to overcome various perils on their journey such as leeches, trains and knife waving bullies. During their journey they find a lot out about themselves and each other through their continuous conversations. Another group of boys, who could be described as the 'bad lads' are also on the trail of the dead body and it comes to a competition of who will find the body first.I really liked the authentic 1950s setting of the film. This is because of the ways this was implemented. For example, the boys discuss hitch-hiking, which was probably the norm back then, but not now. I also liked the 1950s cars used and the country and western music. The music though is a very integral ingredient in the overall nature of the film. The song 'Stand by Me', by Ben E King is almost spiritual and heart breaking and adds to the authenticity by making the film seem older than it really is. The film also contains music that the children would have liked at that time such as 'Lollipop' by 'The Chordettes'. Throughout the film there are very specific special effects to build up the suspense such as slow motion and stills. The slow motion is very good at helping the viewer to concentrate on hidden detail such as facial expressions and hand and body movements. Another part of the film I liked was the implementation of the train track. This seems to have a symbolic meaning in the film, which I will discuss later. Also, the use of the track and steam trains makes the film seem more like a western than anything else. The film was over-all very good and could be classified as one of my favourites, but I found the beginning part quite slow, although this part does help the viewer to get to know the personalities of the characters involved, so this may be a good aspect. I also found the excessive vulgar language by the actors quite unnecessary and could not understand why it should be used in a film like this. Although other films have vulgar language and it seems today that it is the norm of any film, which has an age rating of over 12. The film contains four main characters. The narrator, Gordy is the most sensible member of the children. He has lost his older brother, who he had a very close relationship with and his parents are much traumatised. In the film Gordy has a dream about his brother's funeral, where his Father turns to him and says.'That should have been you Gordy'. There is no evidence given by Gordy whether this did actually happen. However, the viewer could believe that this did, due to the continual flashbacks that Gordy has of his bad home life. Another character is Chris, who comes from a bad family and is the leader of the children. He is very protective of Gordy and both of them give each other plenty of advice. Vern is the main source of humour in the film and could be described as the geeky character. Not much comes to light about his home background and he has a sense of humour that his character doesn't know he is using. The final main character is Teddy, who can only be described as a crazy character. He is abused by his Father, who is referred to as a loony. However, he is fiercely loyal to him and will not tolerate any comment made against him. There is also evidence in the film that he might even be slightly suicidal. I really liked the way the actors played their parts and also used their own personalities to enhance the overall attitude of the film. The other group of boys who are also looking for the body would not be liked by the audience, especially their leader who carries a knife as if he is pre-meditating a murder. I would like to say that I really enjoyed the film because of how suggestive it was. There was a difference in opinion between four 12 year old boys and the police. What would be a horrible search by the police is an eye opener and adventure for the four children. The film is a 'coming of age' production and the train track could be described as life that the children are leading or opinion, as they learn the terrors of the adult world. Also the four boys and their 'bad lad' followers are like good and evil, which meet at the end in a final showdown. The film could be described as funny, light-hearted, but ultimately deeply harrowing because of the nature of the plot.

My wife's best friend swears by this film. We finally got around to renting it and although I really wanted to like it, I found it wearying. It's contrived. I kept trying to imagine what it was like to be a disaffected 20-something in 1971, thinking that the milieu of the times surely contributed to people's inclination to overlook the film's glaring faults and buy its rather forced situation. It wants to be dead-pan and over-the-top at the same time. It wants to be madcap and deadly serious. But it doesn't want to ever take the risk of holding up the two main characters to any kind of standard for three-dimensional behavior. Let's say we buy that Harold really is as morose and unhappy as his several faked suicide attempts indicate, are we ever shown any other reason other than that he has a reprehensible and insensitive parent? Are we even shown any other ways he has tried or failed to connect with others? Why should we care about this kid? What has he ever done for anyone other than a bunch of cruel pranks? And as for Maude, why the constant hypomania about living and life! -- all the feel good thoughts about trying new things. If that is really true to character for her, why? And if the hints at a dark past are what she's playing off of, then why the decision to end her life rather arbitrarily? We get lots of Cat Stevens in the soundtrack to tell us how to feel when the characters can't. It's pretty paint by numbers in the emotional department. Essentially, it's fairly manipulative -- like any good melodrama -- the only difference being that this has a counter-culture theme running through it. Good for it. It's a shame it's so enamored of it's own ironic wit and cutesiness. The title characters get the likeable traits and the everyone else is there to make their lives seem interesting in comparison. We are given nothing of anyone's back story, nothing of their motivations. We're just supposed to think that they find each other fascinating and beautiful because no one else in the film is bearable.I'm not buying it. Almost from the get-go, I thought Ruth Gordon's kooky old lady routine was too cute to be true. The horrible driving and stealing of cars are supposed to make her funny and lovable but they just made me feel like I was watching cheap filmmaker ploys at character. There's barely a single line of dialogue that's memorable or clever. But, more to the point, it's the lack of internal conflict that makes the whole thing seem rather cheap.In the film's defense, I have to say I now wonder how much of the film felt clichéd and unoriginal because it's conceits had been copied so often by others. Perhaps the fascination with eccentrics that still plays out with every movie that has Shirley Maclean in it, and every other Johnny Depp movie owes a debt to this movie for paving the way. I wish I had seen it when I was younger and it was less dated. But, more than anything, I wish it had simply been better written. There's a beautiful sentiment bedded in the film, and I wish to take away from anyone's enjoyment of it.But you have to buy it in order to enjoy it -- and there were too many forced cute moments for me to buy it.

My wife's best friend swears by this film. We finally got around to renting it and although I really wanted to like it, I found it wearying. It's contrived. I kept trying to imagine what it was like to be a disaffected 20-something in 1971, thinking that the milieu of the times surely contributed to people's inclination to overlook the film's glaring faults and buy its rather forced situation. It wants to be dead-pan and over-the-top at the same time. It wants to be madcap and deadly serious. But it doesn't want to ever take the risk of holding up the two main characters to any kind of standard for three-dimensional behavior. Let's say we buy that Harold really is as morose and unhappy as his several faked suicide attempts indicate, are we ever shown any other reason other than that he has a reprehensible and insensitive parent? Are we even shown any other ways he has tried or failed to connect with others? Why should we care about this kid? What has he ever done for anyone other than a bunch of cruel pranks? And as for Maude, why the constant hypomania about living and life! -- all the feel good thoughts about trying new things. If that is really true to character for her, why? And if the hints at a dark past are what she's playing off of, then why the decision to end her life rather arbitrarily? We get lots of Cat Stevens in the soundtrack to tell us how to feel when the characters can't. It's pretty paint by numbers in the emotional department. Essentially, it's fairly manipulative -- like any good melodrama -- the only difference being that this has a counter-culture theme running through it. Good for it. It's a shame it's so enamored of it's own ironic wit and cutesiness. The title characters get the likeable traits and the everyone else is there to make their lives seem interesting in comparison. We are given nothing of anyone's back story, nothing of their motivations.

I am pleased to say I was not let down in any way. Thirteen Days is easily the best historical and political thriller to come about in a long time.The film of course centers around the events of the two weeks Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Through the eyes of Presidential aid Kenny O'Donnell, JFK himself and Bobby Kennedy it takes us through the Crisis from the moment the Missiles were spotted. It's real eye-opener because you can't believe how close we came to war.Although Kevin Costner has received some flak for his New England accent I have to say that anyone who focuses in on trivial matters like that is missing the point of the film. O'Donnell serves as guide through the world of JFK and Ex-Comm. Costner's portrayal is a perfect mix of business like and friendship. Through his eyes we see the intimate workings of government and learn a thing or two about loyalties.Personally though I think the movie belongs to Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK. Greenwood, as the put upon President, is excellent. He looks the part (handsome and yet all business) and his accent is superb. He has Kennedy's various mannerisms and his habits of leaning a lot and sitting awkwardly to a tee. His JFK is shown as both a powerful leader and yet a vulnerable, exhausted and sick man.He carries the part like a true professional and I have yet to see a better Kennedy.Poor Steven Culp tends to get overlooked as Bobby Kennedy but in fact this is one of his finest performances. Again he looks, speaks and acts the part to perfection. He is youthful and energetic but yet a top politician and business man. The closeness between Bobby and Jack is also wonderfully shown through little meaningful looks and glances between Culp and Greenwood.The support cast are superb and the piece is historically accurate which is rare in film.

If you need to know more, glance at stamper's review.The only believable acting in this film is provided by Gary Oldman, as the title character, and Winona Rider, as his love reincarnate. Oldman provides humanity and personality to his character, and unlike some of the other accents presented in the film, sounds somewhat believable. When Ryder plays opposite to him, it is very reminiscent of her work in Edward Scissorhands, which works beautifully in this context, even if it feels a little forced.When these two step on screen, it's easy to forget about the other actors in the film. Though Sadie Frost's Lucy is believable and provides some of the little energy in the film, she is merely a plot device. Anthony Hopkins has little stage presence, and his character is so completely inconsistent that he takes an already iffy character and elevates it to new heights. The three loves of Frost's character, played by Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and Tom Waits, meld as one persona, merely divided by the three accents.

As such it's a slightly botched, uneven work.Very little of Kubrick's style &#150; which was actually still developing at the time &#150; remains intact. It does often look like a typical studio job with the director being just a cog in the crew. You can still see Kubrick's sense of contrasting high and low with location. Just as he showed complete changes of tone between the trenches and palatial officer's quarters in Paths of Glory (1957), he here compares the ornate, spacious Roman palaces with the dingy, underground gladiator's cells. In fact, the films best moments come in the first hour set at the gladiatorial school.Taking the few known facts about the real historical figures concerned, Dalton Trumbo has woven a good story, particularly with the complex rivalries and loyalties between the Romans. The dialogue however is pretty poor. Kubrick dismissed the script as being too full of stupid morality, and he was right. There are lots of impassioned speeches about dying free, much of which borders on cliché. While it's a welcome change from the piety of the religious epics of the 1950s, this deal with making such a big thing of the hero being perfectly noble and principled can be almost as bad.In spite of the stellar acting line-up, there are only really three acting performances I really like &#150; the trio of English Romans. Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton are both ideally suited to their roles as Crassus and Gracchus respectively. However best of all is my all time favourite actor &#150; Peter Ustinov who, as usual steals the show as the gladiatorial school owner Batiatus. Apparently Ustinov wrote most of his own dialogue, which explains why he gets all the best lines. Or perhaps it's just his deadpan delivery which gives lines like Most exciting. I tingle, such brilliance.The musical score is instantly forgettable. In fact I even forget who composed it. Kubrick does make good use of it though, editing to the beat in two key scenes &#150; when Spartacus and Draba are waiting to fight each other, and in the build up to the final battle &#150; building up tension well.There are quite a few moments of sloppiness in Spartacus. There are plot holes big enough to drive a convenient character arc through. There is a hideous backdrop which makes what was supposed to be quite a warm, poignant scene look silly. I'll also point out rather smugly that, if you watch closely in the scene of the gladiators rebelling at the school, Spartacus actually defeats no less than four fully armed Roman guards using nothing more than a wicker basket. Mind you, it's cinema. You can overlook these things, sit back and enjoy.So, it's no small wonder that after Spartacus Kubrick moved to the UK and ensured he had complete control of all his pictures from thereon. You would never guess that it was the product of one of cinema's most stylised and meticulous directors. When there are moments of brilliance they are rarely a result of directorial style. It's not a bad film &#150; it has just enough good elements to hold it all together. But on the flipside it has far too many bad elements to make it a classic.

Thankfully it was a time before routine fifty dollar pay per view cable events. However even though Ali's name had become a household word, I didn't know a lot about his private life, or the deeply held convictions that retreated behind the front page headlines. Ali does a nice job of chronicling the roughly ten year span between his first title win and the defeat of George Foreman after being stripped of the championship.Those who tune in and expect boxing to take center stage might be disappointed; many reviews on this forum express that. That might be missing the point of the film, as there are enough documentaries, interviews and fight films to pursue if that's what one is looking for. Director Michael Mann instead concentrates on Ali's Nation of Islam connection, his friendship with Malcolm X, the shattering of his ties with Elijah Muhammad, and ultimately the loss of the world title as a result of his refusal to be drafted. Besides presenting a sports hero, the film presents a human being showing the world that it's important to live by one's principles.I was intrigued by the almost symbiotic relationship revealed by the story between Ali and legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell (Jon Voight in a take notice role). If you caught their famous verbal battles back in the day, you would swear they were mortal enemies, yet even though they seemed to enjoy taking shots at each other, the scene during the Wide World of Sports segment showed just how loyal Cosell was to the Champ. It was also interesting to watch Ali's defense of trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) during a pre fight briefing with promoter Don King; it showed that Ali wasn't a big fan of King.The biggest surprise of the story for me - Joe Frazier agrees to defend the title against Ali as the two men meet privately, with not a manager, promoter or lawyer in sight. Just two men agreeing to get it done, with a lot at stake for both winner and loser.The most inspirational moment, aside from actually winning the championship, is the training run in Kinshasa, Zaire, as the locals turn out to celebrate a hero. One wonders what had to be going through Ali's mind as he witnessed that turnout, it appeared incredibly moving on film.Undoubtedly, this was Will Smith's career role, and he pulled it off convincingly. He managed to capture the essence of the boxer and the man, earning the real Muhammad Ali's respect in the process, and what could be better than that.

Thankfully it was a time before routine fifty dollar pay per view cable events. However even though Ali's name had become a household word, I didn't know a lot about his private life, or the deeply held convictions that retreated behind the front page headlines. Ali does a nice job of chronicling the roughly ten year span between his first title win and the defeat of George Foreman after being stripped of the championship.Those who tune in and expect boxing to take center stage might be disappointed; many reviews on this forum express that.

Highlighting the ritualistic 'Friday night' and purposeless afternoons, Linklater uncovered the hidden cultural vibrancy within a section of the population who are so often maligned as 'cultureless'. In a particular montage from Dazed and Confused, images of young people cruising the main drag are flashed within a backdrop of the neon twilight typical of America's commercialized sprawl. From the eye of the uninspired, the environment seems completely homogeneous, yet Linklater's intrinsic sensibility of the suburban aesthetic succeeds in portraying this as a scene of excitement and all out possibility where the characters look alive and enthusiastic amidst such an artificial and wearisome environment&#151;it is a defining moment in Linklater's uniquely modern depiction of the sublime, his triumph to find beauty in monotonous. Linklater's adaptation of Erica Bogosian's play subUrbia (1996) follows the same current as the scene in Dazed, yet sans the youthful idealism and expanding upon the central theme of Bogosian's work suburban decay.SubUrbia is stock full of familiar images of the suburban aesthetic 20 years down the road from Dazed (Both filmed in suburban Texas) and backed with a soundtrack courtesy of Sonic Youth (a band whose sound I would argue replicates the feeling of 1990's America.) In a consistently sedated tone, the film follows a group of substance abusing 20-something nobodies in their stagnant town of Burnfield. Terrified to actually confront any progress or purpose, these pseudo-adults stand around in a convenience store parking lot talking about themselves in self-congratulatory manner (the film's particular capitalization of the second 'U' in the title speaks to this theme of self-absorption.) The story's protagonist Jeff (played very convincingly by Giovanni Ribisi) is a jaded, unmotivated anti-hero with seemingly good intentions, but never the follow through to back them up. Consequently, he lives out of a pup-tent in his parents' garage, barely holding a part time and satisfying his latent intellectual streak with a night class at the local community college. Jeff's girlfriend Sooze (Amie Carey) is a sort of caricature of the suburban bred artist set on 'escaping' to New York, while Sooze's character hints at aspects of the genuine, she is ultimately malleable to outside forces such as the romanticized escape dream and the reemergence of a former fellow burnout turned rock star 'Pony'(Jayce Bartok.) The others group in the group of misfit are decidedly more volatile, killing time with a self-destructive consumption of booze and harassing a Pakistani convenience store owner Nazeer (Ajay Naidu) who they xenophobically refer to as 'Mohammed' even though his real name is not revealed until the film's closing climax. Jeff's best friend Tim (Nicky Katt) is the prime perpetrator of the racism towards Nazeer, referring to him as a 'brown bastard' and yelling sexual and racial epithets at the store owner's wife after she pulls a gun on him during one confrontation. Tim is far and away the least likable character of the film, and it would be easy to write him off as a cut-out racial bully, yet he is also the films most powerful representation. Tim alludes on several occasions to his service in the air force and success as a high school football star, but never does he portray his experience as being in any way glorious or important, nor does he speak of anything in such a manner, he seems numbed by his blasé surroundings and only displays emotion in the context of anger or violence toward outside forces. He is the archetype of what a harsh suburban environment creates an angry, ignorant addict trapped in his own misdoings. Interestingly, Tim is the only one of the characters who does not in at least some way attest to being an 'artist'. Jeff justifies his laziness with a hobby of creative writing, Pony has found success with his songs (a success that Jess and Tim highly resent) and even goof-ball druggie Buff (played with the now familiar zaniness of Steve Zahn) claims to make videos. The motif is very ironic for the filmmakers Linklater and Bogosian, as it seems to critique the salience of white, suburban-raised voices in the artistic world. The group of friends exists in opposition to the film's only pragmatic character, Nazeer, who takes pride in being a business owner and on his way to a computer science degree, while the likes of Tim and Buff drift through life with their only goal being to wake up the next more and start the cycle of decay over again. Jeff sits on the fringe of these two worlds as evidenced by his civil interactions with Nazeer and being the only one to actually ask for his real name. There is a sparkle of enlightenment in Jeff, and he even reaches his own cathartic epiphany, screaming passionately about the privilege of being able to be alive, yet the motivation draining presence of his friends and environment ultimately appear to have him cornered. In the films closing scene, a lesser mentioned friend of the group Bee Bee is found on the convenience store's roof having suffered an overdose. Nazeer looks directly at Jeff in disbelief and sadness, saying You have everything and you throw it all away! Jeff says nothing in response, just staring back at Nazeer blankly, his face distraught but blank in the same moment&#151;he recognizes the plague of his situation, yet remains incapable of action. ******** ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2006","score":"","review":" Richard Linklater definitely has an eye for America's mundane middle class, his films Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993) brought an artistic perspective to the experience of the suburban miscreant that in many ways becoming the defining discourse on youth in the 1990s.

Tarantino broke new bounds in his debut with Reservoir Dogs, Rodriguez broke new bounds in his debut with El Mariachi, Allison Anders with Gas, Food, Lodging, Gregg Araki with The Living End, Jimenez and Steinberg with The Waterdance, Tom Kalin with Swoon, Anthony Drazan with Zebrahead. The one that stuck with everyone and lingered and served as the omen for what was to become a new wave of cinema for the past 14 years was Reservoir Dogs.As much as I get sick and tired of the truly excessive worship Tarantino receives, one can never ever say his movies are bad. He is one of the few great independent filmmakers that started with a low-budget debut that was actually a truly great film. Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, two directors whose films can hardly ever be rated below 9 or 10 on this IMDb rating scale, both started off with films that weren't terribly great, and not only that, they like everyone else started off with short films and student films. Tarantino's career just started with this color, star-studded, completely un-campy, blood-soaked drama and has never once gone downhill since. The cinematography gives it the perfect look and gives off intermittent volatility, the editing very subtle even if the keenest, sharpest movie obsessive can tell when a cutaway is a cutaway and an insert is an insert. Do I think he should be mentioned as someone you can never compare to whenever a director makes a crime film? Should every other movie be deemed average or a little above because by comparison Tarantino's genius is no match? No. And I get very frustrated whenever I see instances such as these, which happens to be all the time. Nevertheless, the man is an extraordinary filmmaker, a master from the beginning, which is something you can definitely say is rare.The cast, all having been in jail at some point in their off-screen lives, is generally excellent. This is one of Keitel's best performances by a long shot. Buscemi turns in an incredibly smart performance, letting us know that he is possibly the smartest one of the whole bunch. Roth is a chameleon, always shocking us with Mr. Orange's transience. Tierney, famously the main livewire during shooting of the film, radiates that unspoken, indirectly communicated grit and spunk in only a few, mostly fairly docile scenes. While the late Penn lingers between false and passable, Madsen is the most memorable and unique. The cold, unpredictable nature of Mr. Blonde appears with the utmost effect in his performance.This being what has to be a viewing that contributes to what has to be hundreds of times I've seen it, just like most people my age and my sex, I forgot how much the film itself is a film outside conventional storytelling. It begins, as you all know, with a bunch of guys in suits, tough and cool manly men, sitting around a table in a coffee shop theorizing on the song Like A Virgin and systematic tipping of waitresses. Then they leave. Then the opening credits start. Then one of them is bleeding to death in the back seat of a car being driven at a grueling pace by another of them. Our thoughts suddenly shift. The film continues in this manner. The plot unfolds in ways where our minds take hairpin turns from what we were immediately expecting and gives us something much better and much more riveting and unpredictable. Though his later films elaborate on his brilliance in writing, Reservoir Dogs remains a clear demonstration of Tarantino's shining gift for the power of the pen. He has what even most of the greatest screenwriters of all time don't have, which is a knack for never giving us what we expect and making us love it and want more no matter how extensive the running time.

Tierney, famously the main livewire during shooting of the film, radiates that unspoken, indirectly communicated grit and spunk in only a few, mostly fairly docile scenes. While the late Penn lingers between false and passable, Madsen is the most memorable and unique. The cold, unpredictable nature of Mr. Blonde appears with the utmost effect in his performance.This being what has to be a viewing that contributes to what has to be hundreds of times I've seen it, just like most people my age and my sex, I forgot how much the film itself is a film outside conventional storytelling. It begins, as you all know, with a bunch of guys in suits, tough and cool manly men, sitting around a table in a coffee shop theorizing on the song Like A Virgin and systematic tipping of waitresses. Then they leave. Then the opening credits start. Then one of them is bleeding to death in the back seat of a car being driven at a grueling pace by another of them. Our thoughts suddenly shift. The film continues in this manner. The plot unfolds in ways where our minds take hairpin turns from what we were immediately expecting and gives us something much better and much more riveting and unpredictable. Though his later films elaborate on his brilliance in writing, Reservoir Dogs remains a clear demonstration of Tarantino's shining gift for the power of the pen. He has what even most of the greatest screenwriters of all time don't have, which is a knack for never giving us what we expect and making us love it and want more no matter how extensive the running time. He also has what every great screenwriter has, and then some.

Before it became too comic book, they were an effective and entertaining series of action flicks. Besides, no one was cooler than Connery in the role. While having the usual themes of intrigue, they were a bit more plausible and believable, at least until we met the villains (whom were always appropriately over the top). Plus, the characters were always much more interesting and developed as opposed to plot devices. Don't let all this make you believe they are devoid of entertainment value however. This is one of the most quickly paced action flicks of the decade.Sean Connery surprisingly avoided typecasting after this role. Hes just so breathtakingly cool, suave, charismatic, and handsome. No one else can be Bond in my mind. Also, Ursula Andress may as well be the best Bond girl ever. She certainly has the best entrance out of any of them. Unfortunately, Joseph Wiseman isn't as memorable a villain as Goldfinger or Blofeld. Still, he is serviceable in the role. Overall, this ranks with Goldfinger and From Russia With Love as the best in the series and is one of the best action flicks of the 60s. The Bond films were never the same once Connery left.

His name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) Upon Tony's arrival in America, he is already spotted as a potential threat and is interrogated by customs agents who find out a little bit of his history and decide to send him to a special camp where all Cuban undesirables are sent. Some time later, opportunity knocks in the form of murdering a Cuban general, sent to prison by Fidel himself, who tortured and killed govt. officials back in Cuba and now one of those official's brother, who is a powerful man in Miami, wants him dead. Tony, his best friend Manolo (Steven Bauer), and a few other friends carry out this task and earn themselves a Green Card. But this is only the beginning....This powerful man, turns out to be Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) a wealthy Miami drug lord whom Tony ends up working for. Frank Lopez's right hand man is Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) a guy who does not like Tony Montana's determination and attitude and calls him derogatory names like peasant and dish washer but Tony is not exactly crazy about him either. We also meet Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio) a beautiful 19-year old for whom Manolo falls for, but Tony does not want Manolo anywhere near his sister, because is the only pure untouched thing in his life and does not want her to be corrupted by his world, but eventually this does happen. Later on, Tony falls head over heels for Frank's sexy, young wife Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) who despite her beauty and wealth, is always miserable and does nothing but snort coke all day and never cracks a single smile. Tony starts making the moves on Elvira, until later on in the movie, snatches her away from Frank, but not before removing Frank from the map, but that comes later. During one of Tony's business trips we meet yet another character, The ruthless and even more powerful drug kingpin, Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) a Bolivian landowner who has a drug empire that stretches all across South America. Tony does his best, at first to impress this new acquaintance, and when Sosa questions him about his loyalty, Tony is quick to assure Sosa that he is also someone not to be messed with and is a man of his word. When Tony reaches the top and is now more powerful than his boss, Frank, ever was. Manolo, Tony's right hand man begins to take care of Tony's finances, but, in Tony's words, Manolo cares more about women than business and therefore, does not trust him completely when it comes to money.During the almost three hours of the movie we get to see Tony's rise and then, after a hot-tempered decision, his imminent fall. Scarface is a story of not only an underdog who works his way up until he reaches the American dream, but of the consequences of living in the fast lane. Like one of the songs from the movie soundtrack talks about Push it to the Limit which, thanks to this movie, is now a classic.Yes, this movie nowadays is idolized by pop culture and by rappers and gangsters all over the world. But the question is why a movie who did not do too well at the box office at the time of its release is more popular now than it was two decades ago?. Because the story and the message behind it is timeless. Perhaps because back in the early 80's people were not ready for an in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is movie about something that is very real nowadays, drug trafficking, and for the standards of the time, the movie was very graphic. That perhaps, drove some moviegoers away and is maybe the reason why it was so panned by critics back then. But now, times are different and perhaps this movie speaks to the generation of today, who are more aware that these things are happening out there, or perhaps, because it sends out the same message their favorite hip-hop artists often talk about, which is making it to the top and earning respect through having balls and determination like Tony had. Yes, some people see it as a movie that glorifies crime and drugs and easy money. But the movie really has a deeper message. No one stays on top of the world forever. The world was his, yes, but not for long. In a few words..one of the best crime-drama movies of all time.

Tony starts making the moves on Elvira, until later on in the movie, snatches her away from Frank, but not before removing Frank from the map, but that comes later. During one of Tony's business trips we meet yet another character, The ruthless and even more powerful drug kingpin, Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) a Bolivian landowner who has a drug empire that stretches all across South America. Tony does his best, at first to impress this new acquaintance, and when Sosa questions him about his loyalty, Tony is quick to assure Sosa that he is also someone not to be messed with and is a man of his word. When Tony reaches the top and is now more powerful than his boss, Frank, ever was. Manolo, Tony's right hand man begins to take care of Tony's finances, but, in Tony's words, Manolo cares more about women than business and therefore, does not trust him completely when it comes to money.During the almost three hours of the movie we get to see Tony's rise and then, after a hot-tempered decision, his imminent fall. Scarface is a story of not only an underdog who works his way up until he reaches the American dream, but of the consequences of living in the fast lane. Like one of the songs from the movie soundtrack talks about Push it to the Limit which, thanks to this movie, is now a classic.Yes, this movie nowadays is idolized by pop culture and by rappers and gangsters all over the world. But the question is why a movie who did not do too well at the box office at the time of its release is more popular now than it was two decades ago?. Because the story and the message behind it is timeless. Perhaps because back in the early 80's people were not ready for an in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is movie about something that is very real nowadays, drug trafficking, and for the standards of the time, the movie was very graphic. That perhaps, drove some moviegoers away and is maybe the reason why it was so panned by critics back then. But now, times are different and perhaps this movie speaks to the generation of today, who are more aware that these things are happening out there, or perhaps, because it sends out the same message their favorite hip-hop artists often talk about, which is making it to the top and earning respect through having balls and determination like Tony had. Yes, some people see it as a movie that glorifies crime and drugs and easy money. But the movie really has a deeper message. No one stays on top of the world forever. The world was his, yes, but not for long. In a few words..one of the best crime-drama movies of all time.

His name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) Upon Tony's arrival in America, he is already spotted as a potential threat and is interrogated by customs agents who find out a little bit of his history and decide to send him to a special camp where all Cuban undesirables are sent. Some time later, opportunity knocks in the form of murdering a Cuban general, sent to prison by Fidel himself, who tortured and killed govt. officials back in Cuba and now one of those official's brother, who is a powerful man in Miami, wants him dead. Tony, his best friend Manolo (Steven Bauer), and a few other friends carry out this task and earn themselves a Green Card. But this is only the beginning....This powerful man, turns out to be Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) a wealthy Miami drug lord whom Tony ends up working for. Frank Lopez's right hand man is Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) a guy who does not like Tony Montana's determination and attitude and calls him derogatory names like peasant and dish washer but Tony is not exactly crazy about him either.
