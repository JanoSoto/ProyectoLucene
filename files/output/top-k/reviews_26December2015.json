Dustin Hoffman's character 'Benjamin' is supposed to be very smart and reasonably rational (in accordance with his college accomplishments, as declared by his parents in the beginning of the movie). But each scene reveals him to be an Idiot and a douche-bag. His character acts upon random emotions, is careless, fearful, shy, inconsiderate, lacks basic reasoning ability, gets infatuated with Katherine's Character, then stalks her, all the while worrying about his future but not doing anything about it. All through the film he repeats a same pattern Act upon impulse, worsen the situation, then apologize profusely for his action. Rinse and repeat.Now I am all OK with dumb characters (as long as it's a comedy film), but I found it impossible to relate to 'Benjamin' He was just a little too dumb for a supposedly-smart guy, not to mention a little hard of hearing too - it caused cognitive dissonance.

Like Katherine's dad, who is unconvincingly insistent on making it happen between Benjamin and Elaine (Katherine's Character). Like Benjamin, he is hard of hearing. So, he always, pours Benjamin Scotch when he asks for Bourbon. Friend's of Benjamin's parents declare how proud they are of his accomplishments in the first scene which strikes a little too unrealistic. Now I am from India, where unless you take your family out of poverty, it is rare to hear those words even from your Parents.

First, it's got the greatest amount of on screen dialog by a character talking to himself. And secondly, the story references more movie titles than any other picture I can think of. I came up with the following - Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954); From Here to Eternity (1953); The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945); and Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954). All but Dorian Gray were relative contemporaries of this one, made within a couple years of The Seven Year Itch.So I guess the time and place for a picture like this was the 1950's. Along with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) and Some Like it Hot (1959), both of which also star Marilyn Monroe, the story telling consisted of libido saturated men salivating over ditzy women and the complications that arise during the chase. Time and tastes would eventually put these kind of pictures out of favor and I guess that's why they have a dated feel to them today. One could make the case that they're chauvinistic to a fault and you wouldn't get much push back from me on that score.But just like the racial references one finds in pictures of the Thirties and Forties when blacks were called 'boy' and Chinese were 'Chinks', it's interesting to see the evolution of society and the movies that reflect those attitudes in each ensuing decade on the big screen. The Seven Year Itch is like a movie version of a TV sit-com one might have caught during the era, but with a subject matter a bit too intimidating for family fare.I've never been a big fan of Marilyn Monroe and her film comedies generally leave me feeling ambivalent regarding her talent. The one picture in which she does leave a significant impression is 1961's The Misfits where she uses her eyes expressively to reveal the pain of her character. Had her life not been cut short we might have seen more influential work from this actress who's legacy primarily rests on scenes like the one in this picture, skirt billowing in an updraft to reveal the hint of sexuality for which the blonde actress was primarily known.Tom Ewell, with his hilarious facials and discombobulated lack of self confidence is the perfect foil for 'The Girl in this story. Unable to pull the trigger on his infatuation for the girl upstairs, Richard Sherman (Ewell) represents the Everyman who considers himself a Casanova, but underneath it all, is firmly anchored to the idea of one man, one woman, at least as the institution of marriage existed in the Fifties.

I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this. But still, it turned out okay, could've been better, but it's not the worst in the series. The worst in my opinion comes after this, with Attack of the Clones. But I'm not gonna say much about it here, I'll leave that for it's own review.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"26 December 2015","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I still remember the first time I tried to watch this movie. I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"26 December 2015","score":"","review":" If a nature documentary Attenborough style chooses the choicest shots, the majestic voice-over and score to elicit maximum excitement and wonder, Roeg's Walkabout does the opposite. It does not seek to amaze, but present an unflinching look at the Australian outback, where at any time you could be hundreds of kilometres from the nearest petrol station. Roeg shoots with a tenacity for the fauna and flora; horny lizards bathe in the ember sun, wombats prod at sleeping children, ant and flies are ever constant. The temptation to err and fleetingly capture Uluru in all its size and iconicity is rejected. He will zoom into a random incident of an animal devouring another, giving it no symbolic power but simply showcasing the harshness for what it is. And then he will zoom out from our characters, contextualising them and making them tiny amongst the crimson red hills of sand. Barry's score, with its cacophony of bleeps, high pitched shrieks, radio static and echidna paws trampling up dust, adds a hallucinogenic mood and makes the great stretches of land vast and infused with a haunting beauty. The trees respond to this and seem to shiver in the hot wind. Sometimes, he will forgo hard cuts and dissolve cliffs and mountains and other scenery against each other, as if to represent passing of time. But he never puts a definite marker on these periods; a crucial element of the story is the vagueness of this perception, as the pair wander confused, lost and desperate. Prior to this wandering, there is a wordless intro of sorts, where we survey the image of modernity in 70s Adelaide, but against the backing of a didgeridoo. Roeg is selective about inserting hints of this world with our main narrative. As our nameless Aboriginal boy on his walkabout hunts and skins a kangaroo, we crosscut over to a butcher who mimics the same actions; who tears at tendons with his hands rather than his teeth, but the intent is the same. Dangling and playing around trees is compared to a group of Indigenous women having their fun in the now burnt husk of the car. And in one moment where the two collide, and Barry's score kicks into a haunting gear, and we freeze-frame on animals escaping and reverse this again and again. But I do think in this instance it is a tiny bit over dramatic - it may be in little Luc's perspective, but is the objective of hunting quite so different? And then there is something which they both share, because it is the inescapable nature of humans. Jenny Agutter was 17 by the time that filming began and it was even more appropriate, as she neared adulthood. She has to continually reign in his younger brother, whom is oblivious to the situation, as well as deal with her developing sexuality. The sensual glances from the Aboriginal boy (and I think from the father too at the beginning, very subtly, who has recognised her physical growth) mirror those of the weather scientists towards their female colleague. Two teenagers will share glances at sensually formed branches in the dark, and as she explores the ruins of an old shack and the burial mounds of the inhabitants, he ha a wide grin on his face as he looks over. Roeg intercuts this with a extreme closeup of a termite burrowing its way out of the dirt ground, as if trying to form a conscious connection between the two worlds, but it is in vain. Likewise, when he performs a ritualistic mating dance, with clay smeared body paints, she shys away because she does not understand. But in some ways, in the stripped dialogue between the siblings, she does know a little. She is embarrassed of her nudity and hurries to clothe herself as he dances to the didgeridoo, but earlier, she is much more at ease twisting and sliding her way through the crystal clear pool, and there is almost a conscious sense of display at work. She understands a little then, but does not fully grasp this experience, even as Roeg fast forwards and presents us again with the image of modernity, inside that identical dainty little kitchen for the housewife. And we dissolve again, and she flashes back to that idyllic time in the pools. It is a remarkable achievement to make a film so balanced, so unbiased, so thoughtful of both sides - Roeg does not attempt to fetishsize the mystic power and authentic natural living of the Aboriginals in the outback, and there is no reward for the pursuit of it after throwing away the cityscape life. The boy is resourceful, but not in a wondrous way. The modern citizens are not caricatures for the way of harsh contrast (except perhaps for one fleeting moment at a plantation). And Roeg, having done this in 1971, as a British director, has a remarkable sensibility for the cultures involved, even as Aboriginal racial tensions waver today. The final scene is poetic powerful and completely devoid of any cultural, racial or sexual prejudice. But it becomes lost in time and memory. It is a dream, after all.

Everything, from the wallpaper in the 1st Class Suites to the bunks in 3rd Class, from the bow where Jack and Rose have their first meeting to the wireless room where Harold Bride and Jack Phillips desperately sent their (ultimately futile) SOS signals for emergency assistance, is, as it were, as it was. Cameron even ensures that the audience is never in doubt as to the horrific fate of the 1500 people left aboard Titanic when the lifeboats left; there was no absence of life jackets, and most of the people left behind froze to death in the icy waters off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For most Americans born after the discovery of the Titanic's wreck by Robert Ballard in 1986, this film was their introduction to the fascinating, tragic story of the unsinkable ship of dreams. All of this, of course, would mean nothing if the film was a dud. And truthfully, the script ain't Shakespeare. Kate Winslet's Rose is made to remark that  it appears there are not enough life boats for everyone aboard while on a tour of the ship early in the film. Hint, hint. Poor Billy Zane isn't given much to work with in Cal, Rose's one note fiancée. Her choice between ego-maniacal capitalist and sensitive, artistic proletarian isn't much of a choice at all. And good old Leo looks, more than 15 years on, like he's strutting onto the ship from 90s middle America, not 1912. But I'm quibbling. No, Jack and Rose would never have been able to meet in real life. No, Jack would never in a million years have been allowed to attend a dinner in 1st Class. No, no 1st class girls got to attend quaint Irish dance parties in 3rd Class (was this in keeping with the Riverdance phenomenon of the time, James?). And the heart-rending last moments between our star crossed lovers on the floating door would have been quite impossible (hypothermia would have set in within five minutes, and their bodies would have been twitching like crazy from the shock of the below-freezing water, thus preventing any kind of coherent conversation at all). But in the end, none of that matters much. At it's heart, Titanic is a piece of classic American folk art. It's not meant for the highbrow crowd; there aren't long lingering shots open to multiple interpretations. Jack's observation that Monet's use of color is great is, to be sure, wince inducing. But at it's heart, Titanic works because it reflects our own deepest, personal wishes; our most cherished and deeply held dreams. The dream to break out of our personal circumstances and live our lives as we wish to live them (to quote Jack early in the film). And of course, to love and be loved so deeply, that even if we only know the person for seventy two hours and are separated from them for 84 years, we remember them and our time with them as if it were yesterday.To know what it is to finally meet the one person who you would happily, even gratefully, give up your own life to save. This is the kind of love all humans dream of, but seldom find. The best art reflects and interprets dreams common to humankind; by telling this story in this particular way, James Cameron has succeeded spectacularly in creating a visual tone poem to human yearning. Even if the first half of the film seems like a trite soap opera, the emotional impact of the final moments alone puts everything you've seen in the first three hours into sharp perspective. One wonders how many people in that freezing water more than a hundred years ago now felt as Jack did in those final moments.

Do make sure you have a substantial amount of chocolate pralines while watching, otherwise it will feel like the confectionery equivalent of water-boarding. I could watch this all over again.

I tried not to like it when it first came out due to its name. Seriously, George Lucas...Attack of the Clones? I mean, I get it, but there were lots of options for a better name than that. The Clone Army would have sufficed. But I digress...Again, I really like this movie. It suffers from a bit of poor dialogue and bad acting between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen--their on screen romance feels very much like a bad daytime soap opera rather than something worthy of the Star Wars franchise.And yet, that bit of dissatisfaction aside, I find this to be a fantastic film overall. The storyline is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan's search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great.And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee's performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in Phantom Menace, but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.But I suppose the most important thing that I enjoy about this movie is that it just brings so many pieces of the puzzle together. Anakin's story advances in a way that is plausible and believable, even if Christensen's portrayal suffers at times. This movie sets up his path to the Dark Side in profound fashion, and makes the six films flow together. I like that sense of continuity, and so I'm giving this movie 8\/10 stars. Again, the cheesy soap opera stuff between Anakin and Amidala is a major blow to the film--but all in all it's a great movie.Side Note If I wanted to, I could get really critical about one element of the overall plot here. This whole Dark Side thing and the people involved in the plot to take over the Republic goes completely unnoticed by Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). That really cheapens the whole Jedi thing, in my view--the most powerful Jedi in the world are right in the midst of the people who are orchestrating the fall of the Republic, and they can't even sense it. Strange. Same goes for the fact that Dooku's back story is so wrapped up in the Jedi. How could they never sense this disturbance in the force in a way that would root it out?Whatever the case, that does bother me when I think critically about the film.

Doris is initially happy with her new Santa Claus as he actually looks like Santa Claus (real whiskers and all). However, when Santa Claus (played by Edward Gwenn) starts claiming that he is the real Santa Claus Doris is horrified especially after she's explained to her young daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) that Santa Claus isn't real. Santa Claus AKA Kris Kringle ends up institutionalised as a result of his claims (and also due to the behaviour of unscrupulous psychiatrist Granville Sawyer). Having established enough evidence to believe that Kringle is the real Santa Claus lawyer Fred Gailey (John Payne) takes Kringle's case to court to prove once and for all that he is the real Santa Claus.I think one of the key successes with a film like Miracle on 34th Street is that it is a film that has great appeal to very young children but it also has some themes running throughout the film that adult audiences can also pick up upon. Clearly children are the key target audience here (given the nature of the premise it's probably a film that will work better with very young children). However, if you delve deeper then it's clear that there is also plenty of content and commentary on offer to an adult audience as well.The selling point for an adult audience is that the film also remembers what Christmas is actually about and actually manages to turn negatives into positives - the film focuses on such things as Christmas being far too commercialised, it also focuses on corporate greed and consumerism (department stores trying to manipulate kids into buying items they're overstocked with rather than toys that they actually want). It then turns these negatives into positives by Kringle's notion of being honest with the kids by referring them to another store if Macy's doesn't have the toy that they want. Initially, the head of Macy's department store is angry about the idea of losing business, but Kringle's actions have so much positivity about them that it ends up bringing good PR to Macy's. This leads to a funny moment where the heads of the two biggest department stores are actually encouraging shoppers to buy things from their rivals store which is both ironic and very clever.I think some of the best moments in the film are the scenes between Kris Kringle and Susan Walker (Natalie Wood). As mentioned, Gwenn is excellent here and is probably everything that kids imagine Santa Claus to be - kind, wise, caring, selfless. Considering Natalie Wood was only around 9 years old when this was made I thought her performance here was terrific and at times she almost steals the show from Gwenn. She's neither overly-cute, annoying or bratty and basically just portrays a young girl who slowly starts to believe in something that she's always been told isn't real. The chemistry and warmth displayed between the two characters was a joy to behold. Of course the film had other strengths as well, but Gwenn and Wood were the real stars of the show here.Miracle on 34th Street is a film with plenty for children and adults alike to enjoy. Young children will bear witness to a wonderful interpretation of the mythical man with the white beard who delivers all their presents on Christmas morning. For adults there's a bit of escapism and subtle nods about commercialisation, corporate greed and consumerism and again I liked the idea that these negative aspects were given a positive spin.

Let's say this straight away FotR is the best movie of the trilogy, hands down. What makes it stand out as masterpiece is its variety. We can witness a majority of Middle Earth in this one movie. We will take part in a celebration in the beautiful Hobbiton along with some hobbits, look in the eye of darkness in the form of Nazgul and feel danger on the Weathertop, see the serenity of Rivendell, gaze the ruggedness of Misty Mountains, sense the eeriness of Moria, listen to the elves sing in Lothlorien, enter the realm of men through the majestic Argonath and finally see a glimpse of distant Mordor over Emyn Muil. I mean, if that's not one hell of an adventure, I'm not sure what is. And still the movie doesn't feel like it has too much things going on. It's the adventurous nature of the book, that is perfectly implemented into a movie. Obviously the long duration helps. It's more like a necessity to include the majority of things.Still, even the extended edition doesn't contain everything from the book. For example the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil was left out, which was a disappointment when I first saw the movie 14 years ago. But afterwards I understand, that the whole scenario would have affected the flow of the film dramatically, and that the character Tom Bombadil wasn't really suitable for a big screen audience. He was more of a Tolkien's stream of consciousness than an important character for the plot and works better within the more poetic and slower approach of the book. Although, in TTT the Fangorn Forest is connected with the Old Forest, which is also mentioned in that movie.One thing that was changed big time was the expanded role of Arwen when she comes to rescue from Rivendell. It doesn't happen that way in the book but works fine here.During the movie I never felt bored, and still today I feel the same tension and awe of the first screening in every take. What a wonderful and careful directing from Mr. Jackson. When the actors and director care for their work, it really comes out lifelike. Of course it helps when we know the story and characters beforehand, but they are cast and acted so well that it amazes me. Every one looks the part. My favourites being Boromir, Legolas, Galadriel and Gandalf. And I thought Sir McKellen was great as Magneto in X-Men, but he really is Gandalf in real life, I believe so.Whereas TTT and RotK are more epic in staging and effects, FotR is more accurate and subtle. TTT has its moments like Gollum, RotK has the most beautiful ending and an epic battle in Minas Tirith, the FotR is a nonstop roller-coaster ride with beauty, despair, companionship and sense of growing danger that lurks everywhere. The characters feel more vulnerable, like the fact that the hobbits require protection from the bigger characters. On the other hand Gandalf seems to possess more magic powers than later in the saga as Gandalf the White. All in all FotR takes less liberties than the next two movies and stays true to the book. In fact, it must be the best book adaptation ever filmed.

Having made audiences laugh in THE AWFUL TRUTH (Columbia, 1937), and MY FAVORITE WIFE (RKO Radio, 1940), Irene Dunne and Cary Grant team together for the third and final encore that offers humor, sentiment and tearful moments that rank this their most popular of the three for which they appeared.PENNY SERENADE begins with Julie Adams (Irene Dunne)returning home with her decision of leaving her husband, Roger (Cary Grant). Before packing, her collection of records in a scrapbook titled The Story of a Happy Marriage sets Julie through her Penny Serenade as she reminisces while listening to old tunes connected to various chapters of her life. The first song, You Were Meant For Me, introduced in the late twenties, is the recording played in a music shop where Roger passes by, taking an interest in one of its workers, Julie Gardiner. After buying 27 records without even owning a phonograph, Julie realizes his intention, followed by a six month courtship and finally marriage. Roger, a newspaperman by profession, is assigned to a new job as correspondent in Japan, where he takes his new bride. Poor Butterfly becomes the tune associated with their stay in Japan where an earthquake causes the miscarriage of Julie's unborn child. Unable to birth any more children, the couple settle in San Francisco where Roger establishes his own newspaper business, The Rosalia Weekly Courier, becoming his own boss and publisher. Applejack Carney (Edgar Buchanan), a close friend of the couple, arrives from Brooklyn to assist Roger as press agent, better known as printer. Through Applejack's suggestion, the couple consider adopting a child of their own, and through the kindness of Miss Oliver (Beulah Bondi), head of the adoption agency, the couple do adopt a child. All goes well for the next few years until an unforeseen circumstance takes place that puts a burden on their marriage.With flashback episodes tied together with musical chronology through much of its 118 minutes, the only debit to PENNY SERENADE is having Irene Dunne appearing in 1941 head-dress and costumes in segments not accurate to the actual time-frame of the 1920s and 30s. While Dunne deserved an Academy Award for her sensitive performance, it was Cary Grant who was singled out for that honor as Best Actor. Grant's nomination, no doubt, comes from his moving appeal to the stern judge (Wallis Clark) not to have his child taken away due to his lack of financial support. Who wouldn't be moved by this and Beulah Bondi's excellent support. Another standout is Edgar Buchanan, who should have been nominated in the supporting actor category, especially for one delightful scene where he demonstrates to the adoptive parents how to bathe an infant. Not to disappoint fans of either Dunne or Grant, they do share some moments of comedy, such as their initial meeting, courtship, and their first night after bringing home their adopted baby and what not to do to disturb her sleep.Others in the cast worth noting are Ann Doran (Dotty); Leonard Wiley (Doctor Hartley) and Eve Tee Kuneye as Little Trina, whose upside down smile and echo rendition to Silent Night in a Christmas play certainly makes this worth viewing. It's also the reason why PENNY SERENADE often plays on television during the Christmas season.A public domain title, PENNY SERENADE was certainly one movie easily accessible in the early 1980s during the advent of video cassette rentals and cable television broadcasts. Since then, it's been presented on many cable networks as American Movie Classics, Turner Classic Movies (with restored Columbia Pictures logo inserted prior to closing credits which have been missing for many years), and, in some cases, public television. It's also available on DVD in both black and white and colorized formats.While PENNY SERENADE has an original premise not commonly found in movies up to this time, it's certainly a sentimental journey back to the days when movies captured your heart through the involvement of a young couple going through trials and tribulations in their daily lives, and getting to wonder whether or not they are really meant for each other.

It's also the reason why PENNY SERENADE often plays on television during the Christmas season.A public domain title, PENNY SERENADE was certainly one movie easily accessible in the early 1980s during the advent of video cassette rentals and cable television broadcasts. Since then, it's been presented on many cable networks as American Movie Classics, Turner Classic Movies (with restored Columbia Pictures logo inserted prior to closing credits which have been missing for many years), and, in some cases, public television. It's also available on DVD in both black and white and colorized formats.While PENNY SERENADE has an original premise not commonly found in movies up to this time, it's certainly a sentimental journey back to the days when movies captured your heart through the involvement of a young couple going through trials and tribulations in their daily lives, and getting to wonder whether or not they are really meant for each other.

The beat street cops are often made to look quite foolish while the Tramp (Chaplin) runs around trying to avoid them or keep from being apprehended by them. Edna Purviance is an unwed mother who decides to place her newborn in an abandoned cab, hoping he will be taken to an affluent home. That cab is taken by nefarious crooks, with them eventually realizing that the kid is in the vehicle, abandoning him in an alley! That is when fate would lead penguin-wobbly Tramp to find the kid. Eventually the Tramp and kid would bond and learn to survive together, doing whatever they could to make ends meet (including one hilarious job of repairing windows, with the kid hurling rocks into windows with Tramp just passing through to help for a voluntary fee). Eventually the welfare folks would be told by a misanthropic doc that the kid (Jackie Coogan, just adorable) needed a home better than his current arrangement with the Tramp. The remainder of the film has the Tramp trying to hold onto the kid with difficulty. The heartstrings are certainly intentionally pulled as the Tramp and kid hug after being pulled apart by the welfare officer, doctor, and police officer&#x85;the cop chasing the Tramp who is chasing the truck carrying the kid is a significant scene. The dreamland sequence is a dazzler as the Tramp falls asleep at the doorstep of his locked home (a dump but home just the same), carried away into a dream where he's among angels, and the kid, falling prey to mischief orchestrated by devils (a female angel is lured into seducing the Tramp which leads to her brutish beau and an angel police officer (!) getting involved.

The Olvera Street location, its crumbling neglect quite an assist to the story told by Chaplin, lending a great deal of aesthetic significance to its characters and their existence in less-than-desirable surroundings, is quite vital to the film's power.
