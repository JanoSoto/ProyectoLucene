In specific, to clarify on why I don't like it at all. It's because Steven Spielberg has the skill to make a movie that will really knock you on your ass. These days, an intelligent movie is almost certain to get an R rating, because the character of Tom Cruise is a Philip K. Dick character. This guy wrote stories where almost every time, the main character was tripping out in his own head as a different person, experiencing things and discovering things along the way, and so do we along with him. This trick is briefly explored, but in the end it doesn't matter anyway, because it was decided this film had to be a PG-13 hero saves the day family entertainment type of film, the demographic that Spielberg has catered to all for almost all of his career.The visual style they are trying to use here, which involves extensive use of a blue filter on the lens, really doesn't look pleasing to the eye. In fact, the film is rather ugly to look at, the design is unimaginative. A noir film is filmed at night! When you film at day, and put a blue lens on your camera to make it dark anyway, it doesn't make sense. Has anyone reading this article seen a movie called And God Spoke? It's a fake documentary where two idiot z-level direct to video filmmakers decide to make a film about the bible because it's the biggest best seller of all time, the biggest target audience. During the production, they decide to hire a polish cinematographer who is obsessed with Sven Nykvist. He thinks if he films exactly like Sven Nykvist, who is famous for his creative uses of dark lenses in brilliantly lit scenes, he will be like Sven Nykvist. He idolizes the man. When they film the garden of eden sequence, it's a cheap production, they barely have any lights, but the cameraman has put very dark lenses on the camera to be like Sven Nykvist. The end result is, they can't see anything, it's too murky and dark. He wasted several hundred thousand dollars in re-shoots in overruns. The point is, Minority Report is so boring that's how I was able to think of this connection. Doesn't Spielberg know that history grinds away at hacks?When the plot can be summed up as you used the memory of my dead son to set me up... that is awful writing. I would expect that kind of writing in an Edward Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest.

Obviously, they cannot think for themselves and are spoiled by art-house garbage.  Spielberg has story-telling skill, but rarely does he let the production get in the way.Hook is an unfortunate example of the latter.  It is beautiful to look at, sometimes a little too sugar-coated, and filled with the same moralistic hooey that fills many of his other films.  Close Encounters failed because it tried to make 'family sentimentalism' part of the story.  JAWS succeeded because he used it as a subtext and not a dominant point.  Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List were also loaded with it, the latter being the stronger film.  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade even tried infusing it, but it was totally unnecessary.  I think that was more of George Lucas' fault for trying to mix the same messages of the Star Wars series with the symbolically-dead Jones.Hook's production design is fantastic, surpassing what Disney did with his version of Peter Pan.  You have a politically-correct band of lost boys (no vampires this time) and a typical old white guy as the villain.  This is almost as creative as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Robin Williams is a curious comparison to the world because he spends so much time trying to be funny that his more serious scenes fall flat.  I guess it's just for the easily emotive.By the way, whoever thought that Julia Roberts should be in this movie ought to be shot.  Dustin Hoffman gets a little too far into character as Captain Hook, but I can tell Spielberg was pulling his strings the whole time.Overall, you don't need to see this to understand Spielberg.

After rushing back home to watch it, I was tortured (literally) with an hour of half of bad acting, bad special effects and an extremely confusing plot-line involving a stupid woman who unknowingly opens a gateway to Hell under the house she has just inherited. So far, this sounds like a comedy, but I assure you, you will be laughing for all of the wrong reasons!While I don't exactly tune into a Lucio Fulci film for the 'acting', the work displayed in THE BEYOND is simply phenomenal. The movie starts off in the 1920s with some sort of angry town lynch mob who storm the house (pitchforks and torches in hand!) and bludgeon an artist to death, accusing him of cursing the town. They crucify him to the wall of the basement and throw lye on his face where we get to witness extremely bad scenes of a man throwing a bowl of porridge onto a man's face as it bubbles and melts.Flash forward to the 'current day' where a woman has inherited the house, along with two inept house servants and a lot of bad luck. To start the day off on the wrong foot, a carpenter on scaffolding sees a blind girl through a window and 'falls off' before spitting up gallons of blood in slow-motion. We now meet a Doctor who I guess is supposed to be the 'hero' of the movie who examines the carpenter. He strikes up a friendship with the woman and together, the two begin to explore the mystery and history of the house.Along the way, we have some truly ridiculous scenes and moments that are never fully-explained (and this is the UNCUT version!). For example, as always, Lucio Fulci delivers his gore and the first victim gets his face pulled off and one of his eyeballs popped out of its socket in the basement by a 'zombie hand' that thrusts out of a wall. The dead guy is discovered by the female house servant who also discovers another dead body that has apparently been there for many years.Somehow, both bodies happen to get transported to a hospital in a matter of minutes so we can witness our first laughable mystery. The wife of the man that was killed pays a visit to the morgue. After dressing him up in his funeral suit, she suddenly starts screaming for no reason. We see a shot of a beaker full of acid toppling off a table on the other side of the room, and the next thing you know, the woman happens to be lying flat on her back, directly underneath the acid so we can capture the gratuitous shot of her face 'melting' away beneath it. Uh, right.Next, the daughter comes into the room, only to be scared off by an extremely large volume of 'frothy' blood that edges across the floor, backing her into a room where she is greeted by a zombie.We cut away again to the woman driving down a highway where a blind woman and her dog appears out of nowhere. The blind woman tells her to leave the house immediately. Further confusion ensues when the guy who was killed in the beginning of the movie starts to show up at various different locations to kill off the remainder of the cast. The female house servant gets her head impaled on a nail, where we get to see yet another infamous eyeball popping scene. A man, whose connection with the main characters are never fully explained, goes to the town library to seek out the original construction plans for the house, only to be 'surprised' by a flash of lightning that appears out of nowhere (and for no real reason) that sends him crashing to the floor where he gets parts of his face bitten off by spiders.Some laughable special effects take place in this very scene. The face all of a sudden turns into a 'wax-like' head, and only one of the spiders look real. The ones used in the background all look like one of those cheap plastic ones with pipe-cleaner legs that you once made in kindergarten. One of the spiders 'pull' one of the eyeballs out its socket and another stings the man's tongue. But the biggest bizarre moment does not involve the spiders, but instead we get to see the floor plans of the house 'disappear' like magic ink. What was the purpose of all of that? You're probably thinking that it will be explained at the end of the film. Wrong.Somewhere in the middle of all of this, the male house servant is killed (although I don't recall this ever happening). He appears in a strange seance appearance involving all the dead cast members to date where they surround the blind girl who gets her throat and ear ripped off by her pooch! Ouch! Another unintentionally funny scene shows the woman who got her face 'melted' off by the jar of acid. The make-up effects are hideous. She has enough red and blue make-up on her face to resemble that of a baboon.More confusion ensues when the town suddenly 'empties' of all of its residents so that the woman and the Doctor are both running around with no one else in sight. They take refuge in the hospital (where else would there be any more freshly dead bodies?) where they encounter slow-moving zombies that the Doctor must insist on shooting a hundred times in the stomach. Even after he successfully slays a few by shooting them in the head, he still proceeds to cluelessly shoot them in the stomach. And all of these endless bullets are coming out of a six-chamber barrel that he never refills! LOL!There is of course, one surviving man who is hiding in one of the rooms. He is only there to show us why the Doctor would shoot at a glass door for no reason so a mysterious gust of wind would blow shards of glass into the room and pierce a 'wax-like' head, killing the man instantly.With a mob of zombies (actually, upon closer examination, it looks like it's the same group of six zombies who reappear continuously to make it look like that there are 'legions' of them) shuffling after the Doctor and the woman, they run down a stairwell and find themselves back in the basement of the house. Making their way through a hole in the wall, they find themselves wandering Hell for eternity. If you ever thought Hell would look like a dark wasteland with five bodies lying around, then you'll be pleased with this ending.So all of the missing plot points that you thought would be finally answered in a clever finale, are never explained. We never find out why the woman could see the blind girl and where she lived, but the Doctor couldn't. We never find out how the creepy male house servant dies, or why he and the female servant 'came with the house'. We never find out why the missing floor plans 'disappeared' and for what reasons. That and many other unanswered plot holes left me feeling very angry for wasting my time, hope and money. The gore was laughable if anything and there wasn't one scene that made me 'jump', even if it was the old scare tactic involving a hand on a shoulder during a tense moment. There was only one good scene and that was when the little girl got her head blown off. But other than that, this movie was very disappointing.My Rating - 2 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2003","score":"15 out of 26 people found the following review useful","review":"  For years, I had heard so many good things about Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND that I was simply ecstatic and overjoyed when I found an uncut copy on DVD during a recent visit to NYC.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"18 August 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Can you imagine being able to talk to a dead loved one? What would you say, how would you react? And what if you knew how, when and where they died, and could warn them of their forecoming doom?The questions are answered in Gregory Hoblit's Frequency, in which a young man speaks to his father thirty years into the past. The story starts with Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a veteran firefighter who dies in a factory fire in October, 1969. Exactly thirty years later, in 1999, his thirty-six-year-old son John (Jim Caviezel) has become a police officer, breaking a tradition of all firefighters on his father's side.One night as John is rummaging through a compartment under his stairs (he occupies the same house he grew up in), he comes across his dad's old ham radio. Out of morbid curiosity he sets it up and, eventually, manages to make it work. He clicks it on and a static voice comes across on the other end, asking John to identify himself. In the minutes that pass, John realizes he is speaking to his father on the exact same night, thirty years earlier (or thirty years later, depending on whose perspective you are taking into account).The excuse for this wonderous ability of time communication is really quite nonsense - it has to do with a solar frequency in outer space that happens to be encompassing the sky in both 1969 and 1999 - but we instantly connect with the plot. The characters seem real enough, and sometimes that is all that counts. Recalling the plot of this film on my computer makes it seem just a bit more hokey than it was when you watch it. And that's probably the sign of a good director - one who can make skeptical audiences actually believe his ludicrous plot.Through talking to his father, John is able to warn him of his death. Frank does avoid dying, but this sets off a chain event. By not dying, Frank's wife, and John's mother, who is a nurse in 1969 and 1999, was never told of her husband's death in 1969 (because he didn't die in this alternate timeline.) Therefore she never left the hospital that October night to grieve over her husband's death, and because of this, a serial killer known as the Nightingale Strangler (or something like that) ends up killing John's mother on her routine way home from the hospital, along with six other victims who were not killed in the original 1999. But in the current 1999, John now has all the case files of the murders, since he is a cop and has access to them, and that means he knows when and where the Nightingale Strangler will attack. So 1969 Frank starts a case of detective, scoping out the joints on the night the killer murders his victims. Frank manages to grab some fingerprints of the anonymous killer, and in a very inventive plot twist, sticks the fingerprint evidence in a bag, hides it in his house, and tells John where he hid it. John goes looking in the 1999 house, and finds the evidence, right where Frank left it hidden in 1969.A lot of the timeline theories in Frequency don't hold up. The movie reminds me of Back to the Future quite a bit, except the latter's plot makes theoretical sense and the former's does not. Take, for example, a scene where Frank, in the past, carves the words I'M STILL HERE, CHIEF into a table with a motor mechanism. John, in 1999, sees the words being carved as it happens in the past. Smoke comes out of the table as it happens and everything. But in reality, Frank would have done it thirty years ago, meaning that the table would have the words carved into it long before John sees them being carved invisibly. It's like in BttF Part II - when Biff gets his hands on that sports almanac, everything in the future suddenly changes. It doesn't start happening as Biff does it in real time. Confused? Me too.Also, when Frank survives his destined death because of John's warning words, John suddenly gets new memories. Since his father never died, he now gets all these memories of them together after his (Frank's) death from the original 1969. He says to Frank later that night that now he has two streams of memories - those of Frank's death and afterwards, and those of Frank living and afterwards. But somehow, everyone else does not remember Frank's death - only John. Why? Simple There wouldn't be an interesting film without it.Frequency has almost as much thought put into its time changing as BttF, but lacks the hard conviction that the Future movies had. They made sense, had little plot holes - or at least plot holes that could be analyzed. Frequency has a lot of plot holes that simply cannot be analyzed. They're just there.But this movie has some major highlights. A battle between a serial killer in 1969 and 1999 is visually and psychologically thrilling, and very ironic in execution; moments like the fingerprint evidence being hidden, though a bit shallow, are fun - and the characters and actors are superb. This might not be as deep as Back to the Future, but I found myself lost in this film, never checking my watch for its one hour fifty minute + running time.

What would you say, how would you react? And what if you knew how, when and where they died, and could warn them of their forecoming doom?The questions are answered in Gregory Hoblit's Frequency, in which a young man speaks to his father thirty years into the past. The story starts with Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), a veteran firefighter who dies in a factory fire in October, 1969. Exactly thirty years later, in 1999, his thirty-six-year-old son John (Jim Caviezel) has become a police officer, breaking a tradition of all firefighters on his father's side.One night as John is rummaging through a compartment under his stairs (he occupies the same house he grew up in), he comes across his dad's old ham radio. Out of morbid curiosity he sets it up and, eventually, manages to make it work. He clicks it on and a static voice comes across on the other end, asking John to identify himself. In the minutes that pass, John realizes he is speaking to his father on the exact same night, thirty years earlier (or thirty years later, depending on whose perspective you are taking into account).The excuse for this wonderous ability of time communication is really quite nonsense - it has to do with a solar frequency in outer space that happens to be encompassing the sky in both 1969 and 1999 - but we instantly connect with the plot. The characters seem real enough, and sometimes that is all that counts. Recalling the plot of this film on my computer makes it seem just a bit more hokey than it was when you watch it. And that's probably the sign of a good director - one who can make skeptical audiences actually believe his ludicrous plot.Through talking to his father, John is able to warn him of his death. Frank does avoid dying, but this sets off a chain event. By not dying, Frank's wife, and John's mother, who is a nurse in 1969 and 1999, was never told of her husband's death in 1969 (because he didn't die in this alternate timeline.) Therefore she never left the hospital that October night to grieve over her husband's death, and because of this, a serial killer known as the Nightingale Strangler (or something like that) ends up killing John's mother on her routine way home from the hospital, along with six other victims who were not killed in the original 1999. But in the current 1999, John now has all the case files of the murders, since he is a cop and has access to them, and that means he knows when and where the Nightingale Strangler will attack. So 1969 Frank starts a case of detective, scoping out the joints on the night the killer murders his victims. Frank manages to grab some fingerprints of the anonymous killer, and in a very inventive plot twist, sticks the fingerprint evidence in a bag, hides it in his house, and tells John where he hid it. John goes looking in the 1999 house, and finds the evidence, right where Frank left it hidden in 1969.A lot of the timeline theories in Frequency don't hold up.

I watched part 2 after seeing Freddy vs. Jason at the theater last night, so I was in a jazzed up, Freddy kind of mood. So what did I think?This movie suffers the indignity of being considered the worst in the series. Personally, I enjoyed it somewhat. I thought it was entertaining in a hokey, 80's slasher flick kind of way. The curious thing about this movie was the amount of barely concealed homoeroticism. There's a bunch of scenes in this that just scream sexual tension and it's usually between two guys. My favorite scene was when the coach got his in the shower. For some reason, they felt it necessary to make this guy a leather bar frequenting sadist with a penchant for making his students drop down and assume the position. This leads to a couple of scenes of sweaty teenage boys working their bodies to the limit, while the coach gets his jollies by ogling them. Anyway, this coach gets dragged into the showers and has his clothes ripped off by an unseen force, while being tied to the shower heads by jump ropes. Then, the comedic part of the scene commences with the coach's butt getting whipped by towels hard enough to draw blood. I swear to God, I was laughing so hard my eyes hurt afterwards. Then Freddy materializes out of the steam and does his thing with the razor claws. The movie is pretty goofy like that, especially in another inspired scene between the main character and his family going up against a psychotic parakeet. At this point in the series, Freddy hadn't become the joke-spouting machine that began to emerge in part 3 and beyond, so he still retained some of the spookiness that he gained in the first one. If you liked the Freddy from the first movie, then odds are you'll like him here also. The hero of the story was kind of wimpy and it didn't help matters much that the dude screamed like Jamie Lee Curtis in a Carpenter flick. Also, watching this guy dance to really bad 80's music was pretty painful. I'm sure that he can't watch this film without lowering his head in shame. Well, to close things off, the movie isn't as good as the original (of course) but I think it has received an unfairly bad rap. Some of it is still spooky and at the very least, you're sure to laugh your head off at least a good four or five times.

Well, firstly and I have to say, very importantly, it's taken from the finest piece of modern literature I've read.  Umberto Eco's novel has such mammoth scope of subject matter and detail, it is was always going to be extremely hard to put into film (Dune anyone??), and Annaud certainly doesn't succeed in every way, but my lord he gives it a damn good go. The film quite rightly focusses on the human story within the book of a group of murders committed at an Italian abbey in the 14th Century, and the ongoing search for the purpetrator, by a Franciscan monk and his apprentice. The book encompasses many other issues and plotlines, which could not be fitted into the film. The three screenwriters do an excellent job, of filming the almost impossible to within 2 hours or so. Most importantly to me, the cinematography and set are sublime, almost unsurpassed in modern film to my mind, and still to this day amazing. I've always found that many non movie-lovers remember this film, for good or bad.  The main reason for me is that it recreates so impressively the period it represents. Tonino Delli Colli, I salute you. The production team deserves a similar merit for bringing together what was in essence an European co-production, whilst not forgetting the biggest exterior set built in Europe since Cleopatra. Step forward Dante Ferreti. I salute you too. 0.1 of a mark off for the editing, but let's not dwell on that.

One day he meets a broker who might have an in for him at his mysterious brokerage house situated quite some way from Wall Street.This piece is so clearly inspired by the film Wall Street that the film makers even throw in a scene of them actually watching the movie, almost as if they want to put their hands up! They also mention Glengarry Glen Ross, another film the makers clearly want to ape. Nothing wrong with learning from great films, but this only makes this one look more like a TV movie version of the above.From the opening shots of Davis (Ribisi) in his home made casino the movie has an air of no good will come of this. I don't think it is too much of a spoiler to say expectations are realised.

Then we see the (obviously not dead) killer attack Quaid and his family...Quaid then blows his hand off with a shotgun.Ok plausible so far.Then we see Quaid in 1999 shoot the killer dead....WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!Follow me here...the killer was a cop and there was indisputable evidence that it was him.

The purpose of this film was to bring back the Jason character from his one year hiatus with a new flair. He was to be an undead zombie (an attempt at advancing his scare factor) that could no longer be killed conventionally (not that he ever could, but still). He would be stronger and he would no longer need weapons to kill his prey. Many a death in this movie are the labor of bare hands. And, for the first time, Jason wouldn't be hiding out or lurking in the shadows. Jason is shown in more shots from above the waist than he ever had been. The filmmakers didn't save full shots of him until the end of the movie like the other Friday's had done. Jason is very much a full character in this movie, rather than the usual stalker in the dark that is only shown as a pair of legs or a hand with a weapon. This is a trend that would be followed in every Friday film after this one.This is the first Friday film to play to the fans. It becomes obvious in the early stages of the film, that the goal isn't to scare the viewer as much as it is to impress them with Jason's new found strength and weapon arsenal. This is also a trend that later Friday's would follow. Basically, this movie reinvents the series. The character of Jason is now a vehicle to get from one death to the next, and the audience spends more time following his tail lights than we have before. In my personal opinion, this is not a bad change.This movie still offers up some good scares, although a seasoned horror film watcher won't really catch them. One of my favorite scenes has a stranded Tommy Jarvis (the hero) calling from a boat floating in the lake to Jason on shore. Jason is within seconds of killing Tommy's love interest, but drops the task in favor of pursuing the hopeless Tommy. Jason marches into the lake and soon becomes hidden by the deepening water line. Tommy now knows that Jason is underneath him, and could pop out at any moment.Really people, this movie isn't that bad. If you care enough to search the site for this movie, than it is only fair that you get treated to at least one good review. And for Kane Hodder Fans, C.J. Graham did a good job too don't you think?

However, while it does have some serious faults, TMWTGG is in fact quite a reasonable OO7 adventure, and does not deserve the bad press it gets.Among the positives is one of the more interesting plot lines of a Bond film, as OO7 engages in a personal duel with his alter-ego Scaramanga, a fearless assassin who has sworn to take our hero's life. Scaramanga is played with real charisma and presence by Christopher Lee, that master of villainous acting, who is in fact a cousin of Ian Fleming's. Lee was slated to play Dr No before the part was given to Joseph Wiseman, and having waited another 12 years before finally becoming a Bond villain he makes the most of the opportunity.  Roger Moore, in his second appearance as Bond, tries to bring out the tougher side of the character, and in one scene he even strikes a woman. Moore is nowhere near as convincing a tough-guy actor as Sean Connery, and in most of his films he avoided portraying OO7's darker side, but it is refreshing that he at least gives it a go here, making TMWTGG a bit grittier than many Moore-era Bonds.Another good thing about the film is Nick Nack, Scaramanga's tiny henchman. Herve Villechaize plays him with the right mix of impishness and menace, and he provides Bond with a pleasingly different challenge to the giant, silent henchmen found elsewhere in the series. As for locations, director Guy Hamilton (in his last Bond film) provides many excellent shots of the Far Eastern settings, and Scaramanga's luxury island hideaway is gorgeous to look at; I also like the deadly maze Scaramanga uses to trap and kill his enemies, a novel feature of the film which I think works quite well.On the downside, there is once again far too much wacky humour. Unbelievably, the wretched JW Pepper was brought back for another round of feeble redneck comedy, this time as a tourist in Thailand, and there is one particularly stupid scene where two young girls karate-chop their way through an entire martial arts schoool. There are also deficiencies in the Bond girl department, with Britt Ekland's stupid and bungling Mary Goodnight not only being a sexist caricature, but also unbelievably irritating to boot. She is one of the very worst Bond girls, and things would have been much better if Maud Adams had taken the Goodnight role. As Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, she is demure, impressive, and far more sympathetic than Ekland; she certainly deserved to come back for another bite of the Bond cherry, and would eventually do so in Octopussy.  As for other faults, the film goes on too long (although the final showdown on Scaramanga's island is quite well done), and in Lulu's awful title song it has the worst Bond theme of the entire series-or at least it did, until Madonna came along. The silly whistle during the otherwise excellent car stunt is another black mark against the film.Overall, however, I think TMWTGG probably ranks as the second-best Bond of the 70s, after The Spy Who Loved Me.  It is not a very inspired film, but for all its flaws it provides some decent entertainment, and is a solid, diverting entry in the series.

Goodfellas is the story of real-time mobster Henry Hill and his mafia career, which in the end, doesn't turn out as he suspected it would. As a young teenager, Henry begins working for Paul Cicero who is the head man in charge of the operations. As you watch this film, you will notice that Paulie has one of those serious, funny sides to him. It is almost like a serious paranoia case, similar to Tony Soprano, which I find somewhat humourous.This film is also based on real-time mobster Jimmy Burke, who is portrayed in the film as Jimmy Conway.(But whole plot mainly focuses on Hill) Working alongside Henry and Jimmy, there is also Tommy Devito, who Joe Pesci played brilliantly, and was well deserving of the Oscar that he won for best supporting role. I found Pesci to be hilarious in the movie, especially with the two restaurant scenes. His character simply stole the show, and is portrayed as a classic hot-headed bad guy.(loved him impersonating the Oklahoma Kid)And then you have De Niro who is his usual self, as one of the greatest actors of our time. De Niro shows great emotion in the dramatic telephone scene outside of the restaurant, which is Oscar worthy. I found Conway to be the most responsible out of the three, due to more experience in the business, and a great natural instinct of leadership, which is clearly shown and told, as he was doing hits for mob bosses at the age of 16.I found that Liotta was excellent as well, playing a crazy and violent Henry Hill, with those cold and icy eyes that can look right through you. The immediate thing that I picked up on, and found funny about Liotta's part, was his psychotic laugh. My favourite Liotta laugh moments are in the restaurant scene with Tommy, and when Jimmy is choking Morrie with the telephone cord, and Morrie's wig falls off. A great supporting actress in the film, who I found rather charismatic, was Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry's wife Karen. I found that Lorraine's character took a huge transformation in the film when she first married Henry, most likely due to the mob which is commonly portrayed as destroying marriages.Overall, this was a great all-star cast with excellent appeal to the audience, and to the genre of gangster films. The film was great, but the ending leaves somewhat of an empty feeling, with no exciting conclusion. But after all it was realistic, and it was based on a true story, which leaves me satisfied. Also loved the choice of music for the scenes, and the Eric Clapton theme. 8.5\/10. Best mob movie since the Godfather II.

I didn't like it much, but I think that's because I'm a man. Women I know who have seen this movie liked it a little more that I did (my mom, for example). On the other hand, I also know women who didn't like this film. Now I'll talk about the film itself.Ellen Burstyn stars as Vivi Walker, mother of magazine article writer Sidda Walker (Sandra Bullock). Sidda writes an article how she didn't like her childhood and blames her mother. Vivi reads the article, and refuses to speak to her daughter. Vivi's three friends Teensy (Fionnula Flanagan), Necie (Shirley Knight), and Caro (Maggie Smith) notice that she isn't acting like herself and when they found out what happened, they beg Sidda to come down and make peace with her mother. Upon her arrival, the three friends reveal to Sidda about the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, a life long band formed by the three friends and Vivi when they were children. They promised that they would be blood sisters or something like that, I don't remember very well. Along with this story, we flash back to Sidda when she was a child and see her relationship with her mother (played in these scenes by Ashley Judd). James Garner costars as Vivi's husband, but he's a very small part of the movie.I liked some of the acting, particularly Maggie Smith and Sandra Bullock, and the film tells a story worth telling, but some problems drag it down. First, during the flashback scenes, I noticed that Sidda had a few brothers and sisters. However, in the present scenes, they're no where to be found. I admit that the movie is mainly about the relationship of Vivi and Sidda, but considering what happens in the flashback scenes (which I won't reveal), It would have been more plausible if we found out about the siblings now that they've grown up. Also, for me, the movie went on too long. The film is two hours long, but it feels more like it's four hours. Lastly, I thought that the Ellen Burstyn character was kind of a disappointment. Burstyn was much better and more convincing in Requiem For A Dream (2000), which she got a Best Actress nomination for.So, I didn't hate this movie, but it didn't work for me. I think I didn't like it because I'm a man. I have nothing against chick flicks. I think that some overcome the only women will enjoy it thinking such as Emma (1996), Kate And Leopold (2001), The Evening Star (1996), and arguably the best example, Gone With The Wind (1939). Ya-Ya doesn't cross that line. I know that women will enjoy it much more than men. I'm thinking some men would compare viewing this movie to medieval torture.

I wanted to see that.Man You can see that one by yourself, I'm not going to see it.I at least was willing to see this film.

And to think that this film was made almost 30 years ago, and I was affected by it as if I saw it the year it was released, says a lot about the quality of this film....especially one of its genre.  I was actually compelled to see this when I went to see Freddy vs. Jason last night and saw the preview for the remake of TCM, which I have NO INTEREST in seeing and I feel is\/will be a disgrace to this original classic.  Don't get fooled by the title of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is a classic horror film in every sense of the word, and ranks up with The Exorcist and The Shining as the best horror films I've ever seen.  Truly disturbing, shocking, gritty filmmaking at its best.  **** out of **** stars.

The country was in turmoil over his fully exposed scandals etc. There really wasnt much to be proud of, so here Hollywood comes out with a feel-good-about-your-president movie, where the president single-handedly takes out a very cliche'd russian terrorist squad, and saves the day.This all would be ok, if the movie didnt take itself so seriously. But as such it just leaves one rolling his eyes.Also I would like to say Harrison Ford seems to take himself too seriously nowadays. I thought he did his best work in Indiana Jones, where he was enjoyable to watch. In AF1 he is so serious it is almost unbearable.
