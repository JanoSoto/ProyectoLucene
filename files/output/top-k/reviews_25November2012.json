[{"date":"25 November 2012","score":"","review":" Outside Providence is a real feel good movie. It's starts out and you think it's going to be a stoner movie, or maybe a kid rise out of a broken family movie, you even hate the father immediately. Alec Baldwin is over acting that role, but at some point... you're saying to yourself It's just right. It is a caricature, but a sensible one.The evolution of the main character is truly believable, and you're given all the right milestones to his progression. The rescue he conjure up is even realistic.The acting is good, even if the stoners are overdone, especially the main one. The editing is invisible, the soundtrack well incorporated, the story interesting, the dialogues solid, and the romance very sweet.See it, and you'll have a good evening.

Aspects of this film are similar to episodes of the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Ultimately this is more about people loosing their humanity under extreme pressure than about the futuristic and Kafkaesque trap itself. The opening sequence is truly horrific. The cube itself is well realised and one really wants to know what's outside, where the cube physically is located (it must be vast in size) and who built it and why. None of these questions (naturally!) are answered during the course of the film and this only adds to the intrigue.
