Michael Mann is probably best known for his film Heat. And it's not hard to see why. It is a grand epic in the cops and robbers genre that pits two of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) in the history of cinema against each other (and delivers their first on-screen appearance together in a classic scene...probably one of the best ever). It also has, possibly, the best and most intricately orchestrated shoot-out ever committed to film. Actually, to call it a shoot-out trivializes the beauty of it. It is an all-out gun battle. And yet, in my opinion, Heat is not Mann's best film. His best film came three years earlier. It is The Last Of The Mohicans, and is, I would contend, Mann's masterpiece. It is one of the best films I've ever seen, and is certainly in my top five of all time. It's difficult to try and even remotely convey just how close to perfect this movie is. First there is the acting. Every performance by every major player is utterly convincing. Especially from Daniel Day Lewis. I think this may be his best performance ever, and yet he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it. In fact this movie was virtually ignored (save for the Sound) by the Academy. One of the most epic movies ever made, and the Academy only recognized it for its Sound (which was very good by the way). Almost criminal. This is a movie mind you, that is virtually impossible to nail down as far as genre is concerned. It literally has almost every element that one could think of. It's a powerful drama, and a beautiful love story. It's action-packed (and quite violent), and yet has much historical significance. It's one of the most beautifully filmed pieces of cinema I've ever laid my eyes on (North Carolina in its most glorious splendor), and the story is obviously strong. I remember the first time I ever saw The Last Of The Mohicans. I expected very little of it to be quite honest. Some good action and hopefully some great battle scenes. Well it delivered on that front. But it delivered in droves in so many other ways. Seldom have I ever underestimated a film as grossly as I did Mohicans. And seldom have I seen a film so grand.

Like his previous film Spellbound, Notorious starts slow not in the manner that we're thrown in the middle of an experience and it takes us time to orient, more in the manner that a part of the film must be specifically set apart so the two leading actors can fall in love. I dislike how 'falling in love' in a Hitchcock film is something that must happen in its own time, before the movie can begin. This one does something amazing with the struggle of the two lovers to fall out of it, or verify to themselves that they're not, that they're still acting parts in a game. The doubletalk between Grant and Bergman is some of the best of the decade, I love how they're talking trivialities like what to eat for dinner with manners of passion.The best part of Notorious happens under guises, by people playing roles, hiding deceit or love under social etiquette, and I only have the times to blame that so much of the film's plot doesn't recognize its own redundancy in all this. The ballroom sequence, Grant and Bergman conspiring to snoop down the basement to break into the mysterious wine cellar, rings bells in my head that say social interaction is the best adult game, except the stakes are real. But then, as usual for him, Hitchcock hinges so much of his film's effectiveness on things making sense a certain recognizable way, so that Bergman's idea of snooping into the wine cellar using a stolen key the day of the ballroom threatens to send the movie off under that annoying she wouldn't do it that way spotlight.I remember reading a review on North by Northwest that said everything for Hitchcock takes place in a selfcontained 'movie world'. As far as his pulp fiction is concerned I agree, it's paperback style yet done without the selfaware distance of later directors like Melville. But the relationship between Grant and Bergman or the struggle for one given the circumstances is very interesting to me. It speaks not about the things that can happen in a movie but the things that do happen in life. Not saying you love someone because words are trivial, the other knowing that but wanting to hear the words anyway. Playing jealous to make light of a situation then becoming it, the other sensing the jealousy but not being able to fight it back. The final scene, how again it hinges on etiquette, behaviour judged as normal or not by thirds, is amazing, except for the fact that Grant has to run his mouth saying things we all understand as do the characters. I'd love to see that scene, those dynamics, play out in chilling silence.

In Gabriel's eyes humans are no more than talking monkeys, and he detests us for how we are apparently viewed by God, feeling that angels have somehow received a bad rap.(Gabriel ends up coming into contact with almost every other main character and Walken seems to relish the chance to ham it up, after all no-one can say exactly how an angel should act can they? He spits out lines casually but is always menacing, and in fact some of his throwaway responses are actually hilarious.) Expanding on the simple premise above would result in much complication, none of which is necessary here, but know first that The Prophecy intertwines an intricately crafted backstory into what many believe, and does it very well.

Unless it is movie magic, so let's just agree that it was movie magic and move on you say? Done. You'll never guess who is called in to investigate the crime scene Thomas, that's who. Another digression You know it is a niche market when the force employs an angel specialist. You think he had many cases? Unless the TV show Touched by an Angel was far more literal a title than we thought all these years.Back to the crime scene. Thomas is a little surprised to find the victim lost his eyes, and not in the crash, he never had them. Also the hotel room has been trashed and when dusted for prints not one is uncovered, but Thomas's book on Angels is.Curioser and curioser.We cut to a remote school with a small group of students, Catherine (Virginia Madsen) seems to be the only teacher of the one class covering all ages and grades. Simon is now hiding out in a run down and unused part of the buildings.This town is where the bulk of the rest of the story takes place. To fast track matters Simon is now holding onto something that is much sought after by his yet unnamed rivals, and they want it. Bad.As every good film requires conflict we immediately get to meet the other interested party, his name is Gabriel and he was once the right hand man to God himself.Gabriel desperately wants what Simon holds, as he feels it will tip the balance in an Angelic war that has been waged for countless years in his favour. In Gabriel's eyes humans are no more than talking monkeys, and he detests us for how we are apparently viewed by God, feeling that angels have somehow received a bad rap.(Gabriel ends up coming into contact with almost every other main character and Walken seems to relish the chance to ham it up, after all no-one can say exactly how an angel should act can they? He spits out lines casually but is always menacing, and in fact some of his throwaway responses are actually hilarious.) Expanding on the simple premise above would result in much complication, none of which is necessary here, but know first that The Prophecy intertwines an intricately crafted backstory into what many believe, and does it very well. There are some great standalone scenes, minimum BOO! scares a powerful ending.Whether you believe in this stuff or not probably will have a bearing on what you think of the film. If you are already a believer the odds are that you will hate this or at least just take it as a fantasy story, I can't see why this would create anger in the religious community.If, like me you think this is all a work of fiction then you may find a lot to like here. Again I am an absolute sucker for theological elements in film so I lapped this up. I thought everyone in was effective, most notably Christopher Walken as a perfectly pasty and dare I say it otherworldly Gabriel, and Viggo Mortensen stole the finale with a bit part that veered close to parody but ended up suiting the tone of the film.The only negative I can throw at The Prophecy is that Gabriel and his undead lackeys were used to attempt to add some levity, only it felt quite out of place at times. Gabriel is perfectly amusing with most of his dialogue without forcing the issue with cartoony stuff.Final Rating - 9 \/ 10. One of my personal favourites. I just wish they didn't make 4 unnecessary sequels.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com ","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"19 November 2010","score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" Of all Disney's failures, none are quite so infamous as The Black Cauldron.

Well the studio made the disastrous choice of handing off sections of the film to individual teams without giving them any interaction between each other, leading to some odd continuity and a total lack of a compelling throughline. Secondly, ambitions for a darker film were rather bipolar, leading to some odd inclusions like graphic gore and partial nudity and unfortunate omissions like a number of fascinating Tim Burton designs which were jettisoned for being too twisted. It doesn't help that the animation looks floaty and bland, some of the weakest in any Disney film up to then, and that heavy cuts under Michael Eisner removed said gore and nudity, only adding to the disconnected nature of this film. They made a few interesting choices, like reviving multi-planing (a very good idea) and using widescreen for the first time since Sleeping Beauty, but these don't make up for all the other blunders made by this film.The story is quite typical of Tolkien-inspired fantasy. An evil Sauron figure has returned to seek a magical item that will restore his power and send his armies across the land to conquer everything in existence. That item is a pig. I know, John Huston says he's seeking a cauldron, but he's actually trying to steal a magic pig from this film's Frodo Baggins, Taran, in order to find it. The one pig to rule them all. I'm not sure if that was in the book, and it's probably handled better in the book, but that's just a goofy sounding concept. Of course, our hero Taran, who's such a wimp that he's easily dispatched by the local goat (I know, that's what character development's for, right? right) loses the pig and has to go rescue him from the Horned King (who looks suspiciously like a demon from Night on Bald Mountain). Taran rescues the pig, but gets himself captured. With the help of a few fellow prisoners and a magic sword, he escapes, and it then becomes a quest to seek the Cauldron before the Horned King finds it.As animation, this is even more of a dark pit than The Fox and the Hound, which had a few real standout moments. There are no moments of excellence here, just floaty, weightless motion and an over-reliance on reaction shots that just looks awkward. Characters are thrown off-model in strange ways, and very little of the performances ring true. The backgrounds do have a nice atmosphere to them, but are also pretty smudgy. Design wise, very little stands out here, and I can't help but wish they'd incorporated things like Tim Burton's idea for flying hand monsters (not ripping off J.R. Tolkien enough?). The color design looks hollow and lacks any sort of warmth or emotion, as if drab colors were what was hip in the eighties (not that I blame them for thinking such). Lamentably, the best animation is Hendel Butoy and Andreas Deja's for Gurgie, a hapless character that they nevertheless lend some much needed life to. Otherwise, I can only point to The Secret of NIMH, made for less than half the money, and sigh at how the biggest animation studio in the world could have made a film that looked one-tenth as good.

No matter what anyone might say about any of his films, his reputation is unimpeachable. Even his misfires have terrific scenes. Casino isn't a misfire - far from it - but only manages to be a good film weighed down by the ponderous style and overly didactic expressionism that is Scorcese at his worst.Goodfellas was a Scorcese classic. This isn't Goodfellas, but it sure feels like a mediocre extension of it. For what it is, Casino is enjoyable. Unfortunately, one of the hurdles that lesser Scorcese films face is that they bring to mind his better work. This is especially a problem when one of his films uses similar themes and even actors from his classics. Here, we have Joe Pesci from Goodfellas doing his angry mobster shtick again, and Deniro also reprising his standard wise-guy turn. Further, we have crude hoodlums increasingly turning on each other, having mundane personal problems that cross over into their work, and exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior after starting out seemingly in complete control. Sound familiar? Well, it probably does if you've seen Goodfellas or many other, better Scorcese films.Robert Deniro, who at times is brilliant and at times seems to be suppressing a smirk in his love scenes, overall is fine as a middle-level mob boss who mistakenly begins to believe he is the top dog. So, we have the age-old theme of the inevitable mistake of taking your actual bosses for granted. Throw in Joe Pesci as his old friend who reaches the same conclusion about himself, and watch events unfold. Anyone who's seen mob films stretching at least back to The Godfather Part II on down the line has to see this train racing down the tracks. No real surprises, standard decline-and-fall stuff relieved by the usual Scorcese flourishes which, alas, went over much better elsewhere.Sharon Stone is the empty center of this film, despite the fact that it supposedly is about Deniro's character. As the antagonist out to smash Deniro's controlled world, she is set up as the biggest thing in Vegas. She has to be for her character to work. Unfortunately, but none of that comes across, at least it didn't to me. Not enough time was spent on her character to show why at first she was so popular (which is odd, considering how long this film goes on), so her inevitable decline doesn't strike the emotional chord it should. Reviewers like to say she deserved the Academy Award, but I don't see it. She does get numerous histrionic moments, but then leaves huge gaps in her devolution. Her character lacks continuity. Stone gives two performances, one as a reluctant bride (why?), and then one as an increasingly unhappy wife (again, why?). Admittedly, she does a good job of acting, but it all seems forced and like, well, acting. Her character didn't grab me.The single most annoying aspect of this film is a self-indulgent Scorcese trademark that reached its nadir here and in Gangs of New York. You may find it charming, or helpful, or entertaining, but to me it is downright distracting and needless. That is a banal historical (this is semi-fictional in the worst way) explanation and constant narration by the Deniro and Pesci characters which continues right to the end. A little of that works, but it gets way out of hand. The characters repetitiously explain things that don't need to be explained. For example, the narrator will say, And then she hit bottom and blew her money on drugs and pimps, and we see Stone stumbling down a hallway, doing her mighty best to show herself hitting bottom. And when they found her body.... and she immediately falls down in the hallway, right on cue. Nice acting, Sharon! The technique is patronizing. It is as if Scorcese is directing the film toward people who are complete blank slates, and know nothing about people, or history, or motivations. But, in reality, the audience is not stupid. It can be trusted to draw the appropriate conclusions, given a story rather than a monologue with accompanying moving pictures. I think Scorcese forgets himself sometimes. I think most viewers would find thinking things through themselves more enjoyable.In other words, skip the quasi-documentary stuff, and this would be a far superior film.Despite my major quibbles, I enjoyed the film because it does transport you to another time and place, Vegas in the early '70s, before, as Deniro the narrator so unnecessarily (but characteristically) explains, It became Disneyland. The fashions (Deniro sporting a gold lamé suit is a riot) alone are worth the time. Just try not to compare this film to true classics.

Just look at the superb, solid casting, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham.Good script by Jim and John Thomas (Hard Time on Planet Earth 1989, Mission To Mars 2000) coupled with good special effects by Stan Winston and visual effects by R. Greenberg. Plot Dutch is conned by his ex team-mate Dillon into a rescue operation in a Central American jungle. They land by helicopter and soon finds the bodies of General Hopper and his men who have been skinned alive.They then discover the rebel base camp where Dutch sees a prisoner being shot though the head. And so extreme measures are taken and the rebels are exterminated. They find no hostages and Dutch realizes he's been fooled by Dillon and he immediately pins Dillon to the wall and demands to know why he's been used in this manner, since he and his team are a rescue team and not mercenaries.

Or rather with one particular sci-fi epic, the original Star Wars trilogy.As one might expect from Brooks's films, the plot is little more than an excuse for a series of in-jokes. The beautiful Princess Vespa from planet Druidia is kidnapped by the forces of the evil President Skroob, leader of planet Spaceball in order to forcer her father, King Roland, to hand over Druidia's air supply. The distraught Roland offers a reward of a million space bucks for her safe return, and the offer is eagerly accepted by adventurer Captain Lone Starr and his sidekick, Barf. (I assumed this name was derived from the Cockney pronunciation of bath, but apparently it is American slang for to vomit).Although there are occasional references to other sci-fi franchises, such as Planet of the Apes, Star Trek and Alien (John Hurt makes a brief cameo appearance to send up his role in that last film), the plot and most of the characters parody those in the Star Wars series; King Roland is one of the few characters without a direct equivalent in that franchise. Princess Vespa parallels Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, Skroob (an anagram of Brooks) is the Emperor Palpitine and Lone Starr is an amalgam of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. Barf, a hairy, half-man, half-dog creature called a mawg, is the Spaceballs version of Chewbacca from Star Wars.Some of the jokes do not really work. The adjective to describe an inhabitant of Druidia is not (as one might expect) Druidian, but Druish, an adjective coined with the sole purpose of allowing Brooks to make a series of laboured Jewish\/Druish puns. The Force, the mysterious energy which pervades the Star Wars universe, here becomes the Schwartz, for no known reason except perhaps as a piece of product placement on behalf of the well-known manufacturer of herbs and spices.Nevertheless, the film as a whole tends to works. Brooks has chosen his target well, although perhaps by 1987, ten years after the original film, the idea of a Star Wars parody was starting to look a bit dated. The original Star Wars is a reasonably good sci-fi adventure flick, but its main defect is its tendency to take itself too seriously. (And its legions of devotees take it even more seriously than it takes itself- there are large numbers of people who claim, not all of them in jest, to be followers of the Jedi religion).Brooks's wit homes in on the portentousness and pretentiousness of George Lucas's films, cutting them down to size. Thus the menacing Darth Vader becomes the Lord Dark Helmet, who wears a similar costume (and an even larger black coal-scuttle helmet) but underneath it all is a weedy little man with a high-pitched voice and a penchant for playing with dolls when he thinks nobody is looking. The slightly prissy male robot C3-PO becomes the ultra-prissy female one Dot Matrix, whose main preoccupation is trying to protect Vespa's virginity. Brooks's interpretation of the light sabre leaves us in no doubt of the phallic overtones of that particular concept, as well as the oedipal overtones of that duel between Vader and Skywalker. Jabba the Hutt becomes Pizza the Hutt, another blatant piece of product placement but a neat pun. (Making the name of a bizarre alien race a homophone of an ordinary English word was not Lucas's smartest idea).Brooks's greatest challenge was probably how to parody Yoda, a character so central to the Star Wars mythos that he could not possibly be omitted. I mean, how does one satirise a creature who looks like the bastard child of a garden gnome and a long-eared bat and who believes English to be an object-subject-verb language and speaks it accordingly? (The Force you will feel!) Brooks's solution was to make Yoda, here renamed Yoghurt and speaking with a broad Yiddish accent, rather more normal-looking and recognisably human than he was in the original, thus emphasising the ineffable ridiculousness of Lucas's character.The film will probably not mean a great deal to those not familiar with Star Wars and its sequels; they will probably see it (as my wife did) as just a lot of actors running round being silly and making pointless jokes. For anyone who understands all the references, however, this is a witty and satirical parody. It should be required viewing for anyone tempted to put down Jedi as their religion on the census form. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After parodying the Western, the horror movie, the silent film and Alfred Hitchcock, Mel Brooks now moves on to deal with science fiction.

I watched it in Russian dubbed English, but this isn't a film by anybody's standards.It's a journey (3hrs). Something no one will ever make as good.I saw how people I admired (Darius Kondji, David Lynch, David Fincher, Dante Ferreti)pillaged this movie thinking i'd never see it. And I did.It simply and modestly ashames every directors I've enjoyed so far. They saw it, and copied the excellence. To a lower extent. Where did they film this (Estonia)??? What budget?? Every frame looks like a painting, the lights are astonishing. From the start, the textures, sound effects, photography and mood just takes it to another level. (1979).This is more than avant-garde, this is sheer genius.The plot? Wanna learn about the meaning of life? This is it. It's like kubrick's 2001, with a meaning.

As well as being a versatile actor he proved his capabilities in being behind the camera too. Though I am surprised as to why he never attempted to play a negative character in his entire career. In 'Every which way but loose' Clint gives the comedy genre a shot for the first time. He is convincing, however due to heavy criticism he did not pursue comedy in the long term. The director James Foley directed 'The Enforcer', which also starred Clint. But this in my opinion is his best movie to date. James was more recognized as a assistant director. Unfortunately he did not receive much recognition as a mainstream director.SPOILERS The writer has presented a very routine plot which limits ones expectations towards the end. Philo Beddon (Clint) plays a truck driver who for extra income on the side engages in regular bare fist fights. He lives with his friend Orville, his ma and a orangutan. At a country club he finds a loving acquaintance with a singer Lyn Taylor (Sondra Locke). After spending some time with Philo she takes a sudden leave to Denver which surprises him. In frustration he attacks a cop. This leads the cop and his buddy to search for for Philo to Denver. Simultaneously there also happens to be a gang of bikers that are searching for Philo too for trashing and selling a few of their bikes. Philo does in-coincidently meet Lyn again but faces some surprising revelations about her real identity. END OF SPOILERSIf you're a fan of comedy, this is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. It is not of the rib tickling nature but Clint gives and honest and sincere attempt at comedy. However it is not entirely a one man show. Other supporting characters gives good support. On the script level I felt that more substance was needed to make the plot give a impact. Watching some dumb bikers does not really do justice to half of the story. But Sondra Locke's negative character was a highlight in the movie. She is a fantastic actress and displays a side to us that we had not seen very often. It is disappointing to see that her career didn't develop further. The movie has a moderate pace but the sub plot involving the cops could have had a better finale. The culture of country and western music is blended appropriately in the movie and serves as a good backdrop. Many famous singers were included in a few scenes.Any fan of Clint Eastwood will enjoy this movie. However true admirers of comedy may be disappointed.

Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay updates the action, relocates it from London to New York and features enough plot twists to keep most viewers fully engaged throughout. The interactions between the characters at the centre of the story involve a toxic mixture of jealousy, lust, deception and blackmail which inevitably adds to the tensions which exist between them right from the very start.Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy Wall Street trader with an unfaithful wife and an investment portfolio which is losing its value so fast that financial ruin seems to be a certainty. In order to deal with these problems he meticulously devises a complex and seemingly perfect plan to murder his wife so that he can solve his financial problems when he inherits his share of her $100 million fortune.Steven's wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) has for some time been having an affair with a struggling artist called David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) who Steven visits at his loft studio. Having already researched David's background and discovered that he's actually an ex-convict with a track record of being involved in scams in which rich women were his victims; Steven blackmails him into carrying out the planned murder for $500,000 in cash.When things don't work out as planned, Steven moves quickly to cover up what's happened, David tries to blackmail Steven because he has some incriminating evidence of his involvement in the murder plot and Emily gradually starts to realise what her husband's been attempting to do.One of the strengths of this movie is the brilliant casting as Michael Douglas is perfect as the cold and ruthless Steven, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Emily's natural elegance, refinement and vulnerability convincingly and Viggo Mortensen looks suitably bohemian and at various times shows the mild amusement that David derives from what he does. These three characters all have their secrets as Emily doesn't tell Steven about her affair, he doesn't tell her about his financial problems and David doesn't mention his multiple identities, his criminal record or his background as a con artist.A Perfect Murder isn't as stagy or as claustrophobic as Hitchcock's movie and the new elements which have been added really work well and make the plot more interesting. A wonderfully moody atmosphere is created and maintained throughout the film and some of the remarks made by the characters make a great impact. Examples of this are when Steven and Emily both say at different times what if there were no tomorrow? and that's not happiness to see me, is it?.It's easy to see why A Perfect Murder was such a commercial success because it's actually a great deal more than just a simple remake of a well known movie.

Would you choose to live there? Wouldn't you fully pull the p*ss out of anyone that you knew that did live there? I mean seriously... And if they worked for Umbrella Corp wouldn't that only sweeten the deal? I mean Umbrella Corp?!? In essence the big-nawty Umbrella Corp (tee-hee) has made some whiz bang virus that has apparently been unleashed in the massive underground research facility, and the thousands of staff working there have been locked in to prevent the virus from escaping.The full implications of the virus are unknown, and the impact of the virus on the trapped staff is not shown in the early goings on, we do see in some initial moments that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows for everyone though.Cut! And Scene!

Now dressed in a strange fanboy-fantasy outfit of a red dress over combat boots (which she later adds a black leather jacket to. Huh?), Milla has no memory, no weapons, or no understanding of why she is there. At this stage I'm not sure if she even knew she was supposed to be acting, all she did was look around with wide eyes and her lower lip perpetually dropped for her early scenes.A strike team shows up with a squad leader who looks very much like a robot (mouth closed though), it appears that Milla has something to do with things, how or what we don't know yet.

Anyone who has played the game knows that it is about fighting Zombies, and as 99.3% of viruses nowadays in films create nothing but Zombies it seems why don't we just acknowledge that they are already here? Once the Zombies arrive it seems clear that the crack squad aren't really that well-trained, many of them simultaneously lose the plot and they seem to scatter in all directions, there is also much infighting and bickering, and it takes them forever to realise that a headshot drops their assailants.Alice rapidly comes to realise that whoever she is and however stupidly she is dressed that she has skillz, and that these skillz are effective VS zombies and zombie-dogs alike. (Although if you watch the couple scenes where she fires a gun pay attention to her eyes, she blinks hard with EVERY shot fired.

The zombies seem to inexplicably vanish from the film for very long stretches after the first headlong rush and a new CGI-assisted menace is introduced, I guess sort of like a level-boss in the game really.Final Rating - 6.5 \/ 10.

Almost complete opposites the mild mannered & unadventurous Sylvie & the overt & sexually active Ivy strike up a firm relationship & quickly become best friends, Ivy practically moves into Sylvie's giant mansion where her suicidal mother Georgie (Cheryl Ladd) is very ill with emphysema. Ivy starts to take control of the Cooper's lives, Ivy starts to seduce Sylvie's rich father Daryl (Tom Skerritt) & begins to rip the Cooper family apart...Co-written & directed by Katt Shea I have to say that I thought Poison Ivy was a really limp thriller that offered no surprises or genuine tension, why exactly has it spawned three sequels & counting? I suppose the biggest problem with Poison Ivy is the lethargic & uninvolving script that has wafer thin character's you don't care about sleepwalk through the film. There's no passion here, no excitement, nothing to get the pulse racing, there are no big twists or turns & the entire thing is very predictable. It's never clear why Ivy targets the Cooper's, why she befriends Sylvie (before she finds out her dad's mega rich), nothing about Ivy's background is ever mentioned other than she lived with an Aunt & quite why Ivy wanted to ruin a good thing by wrecking the career of Daryl, killing Georgie & betraying Sylie is a complete mystery to me, I mean she had been all but adopted by the Cooper's as part of the family so why ruin it with no obvious benefit other than breaking a family up & making everyone hate her. With no background on Ivy & no apparent source of motivation it's hard to care to be quite honest. The sacking of Daryl from his job gets one short scene that feels like an afterthought & didn't seem to affect the story that much at all. Then there's the slow pace, things only start to pick up towards the end & it's not until past the hour mark when things turn really nasty & by then the films almost over. There's some poor attempts at psychology as Sylvie has to deal with her ill mother complete with ghostly hallucinations, there's the issue of peer pressure, betrayal, the idea that family is the most important thing in life & teenage rebellion but it's all just padding with little thought or effort going into it. I mean if the most extreme thing Ivy does to Sylvie for the first hour is pamper her dog too much then you know your in trouble.I must admit that I found Poison Ivy really tiresome to watch on a visual level as well, the opening scene of Ivy swinging through the air where she flicks her hair away from her face looks like it belongs in a cheap shampoo commercial. None of it is erotic or sexy & simply dressing Drew Barrymore up in a few tight outfits doesn't cut it, the sex scenes are tame & I am pretty sure Barrymore got a body double. There's one breast shot & one naked male butt & that's your lot. Personally I didn't find Barrymore attractive in this at all, her shallow pointless character & wooden acting combined to send me to sleep rather than send shivers down my spine. There's no violence to speak of & even the 'Unrated' version doing the rounds on DVD is very tame by todays standards as teen flicks such as American Pie (1999) & The Hangover (2009) are far more explicit.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 this flopped at the box-office & you can see why, there's nothing here other than for Drew Barrymore fans & considering this was one of her first films she probably didn't have many at the time. The acting is pretty poor, I thought Barrymore was very wooden with no menace or sexuality about her performance at all while Tom Skerritt looks bored.Poison Ivy is a terrible erotic thriller that is neither erotic or thrilling in any way as far as I am concerned, a real damp squib of a limp wristed film that delivers nothing. Followed by Poison Ivy II (1996), Poison Ivy The New Seduction (1997) & Poison Ivy The Secret Society (2008).

Almost complete opposites the mild mannered & unadventurous Sylvie & the overt & sexually active Ivy strike up a firm relationship & quickly become best friends, Ivy practically moves into Sylvie's giant mansion where her suicidal mother Georgie (Cheryl Ladd) is very ill with emphysema. Ivy starts to take control of the Cooper's lives, Ivy starts to seduce Sylvie's rich father Daryl (Tom Skerritt) & begins to rip the Cooper family apart...Co-written & directed by Katt Shea I have to say that I thought Poison Ivy was a really limp thriller that offered no surprises or genuine tension, why exactly has it spawned three sequels & counting? I suppose the biggest problem with Poison Ivy is the lethargic & uninvolving script that has wafer thin character's you don't care about sleepwalk through the film. There's no passion here, no excitement, nothing to get the pulse racing, there are no big twists or turns & the entire thing is very predictable. It's never clear why Ivy targets the Cooper's, why she befriends Sylvie (before she finds out her dad's mega rich), nothing about Ivy's background is ever mentioned other than she lived with an Aunt & quite why Ivy wanted to ruin a good thing by wrecking the career of Daryl, killing Georgie & betraying Sylie is a complete mystery to me, I mean she had been all but adopted by the Cooper's as part of the family so why ruin it with no obvious benefit other than breaking a family up & making everyone hate her.
