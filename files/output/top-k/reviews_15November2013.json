Inevitable, but perhaps a shame, as it's an intriguing film in its own right.There's no denying it however, the cast is incredible. It's not just a disgustingly young Leo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp, it's also Juliette Lewis, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover of Back to the Future fame.It tells the story of Gilbert Grape (Depp on fine monosyllabic form), his disabled brother Arnie (DiCaprio, who steals the show) and 'worldly' girl Becky (Lewis), Gilbert's love interest who travels around the country with her grandmother. It's a meandering film, full of odd little touches - the mother who is so fat that the floor of her house can barely hold her weight; Arnie, who likes to climb as high as he can at every opportunity, and the little faux-philosophical gems that Gilbert grants us.If you're looking for a rip-roaring narrative and non-stop action, this is not the film for you. As Gilbert tells us early on, nothing really happens in the small town he lives in. What little plot there is circles around Gilbert's dilemma - his duty to care for his brother Arnie and to help his gargantuan, housebound mother; and the promised excitement and escape of a romance with the exotic Becky.It's also about acceptance - both Arnie and his mother are outcasts, yet it's the mother and her titanic size that provokes the most open ridicule. People openly take pictures, stare and laugh at her in a way they would never do with Arnie, who is accepted and liked for all his eccentricities.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an odd experience, but an enjoyable, and slightly mesmeric one. It evokes a rather beautiful sense of small town simplicity that makes me despair of the urbane cynicism of modern London.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film that no matter how many times it re-runs on Television, I can sit down and watch it indefinitely. It is a marvel piece of cinema that was brought to life by two of Hollywood's biggest names, Steven Spielberg & George Lucas (Director Philip Kaufman was originally set to direct before Spielberg, he is credited as a co-writer on the story). Both were inspired by the old film serials of the 1930's and 1940's, where adventurers will survive and escape virtually all kinds of in-escapable peril. Harrison Ford is in his prime as the famous fictional architect Indiana Jones, whose journeys would involve bizarre riddles and strange hieroglyphics that would usually result in disasters of biblical proportions.At the very beginning of the movie, we're in the middle of a jungle exhibition with a mood defining score from John Williams and a younger, thinner Alfred Molina. Suddenly we enter a tomb and already the film has set its entire mood and expectations within minutes. Suddenly we see what little of Jones's regular life is like as a College professor, and in no time we see him off on another adventure searching for the legendary Ark of the Covenant (Built by the Israeli's to hold the fragments of The Ten Commandments). This sees Indy travelling to Nepal to meet his old flame Marion (Karen Allen), who may hold the key to finding the Ark. Unaware that both of them are being followed and hunted by Nazi Gestapos sent by Hitler to collect the Ark for himself, this revelation pairs Indy and Marion together as they head for Cairo to find it first.Among the highlights of the movie as said before is the cave, the bar fight in Nepal, the famous market chase and the undeniably funny Gun to the Swordfight scene (Ford had diarrhoea). All these scenes and so many others continuously loop in the memories of my brain. Even the ending of the film is so famous, it has been more than parodied to death in recent Pop-Culture.The special effects and visual style in this film are truly a lost art. From the wax melting faces and giant fibreglass boulders, to breathing streets of Cairo and dimly lit dungeons meant everything and anything could come out at you anytime, anywhere. Among the talent behind this movie, Joe Johnston won an Academy Award for his effects work and would later turn to directing. His most recent feature being Captain America The First Avenger (2011), which has a wonderful throwback to Raiders (And the Fuhrer digs for trinkets in the desert). Michael Bay was the storyboard artist who thought the movie was going to be horrible, then he finally saw it and loved it enough to become a film-maker himself (Yet he really needs to learn a thing or two).Even now as I write and dive into this movie, I can't fully explain why it's all such a gem to me. Adventure films before and after never really reached this kind of magnitude, not even in the sequels. No matter when and where it's on, I just have to sit and watch it. All in all, you're along for the ride and once it has started there's no going back. I have been researching thoroughly through the history of Cinema, and whilst I have found many better treasures among Japan, Sweden and Italy etc. Raiders of the Lost Ark, even after all I've said there's no possible way to fully describe what the experience meant to me. But why it means so much, summed up in one sentence is One of the most imaginative thrill ride movies ever made, and that's what I consider Cinema and story telling all about.Final Verdict I loved it the first time I saw it, and I'll most likely continue to love it till the day I die.

They have to drill in to the asteroid and bury an atom bomb that will blow it up from the inside. Their path to becoming saviors of humanity is fraught with peril, however, as along the way many orange, firey explosions seek to thwart them.Sarcasm aside, however, I had fun. The casting helps, I mean what man doesn't like to see Steve Buscemi in any role whatsoever (he just makes all of us feel so handsome, right?), and Bruce Willis has his usual gravitas as a particularly talented and experienced oil driller who is also the father of the girl who's dating the guy we're meant to care about(played by Ben Affleck). Peter Stormare plays a Mir Cosmonaut, who was fun in a sort of all Russians are crazed drunks kind of way. Then there was Jason Isaacs in an only too small role as a smart British guy.Also working in the film's favour is... not much.But it does have explosions! And everydudes having fun in space - hey they could be you! Are you the one who'd go nuts like Buscemi or would you be really heroic like Willis? (be honest now) And they do it all while sticking it to The Man, too! Except that Bruce Willis is kind of The Man, in many ways. But he's an everyman kind of The Man. Not like those NASA and White House prats.In short, go in wanting to see explosions, and you will see lots of big orange explosions and leave entirely satisfied. Go in actually thinking about things, and I'm afraid that the cosy Hollywood reality might just take a hit.

Fight Club is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It is a about a man named Jack (Edward Norton) who is stuck in a depressed state. He is unhappy with his job so he tries to delve himself into creating the perfect apartment, when this doesn't fill the gap he goes to support groups for people with terminal diseases hoping he will find fulfilment there. While at these support groups he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who he later takes an interest in. On Jack's journey to fulfilment he crosses paths with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler believes in fulfilment though loss and pain and he and Jack fight. This leads to an underground group called the Fight Club and a journey of fighting and violence embarks from there.Fight Club is a dark comedy which was directed by David Fincher who had also directed Seven, which Brad Pitt had previously acted in. Fight Club portrays controversy and diverse degrees of masculinity and extremism including terrorism. I didn't wait so long to watch it on purpose, life just worked out that way. Fight club is certainly one of my favourite movies now and I finally understand all the fight club references that are used by others in daily life.

Chucky is everything Andy wanted, but people start turning up dead, and everyone begins to think if Andy is committing the murders, and nobody realizes Chucky is Charles Lee Ray, wreaking havoc.I enjoy a couple of the sequels, but Chucky began to suffer from Freddy syndrome.

People keep saying Chucky is back to his creepy ways in Curse of Chucky, but I've yet to see that, so I can't comment on it. If you wanna see Chucky without many wisecracks this movie will satisfy you. Unlike many of the sequels, the jokey tone isn't quite as prominent. Chucky does have one liners, but this is fueled with tension, and it knows how to get under your skin. It has some carefully orchestrated suspense with a slow build to it, which works very well. Don Mancini claims he wanted to wait a bit longer before revealing the doll was killing people, and make people wonder if Andy was crazy. I actually would have dug that, but what they did was awesome as well. It takes about 40 minutes before Chucky reveals who he really is. And let me just say. There is nothing funny about it. If you're a first time viewer, you may find Charles's first real words (I'm discounting the Hi. I'm Chucky. Wanna play?) startling. This movie isn't filled with gore, nor does it need much of it. It relies much more on very effective psychology. When blood does commence, it's fairly nasty. We get a couple of stabbings, gunshot wounds, heads and limbs are shot off, and a little bit more. Gore is not this movie's forte. Alex Vincent is actually quite solid as little Andy. I usually find kids grating at his age, as far as acting goes. Alex thoroughly impressed me with his range at his age. If he had been even slightly annoying, I'm not sure this movie would have been as memorable as it was. Alex is one of the more endearing child actors. I have one request though, sir. Please don't make me breakfast, ever! If the mess he caused is any indication by making his mom breakfast in this movie, he'd burn my place down. I digress. Catherine Hicks is great as Andy's Mom. She's everything you want in a Mother. Vulnerable, strong when it counts, and believable; her relationship with Andy was genuine, and it's easy to root for them. She can be on my side any day. Chris Sarandon plays one of the coolest detectives you'll ever see. I relished every scene he was in. Why isn't this guy recognized more? He's such a great actor. Brad Douriff is legendary, of course. I doubt anyone could do Chucky like he can. I have only one complaint about this movie. The ending felt a bit contrived.

It was followed by ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy as Chris , James Whitmore , Monte Markham , Reni Santoni , Bernie Casey and Joe Don Baker and finally ¨The Magnificent seven ride¨ by George McCowan with Lee Van Cleef as Chris , James B. Sikking , Ralph Waite , William Lucking , and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 , being also produced by Walter Mirish , as usual . The motion picture was stunningly directed directed by John Sturges . This good Western is a Yul Brynner vehicle , if you like his particular performance ,you'll enjoy this one .

Affleck and Damon, with the help of both Rob Reiner and William Goldman, created a history that is at the same time smart and very beautiful and touching. The conflicts of the main character may be very relatable to anyone. For example, how many times you've realized that you could do easily certain things, but you refused to do so 'only' because they aren't what you want for your life? Obviously, Will had his other conflicts, such as the trauma which leads him to do the bad things, and which as well disturb him in his relationships. This is what i found beautiful in this film. Even a genius has enormous troubles, because he is a human being like everyone. I found Will Hunting character very likable as well. I mean, how many persons never got in trouble choosing the job, trouble to plan his future, and etc. I bet that very few persons never experienced or met someone that never experienced that.The acting is very good. Damon is in shape, maybe bringing his best career's performance to this film. Robin Williams did a very good job as well, so well that the role earned an Oscar for him in 1998. The film's editing and cinematography are extremely well made.

What do we do when we find that the relationships we've been involved in are unsatisfying, and we want - more. Of something? Kissing Jessica Stein explores the complicated nature of relationships and it does so in a very mature and thoughtful way. The very nature of the story could have lent itself to the movie becoming a sort of slapstick comedy. Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a terminally single young woman in New York City. Her mother (Tovah Feldshuh) is constantly trying to find the right Jewish man for her, but none of the relationships click. Then, seemingly out of the blue and on a whim, Jessica responds to a personal ad from Helen (Heather Juergensen), whose looking for friendship and possibly more. Helen wants the experience of being with a woman, Jessica's looking for the connection. They meet, and the movie charts the course of their relationship, and it does so both well and tastefully.Although it obviously is the engine driving the movie forward, the lesbianism angle is never really the front and centre issue. It's the development of the relationship, and the way in which the people around both Jessica and Helen react as the relationship cautiously becomes more open from Helen's gay male friend who sees this as a betrayal of the gay community because he doesn't think either Helen or Jessica are really gay, to the very touching scene with Jessica's mother in which she basically tells Jessica that she just wants her to be happy with whoever can do that. But the awkwardness is always front and centre - especially the awkwardness between the two leads. I thought that Westfeldt and Juergensen had a great on-screen chemistry, and a part of that chemistry was the ability to showcase the awkwardness. This began as an experiment for Helen, but in the end she wanted something deeper, more passionate and long-lasting. For Jessica, everything began cautiously - and it's hard to know exactly what she wanted. Did she just want a friend, with some intimacy mixed in, or did she want an actual relationship? A partner to share her life with? It was interesting to watch the evolution, and to wait to discover if this was going to have a happily ever after ending or not.I was happy that this didn't turn out to be a lame comedy. It had that potential, but turned out to be at times humorous but always sensitive. I was also glad that it wasn't a message movie. I never had the sense of having any sort of agenda pushed at me. It was just an account of two people struggling through a relationship that was both fulfilling and awkward for both of them for various reasons. It's a bit dated by now, almost 12 years after it first appeared. Does anybody really use personal ads to meet someone anymore?

An incredibly sweet story, with no logic and...quite frankly...a very dark message. I see what director Barry Sonnenfeld was doing. He's balancing the line between slapstick and fairy tale. Not much different than what Billy Wilder did, except...I know now why those films only exist within their time.Fox plays a concierge who has bigger dreams beyond the bellhop mentality. He gets in business with a man, who (and I'm not ruining it, since it's in the trailer) whose affair with a younger woman is now Fox's duty. Unfortunately for him, he has a flirtatious history with her. You see where the script borrows from The Apartment. He's crestfallen that his feelings towards her may or may not trump his dreams. I can see Fox channeling his inner Jack Lemmon, but something is greatly amiss. I think, it's because there's so much fat in the story that you are just always waiting for something interesting to happen. Take for example, the candy shop lady who is pestering him about his love life. The inexplicable banter between a Chinese food delivery boy and himself (perhaps to illustrate his loneliness).Then you have the obligatory Barry Sonnenfeld wide angle, collective shot. It's very uneven where he places these moments. Works fantastic in Men In Black somehow falls short here. The very lovely Gabrielle Anwar seems SO uncomfortable playing the other woman. She has the look, just not the depth. Something missing, but I can't put my finger on it. Somehow, the Shirley MacClaines's Fran Kubliak sweetness was suppose to be injected here. But Anwar doesn't seem to commit. In fact, there is a vomiting scene in this movie, reminiscent of when she attempts her suicide.I like the fairy tale quality of this movie. And the music, as usual, leaves a swell in your heart. It's not terrible. It's perfectly fine for its time.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 November 2013","score":"","review":" There are certain type of movies you look back on and think that those days are gone. This movie is one of them. An incredibly sweet story, with no logic and...quite frankly...a very dark message. I see what director Barry Sonnenfeld was doing. He's balancing the line between slapstick and fairy tale. Not much different than what Billy Wilder did, except...I know now why those films only exist within their time.Fox plays a concierge who has bigger dreams beyond the bellhop mentality. He gets in business with a man, who (and I'm not ruining it, since it's in the trailer) whose affair with a younger woman is now Fox's duty. Unfortunately for him, he has a flirtatious history with her. You see where the script borrows from The Apartment. He's crestfallen that his feelings towards her may or may not trump his dreams. I can see Fox channeling his inner Jack Lemmon, but something is greatly amiss. I think, it's because there's so much fat in the story that you are just always waiting for something interesting to happen. Take for example, the candy shop lady who is pestering him about his love life.

We see only a negative view of adult sexuality. 2. Youthful interest in the subject is romanticized and idealized. 3. An aging single man spends his time overseeing the life of a boy during a key developmental stage, and the guy is keenly interested in how the boy handles his problems,including romantic ones. 4. In the process, a metaphorical secret is shared between both of them, and the end of the film is set up to imply that this mystical quality will get passed on to the next generation. (A misguided stereotype here, but one that many persons actually believe...)5. Although the film includes scenes in which the mother questions the propriety of this arrangement, her doing so is cast purely in negative terms. Superficially, this viewpoint is supposed to rule out the theme that is otherwise obvious on its surface, and the handling of the film's details is actually quite consistent with her initial suspicions. Her initial reference therefore serves a useful literary function in that it defines one of the main metaphorical themes of the film. Since the film has the mother sexually assaulted, it is suggested to viewers that the mother's traditional sexuality is not at all a good thing, and her judgement is untrustworthy (and that it's okay for some alternative form of love to be sought).The script's handling is very interesting, because if this film is not dealing in metaphor than it is overloaded with contrivances, including things that make no sense whatsoever, such as the lost pet flyers. The flyer is portrayed late in the film as if the mother had called the number on it to report Anthony Hopkins' character. This strongly suggests it's true nature, as a kind of wanted poster, or missing child poster. The mind reading has evidence as a mere ploy by a guy who collects and then uses information to gain trust and set things up just right. For example, it appears that the entire scene in the bar could have been set up by him so that the boy is given a different story about his father (and a photo), thus planting distrust and resentment in the boy toward his mother. The grown-up boy at the end echoes this by meeting a teen girl and providing her with a photo and interpretation of her own parent and background. The boy had said flat out that he had come to love Hopkins, toward the end. But because there is also a girl around, audiences are supposed to accept Hopkins' trustworthiness? Did that thin blouse of hers really need to be unbuttoned in order to adjust her shoulder? Was Hopkins' mind reading really just the research he had done along with the reading of people so that everything was just so? For example, he identifies the teen bully's insult patterns as a probable reaction-formation. The strongest hint of actual mind-reading comes in the idea that he could somehow read that the girl needed help. The reason she would be attacked in the first place is never explained; could Hopkins have set up things so that the rescue scenario could play out, just as he had suggested a romantic role for the boy in one of their earliest meetings?Almost everything in the film is therefore consistent with a darker, more ordinary scenario rather than the fantasy. Hopkins' character is a wanted man, because of unnamed crimes that keep him on the go. His power that must be controlled is not a telepathic one, but his urges that probably involve controlled intimacy with young persons. Now it is made clear that this is not portrayed in the stereotypical manner of violence or coercion, but is instead done in a more insidious fashion through the power of gradual suggestion, trust, and friendship. Rather than a swift attack that could be easily interpreted and thus possibly recovered from, the relationship takes on a form in which the boy is seeing things according to the man's vision, and in a way that makes the boy willing to defend him. It's a very classic circumstance well-known to actual police investigators. The fact that there may be some actual friendship, and even love, does not un-do the fact that the relationship most probably went beyond that which is legally permissible, or appropriate for our contemporary culture (which is not ancient Greece, after all).Since this is a carefully written script, and not a traditional genre film, these elements are quite suggestive of a controversial agenda. It's interesting that no one seems to comment on this. Given the large number of persons who like this film, this issue is worth discussing. What indeed is the message of this movie? The answer seems to be evident from the elements listed above!

For example, one of the main jokes in the film is that the characters are constantly getting their names mixed up. You would only understand why that is if you had read Hamlet, as in the play these characters are interchangeable, appearing only in a pair. There was nothing particularly clever about the camera angles or movements, yet the cinematography succeeded by including subtle references, such as the pages that can be found in each scene, containing text from the bible, or the Shakespeare portraits that are located all around the castle.
