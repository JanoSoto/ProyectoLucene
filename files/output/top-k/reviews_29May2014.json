For me personally, there are a couple things that I do admire about this picture. But given the praise that it had received, including a spot on the AFI's list of the all-time greatest American films and being placed on countless lists of the best musicals ever made, I simply don't get what all the fuss is about. So, how can I be so cold-hearted for dismissing a film such as this? That question shall be answered after I briefly go over the plot. And like I said before, your ability to like My Fair Lady depends heavily on the plot.Audrey Hepburn plays Eliza Doolittle, a young and poor flower girl with a strong Cockney accent living in the streets of London. One night, she comes across an arrogant phonetics professor named Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) who firmly believes that a person's ability to speak English properly determines their value in society. Naturally, Mr. Higgins is absolutely insulted by her ability to speak English. Coincidentally, he runs into a phonetics expert named Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilfred Hyde- White) and bets him that he could teach a woman to speak English so well that he could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball. So with Col. Pickering paying for her lessons, Eliza reluctantly endures Professor Higgins' harsh speech training. His training includes and isn't limited to speaking with marbles in her mouth, repeating saying the same sentences over and over until she speaks them correctly, and other similar methods to practice her speech and word punctuation. Will she be able to become a proper lady with fluent English or will she be back on the streets again?If you can't handle that type of plot, you won't be able to handle at least an hour of this 170-minute musical. Because guess what? An hour or so is devoted to the process of making Eliza into an acceptable lady in high society. To be fair, it does show us Eliza's progress with speaking English. But the main problem I had with this hour as well as the entire picture can be summarized in one word repetitive. First of all, before Eliza even starts training, how many times did you hear her say I'm a good girl or something to defend herself in a loud and whiny manner? It was all the time, right? At the beginning, I actually was enjoying Rex Harrison as the professor and the sophisticated words he was using to dismiss Eliza. That is again until I caught on to the repetition of his character and how he goes on and on about how repulsive her speaking is. We get it. We know she can't speak satisfactory English. Rex Harrison did his part, but the script by Alan Jay Lerner and George Bernard Shaw is a broken record. More so than the repetitiveness of Eliza and Professor Higgins' quarreling, it's the verbal training that really gets old. You know how in elementary school when the teacher makes everyone read out loud and some students have significant trouble which in turn causes other students to be annoyed? Well, think of this verbal training for Eliza as the cinematic equivalent of that situation. It's tedious for everyone involved. It's torture for Eliza, aka the student that can't read, because they're struggling with doing it right. And it's excruciating for Professor Higgins and everyone else in the household, aka the other students who can read, because it's testing their low patience. Other narrative complaints on my part include the character of Freddy (Jeremy Brett) who is a total bore, and the film's final third which sags on and on to no end. As a big fan of musicals, I can't tell you how hard I've tried to get into My Fair Lady over the years. And every time I tried watching it, I fell asleep. Now to the film's credit, the songs by Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner are good. Notable standouts include With a Little Bit of Luck, On the Street Where You Live and Get Me to the Church on Time. Two of those songs are sung by the character of Alfred Doolittle (Stanley Holloway), aka Eliza's father. He's easily the most charismatic and interesting character on screen in My Fair Lady. Like his daughter, he lives in the streets on London and he's poor. Unlike his daughter, he's usually more optimistic towards the future even though he's guilty of getting drunk at any bar in London nightly. A scene in the first third of the picture consists of Mr. Doolittle confronting Professor Higgins after finding out Eliza's staying there for her lessons. And if you think he's there to rescue his daughter, you're not only dead wrong, but you'll be shocked to hear what Mr. Higgins has to say about HIS English. It's a great scene that adds complexity to the two best characters in the whole film. But in able to get to the film's best tunes, Mr. Doolittle's subplot, scenes showing Henry Higgins' complexity, and the admirable production and costumes that My Fair Lady provides, you have to pay the price in the form of getting through a plot with limited appeal. It's possible I could have missed something here since many people seem to enjoy My Fair Lady. Maybe, there's a reason why it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1964 over a more eligible film such as Mary Poppins. Either way, this flick simply wasn't for me.

In fact, according to many, it was 'too dark' and, because of that, somehow less worthy than the other movies. Yes, the tone is pretty bleak, but, when you compare it to many of the films today (including Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) I can't really see the problem.Where some people see 'darkness,' I simply see realism. Yes, people get killed in 'Batman Returns' (shock, horror &#x96; even good people!). If that shocks and disturbs you so then you really should stick to watching Disney cartoons where everyone lives happily ever after.Besides, if you're contemplating watching Batman Returns then you've probably already seen Tim Burton's first Batman offering, i.e. 1989 smash hit with Jack Nicholson as The Joker. If you haven't, I'd start with that one first, as it sets the tone nicely for the sequel. Today's audiences may be more familiar with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 'killer clown,' but, back in 1989, Jack Nicholson WAS the Joker. It was fair to say that he owned the role and whoever followed him in taking on the Dark Knight would have to be pretty damn evil to top him. Enter Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't care what Batman's modern day fans say... I still think Pfeiffer is a better 'Catwoman' than Anne Hathaway. Both of the new villains stepped up to the challenge and scared and slinked their way around the screen at all times.With two such great villains you could be mistaken for thinking that Batman himself might be a bit eclipsed (a common complaint about the first film). However, he too has upped his game (maybe Michael Keaton demanded more screen time and better lines after being so outshined by Jack Nicholson?). Either way, you'll be hard put to find anyone letting the side down.At nearly two hours, Batman Returns isn't a short film, but it seems to fly by. Maybe it's not a 'family friendly' movie and it certainly doesn't have the 'happy-go-lucky' feel of today's modern (Marvel?) superhero movies, but it is one of Burton's best 'twisted fairy tales' to date, so if you're in the mood for something nicely dark with a cracking Danny Elfman soundtrack, give this one a go and don't go thinking that Nolan's Batman was the ONLY Dark Knight out there.

As soon as possible I am going to watch the last movie but I heard some rumors like the third movie wasn't that good after all kind of things, anyway I hope that is not correct. I am freaking recommend to you this awesome production to watch. Take care.

He is willing to go the distance with another heavyweight boxer. His entire life is filled with interesting people that means a lot to him. Yet, when it comes to hard times, Rocky is the only person who can see it all. And right now, he is given a chance to fight at the 200th anniversary of the nation.In the beginning of the movie, Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone), is a down and out boxer who is just finishing up his last fight. He's poor and his only other occupation that he has other than a boxer is a collector for a loan shark. Rocky also has friends that seem to challenge him in his everyday life. His friend, Paulie, (Burt Young), work for a meat processing place and even he has to deal with his problems. One of those problems is Adrian, (Talia Shire), a shy woman who can't stand living with him because of his drunkenness. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers), is looking for a competitor to fight for the nation's biggest birthday. His ultimate choice is, of course, Rocky. Creed thinks that Balboa is the perfect fighter. In order for Rocky to fight against Creed, he seeks the help of his gym manager, Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), an angry and tough man who is willing to train Rocky for the big fight.The movie is filled with a lot of great screen performances. The one aspect that strike me the most was Sylvester Stallone. This is a great performance from him and the first of many. One thing that I like about Stallone is the way that he writes Rocky and all of the other characters' dialogue. He tries to create a likable person out of himself and with that writing, we can actually see ourselves being with these people. Rocky Balboa is a wonderful character. He has a heart of gold. In addition, there is a very nice and sweet love story between Rocky and Adrian that adds flavor to the movie. Burt Young and Burgess Meredith also make the movie work because their characters to me, were one of the reasons why Rocky's world is so upset and angry. It's not the characters' fault. It's the way their world is affected by America's problems. These characters are not happy living in this competitive world of fighting over what they want or what they can get. Rocky isn't about the central character. It is more about people rather than the main character.The famous scene in which Rocky runs up the stairs while Gonna Fly Now plays in the background is perhaps the most powerful and most inspirational scenes in movie history. In my opinion, whenever I see a sports movie, I think of them as being inspirational. I always find that the main character is always pushing his way through tough times. The final fight scene in the movie between Rocky and Apollo is the second best scene in the movie because by the end, you feel as though your emotions are drained. By that time, the audience who seen this movie in the movie theater were probably cheering with joy and crying with emotion. Inside, I was cheering and devastated with joy. It's a shame that Rocky is the only great movie that Stallone has written and starred in. Because of that, Stallone fell into a losing streak with very bad films and sometimes embarrassing. This movie proves that Stallone is perfect for the role. He knows what comes out of Rocky Balboa. He knows that people will like this character and always stick to him because he is friendly and also, lonely. But above all, this is the movie that made Stallone a star in the first place. It's great to see him land a juicy role in a major motion picture. ★★★★ 4 stars.

His increasingly irritated game buddy urges him to return to the game, in response to which Mitch yells - Deal me out! I'm speaking with Miss ...uh and looks to Blanche for help. She reclines, one hand under her chin, the other daintily holding a cigarette, does her best impression of a theremin and replies - Du bwah. And just as easily, I was in love with a character who, among other things is a former prostitute and an implied child molester.Having watched this film well into the double digit number of times, I've come to the realization that I came for Stanley, but ended up staying for Blanche. Stanley certainly hasn't aged badly, but Blanche gets increasingly mesmerizing with each viewing. There are theories abound about what these two characters are meant to symbolize, but I like to imagine their interplay as a match between the old & the new. Blanche comes from old money, a once eminent family and a background in education, while Stanley has to use his physicality and an army record to defend his immigrant ancestry. Despite the obvious difference in class, if I imagine these two characters in twenty years time, I can see Stanley poring over his retirement plans, spouting a tirade at his son and waiting for the microwave to beep. Blanche on the other hand is on her third mint julep, quoting Whitman's raunchiest lines, wearing entirely too much makeup and elegantly hitting on the nearest twenty year old. Yes, she does wear powerful shackles which force her to live in a place which she alone inhabits with occasional intrusions from undesirables. The same shackles however make her rise well above the plebeians...she never has and never will feel the need to learn about the Napoleonic code.Blanche also rarely indulges in self pity in the presence of others. Apart from the one occasion when she bursts into tears in front of Stanley as he hands her a ticket back to Auriol, she keeps her emotions in check. She also does whatever she needs to, to get by - a scalding bath, a drink or three, the rhinestone tiara are all part of her elegant coping mechanism. And whether anyone buys it or not, she is peddling an image of herself as the heroine of her own tale of tragedy, romance and ultimately, redemption.My preoccupation with the details in this movie over time have made me somewhat indifferent to the ending. There is no denying that it is very poignant and moving and so on, but I find myself zoned out during the last scene when things go south for everyone involved (except Eunice. I think Eunice deserves a movie of her own). I like to think that the heroine of this movie would appreciate the fact that I reach for a bottle of bourbon instead of a box of tissues.
