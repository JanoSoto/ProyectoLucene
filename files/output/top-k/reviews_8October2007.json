[{"date":"8 October 2007","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Steve Martin was never a reason for me to see a movie. I mostly found him neutral to slightly annoying to outright bad-slapstick-get-on-my-nerves annoying. For some reason several of his older works and a few more recent ones (Shopgirl) found their way into my rental queue, and I had occasion to revisit his stuff, Bowfinger among them. This is how I discovered that (a) he cannot act, (b) he isn't a very good comic, (c) his writing isn't great, either.It isn't that he hasn't his moments, as an actor, a comic, and a writer. But bad acting, horrible comedic timing, and utterly contrived and unfunny writing are pervasive enough to make it impossible for me to enjoy the better bits properly. Yes, he pokes fun at stuff that deserves to have fun poked at it (Hollywood, in this case, L.A. folks in L.A. Story, etc.), and there are many delightfully accurate observations in his stories---mixed, unfortunately, with saccharine-sweet morality, ham-handedly executed slapstick, and just blatant juvenile stupidity.His absurd is not Monty Python, it's not Charlie Chaplin, it's not even The Simpsons. His absurd is the middle-of-the-road, hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-punchline absurd, no joke unexplained, no movie without message.Of course, it does not help that in this production he is supported by a cast of rather questionable acting talent, such as Murphy, Graham, and Downey Jr., and a puppet master in the director's chair. The combination is about as subtle as the Muppet Show and as funny as Downey Jr. I hope for your sake that you find better things to do with your time.

It's like the military, only not as hardcore. In Police Academy, it's nothing but side-splitting hilarity scene-after-scene. Instead of your average Joe who wants to find a better career, this academy chooses all walks of life from a florist named Moses Hightower(Bubba Smith), an photo developer with an effeminate name Leslie Barbara(Donovan Scott), a trouble-maker named Casey Mahoney(Steve Guttenberg), a human sound machine named Larvelle Jones(Michael Winslow), a dainty lady who gets hardcore with the bad guys named Hooks(Marion Ramsey). She shouts at them saying, DON'T MOVE DIRTBAG!, and my favorite, an Army solider with strong words, I'm talking Eugene Tackleerry(David Graf, 1950-2001). These people don't look like much, but they do have something to show. I liked the scene where the Latin cadet who sneaks into the ladies dorm at night, and when Callahan(Leslie Easterbrook) catches him in the act, she proved to be more woman than any of the other ladies in the academy. Mahoney wants out, but when the riot hits, he changes his mind and gets the glory. He also helped Hightower stay in the academy as well when it comes to the driving test, which he does exceptionally well. With all the others scenes I can tell, I only chose the ones I like. This movie is a true gem of its kind. 5 stars!

Living in Oblivion. Writer-director Tom DiCillo made in 1991 a film called Johnny Suede starring a young and unknown at the time actor named Brad Pitt. Johnny Suede was a failure with both critics and viewers but an artist can learn from any experience however disappointing or devastating it is. DiCillo wrote a short story from his frustration and turned his experience into a smart, funny, playful, and highly enjoyable second feature Living in Oblivion that takes place during one day of shooting a low budget film. Photographed with the color-to-black-and-white transitions, Living in Oblivions has surreal, strangely poetic and amusing quality to it.The cast is solid and consists of DiCillo's friends who are the regulars in his films. Steve Buscemi, the king of independent movies, in the rare starring role, plays Nick Reve, a long-haired, dedicated but frustrated director who in the moments of creative inspiration has to get back to earth and to deal with the tensions between his leading lady (Catherine Keener, before her star-making turn in Being John Malkovich but already a wonderfully talented beautiful and sexy actress) with whom he is silently in love and the male star, arrogant egotist Chad Palomino (James LeGros does an un-flattering but hilarious and quite accurate impersonation of the real life model for Chad). If these problems are not enough, there is eye-patch wearing sensitive leather-clad cameraman named Wolf (Dermot Mulroney) who went through a painful break-up right on the set. There is a great scene with an irritated dwarf Tito (Peter Dinklage) who was hired for a dream sequence and who hates dreams with the dwarfs in them Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarfs in them. The only place I've seen dwarfs in dreams is in stupid movies like this! There is also a smoke machine that explodes every time when turned on...And to top it all, Nick's senile mother surprisingly shows up during the shot and eventually saves the dream sequence and the movie. That's what the mothers are for, aren't they?
