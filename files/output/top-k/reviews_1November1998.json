Valik was quite an intriguing vampire, and I enjoyed watching him. However, Sheryl Lee, James Woods and Daniel Baldwin KILLED ME!! #1, Lee's constant shaking yadda yadda, frustration...Daniel Baldwin, was just too funny with the cauterizing of his many wounds. James Woods, Ahh! Can his jeans be any more tight? And for once, I'd like to see a movie where the vampires prevail (even the master vampire). I loved the storyline though, with the search of the black cross and what not, I thought that was good. But, the western of it all killed me along with the music. Was it me, or was it the same over and over? I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you like vampires, you might want to give it at try--I've heard mixed reviews. So, you may like it.

Although it made an intriguing plot twist it was disappointing. George Clooney was excellent as Seth Gecko, and being a Tarantino fan, I thought that he played a wonderful foil to Tarantino's character Richard Gecko.This movie had all the makings for a successful action-packed movie. Murder, chase scenes, kidnappings and then everyone turns into vampires!!What the heck is going on here. I was all excited to see what was going to happen and then when everyone turned into vampires, I found myself laughing at a movie that once had me rivetted to the screen.The cast played their parts well, Havey Keitel and Julilette Lewis played wonderfully colourful characters and young Ernest Liu did an excellent job as the newcomer. Although the film became a little satirical, there were some classic Tarantino shots that make fans of his work admire the camera angles and other technical aspects. I think that the movie would have been better off going on the storyline that it originally started with, but hey, some people found it quiet enjoying. Only one other thing bothered me about this movie, the ending left me sitting in a dumbfounded state. I think this movie will become a cult favourite, in the tradition of other Tarantino works, and will surely be a fave with fans of the supernatual vampire aspect....I watch the film every now and again, and I find that it is growing on me, although I would still like to have a talk with the writers Robert Kurtzman and Quentin Tarantino.

The movie is basically a western and it has inspired moments but the story is never really fully realized. James Woods plays the leader of a group of vampire slayers and Daniel Baldwin is his partner. They work for the Vatican and I really thought this part was interesting but it was never explored for more than one key scene. Thomas Ian Griffith plays Valek, the vampire master. He has very little dialogue, but manages to convey a menacing screen presence. Sheryl Lee is very sexy in the film eve though most of her scenes involve her having convulsions. The screenplay could have used some more work to tighten up the Vatican\/Vampire connection. John Carpenter scored this movie and his music was quite effective. It's good to see Carpenter having fun and confidence. I enjoyed Halloween night with one of horror's masters.
