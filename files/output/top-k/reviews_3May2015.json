That time being 1996, and the movie in question...From Dusk Till Dawn.I know I already talked about this movie during Halloween last year, but....I thought it would be an awesome idea to talk about this movie in full, of course everybody I know has seen this movie so I am not going to go over the whole plot, but I am going to go over why I think this movie is awesome. For starters, this is how I think a vampire movie should be, it is scary and intense but also exotic and intriguing! It's become one of my personal favorites, so much so I am becoming obsessed with it - i'm even starting to dream about it, you could say that in my dreams I am a regular at the Titty Twister, no i'm not a vampire yet, but I feel I might become one very soon. I even have a fan-made Grimm Wesen based on the vampires in this movie! I love how this movie is different than your typical run-of-the-mill horror flick, it starts off as a typical Tarantino-esque crime caper only for it to become a kickass horror movie in the second half! It took me by surprise! Kudos to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino for their teamwork here.This movie is one no horror fan should be without, as it is an absolute must for horror movie fans, vampire movies, and badass movies in general. It's movies like this and Bram Stoker's Dracula that make me wish i was a vampire myself, I just have a thing for bloodthirsty monster types and monster-girls. It's also movies like this and Sleepy Hollow that make me wish I was the one being bitten or kissed like that. The same goes for Bram Stoker's Dracula, and you can't fault me for the latter because the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow is Christopher Walken and when Walken is on screen you don't question anything and just let Walken do the rest! Also you cannot fault me for wanting to get bitten by Santanico Pandemonium because Salma Hayek is a goddess, and i'd gladly surrender to her and be her willing slave anytime. Hey! It was that sexy dance that did it for me.That sexy dance scene.... by the way is...still impressive even to this day, even more impressive considering Salma Hayek is afraid of snakes and had to be hypnotized in order to overcome her fear. I'd let her bite me anyday! I'd let her bite me anyday! And you can quote me on that! There's so many characters in this movie to love, including the Gecko brothers, the Fullers, Sheriff Earl, Frost, Razor Charlie but I think my personal favorite is this guy here. Sex Machine. This man is one badass mamajamma. Just look at him. How many people do you know that have a crotch-gun? No one.This guy is AWESOME! I wanna hang out with him! One of the best scenes and also one of the funniest moments comes in the scene where we see Sex Machine transforming bit by bit into a vampire, it just cracks me up - especially when he covers his mouth after his fangs start forming, and his right hand changes to become all monster-like with long claw-like fingernails and then his left hand changes and then he hides his hands behind his back. And he's completely unaware of it at first as is everyone else. It's got my two favorite kind of TFs (transformations) in them - the 'Bit By Bit' variety where a person changes one part at a time, and the 'Completely Unaware He\/She is Transforming' kind where the transformee doesn't realize he\/she is transforming. It's no wonder Aardman paid tribute to this scene in Curse Of The Wererabbit.What moment moved me to tears? I'll tell ya.It has to be when Richie dies, I know he's a psychopath - but that moment made me cry a little. *sobs* Richie's gone? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Oh well, he'll come back.. but here's the slight hiccup, he won't be human anymore and he'll probably be after your blood, Seth - just a head's up.As for the funniest moment? Like I mentioned earlier, it was the scene with Sex Machine transforming into a vampire, oh and Frost's reaction to being bitten by him as well, funny as hell and one of my personal favorite scenes. (Frost He f***in' bit me! F****' BIT ME) That scene cracked me up to no end! It is a pretty awesome movie and it is also incredibly badass, especially with the action and crime elements, the vamps are very intimidating and also intriguing. Not to mention the ever alluring Salma Hayek as the vampiress Santanico Pandemonium, who...is in fact quite hypnotic. I'll admit that the vampire with the snapping mouth on her stomach is a bit much, but why quibble? Fun fact The color of the vampires blood is green because the MPAA has issues with it being red, they have absolutely no problem with blood - but they don't like it because it's red. It was indeed Tarantino's idea to give the vampires green blood to avoid the film from getting a rating higher than R and to get it past the censors.

If that describes your state of mind then yeah... no this might not work for you.This would be more like if Peewee Herman and Citizen Kane had an illegitimate child who got shipwrecked on Gilligan's Island with maybe a visit from Jim Morrison from Oliver Stone's The Doors. Sound bizarre? Perfect, because that's what you'll get. The Royal Tenenbaums does require a bit more work and patience than your usual flick. Not necessarily like a Godard film which requires the audience's work equivalent of sweeping up a 12-mile stretch of Interstate 95, but this movie definitely demands a few mental gymnastics.It is the humorous, satirical story of a 20th century New York City elite family. The narrative is told in vivid, fast-moving, short vignettes which, if you're not paying attention, could easily slip past you unappreciated. In that regard, it reminded me a lot of the film Amélie, also released in 2001, by our French friends on the other side of the Atlantic. While, to me, not quite as memorable and iconic as Amélie, this movie delivered a similar visual oddness (saturated colors with a nostalgic tint) and tongue-in-cheek humor (not quite Airplane! surreal but in that direction) that, from the first scene, sets it apart from your standard Hollywood fare.As with many Wes Anderson films, this movie is absolutely carried by an all-star cast of filmmakers' favorite actors. And by filmmakers' favorite I'm referring to actors who may not always grace the covers of People Magazine, E! and whatever star-du-jour the paparazzi are stalking, but these are solid, talented actors with die-hard cult followings. Each actor plays an absurdly extreme caricature of a particular personality type, and the meeting of all these weirdos is like a symphony of deadpan desperation. Don't expect laugh-out-loud hilarity, but it's definitely wacky enough to get a few chortles out.Plot Well don't really expect a traditional plot-driven movie or you'll certainly be disappointed. The story is set up in the first 10 minutes (about a dysfunctional elite family whose father abandons them and suddenly reappears to re-take his place 20 years later), but from there it hops from episode to episode, quickly, quirkily and almost haphazardly. And that's the work I referred to earlier. I have to admit there were several times when I got mildly annoyed, thinking Well that was totally random or That scene didn't really add anything, but I think that's the point. Rather than tell a neat, tidy, Brady Bunch tale with a structured setup\/conflict\/climax\/denouement, Anderson gives us something more reminiscent of a J.D. Salinger book, and I'm not talking about Catcher in the Rye but instead one of his more obscure family-centered stories like Franny & Zooey or Raise High the Roofbeams where, if someone asked you what it's about, you'd either spend 30 mins babbling like an idiot or just act like a pretentious snob and say You just have to read it *puff puff* (that was the sound of you puffing on your Boccetta smoking pipe)Ultimately, The Royal Tenenbaums is a comedy for people who take their films seriously.

So far Ghost Protocol is my favorite in the series, though it could get passed by Rogue Nation this summer. Still, this first installment is much better than 2 and 3, though they both fixed a couple of things that were wrong with the first film. Despite having the least action of the four, the movie is still predominantly action driven.

The confusion comes mostly from a number of technicalities that are hard to keep track of and are kind of vital in order to understand the story. It is possible to follow everything, but it takes so much concentration that it's likely to detract from the overall experience. But, as I said, it's action driven, so all you really need to know is that it's Ethan Hunt and company against everyone else and a couple of shifty allies. The area that the screenwriters could have improved in the most was the character interaction. We see that Ethan feels betrayed at various times by Kitteredge, Jim, and Claire, but the technicalities of the plot and slightly lacking character writing gets in the way. That's not to say that they did a terrible job writing the characters, but it just could have been better.Though it's considered an action film, the quantity of action is more fitting for a thriller. There are long stretches where we are deprived of any kind of fight scene and there is a lot of dialogue. The action sequences mainly come at the beginning and end. The more exciting scenes in the middle are just sort of tense and might feature some spy gear, such as the iconic scene where Ethan breaks into the IMF to get hold of the NOC list in the ultra high security room. Even almost 20 years later, some of the spy gadgets are still pretty cool like Jack's gum and the video glasses. There are no true fight scenes like in the subsequent three films (but that saves us from the annoying amount of slow motion used in MI2).The acting is fair, with Tom Cruise giving the best performance. I thought Luther was played pretty well, though Jim and Claire both could have stepped it up a notch. Kitteredge felt rather clichéd, like a cross between an overly official Bourne antagonist and a threatening Bond villain. Since I viewed it long after it's release, I can't say whether the technical execution is good or bad, but it feels satisfactory given the technology at that time.It's not as good as the Bourne films or the Daniel Craig 007 installments, but might be appealing to fans of either franchise. Again, it's confusing and has less action than you would anticipate, which are both things for prospective viewers to be conscious of. I've heard that it isn't very true to the old TV shows, but given the thirty year hiatus, that isn't terribly surprising. However, the old theme is modernized well and from what I've read, nobody is very intent on comparing the show to the films. So I would probably recommend it to any action fan, especially if you want to get caught up before seeing Rogue Nation in July, but it won't top your lists. Overall Rating 8.1\/10.

Granted, Anatomie was made in 2000 but even more recent German films (and TV shows) always have a 90s feel to them due to various reasons, the most prominent being the typically all-white cast. German films are very 'Disney' in the sense that there seems to be this 'ideal' vision of what Germany looks like or rather, what the German audience looks like but the reality is that times have changed and even Disney is finally updating its thinking. German films need to diversify, stop portraying women as simple stereotypes, and stop promoting smoking in films. I am sick to the back teeth of seeing the main protagonists light up in every single German film I watch. Not just because 'morals' but also because it's distracting. As soon as someone takes that first drag, you know their breath absolutely stinks so if this is happening right before a love scene, it's completely off-putting.Another thing I've noticed is that German films will often have a fascinating premise and will start off strong but will then falter towards the middle, like they don't know how to properly pace a film or write an engaging story from start to finish. I sometimes wish people would send me their scripts for review before selling them to studios! I did feel that the film was very predictable but luckily, Anatomie doesn't try to be a 'true' mystery. The bad guy(s) is revealed fairly early on but there was at least one twist which I didn't figure out until near the end.A special mention for Benno Fürmann; a powerful actor who simply terrifies in every scene. He also worked with Franka Potente in the superb Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000) where he put those tremendous eyes of his to good use too.After the opening and an initial genuinely gruesome and terrifying scene, the horror of which Hostel (2005) later replicated, Anatomie loses momentum and meanders down an irrelevant path instead of focusing on the daily duties of the students at the medical school. That was a huge missed opportunity and like so many other German films I've watched, it felt like a case of 'the audience is invested now, we can switch to auto-pilot'.I only watched this a few hours ago and already, I can't remember the ending. There was another ending during the credits so maybe that's interfering.

As soon as someone takes that first drag, you know their breath absolutely stinks so if this is happening right before a love scene, it's completely off-putting.Another thing I've noticed is that German films will often have a fascinating premise and will start off strong but will then falter towards the middle, like they don't know how to properly pace a film or write an engaging story from start to finish. I sometimes wish people would send me their scripts for review before selling them to studios! I did feel that the film was very predictable but luckily, Anatomie doesn't try to be a 'true' mystery. The bad guy(s) is revealed fairly early on but there was at least one twist which I didn't figure out until near the end.A special mention for Benno Fürmann; a powerful actor who simply terrifies in every scene. He also worked with Franka Potente in the superb Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000) where he put those tremendous eyes of his to good use too.After the opening and an initial genuinely gruesome and terrifying scene, the horror of which Hostel (2005) later replicated, Anatomie loses momentum and meanders down an irrelevant path instead of focusing on the daily duties of the students at the medical school. That was a huge missed opportunity and like so many other German films I've watched, it felt like a case of 'the audience is invested now, we can switch to auto-pilot'.I only watched this a few hours ago and already, I can't remember the ending. There was another ending during the credits so maybe that's interfering. No, I've got it it was an extremely predictable, although fitting ending.If you have time to kill, this is definitely worth a watch. It will however, be almost instantly forgotten.6\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"3 May 2015","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Anybody who idolizing Alex in someway or other being incapable to put themselves in the position of the raped and crippled writer's family or murdered cat lady is enough to showcase the cruel reality of our world we live in (some message that these cocky reviewers are deciphering out from the movie itself).

The idea that aliens have taken over the world without humans knowing is something that you could do a lot of things with and there are many interesting ideas floating around. One of the best sequences in the book shows that even humans are willing to sell out their own as long as they're rewarded with some money.

Carpenter is clearly having fun with the idea of calling out various types of people and this includes a funny nod towards the end of the picture at Siskel and Ebert.Again, the politics never get to the point where the film is preaching to you and this is a major plus because no one likes to be beaten over the head with a political message.

The 1998 American remake, however, just isn't that.Keep in mind that this is a review from my critic side and not my fan side.The story centers around a giant reptilian monster that was created by nuclear tests in French Polynesia. After attacking a Japanese cargo ship carrying fish in the Pacific Ocean, the creature somehow swims towards New York City of all places to make a nest. Now, it's up to Nick Tatopoulos and his friends to stop the monster.The story as you just read is just a typical monster plot, and the writers try way too hard to make this flick interesting by including realistic science. What do I mean by this? Well, Godzilla is a mutated lizard specifically a marine iguana, but he doesn't look anything like the lizard he originally was. Another example is when the film explains that the monster is asexual which is absolutely absurd because a mutation caused by nuclear bombs does not include being asexual. I know about suspension of disbelief, but there's only so much the audience can believe. If having ridiculous science talk isn't bad enough, Godzilla down-right steals scenes from Jurassic Park that this should have been called Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic Park- Giant Dino.The characters are either bland, hateful, forgettable. The main character is Nick Tatopoulos, played by Matthew Broderick, who is the clichéd boring, dorky, socially awkward scientist who never are good main leads. I understand that Emmerich wants to make heroes from normal people, but they have to be interesting and\/or likable. Tatopoulos is not likable. In fact, I don't know a thing about him. He's a bore, but what's worse than a boring character? A hateful character. The romantic interest Audrey Timmonds, played by Maria Pitillo, is a despicable, selfish character who I wanted Godzilla to eat so badly. Here an example on how she's hateful She is talking to her New York stereotypical friend about her relationship with Nick, and her friend asks her how long they dated. Audrey said about 3 or 4 years, and this is what her friend said, Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry you. Then, Audrey says, That's the thing. He did. There's nothing more we learn about their relationship expect that they get back together in the end. So, she wanted him to ask her but declined when he did. Why should I care about her? Also, she steals top secret information from Nick's tent when she knows she's not supposed to, and it was for her career as a news reporter. Additionally, after putting the information on the news, we see her crying while watching the news, but she's not crying because of what she did- we know this because we see her give a horribly acted and soulless apology to Nick prior- but because her report was stolen by her boss. What a selfish broad. The other characters aren't all that memorable outside the fact that they're just New York or French stereotypes giving us some tasteless stereotypical dialogue and jokes.Despite the poorly written characters, the actors do a decent job playing them. There's just nothing else to say about the acting. They did what they could and did okay.That is expect for Maria Pitillo who was just awful.The special effects when looked at a modern aspect are bad, but in the context of 1998, they're from okay especially when you compare the effects of Godzilla to the film that it strongly plagiarizes, Jurassic Park. One scene from Godzilla that might have looked good in '98 but looks really bad today is the footstep scene shown in all of the trailers and commercials where Godzilla's foot slams down and raises back up. However, some effects still look really good which include any particle effects, and, my favorite shot, when Godzilla jumps over the bridge to dive into the Hudson River. That shot still looks really impressive.Now, let's talk about the monster Godzilla. I will not be judging this creature to the original, but instead on how he stands on his own which is pathetic. One of the main problems with him is that he's not scary or endearing. If you're going to do a monster film, you have to do one or the other, and this monster fails trying to do either one. He's not enduring because you don't see any reason why we the audience should care about him, and he's not scary because not only does he not look scary, he's a coward and a wimp. The only reason he stays alive as much as he does in the film is because the military sucks at hitting him. Additionally, we never see him showing why he's a force to be reckoned with. He's constantly running away. Bottom line, this is one of the worst monsters put on film.Overall, Godzilla is a bad film, but there are a few good things in it. Outside of the monster and Audrey, nothing in the film can be heavily criticized or hated for. This is one of those movies where if you turn off your brain and just put it on to kill some time, this film would be fine to put on, or if you want to watch a movie but don't care what it is, Godzilla would be alright to watch. Now, I can't hate on this film too much because there is a good or even great monster film in here but just not fully realized, and The Word to Sum It best explains it best.The Word to Sum It stale. This flick feels that everything was rushed and not fleshed out.IMDb Rating 4\/10 Personal Rating 2\/5 Rotten Tomatoes Rating 2.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1954, the film Gojira was released and became an instant classic spawning numerous sequels some of which became classics too.

Another example is when the film explains that the monster is asexual which is absolutely absurd because a mutation caused by nuclear bombs does not include being asexual. I know about suspension of disbelief, but there's only so much the audience can believe. If having ridiculous science talk isn't bad enough, Godzilla down-right steals scenes from Jurassic Park that this should have been called Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic Park- Giant Dino.The characters are either bland, hateful, forgettable. The main character is Nick Tatopoulos, played by Matthew Broderick, who is the clichéd boring, dorky, socially awkward scientist who never are good main leads. I understand that Emmerich wants to make heroes from normal people, but they have to be interesting and\/or likable. Tatopoulos is not likable. In fact, I don't know a thing about him. He's a bore, but what's worse than a boring character? A hateful character. The romantic interest Audrey Timmonds, played by Maria Pitillo, is a despicable, selfish character who I wanted Godzilla to eat so badly. Here an example on how she's hateful She is talking to her New York stereotypical friend about her relationship with Nick, and her friend asks her how long they dated. Audrey said about 3 or 4 years, and this is what her friend said, Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry you. Then, Audrey says, That's the thing. He did. There's nothing more we learn about their relationship expect that they get back together in the end. So, she wanted him to ask her but declined when he did. Why should I care about her? Also, she steals top secret information from Nick's tent when she knows she's not supposed to, and it was for her career as a news reporter. Additionally, after putting the information on the news, we see her crying while watching the news, but she's not crying because of what she did- we know this because we see her give a horribly acted and soulless apology to Nick prior- but because her report was stolen by her boss. What a selfish broad. The other characters aren't all that memorable outside the fact that they're just New York or French stereotypes giving us some tasteless stereotypical dialogue and jokes.Despite the poorly written characters, the actors do a decent job playing them. There's just nothing else to say about the acting. They did what they could and did okay.That is expect for Maria Pitillo who was just awful.The special effects when looked at a modern aspect are bad, but in the context of 1998, they're from okay especially when you compare the effects of Godzilla to the film that it strongly plagiarizes, Jurassic Park. One scene from Godzilla that might have looked good in '98 but looks really bad today is the footstep scene shown in all of the trailers and commercials where Godzilla's foot slams down and raises back up. However, some effects still look really good which include any particle effects, and, my favorite shot, when Godzilla jumps over the bridge to dive into the Hudson River. That shot still looks really impressive.Now, let's talk about the monster Godzilla. I will not be judging this creature to the original, but instead on how he stands on his own which is pathetic. One of the main problems with him is that he's not scary or endearing. If you're going to do a monster film, you have to do one or the other, and this monster fails trying to do either one. He's not enduring because you don't see any reason why we the audience should care about him, and he's not scary because not only does he not look scary, he's a coward and a wimp. The only reason he stays alive as much as he does in the film is because the military sucks at hitting him. Additionally, we never see him showing why he's a force to be reckoned with. He's constantly running away. Bottom line, this is one of the worst monsters put on film.Overall, Godzilla is a bad film, but there are a few good things in it. Outside of the monster and Audrey, nothing in the film can be heavily criticized or hated for. This is one of those movies where if you turn off your brain and just put it on to kill some time, this film would be fine to put on, or if you want to watch a movie but don't care what it is, Godzilla would be alright to watch. Now, I can't hate on this film too much because there is a good or even great monster film in here but just not fully realized, and The Word to Sum It best explains it best.The Word to Sum It stale.

It's a shame that performance is stuck in such an unremarkable movie. This is a slow, plodding, grim and quite dull movie. Hunter creates a compelling character but the movie really has very little else going for it. The whole thing is rather pretentious. This is a tough movie to get through.The story unfolds in the mid-19th century. Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute Scotswoman who has been sold into an arranged marriage to a New Zealander, Alisdair Stewart. So after a long journey Ada comes ashore in New Zealand. She brings two very important things with her. Her young daughter, Flora. And her piano. Playing the piano is the way this woman who cannot speak expresses herself. She pours her heart into her piano playing. So suffice to say her relationship with Alisdair gets off to quite a rocky start when he decides he can't be bothered transporting the piano to his home and leaves it to rot on the beach. This is not going to be a happy marriage.Alisdair ends up selling the piano, which mind you isn't even his, to his neighbor George Baines. Ada is of course enraged. Further enraged when Alisdair orders her to give George piano lessons. George is a very simple man. He can't read. He has adopted many of the local Maori customs, including tattooing his face. Why does this crude man want to learn how to play the piano? Well he doesn't. He wants Ada. He just wants to watch her play. They come to an arrangement where she can earn her piano back by letting him do things while she plays. And the things George wants to do are not at all innocent. Maybe he'll start by just looking up her skirt. But before long they're naked and in bed. Well, what's a girl to do when she wants her piano back, right? Anyhow, this whole arrangement goes badly because George actually has affection for Ada but she's just using him to get her precious piano. And of course there is the small matter of Ada's marriage to Alisdair. That loveless marriage, with its complete lack of affection, greatly frustrates Alisdair. That frustration will manifest itself in rather terrible ways.This all seems like it could make for an interesting story but for whatever reason the movie just doesn't work. It is not entertaining at all. The whole thing is so bleak, perfectly matching its backwater setting. Hunter does so well to convey so much emotion without even speaking. You always know exactly what Ada is thinking, great credit to Hunter for being able to convey that. The role of Ada's young daughter turns out to be a critical one and Anna Paquin does well with it. Flora is an intelligent, mischievous little schemer and Paquin's performance is very good, very mature. An Academy Award was probably a bit much though. Whereas Hunter and Paquin shine the men in the picture don't come off nearly as well. Admittedly they're not helped by a script which gives them some rather clunky, awkward dialogue. Harvey Keitel plays George and never really seems comfortable in the role. Meanwhile Sam Neill's portrayal of Alisdair falls hopelessly flat. This is a movie largely about passion but it comes across as almost entirely passionless. It's a movie that is badly out of tune.

These performances are worth the price of a ticket alone. Stallone is great at showing his own inner conflict about trying to experience caring and affection for Gloria and especially doreen. When he wishes to be Stallone can be a good actor; his main failing was always his choice of roles though in his defense he showed his ability in Copland. The scenes between him and doreen go well; yes I know the clichéd mumblings on top of the roof hey, does he look like an intellectual to you? He plays the role perfectly; of course he stammers and repeats slogans this whole side of life is completely alien. He is trying is his own very awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny way to be a good person to Doreen and his family. The fight scenes are well put together and very believable. Cyrus beats him up as he should because this ain't yesterday slick but Carter rises bloodied but not beaten from the floor and finishes Cyrus off in a truly scary and powerful scene the Leone like close up of Stallone's face blood running down it is a really well done piece of work. The movie was never intended to be a frame by frame copy of the original which is good because Hodges picture was no masterpiece poor acting in the backup cast translation problems British to English and a crappy ending. This movie is about an evil person tired of being evil wanting to use his great strength and menacing presence for good to help his estranged brother's family. Yes I know revenge and the whole Christian religion are antithetical well not all of us are Christians. Like Carl Jung I agree that harnessing the shadow part of the personality can produce one of the most powerful forces for good Jung always said most attempts end with the shadow overcoming and destroying the person who let it out but you get my point here Stallone hates what he is for Fletcher; he is not all darkness. What he is doing however violent is his way of showing affection for his family. His scenes with Doreen underscore what I am arguing this is a violent man trying to protect and destroy the enemies that hurt Ritchie and still threaten them. It is a much more complex movie than the 1971 version in which Caine is a cold hearted goon torturing and killing along the path to mindless revenge. Caine gives that Geraldine an overdose not Cyrus in this one; he does this quite viciously leaving her dead on Kinnear's back lawn then calls the cops on him. On the surface they appear quite similar but Stallone's Carter is very different from Caine's Carter. One seeks to destroy and protect by destruction the helpless who are still in danger. The other is a stone cold killer using his brother's death to do what he enjoys most hurting torturing and killing people for entertainment.

It appears to on the surface it is about a man who used violence his whole life to pay the bills working for some scumbag mobster coming back to his dead brother's family and expressing love for them and making up for not being there when they and his brother needed him the most. Yes he goes after and destroys the people who killed his brother; the reason why hangs over the picture everyone from Gloria to Con even Cyrus cannot fathom why does this hulking thug care what happened to Richie?Stallone Rourke and Caine are at the top of their form. Stallone was born to play this role and is far more convincing in it than was Caine in 1971. He radiates danger his scenes with Kinear are great; the understated threat communicated the Stallone way. These performances are worth the price of a ticket alone. Stallone is great at showing his own inner conflict about trying to experience caring and affection for Gloria and especially doreen. When he wishes to be Stallone can be a good actor; his main failing was always his choice of roles though in his defense he showed his ability in Copland. The scenes between him and doreen go well; yes I know the clichéd mumblings on top of the roof hey, does he look like an intellectual to you? He plays the role perfectly; of course he stammers and repeats slogans this whole side of life is completely alien. He is trying is his own very awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny way to be a good person to Doreen and his family. The fight scenes are well put together and very believable. Cyrus beats him up as he should because this ain't yesterday slick but Carter rises bloodied but not beaten from the floor and finishes Cyrus off in a truly scary and powerful scene the Leone like close up of Stallone's face blood running down it is a really well done piece of work. The movie was never intended to be a frame by frame copy of the original which is good because Hodges picture was no masterpiece poor acting in the backup cast translation problems British to English and a crappy ending. This movie is about an evil person tired of being evil wanting to use his great strength and menacing presence for good to help his estranged brother's family. Yes I know revenge and the whole Christian religion are antithetical well not all of us are Christians. Like Carl Jung I agree that harnessing the shadow part of the personality can produce one of the most powerful forces for good Jung always said most attempts end with the shadow overcoming and destroying the person who let it out but you get my point here Stallone hates what he is for Fletcher; he is not all darkness. What he is doing however violent is his way of showing affection for his family. His scenes with Doreen underscore what I am arguing this is a violent man trying to protect and destroy the enemies that hurt Ritchie and still threaten them. It is a much more complex movie than the 1971 version in which Caine is a cold hearted goon torturing and killing along the path to mindless revenge. Caine gives that Geraldine an overdose not Cyrus in this one; he does this quite viciously leaving her dead on Kinnear's back lawn then calls the cops on him. On the surface they appear quite similar but Stallone's Carter is very different from Caine's Carter. One seeks to destroy and protect by destruction the helpless who are still in danger. The other is a stone cold killer using his brother's death to do what he enjoys most hurting torturing and killing people for entertainment. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"}]
