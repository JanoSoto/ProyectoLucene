He is given a choice accept the illusion, or break out of the illusion.You can't really say that the events in the movie are philosophically coherent or satisfying, but on a visceral and emotional level, it gives a tremendous thrill ride.The movie plays like every small boy,s fantasy-a chance to play a god-like being against other all powerful beings. The music adds to this macho, gun-toting, martial art practising fantasy.

Don't be put off by my description of these movies as 'philosophical'-they are entertainment first and foremost.The philosophical theme of this movie is, I suppose, the old chestnut of nature versus nurture.

Or was he a bad seed who would still give forth rotten fruit?

I don't want to get into much more detail than this.I did read a review of this movie in the Halliwell film guide, I think, and was surprised how low it scored. Not sure, but perhaps the reviewer was misguided into thinking this film lightweight when it is so much more than that. Again, Halliwell seemed to give many poor reviews for movies that I would consider masterpieces, especially Australian movies like Mad Max 2 and Bad Boy Bubby.

Then there is the awful feeling you get at certain points when you realise the character of Sergeant Howie (Woodward) is in actual fact a policeman and what might happen if he hadn't been. The Wicker Man is really a mere exercise in suspense on the surface but I think it toys with other, more political ideas during the core of the film before substituting everything and just focussing very briefly on the religious aspects it raises.For Sergeant Howie, he is bordering on the ultimate fish-out-of-water. Howie may be British and may well still be in Britain but that does not exclude him from the fish-out-of-water treatment that other film characters get when they are in that respective situation (see Doyle in 'French Connection II' and Neo in 'The Matrix' among many other examples). Howie is a man of pride; a man with ideas, discipline and rules and regulations he likes to stand by. He is a thorough man and this is partly his downfall since it is this case that is so difficult, it sees him assigned to it. Howie is on a remote Scottish isle investigating a disappearance of a young girl but while remaining within the boundaries of his own world; his own language and even his own country, Howie will find the going difficult and complicated due to several unsuspecting and eerie things.Firstly, the location of the island is important because it obviously resembles a sort of detachment from the mainland or indeed the rest of the world. There is special care taken to tell the audience as well as Howie that the mainland is a good week or so away by boat. So within this isolated utopia for the locals develops a sub-culture, a world in which people are people but methods of teaching, governing and religion are very different. This can be read into as some sort of political statement by the writer of the film &#150; perhaps he is bringing to attention the level of policing in Britain for the time? There is no suspicion from Howie at all in the film but I noticed very quickly there was no police station nor was there any feeling that rules were apparent. The whole island was governed by a mysterious, never seen man and look at what situation the island locals were in, in terms of mentality.So if this island is a society without law and order; without a stone wall ruling on the most basic humane regulations, is the writer trying to bring to our attention the dangers of lack of authority in our own country? But The Wicker Man is not entirely an ambiguous text revolving around statements on our own world and society. It is a chilling and haunting horror film that predominantly falls into the 'Gothic' typecast due to its minute details on screen. There is a distinct ritualistic tone to the film and it is one that is fetishised. Several years earlier, Christopher Lee himself starred in the highly fetishised 'Dracula'. Here, shots of naked people sitting on grave stones and people having sex in graveyards, maybe to merely gross the 1973 audience out or to just make us aware that this is indeed going to be different, are included and add an ever present layer of disturbance but also one of ambiguity &#150; why is it that people here do these things? To combine sex with a place of death can be linked with the film's overall theme. The man in the scene around the maypole sings a song about evolution and reproduction and generally about a certain circle of life. From here, it is only obvious that the act of reproduction (sex) to produce new life would take place in a location in which you bury the dead. Life goes on, it seems.Then there is that extra evidence to suggest this is one of the great Gothic horrors. How may of the cast are actually playing themselves? There are the people in the public house and the elderly folk by the harbour. This gives off its own air of disturbance in the sense they might be playing themselves and what with the commentary on society as a whole, the two seem to bind together all the too nicely. Then there is the attention to faces early on. The chocolates in the baker's window have faces on them and the close up of the pub sign has a face on it. There is also the excessive wearing of masks later on as identity is toyed and revealed but generally kept ambiguous. Is this the future of the society circa 1973? Do we know what we believe in terms of religion? And where we are going in the future? What about the schools and the policing? Will this be the sad reality of a nation gone mad if these things are cut back on? I think these are the sorts of questions the writers are raising by making a film like this and it must've been all the more disturbing in 1973.So if The Wicker Man succeeds as a statement then it certainly succeeds as a piece of Gothic horror. It mixes in the uncanny with the surreal and it carries a distinct atmosphere of dread all throughout. There is ambiguity all over the place but I especially liked the attention to the film's music is it diegetic or not? Sometimes it is and others it isn't but it's such a head-trip of a soundtrack that it's difficult to notice most of the time. This surely one of the better British films ever made.

This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.

This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 June 2008","score":"","review":" While the majority of biopics focus on personalities who were the best and\/or the most popular in what they did, Ed Wood tells the story of the man who is considered today as the worst filmmaker of all time. It must be said right away that the life of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is far more interesting and fascinating than those of many other popular Hollywood legends and this movie shows why.For starters, Wood was a filmmaker who defined himself as a writer-director-actor-producer, much like his idol Orson Welles. However, unlike Welles, Wood didn't have any magic touch, he never showed any visible talent in his movies, should it be his own or those of his faithful associates.Ed Wood is played here by Johnny Depp, in what might probably be his best dramatic performance ever. Wood is portrayed here as a fiery film buff who is well decided to leave his mark in Hollywood. His main characteristic is his unequaled optimistic attitude and this attitude pushes him to go forward, even in front of the most insuperable problems. He is always able to find a ray of sunshine inside the most devastating reviews. But in a movie like Ed Wood, the hardest thing to do would be to find some negative in such a genius and entertaining film.Ed Wood is directed by Tim Burton, probably the most weirdo of all mainstream Hollywood directors and the most capable of presenting the life of Wood and his motley crew of misfit collaborators in the most adequate way possible. Besides Wood, we can find the veteran star of Dracula Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), drag queen Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), the amazing Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (real-life wrestler George Steele) and TV show host Vampira (Lisa Marie).The actors are fantastic in the sense that they are able of recreating such bad acting roles with that much conviction. Once Burton's camera starts rolling, we can see their real talent in front of us, but when Wood's camera starts rolling, they become pathetic, unconvincing and they deliver the Wood-written lines without even realizing their absurdity.The movie is shot in black-and-white, which is frankly the only logical option for this kind of motion picture. Honestly, how could we imagine in color those sets that we can only see in black-and-white? How could we possibly imagine Plan 9 From Outer Space in color? The recreation of Wood's turkeys is simply perfect. The story is set in the 1950s, the era where Wood directed his worst projects Glen or Glenda?, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9.The 1950s, it must be said, represent the golden era of the Z-movies in Hollywood. Although there have been many classics, like A Streetcar Named Desire, High Noon and Ben-Hur, this era is much remembered for those horror and science fiction flicks interested in the atomic age and monsters derived from it. Besides Wood's masterpieces, we can also mention The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, It Came From Beneath the Sea and the Japanese opus Gojira.The 1950s is also an era where the studio system still prevails and the directors are always at the mercy of the producers who are the supreme authority and they own a veto over every aspect of the movies. And it can even go well outside of the movie. For example, in the Bride of the Monster making, Wood is forced to modify his cast and even his ending in order to meet the requirements of his main financier. And for Plan 9, he must go under baptism (and so must his friends), so a group of Baptists will finance the picture. This adds even more to the incredible, as if the movies were not enough.Even if Ed Wood contains numerous scenes showing the stupidity and the lack of talent of the protagonists, there's still some fair level of intelligence emerging from the picture and some goofy statements suddenly become full of sense. For example, Bela Lugosi, even if he's been addicted to morphine for twenty years and lost nearly every bit of his talent since he made Dracula, is able to deliver some interesting utterances, such as why the Dracula character is more interesting than the Frankenstein character and why women should love the classic 1930s horror movies from Universal.The actors from the movie are all tremendous, but two of them clearly stand above the others. Johnny Depp plays his Ed Wood role in an immaculate way. He knows how to write a script, how to shoot a picture and he's able to detect some qualities in people that very few would be able to see. That's why he casts Loretta King (Juliet Landau) just by watching her commanding in a restaurant.Depp also seems to be very comfortable when comes the time of wearing women's clothing, just like Wood did in real life as a transvestite.In the case of Martin Landau, the scale of his (Oscar-winning) performance is difficult to surround. Simply said, he is better as Lugosi than Lugosi himself was. His Hungarian accent is perfectly convincing and he delivers very interesting quotes (This is the most uncomfortable coffin I've ever been in). His relationship with Wood is touching and extraordinary. Lugosi finally meets someone who still believes in him and who is able to find him some new work.Ed Wood is without a doubt the greatest Tim Burton movie for the moment. The Ed Wood story couldn't have been directed by anybody else than him. Instead of ridiculing Wood, which would have been too much easy and far less interesting, Burton seems to celebrate him and making him a symbol for those who idolize movies and absolutely want to leave their mark in Hollywood, whatever the result be good or not. Ed Wood is the ultimate proof that cinema is far more than a job and an art. It's mysticism.

I, however, would disagree whole heartedly with that accusation. I would almost put Episode II on par with Episode III for best of the prequels. It's not nearly as good as the classic originals, but it's still got enough plot and character development to keep the audience interested. It definitely did what Episode I failed to do in terms of plot and character development. First off, let me get some of the common complaints about this movie out of the way right away. A lot of people complain about the amount of romance in this movie. Yeah, yeah, I know, George Lucas is not a very good romance director, at all. But the romance that's in this film is here for a reason. George wanted to show the developing relationship between Anakin and Padme in a way that would make the events of the next film even more tragic. So, in a sense this is the most romantic of the Star Wars movies and the romance is actually more necessary here than it was in The Empire Strikes Back. I think the reason why so many fans were offended by this kind of romance is because it was something that hadn't been done in a Star Wars film before. But is that a bad thing? Is it so wrong for George Lucas to expand his universe a bit by trying new things? Not everything has to be the same as the originals. Now, all that being said, the romance aspect wasn't perfect. A few moments are almost cringe-worthy, but it also had some moments that were really affective and I really did feel attached to these two people by the time they get married at the end of the film. The next thing that people complain about is Hayden Christianson's acting. People, it's a Star Wars movie. The last thing I'm looking at is the acting when I watch these movies. Remember how horrible and whiny Mark Hammill was in the original (But I wanted to go to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters! Waaaaaah!) Yeah, I bet you forgot about that because you paying attention to the story and characters too much to notice. Sure there are better choices to play Anakin and I'm not saying that Hayden is the best choice for Anakin, but he's certainly not the worst. In reality, no one's a good actor in Star Wars. Even good actors aren't good actors in Star Wars. In fact Hayden's a decent actor in most of his other work, it's just that this is Star Wars and the focus is not on the acting. Anyways, with those things out of the way, I will say that Episode II's plot isn't perfect. Sometimes it just gets a bit too, well, boring. But the fact remains that George really stepped up the character development on this one just like he did in Episode V and it really shows through. People and things are starting to shift in a big way here and there's enough mystery to keep audiences interested to want to see a third movie where they basically already know what's going to happen. Going back and making movies about something that already happened is a huge undertaking for anyone and I feel that story-wise this one got it right the most due to major continuity flaws in the third movie and the lack of progression in the first. There's also enough eye candy here to keep the casual film-goer interested, such as a lightsaber battle with Yoda and an epic clone war battle at the end of the movie. When Obi-Wan briefly mentioned the clone wars at the beginning of Episode IV no one imagined it was going to be this cool. Seeing that battle is reason alone to see this movie. Ultimately though, Episode II is a Star Wars movie for Star Wars fans and I think that's why a lot of casual viewers couldn't appreciate it. It's not perfect, but it's far from being bad.

Remember how horrible and whiny Mark Hammill was in the original (But I wanted to go to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters! Waaaaaah!) Yeah, I bet you forgot about that because you paying attention to the story and characters too much to notice. Sure there are better choices to play Anakin and I'm not saying that Hayden is the best choice for Anakin, but he's certainly not the worst. In reality, no one's a good actor in Star Wars. Even good actors aren't good actors in Star Wars. In fact Hayden's a decent actor in most of his other work, it's just that this is Star Wars and the focus is not on the acting. Anyways, with those things out of the way, I will say that Episode II's plot isn't perfect. Sometimes it just gets a bit too, well, boring. But the fact remains that George really stepped up the character development on this one just like he did in Episode V and it really shows through. People and things are starting to shift in a big way here and there's enough mystery to keep audiences interested to want to see a third movie where they basically already know what's going to happen. Going back and making movies about something that already happened is a huge undertaking for anyone and I feel that story-wise this one got it right the most due to major continuity flaws in the third movie and the lack of progression in the first. There's also enough eye candy here to keep the casual film-goer interested, such as a lightsaber battle with Yoda and an epic clone war battle at the end of the movie. When Obi-Wan briefly mentioned the clone wars at the beginning of Episode IV no one imagined it was going to be this cool. Seeing that battle is reason alone to see this movie. Ultimately though, Episode II is a Star Wars movie for Star Wars fans and I think that's why a lot of casual viewers couldn't appreciate it. It's not perfect, but it's far from being bad.

Little Shuisheng finds himself landed with the thankless task of being personal servant to the bosses number one girl, Bijou (or Miss to anyone else). He soon learns how unjust the world is when his uncle is murdered by a rival gang and his mistress treats him like dirt.Yimou cleverly manipulates the audience, making us fond of characters whom we turn away from later, and endearing us to others whom we despised early on. The central character, Bijou, is convincingly played by Gong Li. Throughout most of the movie she is quite easy to dislike, and it is only near the end of the film that we are allowed to develop some belated compassion for her. Shuisheng remains a rather naive pawn until ti's all too late, while the real villains who are responsible for creating the monsters they then self-righteously destroy, rear their ugly heads at the very last.

In Australia, this movie is known as Airplane and was a parody of a spate of aeroplane related disaster movies (as in the sequence of Airport movies).Why is this movie so funny? Well, it is four-dimensional comedy. You will only get a fraction of the jokes in this movie, as they come thick and fast from every direction-in the foreground, middle-ground, background, in the audio and the credits. Flying High could be the movie that started end credits featuring jokes.Here's the plot in a nut-shell a former US Air Force fighter pilot, trying to re-establish a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, who is a stewardess on a commercial passenger aeroplane, takes a flight with her which goes from bad to worse. The pilot and co-pilot get sick and the ex fighter pilot who is afraid of flying has too...(I'm not giving away too much here, but that's enough plot).Not sure if this is the first movie by the creators, but they have had subsequent success with this kind of absurd comedy, in movies like The Naked Gun. Perhaps The Kentucky Fried Movie was their first such comedy. All these movies are worth watching, as is the other obscure movie, Top Secret, which has some brilliantly surreal humour.Anyway, if you are a rather literal-minded person, you may not enjoy this movie too much...you'll complain about planes not really being like that, or professional people not really acting like that.This movie is heightened reality. The visual gags are funny & the dialogue is funny too...I still remember the bizarre and somewhat disturbing ex-change between the pilot and a small boy, named Jimmy, invited to view the cock-pit (as children often are in movies)-Pilot Jimmy, have you ever seen a grown man naked?. Hmmmm.Honestly, this is a movie that rewards multiple viewings, to absorb all the jokes you missed the first time around. And, like I say, don't forget to scan the end-credits for more comedy gold.

I can't say how realistic Coogan's portrayal of Wilson was, as I wouldn't know Wilson from a bar of soap. All I can say is that Coogan gives one of the most charismatic performances I've ever seen (some other charismatic performances I'm quite fond of include Orson Welles as Citizen Kane in the movie of that name, Robert de Niro for one scene in the otherwise dull Mean Streets and for a similar reason, Noah Taylor for one scene in He died with a felafel in his hand).Coogan plays Wilson as a rather droll person who wears his university education on his sleeve in his media work as an on-air personality (hosting a music show, amongst other things). If you don't have an Arts degree, you may find Wilson to be a bit of a tosser, but as someone with an Arts degree myself, I did find him hugely entertaining and, dare I say it, quite perceptive in his overly analytical dialogues on all manner of subjects.The movie charts the nature of the music industry from pre-Sex Pistols to around the time of New Order. I'm not a huge fan of the bands covered, but I learned a lot of interesting factoids about them. For fans of bands such as Joy Division etc, I'm sure that this movie will be even more rewarding, for purely music fan related reasons.As Wilson, as played by Coogan, might himself say, the movie has many post-modern conceits. As post-modern cultural artefacts go, you'd have to go back to the mid-18th century (to Henry Fielding's novel Tom Jones) to find one as post-modern as this. In other words, expect to see Wilson in this movie pointing out that he really isn't Tony Wilson, and that the real Tony Wilson has a cameo appearance in the movie as a TV director.

Of course at the time, Eastwood was already a cult figure known for his numerous appearances in dozens of westerns, the most notable of which were the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone. When Frank Sinatra turned down the role due to an old injury, it was then offered to Eastwood, and screen legend (and infamy) was born.Dirty Harry was groundbreaking for its hard violence and fascistic-vigilante approach to law enforcement. This played hard for liberals and anyone concerned with criminal rights (though the argument could be made that criminals have no rights, but this IS America, right?). As a criminal justice major myself, this puts me in an awkward position on the one hand, I want to cheer Harry Callahan for breaking the rules to get positive results, but on the other hand we live in America, and we have a responsibility to show to the rest of the world that we're a civilized country, and we treat everyone (yes, even our criminals) fairly.In Dirty Harry, a sniper, dubbed Scorpio (Andy Robinson), is terrorizing the Bay area, shooting innocent civilians at random until the city hands him over $200,000. The rule-breaking Dirty Harry Callahan is put on the case, partnered with Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni), to track down the elusive Scorpio Killer, who was based on the real-life Zodiac Killer (and who was terrorizing the city at the same time the movie was being filmed and was never captured). But political red-tape and suspects'-rights force Harry to earn his namesake, and go beyond the law to capture a dangerous psychopath.Eastwood's close friend and directorial mentor, director Don Siegel, working from a screenplay by Harry Julian Fink & R.M. Fink and Dean Riesner, made excellent use of the San Francisco city-scape to depict a world that was not only on the brink and rife with violent crime and debauchery, but gives the audience a real reason to shun suspects'-rights (the then-recent Miranda case, coercive interrogation techniques, denial of right-to-legal-counsel) and get justice by any means necessary. So you get why Dirty Harry, which was released during a time of great change in Hollywood, when filmmakers were taking a stab (no pun intended) at left-wing Hollywood morality and was telling the liberal politics to take a hike, was so revolutionary.

If you want to see a relatively new movie that delivers on many levels, Vanilla Sky is a leading candidate. I will spare the details of the plot, but will give you a primer on how to appreciate this fine work of art to enhance your movie-watching experience. To begin, the allusion to impressionistic art is not a coincidence. The art of impressionism embodies a whole set of socio-historical ideas that add depth to the movie. The beautiful Monet-like skies represents a disillusion with realism and an erasure of memory, evident in the visual display of distortion and haziness in many impressionist paintings. The scene in which these impressionistic skies appear reveal the emotional torment of the past as well as the desire to distort or rewrite it. This makes the main character's initial starting point as a wealthy playboy instead of a pauper essential in framing the movie's plot twist. In addition to its crafty and artistic themes, the movie has a strong soundtrack that is both enjoyable and fun, but very appropriate for the scenes. Despite the lack of dynamic characters in this movie, with the main character being the only one although he too is rather static, the movie delivers a revelation that can only be appreciated with more than one viewing. It is through this second or third viewing that you pinpoint the scenes in which the main character has revelations about the nature of his reality and realizes whether or not he is dreaming. Through these scenes do you see his transformation. Simultaneously, through these scenes do you as the audience vicariously experience this change. This movie is not about character development, it is about audience awareness of reality and fantasy. Will you be able to tell if a painting is impressionistic or a realistic landscape painting from afar? Probably not. Will you be able to discern a real scene from a dream in this movie without well-marked cues? It's unlikely. It is through careful analysis will one be able to determine the true nature of the scene, real or fantasy, and the depth of the audience's understanding alone will add depth (and appreciation) to this masterpiece. These visual cues will be revealed within the movie, but you will realize that your ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not is the driving force of the movie apart from the beautiful imagery and iconography. The Great Gatsby was not considered to be a Great American Novel immediately after its release. It took a decade for the novel to be rediscovered and then catapulted into its deserving place today as an icon of American literature. I make no qualms about my desire to have this movie also be catapulted into its place among the greatest movies of all time as well.

If he were of any other nationality or generation he'd be subject to a veritable tome of critical analysis; with amazing films like Elgar (1962), The Debussy Film (1965), Women in Love (1969), The Devils (1971) and Savage Messiah (1972) all standing out as some of the most radical, imaginative and visually impressive feature films of the last fifty years. Too often his excesses got the better of him, as in films such as Lisztomania (1975), The Lair of the White Worm (1987) and Salome's Last Dance (1988), but despite the overall quality of those films, the results were always interesting and visually unforgettable. Gothic (1986) has much in common with the latter collection of works, being somewhat messy and decadent whilst still trying to remain somewhat conventional in its approach to character and narrative. It is this aspect of the film that is the weakest, with the story and the characterisation often feeling somewhat weak or unformed, particularly in the first half. However, once the film gets going - and the wild images and hallucinations begin to accumulate - Russell's energetic style and talent for creating outré and unforgettable visual compositions and ideas really begins to take off; creating a film that is fascinating and open to deeper interpretations regarding the character of Mary Shelley and the unfortunate circumstances of her life that may have led to the creation of her classic and iconic horror story, Frankenstein.Naturally, the roots of the film are based in fact, taking place in June of 1816 - the year without summer - when the five central characters met at Lord Byron's Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva. From here, the film creates a fictional back-story to the wet and windy night that would give birth, not only to Shelley's Frankenstein, but also Polidori's celebrated novel, The Vampyre. What follows is a bizarre and overwhelming example of pure visual storytelling, which is all the more impressive when you take into account the obviously limited budget. However, if you can overcome this aspect - as well as the rather poor performances from Julian Sands as the exaggerated Percy Shelley and Myriam Cyr as Mary's half-sister Claire Clairmont - then the film will reward with a truly astounding final act filled with Russell's typically surreal and lurid imagery, an escalating sense of fever-dream-like horror and exaggeration and the three fine performances from Gabriel Byrne as the seductive Lord Byron, Natasha Richardson as the tortured Mary Shelly and Timothy Spall as the beleaguered Dr. John William Polidori. The tension is also heightened by the choice of location, with the film taking place almost entirely within the Byron estate, and almost entirely at night; although there are two separate framing devises, one of which takes place in the present-day and helps clarify some of the scenarios depicted in the film's aforementioned final act.These don't necessarily add much to the story - though neither do they detract - simply giving a certain sense of context before Russell gets on with the mind-blowing imagery and finely tuned atmosphere of eroticised dread. Some have likened the film to Dario Argento's classic supernatural thriller Suspiria (1977), with the use of Gothic locations, bold colours and a self-consciously visual approach to storytelling. These similarities stand, though you can also see the film as an extension of the earlier Altered States (1980) and Crimes of Passion (1984); both in certain thematic preoccupations, and in the actual visual presentation overall. The film works simply because of the intensity of the images, but ultimately going deeper than even that; tying the whole thing into the character of Mary Shelley and her own sense of personal tragedy. It gives the film that much needed emotional quality, helped along by the fine performance from the incredibly young Richardson in one of her first leading roles. She's complimented well by Byrne, who takes the role of Byron entirely seriously, even when spouting some incredibly pretentious dialog and attempting to seduce every character in the film. Nonetheless, the intensity of the role shines through and really establishes the character, with his fears and weaknesses going towards the creation of his own personal nightmare that will reverberate through time.The film suggests that by raising the spirits of the dead you fate yourself to an inescapable evil. This is reflected by the tragic circumstances that surrounded the characters - hinted at in that tour-de-force final - and their eventual fate as documented by history itself. It's very clever once you get past the awkward, slightly giddy and anachronistic-like feeling of the first few scenes and really get into the horror aspect and the more much rewarding sense of human interest. Naturally, it won't be to all tastes, as the factors that Russell tends to highlight in his work - religious symbolism, garishness, sex and sensuality, brutality and anachronistic humour - will obviously cause problems for viewers looking for a more conventional horror story. I liked the break in convention, though. After all, there are plenty of horror films that regurgitate the same old stock tactics and scenarios. Gothic goes for a different approach; one that is more eccentric, single-minded and unique, layering the fact and fantasy elements of Stephen Volk's imaginative screenplay with a lurid and sensational approach to the visual telling of the story, rife with his usual themes and obsessions. If you love Russell's work, and appreciate interesting and unconventional cinema, then Gothic is well worth checking out; if not for the bizarre visual aspects and exciting, nightmarish final, then certainly for the nicely judged performances of Richardson, Byrne and Spall.

Some have likened the film to Dario Argento's classic supernatural thriller Suspiria (1977), with the use of Gothic locations, bold colours and a self-consciously visual approach to storytelling. These similarities stand, though you can also see the film as an extension of the earlier Altered States (1980) and Crimes of Passion (1984); both in certain thematic preoccupations, and in the actual visual presentation overall. The film works simply because of the intensity of the images, but ultimately going deeper than even that; tying the whole thing into the character of Mary Shelley and her own sense of personal tragedy. It gives the film that much needed emotional quality, helped along by the fine performance from the incredibly young Richardson in one of her first leading roles. She's complimented well by Byrne, who takes the role of Byron entirely seriously, even when spouting some incredibly pretentious dialog and attempting to seduce every character in the film. Nonetheless, the intensity of the role shines through and really establishes the character, with his fears and weaknesses going towards the creation of his own personal nightmare that will reverberate through time.The film suggests that by raising the spirits of the dead you fate yourself to an inescapable evil. This is reflected by the tragic circumstances that surrounded the characters - hinted at in that tour-de-force final - and their eventual fate as documented by history itself. It's very clever once you get past the awkward, slightly giddy and anachronistic-like feeling of the first few scenes and really get into the horror aspect and the more much rewarding sense of human interest. Naturally, it won't be to all tastes, as the factors that Russell tends to highlight in his work - religious symbolism, garishness, sex and sensuality, brutality and anachronistic humour - will obviously cause problems for viewers looking for a more conventional horror story. I liked the break in convention, though. After all, there are plenty of horror films that regurgitate the same old stock tactics and scenarios. Gothic goes for a different approach; one that is more eccentric, single-minded and unique, layering the fact and fantasy elements of Stephen Volk's imaginative screenplay with a lurid and sensational approach to the visual telling of the story, rife with his usual themes and obsessions. If you love Russell's work, and appreciate interesting and unconventional cinema, then Gothic is well worth checking out; if not for the bizarre visual aspects and exciting, nightmarish final, then certainly for the nicely judged performances of Richardson, Byrne and Spall.

This is also a very funny spoof on Frankenstein movies as Mel Brooks was top notch in this film as he did nearly no wrong in casting and the story was to die for. The only complaint I have is not really all that big, but I just find this movie is most funny during the beginning and middle while the ending, while not weak, is not as strong. Gene Wilder plays the son of the notorious Dr. Frankenstein great, at times playing his role in a straight and serious manner, then he goes off on a demented rant the next. Other characters and cast are good as well, but for my money Marty Feldman stole the show as Igor (prounced eye-gor here of course). From his scene in the basement posing as one of the heads on display to his bad choice in brains, he was the highlight in this movie for me along with the brief, but also very memorable performance of Gene Hackman as a blind man who asks god for just someone to stop by and visit him. The story is very basic Frankenstein with the strange Mel Brooks flair added in for fun. Many funny scenes are to be found within as this comedy still holds up and stands the test of time.

So, before writing this review, I read the 20+ ones already posted here, mostly from viewers who had not seen Pepe le Moko first, to see how they reacted to Algiers without knowing the French original. Most of them liked it a lot.While I wouldn't go that far - despite a few of the comments, I found this movie not even close to Casablanca - I did find it enjoyable for certain things, if not for others.While I like Charles Boyer in certain movies (Gaslight, primarily), in this film he is radically inferior to his French predecessor, Jean Gabin. Gabin is very believable as a thief and member of the underworld; it is hard to imagine Boyer surviving there 10 minutes. Gabin could be rough and charming; Boyer is suave, but there is no dark underside to it.Hedy Lamarr is indeed beautiful, and sometimes gets to do some acting here. She never overacts (as Boyer and some of the others do), so she is always fun to watch.The best acting, however, is in the character roles, some of which are in no way inferior to the original. Gene Lockart's death screen is well acted and magnificently staged; it is one of the best moments in the movie. Joseph Calleia is very good as the police agent throughout.Still, the best thing in this movie, for me, was the lighting and camera work. Often atmospheric, some of the shots are very strikingly composed. The next time I watch this movie, it would be tempting to do so with the sound off for most of it - though not when Vincent Scotto's music is playing. It is haunting and very evocative; another of the best features of the film.My only complaint about this movie is the end, which some previous reviewers liked. (Here comes the spoiler.) In the original, Jean Gabin commits suicide when he realizes he can't have Gaby; it is a chilling scene very well done. In the American remake Boyer gets shot while running to the ship; it makes him much more of a victim without control of his destiny, and in that sense was a real aggravation after having seen how it could have been done. Other changes in the movie are interesting examples of cultural differences in the French original, Gaby is the well-paid mistress of the wealthy overweight Frenchman; there is no question of marriage between them. In the American remake, they are engaged, and while there is no suggestion either loves the other, the relationship would have been seen as less immoral. In the same sense, the low-life is the French Casbah is much more clearly low prostitution, etc. That is all glossed over in the American remake.So, a movie worth watching, especially for the lighting, the camera work, and some of the direction, as well as the acting of some of the subordinates. Watch this movie first, and then Pepe le Moko, and you will enjoy it more.
