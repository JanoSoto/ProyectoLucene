Yet, in the end, the film manages to use this slightly innovative structure (though it wasn't the director's innovation) to good effect in creating and selling several interesting points about the postmodernisation and proletarisation of Germany that they had been undergoing since the 1980s. Okay, I got carried away with my rhetoric. Let's just say Germany was in the 1980s facing a new phenomenon, the emergence of an educated and not British soccer fan loutish underclass, to which this movie alludes in a clever way by underscoring the psychological dysfunction in Lola's family that, the film alludes, was partly responsible for creating punk culture out of bourgeois alienation. So, the theme is interesting, the casting good, and there is obligatory referencing to Kafka-esque surrealism, Gunter Grass anomie (repeated screaming) and Marquez mythologizing (the plot follows a mythic structure, in the style of A Hundred Years of Solitude), so why not praise this as innovative in its own way? Of course, culture snobs will never acknowledge that a lot of the allegedly avant-garde and experimental techniques that various obscure film festivals label as innovative were in fact pioneered by popular American television shows, but let it ride.

Bond must investigate an American space shuttle that gets hijacked but thankfully he has assistance from Mrs. Goodhead (Lois Chiles). The two must go up against Hugo Drax (Michael Longdale) and the one and only Jaws (Richard Kiel). There are certain things that even James Bond shouldn't be able to do and space travel is one. I'm going to guess this film tried to capture some of the STAR WARS craze but no matter what the intentions were the final product is just a parody of itself and in the end it's quite boring and silly. What really took me by surprise is how silly everything is and it never really seemed as if the producers or directors were taking the material too serious. I'm all for Jaws returning from the previous film because he was a terrific character but here he's just used as some sort of failed comic relief. Whenever he appeared on film in the previous movie he struck a nerve as being a true beast but here he's just silly comedy that is never funny or fun for that matter. Another problem is some of the stupid dialogue that tries to be clever and you can start with the Goodhead name. This is just childish and whatever comedy they were going after doesn't work here either. The action sequences really aren't all that either with the exception of the first one where Bond is on a private jet and things get out of control by a couple assassins. I found the rest of the action to be either bland or just not all that exciting and especially when you compare it to stuff from the earlier pictures. There's a scene with a large snake that is decent but it really doesn't pack too much suspense. There's all the stuff on the space shuttle, which just came over very cheap and generic to me. Again, I'm not sure how much of an impact STAR WARS had on this entry but it's clear director Gilbert wasn't too comfortable working with the space stuff. Moore isn't nearly as entertaining as Bond and Chiles isn't the best of his countless lovers. Kiel is always entertaining no matter what he does but his Jaws character isn't nearly as memorable here. The rest of the supporting players are decent but nothing more. MOONRAKER never had the highest reputation and it's easy to see why. A bland entry with only a few decent moments scattered around.

In fact, it isn't what I would call a bad movie. So then why do I give a 4\/10 rating? Well to be quite honest, most everything held up except for the pacing. The story is good, the acting is good, and some of the characters are interesting. Sadly, THE PACING IS TERRIBLE! This is what ruined Thunderball for me. My biggest complaint aside from the dull moments of this movie is the much appraised underwater climactic scene. I'm sure the scenery for it's time was deemed magnificent. To be fair, the underwater segments were shot quite well. The problem is that they went on for far too long. Moving on to the bond characters of Thunderball; three in particular. The central villain of this movie tried to come off as a fearless leader yet had the personality of a rock. The bond girl really wasn't given much to work with and between her and the female villain, I rather fancied the female villain. OK, moving on... After seeing Connery's Bond reach his peak in the superior Goldfinger, I suppose my expectations for Thunderball were not met.

At times I felt that the movie was hard to understand, and if you were watching it without reading the novel first you would be very confused. The storyline of Tita and Pedro's undying love for one another was magical, and although the movie is from a different country and time period, I feel that many people today can relate to their story. Food plays the largest role in the film. Most of the magical realism portrayed is after the family or even guests of their home ate the meals Tita prepared. Before watching the movie I was concerned how they would portray the magical realism throughout the film. In the novel, the magical realism catches you and draws you in. The film does the same. The magical realism scenes were wonderful and exciting. Some were not done as well as others, for instance when Tita is being born and the buckets of flowing water come, but for the most part the magical realism scenes were successful. I do not know much about Mexican culture, but from what I have learned this year in World Literature class the movie is very realistic. Some actors and their Spanish could have been better, for instance Pedro, but overall most the characters were portrayed well. Tita was just as I imagined her from the novel. Gertrudis, on the other hand was not, but I think the choice of actress was great. Gertrudis was not like her sisters. The red hair made her stand out and reminded viewers she was different. Like Water for Chocolate makes you question yourself throughout the film. Lots of people say they don't understand Tita and her actions, but they have never been in her position. Mexican family traditions are different then what we see in today's society. What would you do if you had to wait and take care of your mother until she passes to marry? What would you do if your one true love married your sister? These questions seem so easy to answer, but when you see Tita facing these questions in her real life, you realize the answer might not be as easy as you thought. Over all Like Water for Chocolate is a great film. I was worried about how I would deal with subtitles and it didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie at all. The movie is in Spanish and involves Mexican culture but, anyone can enjoy it. If you have or haven't read the novel I recommend watching Like Water for Chocolate.

After murdering a woman (Miriam Karlin) with a giant penis Alex is caught by the police, convicted of murder & sentenced to fourteen years in prison. After spending two years in prison Alex agrees to take part in revolutionary Ludovico Treatment which psychologically conditions violent & sexual urges, after a two week treatment course Alex is released completely cured. However Alex finds himself in a harsh world unable to make any moral choice, unable to fight back or protect himself Alex is beaten up & left for dead. Seeking help Alex finds himself at the house of writer Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee) whom was left crippled by Alex & his Droogs several years earlier, Frank decides to try & make Alex commit suicide & both gain revenge & bring the Government down in a blaze of bad publicity...This American & English co-production was written & directed by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, one of the more controversial films released by a major studio A Clockwork Orange has quite a reputation & while in terms of violence & sex it can't really hope to compare with more recent offerings this is a fine film that has meaning, intelligence & makes a statement that is still relevant even now over forty years after it was originally made. Now that's visions, right? The social political story about rampant youth crime, overcrowded prisons, victims rights, rehabilitation, probation, psychiatric cures, the breakdown of the family unit & law & order feels totally contemporary & you can see that the Kubrick's vision of a future Britian really isn't that far off from the way things are now with all the issues & themes raised in A Clockwork Orange still relevant today, if not even more so than back in 1971. From inmates using the bible to fuel their sexual & violent fantasies to the corruption & underhand use of the system, from Alex starting out as a thug & then being cured only for a public media outcry which claim Alex's human rights have been violated while ignoring his victims so he is simply to be at the end to carry on as a thug free as a bird. I found the issues & themes very timely & the film as a whole fascinating to watch but at two & a quarter hours long it goes on forever, I doubt I would want to sit through it again & Alex goes from monster to hero & back again so your never quite sure what to feel for him but I suspect this was intentional on Kubrick's part & is admittedly done in a clever & manipulative way. Although always watchable & engaging some may find A Clockwork Orange a little slow at times & the strange language which is apparently a mix of English, Russian & slang may be off-putting for some although I always new what was being spoken about & thought the abstract dialogue was rather entertaining & very amusing in places.While the issues & themes in A Clockwork Orange haven't dated at all what about the visual look of the film? Well, apart from some bad 70's colours & technology this still looks great & hasn't dated badly at all. There are some great scenes, some poetic violence set to classical music like when two rival gangs of thugs fight each other to Rossini's Thieving Magpie & Alex's liking for Ludwig Van Beethoven's ninth means it's used throughout. The Ludovico treatment scene has Alex strapped into a chair with metal hooks holding his eyes open in what must have been an incredibly painful & uncomfortable scene to film.With a supposed budget of about $2,200,000 A Clockwork Orange turned out to be one of the biggest money makers of 1971, nominated for four Oscar's & seven BAFTA's it actually won none of either. Filmed here in England almost entirely on location, Woolwich Barracks prison was used for the interior prison scenes while the exterior was actually Wandsworth prison. The acting is very good, I am sure McDowell suffered for the part both physically & mentally. Having said that everyone seems to shout a lot & everyone plays it over the top with some funny facial expressions.A Clockwork Orange is a really good film, I would maybe stop just short of calling it a classic or even a great film as it's a bit too long & the artsy mix of culture & violence & sex may put some off. The themes & issues are bang on & it's a clever film by a visionary filmmaker but as I said, I don't think I would want to see it again.

After murdering a woman (Miriam Karlin) with a giant penis Alex is caught by the police, convicted of murder & sentenced to fourteen years in prison. After spending two years in prison Alex agrees to take part in revolutionary Ludovico Treatment which psychologically conditions violent & sexual urges, after a two week treatment course Alex is released completely cured. However Alex finds himself in a harsh world unable to make any moral choice, unable to fight back or protect himself Alex is beaten up & left for dead. Seeking help Alex finds himself at the house of writer Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee) whom was left crippled by Alex & his Droogs several years earlier, Frank decides to try & make Alex commit suicide & both gain revenge & bring the Government down in a blaze of bad publicity...This American & English co-production was written & directed by Stanley Kubrick based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, one of the more controversial films released by a major studio A Clockwork Orange has quite a reputation & while in terms of violence & sex it can't really hope to compare with more recent offerings this is a fine film that has meaning, intelligence & makes a statement that is still relevant even now over forty years after it was originally made. Now that's visions, right? The social political story about rampant youth crime, overcrowded prisons, victims rights, rehabilitation, probation, psychiatric cures, the breakdown of the family unit & law & order feels totally contemporary & you can see that the Kubrick's vision of a future Britian really isn't that far off from the way things are now with all the issues & themes raised in A Clockwork Orange still relevant today, if not even more so than back in 1971. From inmates using the bible to fuel their sexual & violent fantasies to the corruption & underhand use of the system, from Alex starting out as a thug & then being cured only for a public media outcry which claim Alex's human rights have been violated while ignoring his victims so he is simply to be at the end to carry on as a thug free as a bird. I found the issues & themes very timely & the film as a whole fascinating to watch but at two & a quarter hours long it goes on forever, I doubt I would want to sit through it again & Alex goes from monster to hero & back again so your never quite sure what to feel for him but I suspect this was intentional on Kubrick's part & is admittedly done in a clever & manipulative way. Although always watchable & engaging some may find A Clockwork Orange a little slow at times & the strange language which is apparently a mix of English, Russian & slang may be off-putting for some although I always new what was being spoken about & thought the abstract dialogue was rather entertaining & very amusing in places.While the issues & themes in A Clockwork Orange haven't dated at all what about the visual look of the film? Well, apart from some bad 70's colours & technology this still looks great & hasn't dated badly at all. There are some great scenes, some poetic violence set to classical music like when two rival gangs of thugs fight each other to Rossini's Thieving Magpie & Alex's liking for Ludwig Van Beethoven's ninth means it's used throughout.

The movie follows Henry Frankenstein who is engaged to a girl named Elizabeth. He leaves his fiancée for four months to work on an experiment with his assistant Fritz. His experiment is to revive a dead corpse but since he is unable to find a perfectly healthy human corpse (they had to have had something wrong with them if they died after all) he ends up grave digging and putting all of the pieces together to create The Monster. When he succeeds in giving it life the Monster manages to escape and cause trouble throughout the entire countryside, killing at will. Will anyone be able to stop the monster? So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion). The Monster's intelligence is also drastically brought down to the point where he can't even speak. The main loss though is the fact that the good guy\/bad guy relationship is much more black and white. In the original novel it was open to interpretation but here the Monster is clearly bad with Henry being good. So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.When it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well. Then there is Mae Clarke who plays Elizabeth but the script doesn't give her very much room as it makes her out as the damsel in distress. Keeping that in mind though she pulls it off well. And next up is Dwight Frye as Fritz, often incorrectly called Igor by viewers. Frye is great as the crazy and stupid hunchbacked character. Most importantly we have Boris Karloff in the film that raised him into star dome. Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film. He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster. So overall there is some great acting here.All of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster. In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake. And as for the musical score it complements the picture tremendously. Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.As a classic of the horror genre at the time and one of the most famous monster movies ever made I was slightly disappointed with the film. I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time. It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster. So give this film a try if you have any interest whatsoever in monster movies, horror, or Frankenstein. But don't expect it to be anything like the book.

Good and evil, right and wrong. The movie is brazenly simple, unfailingly sincere and if you don't shed a tear for Apollo, you might be a Commie.Like so many of us, I was a kid who grew up in the shadow of the Cold War. Not Jack Kennedy's we-all-own-a-bomb-shelter Cold War. I'm talking Reagan's Star Wars, silent submarines, there's-no-point-in-a-bomb-shelter, Red Dawn brand of Cold War. And the first time you hear Burning Heart by Survivor, you'll know exactly what this movie is about. Us versus Them. So, let's talk about the four reasons you need to love it.Number One The Soundtrack. The Rocky IV soundtrack propels this movie into the 80's stratosphere. Trust me, if you've got an important day on the horizon, do yourself a favor and load up that iPod with Hearts On Fire, No Easy Way Out, and, of course, Training Montage. As soon as they're coursing through your headphones, you'll be ready to bust through walls Kool-Aid Man style and tell your wife, No! I will not go see that Justin Bieber movie!Number Two Drago as Frankenstein. Balboa and Ivan Drago personify their respective countries. Rocky Balboa is the son of an immigrant. Once doughy and poorly dressed, now chiseled, heavily altered by plastic surgery, and losing touch with his meager beginnings as he drowns in money. He is brash and jumps into ill-advised decisions. However, he does so based on what he believes is right and, most importantly, he doesn't know how to quit (despite the fact that he's running headlong toward brain damage). The Soviet Union is represented by a juiced-up monster with a blonde flat-top. He's an automaton, easily confused by the things going on around him and borderline frightened of James Brown. Watch the movie and tell me they didn't fully intend for Ivan Drago to be Frankenstein. Tell me you aren't constantly worried someone will strike a match and send him into a mindless rampage. It is also fairly clear that Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen) is the Bride of Frankenstein, genetically engineered to be his identical female counterpart, complete with blonde flat-top. This brings us to the secondary theme that runs throughout the film.Number Three Man vs. Machine. Soviet Frankenstein is constantly surrounded by a team of scientists and technicians as he trains in a gym full of cutting-edge equipment and is injected with what we would assume are anabolic steroids. Ivan Drago has been constructed by his government according to a carefully devised plan. Meanwhile, Balboa dials it back to his roots in the best training montage of the Rocky series. Running through the snow while being chased by bumbling KGB agents, using stones and wooden carts and even his friends as resistance; all he lacks is a frozen side of beef to pound into oblivion. Also falling into this category is a ridiculously awesome birthday gift Paulie's pleasure bot. Robots were huge in the 80's and this one made quite an impression on me. This thing was apparently a genuine, operational robot named SICO, a member of SAG, and toured with James Brown after the movie was released. I'm not joking. My favorite moment with the robot is during the finale. Rocky's son wasn't brought along to Moscow for the fight. Rocky, Paulie, and Adrian are all in Russia. So, if you'll notice, the Balboas apparently felt so good about the robot, they left it alone to watch their son and his friends. But, it looks like the kids (and SICO) are having a good time, so who can complain?Number Four Balboa Triggers the Collapse of Communism. Mark it down Rocky IV got the ball rolling. This film was released in November, 1985. The moment Rocky cuts Drago and turns the entire Russian crowd against their own freakish cyborg and over to his side (including Fake Gorbachev), a groundswell had begun that couldn't be reversed. Four years later, in November, 1989, the Berlin Wall comes down. Coincidence? Hardly. So, remember the words that started it all During this fight... I seen a lot of changing.

How did they convince that cast this story would be anything other than the t-shirt\/movie of the week Brad Pitt's character said it was going to be? The performances were fine (particularly Freeman's and Spacey's). The script, however, was a travesty.First, the consistency of the killings is completely muddled. The first five murders were committed by Spacey's character (John Doe--how original) because of what he perceives to be the sins committed by those he's killed. OK so far. The 6th murder (of Paltrow's character) is also done by Doe, but not because of a sin she's committed, rather because of the sin Doe perceives HE has committed. Got that? And the 7th murder is done by Pitt's character to Doe because of the sin Mills (Pitt) carries with him (I guess?). But even if you link the Envy murder of Doe by Mills as one of the 7 sinners who deserved to be killed for their sin, why was Paltrow's character killed again? And along with that, why does Pitt's character get to live for the sin of Wrath? Another plot point that I don't think can be overlooked... If Doe was the religious lunatic he was presented to be, the murder of Paltrow's character and her unborn child would surely have been the 6th AND 7th murders. Doe was aware she's pregnant. Of course, how do you link an unborn child with a deadly sin? I see the writer's problem. His solution was a train wreck.I also didn't buy at all that Doe was actually envious of Pitt's character. It made for a quirky plot twist, but it seemed so inconsistent for that character. It also didn't make much sense from a plot perspective (see paragraph above).Have I got to 7 things yet?

I guess if you make the assumption that John Doe is insane, then this master plan might make sense to the audience He's insane, his plan probably shouldn't make sense. But to think that his plan worked, succeeded, was effective or even consistent at all (as Somerset's character implies by telling Mills not to kill Doe and fulfill Doe's plan), is giving WAY to much credit to the writer, and almost no credit to the audience.

His portrayal of how loneliness and alienation can affect one's outlook on life is believable. An average happy person may think a person like Bickle is crazy, but this character is so relateable in so many aspects. From his tired voice to his emotionless eyes, it really gives a good view of how isolation in his life has worn him down. When you are isolated and alone, one has more time to develop a philosophy on different things, but at the same time boredom and redundancy can really take a toll on a person's mind. Everything about his portrayal of this character is iconic and memorable.As a taxi driver, we see the world from Travis's eyes. As the film progresses, Travis becomes more and more engrossed in changing things around in the city, as we see him being immersed in the ugliness of the criminal underworld and how much of the city is infested with it. This psychologically affects Travis more into becoming radical and it seems to be offset after Travis fails to develop a sense of normalcy with social relationships and trying to connect to someone. And as a human being, what is astounding to me, is that I could relate to all of this.This is an intense film and what further builds upon this is the soundtrack. The use of jazz music really helps to enhance the looming atmosphere of the film. The down beat jazz music really contrasts well with the more ominous music, and what makes it really work is that it perfectly compliments Travis Bickle as a character of contradictions. While some could argue that Travis Bickle is enigmatic, I think the same could be said about everyone else. Aren't we all an enigma to some degree? I think so.Overall, this is a great film with a great story that in my opinion makes a big statement. The meaning of what I inherited from all of this is that sometimes we as human beings want to make some sort of statement, but the limited ability of words can sometimes not be enough to express what's eating us away deep down inside.What Taxi Driver does is not doing what other movies do and that's creating a realistic view of the world with a dash of fantasy.

In life, sometimes you've just got to just say, What the f . These are wise words indeed coming from a Joel's zany friend Miles (Armstrong), although I rather say the f with it. The main point is that life is to short, and when you have even a slight shot at anything, you got to grab it by the balls, and in this case not Joel's whenever he is in private. Joel is portrayed as a character who is just restrained, no doubt his parents are responsible for that , as they mean well in their efforts to send him off to Princeton, and even so much as leaving him with the house to himself. Despite this constantly mentioned array of freedom his friends remind him he has at his disposal, Joel's only sense of fun and excitement resort from a slow dance to the magic of Old Time Rock and Roll. No much of a thrill, especially when having his own quiet time jerking off seems even less dignified. Fortunately, Mile's own stupidity leads Joel down to the right path of discovering more than just freedom, but an opportunity beyond the already displayed capabilities of his risk free behavior. The arrival of transvestite call girl, named Jackie, (one word Yikes!) gives Joel a real chance to score, and real chance to get a girl to say Oh God. The slick, and even charmingly approaching call girl Lana (Mornay) does more than take Joel's virginity, as she involves him into her array of insanity. An angry pimp, a prosperous in home brothel, and a stolen egg that top it all off, bring Joel towards discovering his talents as he risks his own future in putting things back together. The stolen egg belonging to his mother signifies her very trust for him, and the brothel, being my personally favorite scene of the film, as we viewers witness Joel show a side of himself that even he never knew.

I loved this film a child. But watching this film recently, I realized how kiddie it is compared to the Tim Burton films which was geared towards adults. But it brings back memories when I watch it. I think it is a underrated superhero film. While it may not be as incredible as The Tim Burton or Christoper Nolan Batman films, it is still worth a watch. It's a different take on Batman and it was trying something new. I think it does a good blend of both the Burton films and the 60's T.V show. It's fast paced, over the top and fun to watch. I also think it's story about Bruce Wayne's decision on whether to remain as Batman or not was smart and it adds a new challenge to the character like what Superman does in Superman 2. I like it's jokes like how chicks dig the bat-mobile and I'll get drive through. I thought those were smart jokes. I also think people hate this film because it basically leads to Batman and Robin. There are flaws like the music. It's not the Danny Elfman score which is fantastic. It's different which is too bad, but it is a different Batman film so it works in a way. However, I feel the biggest flaw with the film are the villains. They are too flashy and goofy for a big Batman film. Compared to the Tim Burton villains which were dark, demented and scary like The Joker, Penguin and Catwoman. This villains were to goofy and they felt to much like the 60's Batman villains. Those villains worked in the 60's, but they don't really work in the 90's. I think the casting was good for this film, here is my rundown for each roleVal Kilmer as Batman- I think he was a good choice and he does a good job playing The Dark Knight. Even though I don't think he is the best Batman. He is a little more of a mellow Batman and acts more like a detective while playing the role. His highlight in the film was when he survives a trap by Two-Face and he runs through the fire. That shot always stayed in my mind as a child and it should go down as a fantastic Batman moment.Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face- This role was WAY to over the top for a Tommy Lee Jones role and for the character of Two-Face. I love Tommy Lee Jones in any of his films, but I think he overacts a little too much in the film. I also think his character was not true to the comics at all. In the comics, his character is like a split personality. In here, he is a goof ball who laughs a lot. His coin has no purpose unlike the comics. Although he had scenes that I liked. Such as when he was teaching Riddler how to punch.Jim Carrey as Ridder- Well what can you say, it's Jim Carrey. He plays this part like his other parts which isn't really a bad thing. But again, it's too over the top for a Batman film. I did love how obsessed he was at trying to be like Bruce Wayne. It adds a little more character to his role.Chris O'Donell as Robin- I thought Chris does a good job as Robin. He's young, arrogant and stubborn. I love how he is revenge driven and desires to kill Two Face. It gives another challenge to Batman having to stop Robin's lust for revenge. It has a stronger message against Revenge than most superhero films do.Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase- Not much to say, just a typical damsel in distress. Although I though she was sexy in this movie.Overall, it's nowhere near being the Best Batman film like the Tim Burton or Christoper Nolan films are. But it's a fun movie and it's still worth a watch for young Batman fans.

Richard Scarry delighted me as a child and still does, although i find the books to be aimed at very small children so i don't read em anymore. but i still dig Disney as an adult so i find this combination of Scarry and Disney to be a delightful blast of fun.'Robin Hood' is also one of Disney's best cartoon features for the toddler set. most all of Disney's cartoon features aim at acceptance from an older more mature audience, 'Robin Hood' doesn't seem particularly concerned with adult appeal. that's just fine and that's also what i like best about it. it requires less involved thought then the other Disney films and has far less ambitious and lofty pretensions. not every work of fun or entertainment has to be high culture or serious art. this is one of Disney's most laid back films animated or live action, and definitely one of Disney's least pretentious. which is saying a lot because on a whole, Disney is not very pretentious.

Moore simply wanted to interview Smith and take him on a day-tour of Flint, Michigian where he and the GM executives decided to close several of their car-manufacturing plants. Instead, Smith avoids the encounter, sending Moore on a kind of corporate wild-goose chase which ends up being both amusing and heart-wrenching.The tragic under-story which is really at the heart of Moore's film is how Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, essentially goes down the proverbial sewer once the plants began closing, because in all likelihood, the GM executives did not understand how entwined the plant was with the local economy. Unemployment went up, businesses closed, houses went into foreclosures, people were evicted from rentals, and crime escalated. At one point, Flint becomes the crime capital of the United States. Certainly, to blame all of Flint's problems on the plant closing may be unfair, but most of the people who made the decisions to close the plants, particularly Roger Smith, are unwilling to talk about it. Moore, as far as I can tell, never demanded Smith reopen the plant. He just wanted to talk about how the life of the town had changed as a result. But talking about it would mean having to look at it, and look at it is not what Smith wants to do, which is I think the whole point of the film.At some point, Smith and the execs of GM become aware of Moore, his mic, his cameraman, and his crew, and hide from him at all costs, despite repeated requests for an interview. His employees as well as one of the lobbyists for the car industry, most of whom were not making 1% of Smith's yearly income, have to make excuses for him. The few who are willing to talk to Moore on camera rationalize that the decision to close the plants were in the best interests of the company, and that GM has absolutely no civic responsibility whatever, only the responsibility to make lots of money for their stockholders. Because Smith avoided Moore's microphone and camera, the irony itself makes interesting fair for a documentary film. The viewer's first thought is, what's he hiding? Of course, if Smith and his fellow executives made such a good decision by closing these plants right at the height of their profits, they should have nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to explain their reasonings. Their avoidance of the conversation is quite telling.Roger and Me was Michael Moore's first documentary and became the prototype for all his later projects. Moore interjects all the elements that will become trademarks for his future films Moore's voice-over, classic film footage, home-movie footage, interviews with local people, footage of local events, and the most interesting of them all, going to the large executive suites, trying to get interviews. He did the same thing in his most-recent film, Capitalism A Love Story where he used a blow-horn in front of a New York financial firm yelling Give us back our money! In Roger & Me he simply tries to get to the 14th floor of the main GM Building. At the time, the security and company managers didn't realize this would be tame by Moore standards.One of the more interesting developments is the numbers of celebrities and singers who come to Flint to try to inspire the town, everyone from the televangelist Robert Schuller, Pat Boone to then President Ronald Reagan, and Donnie and Marie Osmond make an appearance. Reagan suggests that the unemployed leave Flint and relocate to another state where there are more jobs. Sort of reminds me when certain politicians in the 1850's suggested African-American slaves relocate back to Africa. It's not only unrealistic, it's kind of insulting. Even Bob Eubanks, a native son and the MC for the Newlywed Game, visits Flint. Eubanks admits he knows nothing of their problems or their politics even though he was born there. The celebrities came and provided inspiration in very contrived live performances; unemployed persons got half off the regular ticket prices! The biggest irony is that aside from the discount, these celebrities who have made millions do nothing to actually help the town. The only attempt is an Autoland theme park, sort of like a Disneyland for cars, which bombs and closes after only six months.People have criticized Moore and his films because they distort the facts. But I don't think Moore is presenting a Frontline-like documentary. He uses humor and irony to make his point. The funniest and most-telling scenes are often the interviews of those on the adversarial side which inadvertently end up making his case. My favorite scene is when he is interviewing a few upper-crust ladies at a golf course, most of whom haven't worked a real day in their lives. With their golf clubs and sun hats, they're saying that these out-of-work people need to get off their duffs and do something. All the while they're swinging away at golf balls in between riding around in golf carts. It's so funny that they don't even see how hypocritical they appear. Of course none of the four women offer to do anything for their fellow Flint townsfolk. It's sad that these women could probably make such a difference in these people lives, but all they do is play golf.Certainly, Moore doesn't try to re-open the plant himself. But what he did was tell the story of Flint, Michigan, and I think that's Moore's main contribution. Again, his initial goal was simply to open a dialog. But of course, the minute people are willing to talk, who knows where it might lead?
