The best monsters are the ones which are very difficult to kill; in addition, these types of monsters can destroy fragile human beings with ease. This is what is confronted here, with humans little more than insects to be crushed and absorbed. Of course, certain insects can cause a lot of damage when they put their minds to it. The atmosphere in the first half hour is very eerie and there's a lot of mystery. You have pretty much an empty town, a couple of young women just arrived, and a couple of bodies - no answers. That gloom & foreboding of doom may not be too difficult to create, but we hardly see it anymore, even in horror films. Even if one has seen this film, however, they may be compelled to watch that first half hour again just to get that sense of doom all over. When some cops show up, things get even worse. Then an entire army shows up and, of course, we think things are under control now, but it makes no difference. At least the pic is consistent with its menace.This picture was virtually ignored on release and I don't think video has helped it much. When the monster is revealed, it obviously takes away all the suspense built up earlier, but it's still creepy going (without revealing too much, the monster is a more advanced version of a famous one from the fifties; think also along the lines of The Thing remake by Carpenter in '82). Writer Koontz was involved in the adaptation, which always seems to help. Actor O'Toole appears around the midway point as the only so-called expert on the creature, all based on conjecture, of course. He lends a bit of gravity to it all, tho I suppose he's slumming here in a 'typical' fright flic. The rest of the younger cast do fine, with Affleck a bit irritating as usual. I'm not sure what Schreiber was aiming at, but he was almost as creepy as the creature. There's a bit of a twist ending, which wasn't really necessary.

The coal-stoker on the train seems aware of Blake's destiny and shows that this is not just any train.We might take Blake as an incarnation of the real poet William Blake. The coal-stoker's obscure reference to the ship might indicate a passage across the sea he assumed Blake made (from England).The shooting of the buffalo from the train (huh?) shows man's senseless destruction of nature.The hellish machinery of the train is shown taking Blake towards Machine, the crossroads of man's conscience and a place already turned into a kind of hell. The girl's paper flowers show how even pretty things have degenerated into a soulless artificial state, but is also a sign of hope. She hopes to have real flowers one day - a sign that she has a good soul.After Blake collapses in the street there is a rather large shooting star, presumably to indicate that his soul had left him (Jarmusch is being coy if denies this blatant indication that Blake has passed on). In fact, the best interpretation is that he is not quite dead, but dying, comatose that enables the film to work equally well on two levels.Here's the key thing the real poet William Blake had visions and wrote a book called The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (geddit?). This book is written in a weird style that sounds quite like Indian-speak. In fact, several of Nobody's lines are taken straight from the this book such as The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn of the crow. Ironically, in the film, Blake does not understand any of what Nobody is saying and calls it Indian malarkey.We can take Nobody for a bit foolish in a real-world sense, but in the spiritual world we must assume he knows what he is talking about. When he asks Blake did you kill the man who killed you? and Blake answers I'm not dead, we can assume that Nobody's knows something Blake doesn't. In a scene cut from the final film, Nobody says that he saw a bluebird drinking the blood from Blake's wound. This obviously showed Nobody that Blake's soul was worth saving - otherwise it would have been a vulture, not a bluebird, on his chest.Nobody = no body. A further indication that he is of the spiritual world.Nobody and Cole (black as coal) are good and evil angels fighting it out for Blake's soul. They are each more or less indestructible, except that like good and evil themselves they can cancel each other out, as they do at the end.Everyone met along the way shows various types of human fallibility or degeneracy and each comes to a bad end, weeded out in the purgatorial process.The dead deer represents the woman he met in Machine, and bears the same wound. The embracing of the deer is Christian-type imagery, providing some indication of the good, redeeming side of Blake's character. During his trials (Nobody gives him the odd test) Blake shows both good and bad aspects to his character, and so at the end we can assume he drifts off into neither heaven nor hell, but in limbo.There's surely more. For example, the sheriff's head (that Cole crushes under his boot) is an exact replica of Lenin - implying that communism is more evil than Evil. And I was interested to see one reviewer mention that the name of the bar in Machine has some relation to the death of Stalin's wife.No doubt the film is worth more than one viewing.

There are some superb moments, stunning music, and of course, loads of mystical meaning.Here is a quick key The train journey is a metaphor for the passage of Blake's life as well as the passage of man into the dubious morality of the machine age. The coal-stoker on the train seems aware of Blake's destiny and shows that this is not just any train.We might take Blake as an incarnation of the real poet William Blake. The coal-stoker's obscure reference to the ship might indicate a passage across the sea he assumed Blake made (from England).The shooting of the buffalo from the train (huh?) shows man's senseless destruction of nature.The hellish machinery of the train is shown taking Blake towards Machine, the crossroads of man's conscience and a place already turned into a kind of hell. The girl's paper flowers show how even pretty things have degenerated into a soulless artificial state, but is also a sign of hope. She hopes to have real flowers one day - a sign that she has a good soul.After Blake collapses in the street there is a rather large shooting star, presumably to indicate that his soul had left him (Jarmusch is being coy if denies this blatant indication that Blake has passed on). In fact, the best interpretation is that he is not quite dead, but dying, comatose that enables the film to work equally well on two levels.Here's the key thing the real poet William Blake had visions and wrote a book called The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (geddit?). This book is written in a weird style that sounds quite like Indian-speak. In fact, several of Nobody's lines are taken straight from the this book such as The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn of the crow. Ironically, in the film, Blake does not understand any of what Nobody is saying and calls it Indian malarkey.We can take Nobody for a bit foolish in a real-world sense, but in the spiritual world we must assume he knows what he is talking about. When he asks Blake did you kill the man who killed you? and Blake answers I'm not dead, we can assume that Nobody's knows something Blake doesn't. In a scene cut from the final film, Nobody says that he saw a bluebird drinking the blood from Blake's wound. This obviously showed Nobody that Blake's soul was worth saving - otherwise it would have been a vulture, not a bluebird, on his chest.Nobody = no body. A further indication that he is of the spiritual world.Nobody and Cole (black as coal) are good and evil angels fighting it out for Blake's soul. They are each more or less indestructible, except that like good and evil themselves they can cancel each other out, as they do at the end.Everyone met along the way shows various types of human fallibility or degeneracy and each comes to a bad end, weeded out in the purgatorial process.The dead deer represents the woman he met in Machine, and bears the same wound. The embracing of the deer is Christian-type imagery, providing some indication of the good, redeeming side of Blake's character. During his trials (Nobody gives him the odd test) Blake shows both good and bad aspects to his character, and so at the end we can assume he drifts off into neither heaven nor hell, but in limbo.There's surely more.

Want to rate him against other leading men today, all you have to do is take a look at one emotionless Keanu Reeves performance or Ben Affleck (though I think Affleck is better than Reeves) and then try to put them into Cruise' shoes in Born on the Fourth of July or Minority report and think for a minute. Not a chance.So what is it, fault Spielberg because he didn't satisfy your vision of whatever tripe you had in your head or Cruise, because he's flying the Jet you've only known in fantasy? People love to hate and show contempt when the majority of us have no foundation upon which to stand other than I liked it, or I didn't. Reviewers like tedg, who apparently seem to be professors, still have only cinematic license to critique based on formulaic visions for what is, should be and how they might have changed it etc. etc.While the majority of films for example are supposed to stick to non-filmmaker Syd Field's three act recommendation, some of the better works through time follow their own conventions and paths, not those set out before writers by non artists, who have never made more than the crap in their drawers.Of course this is all garbage ultimately too, since the analysis of another's art, commercial or otherwise is simply opinion. Though it's nice for guys like Spielberg to consider the audience and commercially succeed, as well as being a requirement for continued work in this field (unless you fully finance everything you do), I think he probably wants to do movies he will like, regardless of what others think. Of course that's just my opinion.

It's too bad he blatantly resorted to copying Hitchcock rather than trying to be original. Ripping-off Hitchcock does not make your movie Hitchcockian.You all know the plot of the movie, so I'm not going to waste my time explaining it. But what I will comment on instead is the severe multiple personalities of this film. First, it's a ghost story. Then, it's a murder mystery. The problem lies in the fact that there's too much going on in each story that any attempt to connect them feels overtly contrived. It doesn't gel naturally, and it leaves too many loose ends that nobody mentions after they disappear (despite making a big deal about them earlier). The biggest example of this flaw is the neighbors. First, the female lead character thinks the man next door killed his wife, and finds a bloody shoe on their porch to support her claim. Later on (much later on), we find out that the couple living next to our main characters really have NOTHING to do with the actual plot. A whole hour of film wasted on something that doesn't even matter. And they never ask for the shoe back, either...and it's never revealed how it got bloody in the first place.I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10 (which equals 3 out of 5 stars). The two lead characters were perfectly cast and anybody else playing their roles besides Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford would simply be wrong. Pfieffer because she is an outstanding actor (yes, actor. You don't call an author an authoress, do you?) and Ford because you will never expect him to play that kind of role...even while you're watching the movie. The cinematography is very good looking, if a little too bright. The sound design is especially noteworthy and helps a great deal in creating suspense. Alan Silvestri's 'Bernard Herrmann Psycho\/Vertigo amalgam rip-off' score is too over-the-top for my liking and sometimes used when it silence would not only suffice, but enhance the viewing experience. And like I said before, Robert Zemeckis is a very talented director. He does a great job here, creating some very unique shots and generating suspense at key moments.But one thing that really sucked was the ending. Anyone who has at least seen one thriller before will see it coming from 3 miles away. Not the big twist, but everything that happens after it the chemical that was explained earlier for no reason at all, the killer not really being dead, the killer not really being dead for a second time, the killer following the protagonist as she makes her escape, etc. It's 10 minutes worth of film and the audience is already at 11 minutes.

Good.I'd just like to say again that not only is Michelle Pfeiffer one of the most beautiful women in the history of the world, but she is also a very talented actor.

I instantly remember the climax of the movie which is the last scenes in the crypt, where in verse Juliet declares what she feels for Romeo. The plot's turning point is the effort of the monk to save the two and bring the message that would bring the happy end but he fails but by an instant.

I noticed.. quickly.. her HUGE hair. And then Adam Storke enters the movie, and my god, I just about keeled over laughing. Wearing the most ridiculous jacket that hasn't been seen, well, since the late 80's when this film was made, collar up and with a somewhat effeminate look about him. It's very odd and it just distracted me throughout the movie. Oh right, about now the cheesy 80's synthesizer squawk song comes up as well, so this movie instantly arrives at 80's kitsch supreme, and the movie is just 5 minutes old! This movie follows a theme we've all seen before. AKA, women trying to find the love of their life while trying to make sense out of like (See Shag, Satisfaction, Three Coins In The Fountain, etc). Lilli Taylor plays a woman who's not too sure whether she wants to get married to Vincent D'Onofrio or not (Yes, I can understand that). Annabeth Gish plays a girl who makes some extra money babysitting and falls in love with a married man who's wife has gone overseas, and Julia Roberts is a somewhat let the chips fall where they may type of gal who yes, beds the rich Storke, and realizes that, shockers upon shockers, The Rich People Don't Care For The Lower Class! All of these women for some odd stupid reason don't seem to GET it. What exactly was making Taylor so neurotic about marriage? Why is Gish so shocked when the married guy's wife comes home? Who on earth would pick up Adam Storke? All of this, and yes, Matt Damon too! In his first movie role! I didn't realize this until I was watching it that he was in it, playing Adam Storke's brother. It's sort of fun to think that the next time you would see them on screen together would be Oceans 11, a full 13 years after this was made! Yikes!

Once the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the journey and the emotional struggles seem to be more difficult and dangerous than the killing of Kurtz.What makes the movie work are the good and realistically brought characters and the actors that portray them. All of the characters are stereotypes in a way, which works extremely well for the movie and its story. Brando is totally flipped in his role as 'crazy' mumbling Colonel Kurtz and even though his role isn't THAT big (ironic sentence, considering the fact that Brando was 40kg overweight, for his role), he still makes a lasting impression.

He didn't like the idea of a camera crew roaming the headquarters and recording conversations that he felt should have been private. Clinton overruled him, of course. As a result, the documentary skews history a bit. The nuts and bolts of running a campaign are ignored while the craft of spin doctoring is glorified. In a visual medium, that's not altogether surprising, and it may even have been unavoidable. But the misrepresentation -- or rather, the selective representation -- has had the unintended consequence of contributing to public cynicism about political campaigns, which now appear to be all about the spin, the framing -- the very things that make voters feel like they're being manipulated. Perhaps a stronger emphasis on the heavy lifting of door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, meetings with interest groups, outreach to local officials, event set-up, and the like, would have given a more complete picture.

I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favorite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and clichéd concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section. Being young and innocent and carrying an animatronic teddy bear (arguably the greatest character in the film) wherever he goes, he embodies the naivety of your average child growing up in a terrifying world which he does not understand. But in this film, that real-life situation is explored to its extremes.David is helped along his way by another very likable character, Gigolo Joe, one of Jude Law's most interesting performances. The interaction between the two is absolutely fascinating, almost absurdest at times and always with that quirky, Kubrickean feel to it.The quest that forms the central part of the film is essentially nothing more than an appropriation of the Pinocchio story, retold in a science-fiction context David must become a real boy in order to gain the love of his mother. When he reaches Manhattan where his final destination is supposed to be but in actual fact finds him nowhere else but back at the manufacturer's where he was made, we think the film is over. But in actual fact there is about another hour to run.It is this last hour that is the most criticized, and it is quite clear why. There appears to be too much resolution to the film; there are three different points at which the film could end, and at only one of these it does. All three are very sad and tragic ends, but the third and actual ending is somehow the least fulfilling, it gives you a far more hollow feeling. At first I thought it was just because it is such a bleak portrayal but in actual fact it is simply because personally I felt one of the other two endings would be better, but maybe that's too conventional an outlook.The final resolution is something that has never been done before, in a way that has never been done. It's really unexpected and unpredictable, it deals with a bizarre concept in a very serious manner and essentially finishes for you a movie that one person could never make alone. It's one of the most original and thoughtful endings of all time and really gets you thinking. It is so evident that so many minds and so many hours went into the crafting of this modern masterpiece that you have to appreciate it. The film borders on being silly so often but never quite falls into that trap (I'm still not sure why) and for that I am forever grateful.

I use this simile simply because there are so many ways this film can be read, and indeed so many ways in which this film leads you. It takes you through each and every one of those doors and you have to decide in which destination you stay.Being the final working project of Kubrick, it obviously had high promise. The fact that Spielberg had to finish it off, obviously leads to disappointment. Not because Spielberg does a bad job- far from it- but because one can only speculate how much better Kubrick could have done.There are elements of both directors in the film the first thirty minutes are very Spielberg, while from about thirty to ninety minutes the Kubrick influence is extremely strong, and this is definitely my favorite part of the film. It's dark and cynical and provides us with a world we are not accustomed to, and don't particularly want to be. While the first section dealt with the dream of a robot boy who could be taught to love, which is quite a corny and clichéd concept, the second section deals with the harsh realities of the inferiority of robots and mankind's inability to accept and adjust to them, and their violent retaliations. The principle character, David, played astonishingly well by Haley Joel Osment, plays a key role in this section.

Since then I've always tried to catch it every time its been on TV over the past few years, and unsurprisingly it is quite often thanks to it being a wonderfully moving, feel good film that features superb performances from a talented cast along with a terrific script and Ron Howard's splendid Direction. So I ended up seeing it for the first time in over a year today and it was just as refreshing and joyful as it was for me before.Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah are brilliant in the leads and have a lovely chemistry together that really makes the film work so well and must be one of the best if not THE best chemistry i've ever seen in a romantic comedy. However, another large factor that makes it work is the comedic elements that are played to perfection by John Candy and Eugene Levy, although Hanks and Hannah get several as well. Candy especially has some moments that had me laughing for ages and I won't spoil them for you. But, more importantly it doesn't try to be a straight comedy because it isun't meant to be and the script and Howard know this. So, while the film does include several hilarious moments, they don't allow it to upstage the heart of the story which is the loving relationship between the two leads and do allow for some wonderfully sentimental moments between Hanks and Hannah throughout.Without spoiling too much let me just say that the film's ending really is the icing on the cake as far as the whole film is concerned and as the credits roll you are guaranteed to have a smile on your face. I certainly did and did for most of the film as a matter a fact. It really is great and I really did love the film that much. I hope it goes on to become a classic and judging by other comments I've read on here I'm not the only one who thinks that.Absolutely wonderful 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 August 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this for the first time on TV when I was 11 and absolutely loved it.
