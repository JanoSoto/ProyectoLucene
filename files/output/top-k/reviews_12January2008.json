Starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette.After the original Scream (1996) Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson continued the story into a disappointing Scream 2 (1997). After that I wasn't sure about Scream 3. But, I went to see it and I was amazed.Scream 3 is brilliant. All the surviving characters are back (Even a video recording of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) who died in Scream 2) This time they are in Hollywood filming Stab 3 the second sequel based on the events of the 1st and 2nd scream movies. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is living under a new name in a isolated house. But she gets a call from someone with a familiar voice Hello Sidney. While that is happening ex-cop Dewey Riley (Arquette) is working on the set of Stab 3, and after a couple of deaths (and a series of clues to Sidneys mother's death) reporter Gale Weathers (Cox Arquette) shows up. When Sidney arrives they decide to try and find him.The suspense is still there, great dialogue, good humour and great special effects (especially on some of the death scenes). If you liked Scream and Scream 2, you must watch this, it ties up all of the unanswered questions that all fans will be asking.I know this can never live up to the original Scream. But it is definitely better than Scream 2. If you're a fan, watch it. If you haven't seen the other two movies first, watch them, then this one.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 January 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Scream 3.
