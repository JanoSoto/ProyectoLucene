I saw a bit of what I guess was the 1992 sequel, Home Alone 2 Lost in New York, when I was a kid, and was familiar with the Screaming Kevin doll (a toy which I was never was a big fan of, based on the main character in the first two Home Alone films, played by Macaulay Culkin), from a very early age. However, believe it or not, it took me a little over eighteen years after the theatrical release of the original Home Alone for me to get around to seeing it! Yes, this movie is up there on the highest grossing movies of all time lists, but now that I've seen it, I don't know exactly what that was all about.Kevin McCallister is an eight year old boy in Chicago whose family is preparing for their Christmas vacation in France. On the night before the trip, he is picked on by his siblings, and after a dispute with one of them, he is sent to sleep on the third floor, wishing his family would disappear. The next day, the family leaves in a hurry and Kevin is accidentally left behind! He wakes up to find that his family actually has disappeared, and his parents don't realize they've forgotten their son back at home until one point during their flight! At first, Kevin is happy that the family is gone, but eventually finds that being home alone isn't all that easy. While his mother, Kate, tries desperately to get back home as quickly as possible, which doesn't turn out to be easy, Kevin becomes aware of two burglars who intend to rob the McCallister house! For a while, early in the film, I didn't find it very funny at all. Before the trip, there's a joke about armpit shaving (jokes like this, along with some language, are the obvious reasons for the PG rating), and one of the McCallister siblings throws up. I did not care for these, and some of the sibling rivalry and insults I found to be a bit much. For a while after Kevin first finds himself home alone, I found the film rather dull, but fortunately, funnier parts come. There are some humorous moments involving Kevin without his family, such as the character at the store, with the question he asks about a certain toothbrush, and I laughed hard during the scenes where he uses the movie to communicate with people at the door, convincing them there are adults inside (they're probably the funniest parts). The McCallister mother can also be somewhat amusing during her attempts to quickly get back home. Casting comedienne Catherine O'Hara in this role definitely helped. The climax can be funny, but gets a little tiresome.I've definitely seen much worse comedies than this hit holiday film from 1990, and this one is funnier than 1994's The Santa Clause, another PG rated family Christmas movie from the 90's, which I seemed to enjoy as a kid, but not during my last viewing many years later. Despite the absurd plot, Home Alone does have some good humour, as well as a rather poignant moment in the church which eventually comes, but still, the film is not all it's cracked up to be. It may be slightly above average family fare, and it has appeal, but it's still a little strange, the fact it's among the tops in box office history. I'm sure there are so many movies which have been much more deserving of the success that Home Alone had at the box office, but unfortunately didn't even come close.

I first saw it probably 10+ years ago when my daughter was little and crazy about horses. I had read Black Beauty as a child and it was one of my favorite books. So I was looking forward to seeing it but really wasn't expecting much - just a children's film about an old childhood favorite.Boy, was I surprised. This movie was such a moving film. I still remember it this many years later. (I did also recently watch it again). But from memory, the thing that stood out most to me was the superb narration by Scotish actor Alan Cumming as he brings Black Beauty to life. His voice lent so much charm and personality to the entire film. Usually I'm not a fan of accents as it can make the movie harder to understand. But his enunciation was so clear as to not be a problem. He truly MAKES the film. His voice is so rich, with layers and textures. An American narrator couldn't have possibly been nearly as effective. I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts.The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1\/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way!Usually, I would comment on the cast - but here, the most important ones are the horses. So I guess kudos go to the trainers and director in getting such great footage of them on film. There are times when they are racing through pastures, or rearing up on their hind legs so that it appears as though they are dancing. And with the beautiful music playing alongside - it is truly magic.The film does great justice to Anne Sewell's original novel of BLACK BEAUTY (1878). It's unfortunate she never lived to see the great success her novel achieved - as she died just 3 months after it was published.This film will definitely pull at your heartstrings. Have the tissues handy, especially if you are an animal-lover. There are great themes of love and loyalty, trust and betrayal. The film will have you laughing, smiling with pure joy, and crying.

It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups (The Color Purple), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3\/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it.

I do admit that the first time i watched it i had second thoughts, but after watching it again and actually paying attention to the symbolism...I got it. Kubrick once said you are free to speculate what you want about the philosophical meaning of 2001... To me this movie isn't actually a film, but in essence presents us with a challenge. A mental challenge where we actually in the end question ourselves and whether our technology will in the end try to over come us. I never truly caught that the theme of the movie (or what i believe is the theme) started on the space ship on its way to the space station when Mr. Floyd's pen was floating out of his hand, and the flight attendant had to put it back into his pocket. To me this is the fact that man has invented tools that we live with on earth and use every day. For example the pen. Everyday we use it to write different things, but in space...we lose control of our tools-this where Kubrick shows the pen floating out of Floyd's hand while he is sleeping. That same seen also symbolizes and foreshadows the star baby at the end of the film that you see. During the spaceship scene, Floyd has to learn how to use the bathroom (like a baby), and also while eating dinner he has to slurp a liquidy substance out of a straw (like baby food). In all there is so much more meaning to this movie than what I just stated. I would recommend this movie to anybody...that is if they watch it more than once (becasue if you get the theme and symbolism the first time, you clearly didn't)...and for all those people who gave bad reviews or didn't like masterpiece, take this into account-This film was released in 1968, which means that they began filming it 4 years before (typical Kubrick movie took about 4 years) so somewhere around 1964 was the start date...and what famous revolutionary TV show came out in 1966?

Francis Ford Coppola does a great job in directing by creating great suspense and drama in the film as well as the dark theme meant in the book. Mario Puzo did a wonderful job in turning his best-selling book into a movie script with a little help from Coppola. This film also introduces some of the greatest actors in the crime genre which includes great performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the N word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs. Overall I'll recommend this movie to anyone but please don't judge by the boring beginning please see the whole movie before you judge it.

The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the N word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs.

The story is familiar to all by now, four hobbits embark on a journey to Mt. Doom to destroy the dark lord Sauron's ring of power with the help of the Fellowship of the Ring, which consists of the wizard Gandalf the Grey, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the warrior Boromir, and Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor. Frodo Baggins is the ring bearer and must prove strong enough to resist the ring's power, which his uncle Bilbo could not do. They are pursued by Ringwraiths, Sauron's minions who search for the ring, and Orcs sent by the evil Wizard Saruman.The Lord of the Rings trilogy rivals movies like Star Wars in its creation of a new universe, Middle-Earth. I think the atmosphere is established very well by the prologue that gives us the history of the Ring of Power. Howard Shore's Concerning Hobbits theme gives The Shire a sweet, homely feel. You can listen to it and think this is what music in the Shire would really sound like! Jackson really built up the culture of the Shire and the impending danger that awaited the Hobbits and the rest of Middle Earth excellently. They are some of my favorite scenes in the series. The Ringwraiths are some of the creepiest baddies in recent years, and Christopher Lee is exceptionally evil as the Saruman, as usual! I cannot give enough praise to the costumes, production design, and special effects.This entry is my favorite in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, mainly for the subjective reason that Gandalf and Frodo have the most screen time together. Ian McKellen (Gandalf) is the best actor in the series by far, and his small amount of screen time in the second movie is one of the main reasons it is my least favorite! Elijah Wood and McKellen have great chemistry, they form a relationship that reminds me of Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. Their friendship gives the movie a charm that I missed in the sequels.Fellowship is the only movie where all of the members of the Fellowship are together. They all have great chemistry, except Orlando Bloom. I think Bloom went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting. The one actor I must really give credit here is Sean Bean. He portrays Boromir as a well intentioned man who is ultimately too weak to resist the ring. He is a tragic, moving character, easily one of the highlights of the film.What sets this movie apart from its sequels is the lack of really grandiose battle scenes that would take place in The Two Towers and Return of the King. I think the smaller action scenes are more intense. They don't have as much of a fake digital look and they are not as over the top. This is a bit off topic, but a museum in Boston once had a Lord of the Rings exhibit with many of the costumes and props from the films. I was able to hold Frodo's sword, Sting, and I must say it was the only sword I felt comfortable holding. Gandalf and Aragorn's swords were so heavy the actors probably used fake swords for some scenes, just to make it easier on them. It gives you an appreciation for how difficult Medieval Sword fighting was! Overall Fellowship is my personal favorite LOTR film and I think it was the best adaptation of Tolkien's work.

He takes us back to a 6th century England with swords, armor, magic and chivalry, with lush forests and gold castles. The production design is up to par with the best movies of the time period. It is nice to see a film that can create such an engrossing atmosphere without the use of CGI. To paraphrase Roger Ebert, the film's visual beauty makes up for its other flaws.Unfortunately this film has its share of bad actors and terrible dubbing. Even Shakespearean actors like Patrick Stewart overact, although it's nice to see him in a role other than Captain Picard. I am not sure if Nigel Terry is actually doing the voice of King Arthur; if he is than all of his lines must have been dubbed in post production. The bad dubbing is fairly distracting and can take you right out of the film. Another significant problem is how condensed the film is. The plot does not have a natural, logical flow, and it feels more like a collection of poorly developed short stories. That might be because the Arthur legends essentially are a collection of short stories, but I feel the movie would have been better if they had just chosen one short story and stuck with it. The film started with Uther Pendragon conceiving Arthur with the help of Merlin's magic, which was a natural place to start, but then it jumps to Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, Arthur becoming king, Lancelot having an affair with Gwenevere, Morgana LeFay killing Merlin, and finally the search for the Holy Grail and the battle with Mordred. The plot progression feels arbitrary and we don't really understand why the characters act the way they do, we just know that is how it happened in the original story. It really helps to have some knowledge of the Arthur legend or else this movie could be confusing. They really could have made a trilogy out of all these stories, but I guess Boorman did not know if he would get a contract for sequels so he decided to make one epic movie.Aside from the visual aspects, the other great strengths of Excalibur are Nicol Williamson and Helen Mirren. Williamson plays a wonderful, multi-faceted Merlin. He can be very sinister, yet he is the funniest character in the movie. Helen Mirren plays Morgana LeFay, Arthur's half-sister and the mother of his child Mordred. Morgana is Merlin's rival, a wretched sorceress bent on getting revenge on Merlin and Arthur, because Merlin cast a spell on her mother which made her think Pendragon was her real husband. Arthur was conceived through this act of deceit on Merlin's part. Mirren has great chemistry with Williamson. Supposedly they had had an affair during a play or movie in the past and could not stand each other anymore, and both actors tried to convince Boorman to fire the other! These actors really carry the movie.Excalibur is a fun romp with great visuals and two outstanding actors.

It wasn't until years later that the film was seen in its original form and it now has a sizable following.The story, which is based on a novel by Harry Grey titled The Hoods, follows a group of gangsters from their days as young punks to their demise in a botched liquor run. All of this is told in flashback as the one remaining member of the crew returns to his old neighborhood to take care of some unfinished business.It should be noted that the film is nearly four hours long, so those with short attention spans need not apply. That being said, those hours go by fairly quickly and, if anything, it seems like there are parts that could have used elaboration. However, this is probably just a result of Leone trying to do too much.The cast is well-assembled with Robert De Niro in the central role and James Woods in the next most prominent role. The rest of the cast is pretty solid though some of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. The only performance that I thought wasn't on par with the rest was Elizabeth McGovern as De Niro's love interest.Leone's direction is expertly handled, giving the film a polished, yet realistic, look. The editor deserves credit as well since he does an admirable job of keeping the narrative flowing, even when switching between three different time periods. Ennio Morricone's score is good for the most part but the motifs get a bit repetitive by the end. Also, there are a few questionable choices, such as the use of the Beatles' Yesterday and the pan-flute playing of Zamfir.Even considering the film's faults, I think that it has to be considered a classic gangster movie. While the current IMDb rating is, in my opinion, overly generous (as is the case for a number of Leone's films) I wouldn't begrudge it a spot somewhere in the top 250.

However, this is probably just a result of Leone trying to do too much.The cast is well-assembled with Robert De Niro in the central role and James Woods in the next most prominent role. The rest of the cast is pretty solid though some of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. The only performance that I thought wasn't on par with the rest was Elizabeth McGovern as De Niro's love interest.Leone's direction is expertly handled, giving the film a polished, yet realistic, look. The editor deserves credit as well since he does an admirable job of keeping the narrative flowing, even when switching between three different time periods. Ennio Morricone's score is good for the most part but the motifs get a bit repetitive by the end. Also, there are a few questionable choices, such as the use of the Beatles' Yesterday and the pan-flute playing of Zamfir.Even considering the film's faults, I think that it has to be considered a classic gangster movie. While the current IMDb rating is, in my opinion, overly generous (as is the case for a number of Leone's films) I wouldn't begrudge it a spot somewhere in the top 250.

It wasn't until years later that the film was seen in its original form and it now has a sizable following.The story, which is based on a novel by Harry Grey titled The Hoods, follows a group of gangsters from their days as young punks to their demise in a botched liquor run.
