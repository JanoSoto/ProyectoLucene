This series started out beautifully and ends as it started, wonderfully.  The best part of Lethal Weapon 4 is that this is a movie, that could stand on it's own as a great action movie.  That is not only very unusual for a third sequel but it's almost impossible to do.  But Richard Donner brings together the cast and crew for a finale that is action-packed, fun, and a little sad.  A lot of years have passed since the original and Riggs and Murtaugh are a little older and a little wiser and Donner is not afraid to show their weaknesses that have come with age.  Riggs has fallen in love finally with Lorna Cole (Rene Russo returns) and they are expecting a baby.  Murtaugh's daughter Rianne is also expecting.  The movie starts out with an explosive scene with Riggs and Murtaugh going up against some crazy nut with a flame thrower, a bullet resistant outfit, and a machine gun.  Of course that situation couldn't end without Riggs blowing up the city block.  The story line for Lethal 4 is a little more in depth but fortunately still makes sense and is fun to watch.  Chinese Triads are smuggling over immigrants to sell as slaves to Chinese factories.  Some of the slaves are used to make counterfeit money in order to buy four top Triad leaders back from a Chinese Ambassador.  Jet Li stars as the big bad guy and he is chilling and evil looking and an unbelievable martial artist.  I am not a huge fan of Jet Li but he was the ideal adversary for Riggs and Murtaugh.  Donner brings everything back from the first Lethal film and rolls it into this one smoothly.  Riggs is not quite as quick as he once was and although Lorna has managed to domesticate him...there are several scenes where Gibson is taking on Jet Li hand to hand and you see that flash of that loose cannon Riggs we all know and love.  That crazy look in his eyes that we all remember.  Joe Pesci is back and this time Leo Gettz is a Private Detective which means he finally has a gun of his own.  Fortunately again Leo is used in moderation and not only that but the character this time is given some depth and instead of being just constantly annoying he is a little more sympathetic and at the end of the film he has a very moving and touching conversation with Mel Gibson's character Riggs and he helps Riggs genuinely, with a very big situation in Riggs personal life...whether or not to marry Lorna Cole.  Rene Russo still manages to kick a little butt even being pregnant which sometimes makes you think about the poor baby.  Chris Rock joins the cast as a fresh new cop who reminds you a little of Riggs and a little of Murtaugh but also adds his own flavor to the group.  He is made out to be the new generation of cops, and kinda of a new generation of Lethal Weapon.  In one very cute scene which was bordering on un-necessary Chris Rock and Joe Pesci have a little back and forth squabble slash stand-up routine about cell phones.  What seems un-necessary is probably actually Donner's attempt at demonstrating the old and the new.  Pesci being an old comic, and Chris Rock being the fresh new face.  The cast...whether it be our old familliars from Lethal 1-3 or newcomes like Rock...fit together perfectly.  This is a family through and through and as they say in the end We're family.  The whole series of these films together are amazing achievements in the world of Action films where almost anything passes for entertainment.  Blow something up and it's an action film.  Instead Donner has given us a series with characters that are likeable and important, and deep, and relatable, and given us lives and stories that we love to watch.  On top of that he builds action films that are chock full of explosions, and laughs and guns, and martial arts and a world where reality has to be set aside and you get to ride shotgun with the two craziest cops in the business.  I hope that maybe someday Donner might bring the cast back for another one although I think I would be shocked and floored if he was able to pull off another part in this series.  It really would be milking the cash cow and Donner is not much for doing that.  Definately check out Lethal Weapon 4....but without a doubt check out the whole series...you can't miss these movies.

The story is intriguing.  A former rogue cop is helping a bid bad mobster steal guns and drugs from police lock ups around LA.  Together they are pushing the guns into the streets into the hands of kids and gangs.  Lethal Weapon 3 has all the magic that made the first Lethal movie so perfect....of course Riggs and Murtaugh who continue an unbelievable on screen chemistry light the screen and keep us laughing and on the edge of our seat.  Joe Pesci in a DELIGHTFUL turn of events stop being so incredibly annoying to the audience and instead is a perfect dose of comedic relief that is used in moderation as opposed to be completely barraged with his annoying character.  Leo instead annoys Murtaugh and Riggs which is cute and funny and his character is much more enjoyable.  The story line is more simple to understand, and has the heart that Richard Donner usually manages to bring to the story line which is what makes the Lethal films such a unique action experience.  The action is of course EXPLOSIVE...with some great fight scenes, and things exploding all over the place which is always fun when put into the Lethal Weapon context.  Enter a new character....Lorna Cole...the beautiful Internal Affairs (Infernal Repairs as Riggs calls it) agent who is investigating the cop, Jack Travis, who is smuggling the guns out of police lock ups.

In fact at the beginning of the film he has eight days until finally he gets his retirement.  Instead of spending those eight days relaxing and tying up loose ends, Riggs pulls him into a case of bad cops, and illegal guns.  I must say that Lethal Weapon 3 doesn't exactly carry the Dramatic Heart that Lethal Weapon 1 had with the story line of Riggs wife being murdered, and Riggs being such a loose cannon but certainly it holds it's own with the action and the storyline.

Even if it were on par with any of the original three, it wouldn't live up to expectations.  C'mon people, lighten up.  Like any movie, you have to appreciate the good and just accept the bad.  The moment reviews started popping up left and right in 1999, it almost seemed vogue to bash Episode 1.  In a way this overwrought negativity has made it easier for Attack of the Clones -the public was seemingly brought back down to earth by the problems with Phantom Menace.  Of course, at the same time it also puts pressure on AOTC to make up for many people's disappointment last time.Did I like Phantom Menace?  Yes, I did.  Was I disappointed in it?  Of course, but I didn't really think about it much until a while after I exited the movie theatre.  I still felt some of the magic I had experienced the first time around with the classic trilogy at a much younger age, but something was off.Just the over-merchandising of the whole event left a bad taste in my mouth even before I saw the picture.  Everything was overdone, from the product tie-ins, to the heavy toy production, to the inflatable Darth Maul lawn chairs -it was just ridiculous.  And then the movie itself . . .(WARNING Some spoilers follow, but since the original trilogy has been a pop culture fixture for over twenty years, I think we all know how everything ends up anyway.)THE BAD  Only one main character was allowed to develop Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn.  Everyone else just seemed to go through the motions.  I realize that it's hard to find decent child actors, especially for the daunting task of a young Darth Vader, but c'mon, Jake Lloyd?  I still find it hard to believe that Haley Joel Osment auditioned for the part and lost to Lloyd, but then again this is the same film that brought us such gems as Jar Jar Binks, aliens that sound like Charlie Chan, and General Zod losing his power because of a teenage girl. Sorry Mr. Stamp ;-)  Of course the other young'n in this flick also takes some ribbing.  Natalie Portman has proven that she can be a great actress if given the proper material and motivation.  For proof go rent Leon (aka The Professional) or the underrated Mars Attacks. Here, her regal side acts truly regal -hence she's dull as wood. Undercover as one of her own handmaidens, the audience occasionally gets a glimpse of a more lively girl.Jar Jar Binks.  The moment this character opened his computer-created mouth, I felt chills up my spine; the bad kind.  Sure, Lucas claims that Binks is the hook for the younger crowd, but if I remember right, I thought that the Ewoks were way too cutesy when I was just a lad.  Compared to any Gungan, the Ewoks are masters of subtlety and seriousness when it comes to creating alien characters.  Teddy bears with spears defeating the biggest, baddest army in the galaxy?  Seems like a breath of fresh air compared to the recently introduced race of floppy-eared, baby-talking, frog monsters.And of course, we move on to the most marketed character of them all Darth Maul.  That cool tattooed visage was plastered everywhere, yet the bad boy himself only got about ten minutes of screen time.  Once again, there's a great lack of character development.  He's evil, he's deadly, and he's a just a mindless killer for his master.  That's it.  He had a few lines that were in the script at some point that would have given him a little personality of his own, but unfortunately they were dropped.  Why?  Was Lucas afraid that a stunt man couldn't act, let alone speak?  (Same trick with Darth Vader Prowse as the body; Jones as the voice)  Ray Park is indeed physically amazing as a fighter, but X-Men and Sleepy Hollow also show that he can really act.  So what went wrong?THE GOOD  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make a great pair of Jedi Knights. Even though McGregor seems to get the shaft when it comes to over-all exposure, his mannerisms and actions really fit those of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Neeson transcends even the dullest dialogue given to him and carries himself with such presence that he becomes a real Jedi Knight on screen; there is no question about.The true surprise is the supporting cast.  A lot of the leads are dull and fall flat, but characters such as Shmi Skywalker, Mace Windu, Sebulba, Watto, and good ol' Jabba the Hutt add life to the background, despite their small amount of time on screen.Of course, there's the action sequences.  While the pod race seems almost out of place in this movie, it is indeed a great action scene to watch, especially with surround-sound.  And of course, the three-way lightsaber battle at the end is absolutely stunning to watch, but seems too scripted. The beauty of Luke and Vader's fighting was that it looked raw for the most part.  Here it looks like the actors are running through a series of motions, even though they do breath life and copious energy into it.And it's always good to see some old friends like Yoda hanging around.All in all, this movie is worth seeing, and the DVD is definitely worth purchasing if only for the huge amount of extras and behind the scenes material.  Sure it's got problems, and it's not on par with the original trilogy, but it ain't all bad.

I still find it hard to believe that Haley Joel Osment auditioned for the part and lost to Lloyd, but then again this is the same film that brought us such gems as Jar Jar Binks, aliens that sound like Charlie Chan, and General Zod losing his power because of a teenage girl.

The moment this character opened his computer-created mouth, I felt chills up my spine; the bad kind.  Sure, Lucas claims that Binks is the hook for the younger crowd, but if I remember right, I thought that the Ewoks were way too cutesy when I was just a lad.  Compared to any Gungan, the Ewoks are masters of subtlety and seriousness when it comes to creating alien characters.  Teddy bears with spears defeating the biggest, baddest army in the galaxy?  Seems like a breath of fresh air compared to the recently introduced race of floppy-eared, baby-talking, frog monsters.And of course, we move on to the most marketed character of them all Darth Maul.  That cool tattooed visage was plastered everywhere, yet the bad boy himself only got about ten minutes of screen time.  Once again, there's a great lack of character development.  He's evil, he's deadly, and he's a just a mindless killer for his master.  That's it.  He had a few lines that were in the script at some point that would have given him a little personality of his own, but unfortunately they were dropped.  Why?  Was Lucas afraid that a stunt man couldn't act, let alone speak?  (Same trick with Darth Vader Prowse as the body; Jones as the voice)  Ray Park is indeed physically amazing as a fighter, but X-Men and Sleepy Hollow also show that he can really act.  So what went wrong?THE GOOD  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make a great pair of Jedi Knights. Even though McGregor seems to get the shaft when it comes to over-all exposure, his mannerisms and actions really fit those of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Neeson transcends even the dullest dialogue given to him and carries himself with such presence that he becomes a real Jedi Knight on screen; there is no question about.The true surprise is the supporting cast.  A lot of the leads are dull and fall flat, but characters such as Shmi Skywalker, Mace Windu, Sebulba, Watto, and good ol' Jabba the Hutt add life to the background, despite their small amount of time on screen.Of course, there's the action sequences.  While the pod race seems almost out of place in this movie, it is indeed a great action scene to watch, especially with surround-sound.  And of course, the three-way lightsaber battle at the end is absolutely stunning to watch, but seems too scripted. The beauty of Luke and Vader's fighting was that it looked raw for the most part.  Here it looks like the actors are running through a series of motions, even though they do breath life and copious energy into it.And it's always good to see some old friends like Yoda hanging around.All in all, this movie is worth seeing, and the DVD is definitely worth purchasing if only for the huge amount of extras and behind the scenes material.

Even if it were on par with any of the original three, it wouldn't live up to expectations.  C'mon people, lighten up.  Like any movie, you have to appreciate the good and just accept the bad.  The moment reviews started popping up left and right in 1999, it almost seemed vogue to bash Episode 1.  In a way this overwrought negativity has made it easier for Attack of the Clones -the public was seemingly brought back down to earth by the problems with Phantom Menace.  Of course, at the same time it also puts pressure on AOTC to make up for many people's disappointment last time.Did I like Phantom Menace?  Yes, I did.  Was I disappointed in it?  Of course, but I didn't really think about it much until a while after I exited the movie theatre.  I still felt some of the magic I had experienced the first time around with the classic trilogy at a much younger age, but something was off.Just the over-merchandising of the whole event left a bad taste in my mouth even before I saw the picture.  Everything was overdone, from the product tie-ins, to the heavy toy production, to the inflatable Darth Maul lawn chairs -it was just ridiculous.

Also, Claire Forlani turns in a luminous performance, as does Anthony Hopkins (as always).There are two elements from the original play which I miss in this remake.  One is that the premise of the story is that Death appears in human form in order to find out why humans cling so desperately to life.  The other is that nothing on earth dies while he is on 'holiday.'  I realize these concepts don't fit well with the 'Hollywood-ized' happy ending, but I do feel they're at the core of the story. In all the stage versions and both earlier filmed versions, I found the premise of the girl (originally Grazia, then Peggy) being one who constantly defies--and seeks--death, who then goes with him, a very romantic ending.  It always felt as if she became immortal.  Oddly, in all film versions, the role of Death has been miscast.  Brad Pitt is quite wooden, March silent-movie stiff, Markham a little too ingratiating.  Onstage, this role is usually cast with a true romantic leading man handsome, suave, sensual. This does help make the whole story work.

In so many super hero movies (cough cough Batman cough cough) the rationale used to explain why the superhero or the villain chooses the life that they do seems far-fetched, but you excuse it because its a superhero movie.  In Spider-Man, however, we can really believe that Peter Parker would be compelled to become the Amazing Spider Man because of the series of events that led to his Uncle's death.The casting was excellent as well.  While many people said that Toby Maguire was wrong for this role, whoever chose to cast him knew what they were doing.  People forget that Spider-Man is essentially a nerd.  A skinny and innocent looking actor is perfect for this role.  William DeFoe did an amazing job with his role, especially the scitzophrenic conversation he has with his own reflection.  The rest of the cast does a good job as well.Something that my friend pointed out to me about this movie that I thought was very interesting was that Spider-Man never kills anyone.  All the villains die by their own actions, which makes sense since the character of Peter Parker seems too harmless to actually kill anyone.  He's out to defend people, never to take the offensive.There are some problems.  There are plot holes, like the fact that the police come to arrest Spider-Man when he hasn't done anything, but they are forgivable.

Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has hit the big screen. The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world. I saw the last showing of it with my friends because every other showing was sold out and the showing i saw was packed and filled with Spidey fans and excited movie goers alike.*POTENTIAL SPOILER* I just read this morning that Spider-Man achieved the highest opening day of all time with 41.5 million and is set to make about 100-120 million opening weekend which would make it surpass Harry Potter as the highest opening weekend of all time. *END SPOILER*. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books.Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker\/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman\/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles.One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character. Considering that we can't see his face at all when the mask is on, the fact that he still can give a masked character some heart is amazing in my bookKirsten Dunst isn't just there for eye candy, as the trailer would suggest. Sure, there are several shots of her that plenty of males will enjoy but she also brings her character from the comic book into the real world. Her chemistry with Tobey Maguire is not forced but very natural. There are certain moments when she falls into total damsel in distress mode but over-all it's a pretty grounded performance.James Franco makes for a very good Harry Osborn. He brings the character's struggles from the comic book and right onto the screen. We respect him because he's Parker's only friend but at the same time he makes you feel for him because he could end up as his father. Franco is able to this well and is very impressive in a few emotional scenes.Every comic book movie needs a good villian. Batman had the joker. X-men had Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Muntants. Spider-Man's greatest foe in the comic was none other than the Green Goblin. He gave Spider-Man the most conflict in the comic book because of the secret that he knew about Spider-Man and the secret that Spider-Man would eventually learn about him. It was very important that they not ruin this character because he's such an important villian in the Spider-Man mythology.I'm proud to say that Willem Dafoe is quite good as both Norman Osborn\/Green Goblin. He makes his Norman likable yet flawed in the beginning but once he turns into the Green Goblin, that's when the fun starts. His performances is borderline over the top but since it never crosses the line he makes the villian much more threatening. You can tell he had fun with the part and while he doesn't quite reach the level of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, he's right up there as one of the better comic book movie villians. What i also enjoyed was the fact that the villian never over-shadowed the hero. This is where Batman made its mistake. Jack Nicholson stole the show, but since Dafoe doesn't get as much screentime as Tobey Maguire, he doesn't steal show. I'm glad the filmmakers chose to do this.The CGI is a wonder to look at it. You will believe that a man can stick to roles and soar over the city with grace. It's like a comic book come to life. There are some shots that look pretty unrealistic but when you think about it i think they were going for that in a couple of shots. It feels more like comic book when you see certain shots like that. Besides it would be very difficult to make this believeable with the use of a lot of CGI. The characters never lose their depth when they're in costume and the voice over work done when it's obviously not a man but a special effect is quite good as well. The actors deserves major kudos for making their characters believeable, even when it's a CGI shot.Sam Raimi is a gifted director. From genre films like the Evil Dead series, to compelling films such as A Simple Plan and The Gift, his work never ceases to amaze me. He handles the material well and you can tell he followed the comic book closely. He makes Spider-Man move much like he does in the comic book and he makes sure that there is more time spent on developing an actual story than giving us a lot of action. There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong but the story in my opinion is it's greatest highlight because you can almost identify with all of the characters. This credit should go to screenwriter, David Koepp, who also did well with the Panic Room script. Raimi does offer some campy touches. The wrestling match features a cameo with Bruce Campbell as the announcer, you may remember him as Ash from the Evil Dead movies, The towns reaction to Spider-Man is very campy and cheesy but is handled well. You can tell Raimi really had fun with the material. The J Jonah Jameson character is another example. Out of most of the supporting characters he looks more like his comic book character. The performance is doen pretty well and he does offer us some nice campy laughs.Spider-Man is more than a summer movie. Most summer movies supply you with much action but a little of everything else. This movie has it all. Action, romance, and a little heart too. The film leaves it wide open for a sequel and by the end of it i couldn't wait to go on another adventure with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!

The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world.

There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books.Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker\/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman\/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles.One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character.

X-Men was closer, but was weighed down by its sheer number of characters.Enter Spiderman.  Go ahead.  You know you want to say it.  It's AMAZING! Let's start from the infrastructure.  Rosemary Harris (Blow Dry), was virtually unknown despite her long distinguished career in movies, television and the theatre, where she was nominated for a Best Actress Tony (she lost to her daughter).  She is perfect as Aunt May, conveying a interior strength and complexity that coexists gracefully with her soft-spoken exterior.  Add in J. K.

Again, he was exactly the way I pictured J. Jonah Jameson. Randy The Macho Man Poffo as Bonesaw McGraw, Larry Joshua uncredited (Cop Rock, For Love of the Game) as the unscrupulous fight promoter, and even Cliff Robertson as the ill-fated Uncle Ben, all add to the remarkable synergy that never misses a beat.Now the first string.  The sheer genius of selecting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker\/Spider-Man was the best way possible to provide an axis for all the other talent to revolve around.  He is far and away the best young actor out there, and his understated yet always larger than life presence completely occupies the superhero persona. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko much have been chanelling Maguire forty years ago when they created Spiderman.  He is vulnerable, not in the hapless and ultimately hollow Clark Kent way, nor in the damaged and empty Bruce Wayne manner, but in a human and sympathetic way that allows us to empathize and identify with him unlike any other comic book to silver screen alter ego.The chemistry between Maguire and Kisrten Dunst is breathtaking, and the beauty of their star-crossed romance is tragic in the best literary sense, carried off to perfection under the surprisingly mature performances of Dunst and Maguire.Willem Dafoe is the ultimate comic book villian.  He is diabolical, and wears his thinly-vieled alter ego as transparently as a mist.  He is unrepentant and remorseless as all true villians must be.  Dafoe is one of the many casting coups that make this masterpiece work.Sam Raimi, who has had his greatest success as a producer, directs Spider-Man with the skill of a maestro, and delivers an instant classic that works frame to frame from beginning to end in seamless perfection.It was worth all the anticipation, worthy of all the hype, and satisfying in every way.

Simmons, whom we have all loved to hate for years as the unctuous Vern Shillinger on HBO's Oz, but may be better known as Dr. Emil Skoda on television's Law and Order.  Again, he was exactly the way I pictured J. Jonah Jameson. Randy The Macho Man Poffo as Bonesaw McGraw, Larry Joshua uncredited (Cop Rock, For Love of the Game) as the unscrupulous fight promoter, and even Cliff Robertson as the ill-fated Uncle Ben, all add to the remarkable synergy that never misses a beat.Now the first string.  The sheer genius of selecting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker\/Spider-Man was the best way possible to provide an axis for all the other talent to revolve around.  He is far and away the best young actor out there, and his understated yet always larger than life presence completely occupies the superhero persona. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko much have been chanelling Maguire forty years ago when they created Spiderman.  He is vulnerable, not in the hapless and ultimately hollow Clark Kent way, nor in the damaged and empty Bruce Wayne manner, but in a human and sympathetic way that allows us to empathize and identify with him unlike any other comic book to silver screen alter ego.The chemistry between Maguire and Kisrten Dunst is breathtaking, and the beauty of their star-crossed romance is tragic in the best literary sense, carried off to perfection under the surprisingly mature performances of Dunst and Maguire.Willem Dafoe is the ultimate comic book villian.  He is diabolical, and wears his thinly-vieled alter ego as transparently as a mist.  He is unrepentant and remorseless as all true villians must be.  Dafoe is one of the many casting coups that make this masterpiece work.Sam Raimi, who has had his greatest success as a producer, directs Spider-Man with the skill of a maestro, and delivers an instant classic that works frame to frame from beginning to end in seamless perfection.It was worth all the anticipation, worthy of all the hype, and satisfying in every way.  Absolute perfection.  My Spider Sense is already tingling for the sequel.

After hoping and waiting for more than a decade, Columbia Pictures finally resolved the legal issues and announced that they were going to bring the beloved `Spiderman' to the big screen. Usually I don't get too excited over new movie projects, but this one I really got into the hype. The trailers ran the gambit from being terrible to awesome with each new version.It seemed to have all the elements in place to be a really good, if not great superhero movie. So why, oh why, didn't I like it? What went wrong?I can't remember the last time I left a theater feeling as let down and disappointed in a film as I was in this. I was pretty speechless when folks asked me what I thought, I couldn't quite verbalize why I didn't like it or how I felt. Now after thinking about it for a few days, I now know why.Let me say `Spiderman' wasn't a `bad' movie. But it certainly wasn't great or even above average; it was a perfectly `pedestrian', run of the mil ho-hum movie, that didn't have a single moment in it that makes you go `wow'! Most of the movie's wow moments are in the trailers, which have been shown hundreds of times. It plays it safe and doesn't take any chances to be great or push any boundaries, which is what great movies do and what `Spiderman' should have aspired to do.For those who have lived under a rock and don't know, `Spiderman' is based on the beloved Marvel Character created four decades ago by the `infamous' and creative genius Stan Lee and Marvel Character designer Steve Ditko.`Spiderman' tells the story of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a teenager who was raised by his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). He's an awkward kid, who typifies the standard nerd `cliché', he's poor, he's bullied by the school jock, Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello), ignored by the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and are best friends with the local rich kid, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whom he befriended during tutoring sessions.During a class school trip to a hi-tech genetics research facility, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider and his life suddenly changes. He gains all the `proportional' abilities of a spider; which includes superhuman strength, the ability to spin webs, superhuman reflexes, the ability to cling to any surface, and a nifty thing known as `spider senses' &#150; which warns our hero of impending danger. Can someone answer a question for me? If spiders have all of these abilities why are they so damn slow and easy to kill?At first Peter doesn't realize what is happening to him until he finds himself involved in yet another fight with Flash. When he is able to effortlessly dodge all of Flash's punches and knock him out with one punch, he's just as surprised as everyone else. Imbued with excitement over his newfound powers he wants to turn use his `gift' to make money by becoming a wrestler. After being stiffed by the wrestler promoter, (Lying wrestling promoters? I'm shocked! Shocked!), he let's a thief who robbed the promoter escape.Later that night, that very same thief shoots and kills his beloved Uncle Ben. In anguish Peter remembers something his uncle told him `With great powers, come great responsibility.' At that moment he vows to help the helpless and `blah, blah, blah'While all of this is going on, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), Harry's domineering and `distant' industrialist father is having some issues at work, he's about to lose a major military contract to a rival company if they cannot deliver a `super-soldier' serum to the government in a few days. His chief scientist tells them that in all their lab tests, the subject's where genetically enhanced to display superhuman strength, hearing, etc&#133;.but the side effect is, all the mice went insane (How do you know a mouse is insane?) and displayed a marked increase in aggressive behavior. Well of course, never having watched an evil scientist movie, and being desperate, Norman decides to test the serum on himself with the standard results. The experiment goes bad and he becomes an insane madman known as the Green Goblin (more on this later).The movie does a pretty good job of telling Spiderman's origin, although it should have and could have done it in a lot less time than the 20 or 30 minutes it takes. It bogs the movie down. The `back story' seemed empty and stilted. Maguire's acting was ok, but he didn't quite have the raw star power or presence that was needed to anchor this film. But then, in the comic book (which I collected for 10 years) the Peter Parker `character' was never really all that interesting. He was only interesting because he was Spiderman. He used Spiderman to show an alternate side of himself - a confident, `fun loving' superhero, who would have a ton of zingers and funny quips that would drive the bad guys crazy. The character and personality of Spiderman was totally lost in this film. This Spiderman was more like `Batman', than the comic book Spiderman.Kirsten Dunst was fabulous as Mary Jane Watson and the chemistry between the two were good as well. Unfortantely the rest of the cast is nowhere near as good as Dunst and Maguire are, with the notable exception of J.K. Simmons dead on `impersonation' of the cigar chomping gruff, blowhard, J. Jonah Jameson &#150; publisher of `The Daily Bugle'. Who uses his newspaper as a soap box to trash and discredit `Spiderman'.What was director Sam Raimi thinking when he horribly miscast Joe Manganiello as Flash Thompson, but his worst sin was James Franco as Harry Osborn. Franco looked as if he ate bad cabbage, or tasted sour milk and that was the only expression that he displayed throughout the entire film. Why was he picked? Was it his resemblance to Harry Osborne?On paper, Willem Dafoe was perfectly cast as `The Green Goblin'. But there is but so much you can do with a villain who was never that great to begin with. The Green Goblin was a ridiculous villain in the comic book, and he's even more so on the big screen. The goblin suit, had to be the worst, cheesiest looking monstrosity that I've ever seen on a big screen. It supposed to inspire fear, a sense of danger, instead it inspired fits of hysterical laughter whenever the goblin put in an appearance. It looked klunky, fake, and just totally ridiculous.As for the rest of the special effects, the night time sequences look fantastic, and the up close stunt work look fabulous and realistic, unfortunately the CGI in the movie looked really fake, especially the web swinging shots, which were plentiful, and some of the more `far away' shots. The heavy reliance on CGI is what robs Spiderman of his character, his humanity, and ultimately makes the film feel `hollow' and dare I say `cheap'.Danny Elfman's music score was tame, borring, and non-inspiring. It was the same recycled, derivitive, crap that he's done every since he did the excellent score for Batman.While watching `Spiderman' I kept feeling like I was watching the old `Spiderman' series from the 70s, just blown up to the big screen, and I kept thinking how cool this would be on television. Something you should never be thinking during a summer blockbuster, especially a superhero film. `Spiderman' is the perfect cookie cutter, carefully `packaged' corporate product.
