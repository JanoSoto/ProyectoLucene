But when a film comes along that is perfectly plotted, scripted, acted, shot, scored and directed with not a single moment flubbed or wasted, then you know you have something very special. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is such a movie. Whether by accident or design, the name Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (wordy though it is) has a clean rhythmic structure there are exactly two syllables in every word and four words, or two multiplied by two, in total. Everything comes together perfectly in this film and fits together with a cohesiveness every bit as pleasing - but immensely more satisfying - than the words, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. If ever there was a film that exemplified the perfect translation of existing visual mediums (comic book\/cartoon) to the big screen, then this would be it.For starters, Steve Barron's direction is sprawling and assured everything from kinetic fight sequences to tender character moments are executed with equal aplomb. John Fenner's photography is the perfect match from murky sewers to dingy streets to hazy warehouses to beautiful outdoor country, his lens captures everything it needs to time and time again. Roy Forge Smith's production design, in concert with Gary Wissner's art direction - and on a shoestring budget - is also everything anyone could ask for few films have the same consistently gritty verisimilitude to them. The use of bold green and white opening titles - with establishing shots of the sewers - shows enormous reverence for the source material and accentuates the notion that one is watching a comic book brought to life. And if you think those are real sewers, think again! Even the Turtle suits are extremely impressive with fully articulated mouths, subtle skin tones and bulging muscles. Visually, this film is inspired.It's inspired in almost every other sense, too. The casting is, without exception, pitch perfect. In particular, it's hard to imagine anyone else voicing Donatello and Raphael other than Corey Feldman and Josh Pais. Judith Hoag is also perfectly cast as April. Only 21 at the time of filming, Hoag projects the aura of a woman significantly older and wiser than her but every bit as youthful and vulnerable. Elias Koteas also impresses as Casey. A scene of him relaxing on a bench whilst chewing an apple is worth the entire endeavour. And there's one person often overlooked here Michael Turney brings in a very understated performance as confused teenager Danny. Why he hasn't had more work remains a mystery. None of the performances would mean much, however, without a solid story backing them up...Although essentially a good vs evil morality tale, TMNT does not play a forceful hand. In the dayglow coloured cartoon, the Turtles were crudely rebranded as Heroes; TMNT restores the more appropriate Ninja wording and shows the Turtles as essentially heroic without trumpeting them as heroes (they do good things but their driving force is the recovery of their master and not the saving of a populace from the clutches of evil). The antagonists are not overtly bad, either the majority of them are, in fact, alienated kids. Only The Shredder seems unequivocally bad but his screen presence is so gripping that it hardly seems to matter. The script itself is an exciting and finely tuned blend of master philosophy, rapid-fire punchlines and real human drama. For a film about four walking, talking turtles, one might not expect much subtlety but one would be wrong. For example, after being at each other's throats in previous scenes, Casey and April enjoy a quiet moment together in the latter half of the film before the Turtles show up and interrupt them. In this blink and you'll miss it moment, Casey relates to April that he played professionally until getting injured; April in turn relates, with genuine sincerity, that she's sorry. It's such a short moment - and it's acted with such softly spoken dialogue - that it can be easily missed. But short as it is, it speaks tomes about the unfolding love between April and Casey and April and Casey as individuals (particularly Casey who is such a guarded character through most of the film).The allocated review space on IMDb is coming to an end... and there's so much more to say. Thankfully, some very open-minded and observant people have already said most of it for me. About the only crucial ingredient I've not yet touched upon and feel I should is the music. Like the direction and photography, John Du Prez's score takes in a range of styles (instrumental, electronic, synthesised) and enriches the film with its presence. A noteworthy highlight is the film noir-ish string arrangement he uses when the Turtles return home to find it ransacked in tandem with the liberated camera which pans around Raphael, it makes for a quality of artistic expression that cinema often aspires to but rarely achieves. The 1990's was one of the most exciting decades - if not THE most exciting decade - of film there has ever been. Even though critics will only gush about the other two in this sentence, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, along with Goodfellas and Dances With Wolves, got the decade off to the best possible start.More than worth your time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles deserves a place in your DVD collection if you claim to treasure the medium of film.

Working on his own screen play, he was obviously the right person to be at the helm of this fine film. It appears that he got a lot of help, not only of his own brothers, but from a lot of well meaning people in this production.If you haven't watched the film, maybe you should stop reading.The film focuses on Kieran Johnson, the Chicago schoolteacher, ones encounters at the beginning of the movie with his students. His sick mother, Fiona, is being taken care at home by a daughter, and Kieran helps in his own, limited way. Watching his mother in her sick bed motivates him to go to Ireland in a voyage to discover a part of his life which he never knew.Upon arrival, accompanied by his nephew, they go to the rural area where his mother rears from. They get to stay at a modest bed and breakfast run by a greedy man. Seamus' old mother holds the key to the mystery surrounding how he came to be born and to know the truth about what happened to his mother. In the process we are taken in flashbacks to another era.Kieran O'Day, is a young man working in a small farm with the Meaneys. Beautiful Fiona is a local girl living with a widowed mother. It's obvious from the start these two like one another in more ways than meet the eye. The local town is dominated by the ruthless priests that see smut and lewdness in every one in the small town. In fact, most of what derails the lives of all of the people in the story seems to have been caused by the narrow mindedness of the clergy that held such a grip in the Irish society of the time.Kieran and Fiona eventually realize the love they feel for one another, but fate will come between them in unexpected ways. The film ends in tragedy, as Kieran Johnson gets to know that O'Day was his father and what became of him.In a lovely sequence, we watch as young Kieran and Fiona make a detour to a nearby beach because the car they've been traveling breaks down. While walking in the beach, they witness as a single engine plane come for a landing near them. They meet the American pilot, Eddie Sharp, a National Geographic photographer, who is taking pictures of Ireland. It's a lovely moment where the would-be-lovers interplay with the stranger and all seem to be at peace. Eddie is responsible for taking the only picture where Kieran and Fiona are seen together. That is the only clue left for their son to go on his search for their past.The amazing, largely Irish, cast do an outstanding job in recreating the people in the story. Moya Farrelly, the lovely young Fiona, is one of the best things in the film. Aidan Quinn, as Kieran, delivers a good performance in his portrayal of this lonely man of the country who finds love that proves to be fatal. James Caan, as Kieran Johnson, has some good moments, but of course, he is only seen in a few key scenes. John Cusack's contribution as the friendly aviator is one of the highlights of the movie.The supporting cast makes the film what it is. Colm Meany, Donald Donnelly, Gina Moxley, Brendan Gleeson, Stephen Rea, Moira Deady, among others, are the main reason for watching the movie.

It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon. In the film Hitchcock demonstrates a fascination with restricting the action to a single set. He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. It is an approach that would bring most directors to their knees, but Hitch rises to the challenge admirably, finding ingenious ways to maintain audience interest and providing a ceaseless undercurrent of excitement.A passenger ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat sinks in the Atlantic Ocean. Well-groomed society lady Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead, in an absolutely outstanding performance) successfully mans one of the sunken ship's lifeboats and steers it around the debris in search of survivors. She picks up various types from the sea, including injured sailor Gus Smith (William Bendix), crewman John Kovac (John Hodiak) and the German U-Boat captain (Walter Slezak) whose own submarine was critically damaged in the attack. The dynamic of the group is severely strained by the German's presence, as the other survivors contemplate and argue over whether to toss him to the sharks, or put their trust in him to steer their lifeboat to safety.Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret. Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery. This keeps tension on a knife-edge throughout the film, and holds the viewer in suspense for the whole story. Similarly, Bankhead's casting is so unorthodox, her character so intentionally ill-fitting to the oceanic setting, that her role in the proceedings casts a strange fascination. The film has a lot of political and propagandist subtext, and many people have viewed it as an allegory of the Nazi rise in Europe (Slezak is the metaphor for Nazi Germany; the others metaphors for surrounding nations duped into believing that the Nazi neighbour in their midst is helpful and trustworthy). Whatever else Lifeboat can and can't be interpreted as, one thing is certain - it's a mighty fine movie!

The dynamic of the group is severely strained by the German's presence, as the other survivors contemplate and argue over whether to toss him to the sharks, or put their trust in him to steer their lifeboat to safety.Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret. Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery. This keeps tension on a knife-edge throughout the film, and holds the viewer in suspense for the whole story. Similarly, Bankhead's casting is so unorthodox, her character so intentionally ill-fitting to the oceanic setting, that her role in the proceedings casts a strange fascination. The film has a lot of political and propagandist subtext, and many people have viewed it as an allegory of the Nazi rise in Europe (Slezak is the metaphor for Nazi Germany; the others metaphors for surrounding nations duped into believing that the Nazi neighbour in their midst is helpful and trustworthy). Whatever else Lifeboat can and can't be interpreted as, one thing is certain - it's a mighty fine movie!

It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon. In the film Hitchcock demonstrates a fascination with restricting the action to a single set. He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. It is an approach that would bring most directors to their knees, but Hitch rises to the challenge admirably, finding ingenious ways to maintain audience interest and providing a ceaseless undercurrent of excitement.A passenger ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat sinks in the Atlantic Ocean.

It takes a little concentration to separate the two different lives the main character is living until they finally change the hair color of the main character in one of her lives. I thought that was a nice touch to help you follow the story line. I was very surprised by the end. However, it is almost a testimony for how right time\/right place plays such a huge role in whether or not the happy things in life will succeed. Jeanne Triplehorn was absolutely vicious and wonderful as the foible for Gerry, the two-timer. John Lynch was successful at being the slimy two-timer.
