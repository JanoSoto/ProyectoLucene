I just got around to watching the 1981 original a couple weeks ago, believe it or not, and could understand why it was such a popular action adventure. Before watching this second film, I knew the first was the most popular in the series, and this one was the least popular of the first three, but that didn't mean I wasn't going to watch it. For over 50% of the film, I found that it wasn't as good as Raiders, but still very entertaining. However, I had been warned that it was darker and more violent than its predecessor, which eventually began to make a lot of sense! In 1935, Indiana Jones makes a trade with Chinese crime boss Lao Che in a nightclub in Shanghai, but the gangsters want to kill the archaeologist! He narrowly escapes with nightclub singer Wilhelmina Willie Scott, and with the help of his sidekick, a young Chinese boy named Short Round. The three of them leave Shanghai on a plane, unaware that it belongs to Lao Che! While they are asleep, the pilots get off the plane, leaving the three in peril! Indy, Willie, and Shorty escape the plane in an inflatable boat, landing on the slope of the Himalayas and sliding down into a river! They come to a village in India, where a sacred stone has been stolen and all the children are missing! The people believe that evil spirits are responsible for this, and the trio venture into a nearby palace to save the kids and retrieve the stone, but are headed for a terrifying experience! This prequel starts out showing Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, performing, which is a lot different from the beginning or Raiders, and I did not care much for it. After that, it gets better, with Indiana talking to Lao Che. This is where the suspense begins, and Harrison Ford still is charismatic as Indy. I quickly realized that Willie Scott is not a very good comic relief. I didn't find her as annoying as many others probably have, but didn't think she was that funny, constantly freaking out and complaining, and sometimes screaming a lot, like when she keeps seeing one jungle creature after another. Still, there are some mildly amusing parts, as this character does have her moments, and so does Short Round, played by Jonathan Ke Quan. For a long time, the film succeeds as an action adventure, with great action scenes, consistent suspense, and some nice special effects and sets, much like its predecessor. However, we eventually see a man getting his heart magically pulled out before he is lowered into a pit of lava, and then we hear screams as we see child slaves mercilessly lashed while they are forced to toil in the horrible underground chamber! Starting here, the film isn't so entertaining anymore.To me, the first hour of this movie seemed to go surprisingly fast, but after the brutality starts, the film drags a little. If it hadn't made this sudden change, I would at least be able to give this Raiders of the Lost Ark prequel an 8\/10. A highly entertaining action adventure turning into what is more like a brutal drama (with the child slavery scenes) is kind of like a mean trick! As a movie billed as an action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is obviously supposed to be fun, not a film to remind us of the cruelty of humanity! Don't let the PG rating fool you. Kids should not watch this movie with or without their parents! Apparently, it was one of the films that inspired the creation of the PG-13 rating, which is not surprising. I guess there was nothing in between PG and R before then, and of those two, Temple of Doom probably would have been better off with an R rating. So, while this film does have some good entertainment value, no wonder it's the least popular installment in the original trilogy!

It's really a classic and it brings back the good old days before CGI. And the moral is, nothing can replace great storytelling magic. Long live Jim Henson! Man, it's really got to be the highest point in his career, the muppets are so so real. I just love the way he breathes life into them! And they are all so unique! The storyline in Labyrinth is great and multi-layered - definitely a bit too complex for a child to understand. When I first watched it, I was 12 and it scared the hell out of me! And it was great to revisit it 20 years later and find that you have progressed and that you can understand the multi-fold depths of the film.I think David Bowie did a fantastic job (and I'm not even a David Bowie fan) playing a charismatic, manipulative and yet sympathetic villain. He did so great a job that at the end you are left feeling sorry for him, cos he didn't do anything wrong - he liked Sarah, he granted her first wish to take Toby away, gave her a second chance to get Toby back... he wanted to love beneath his seemingly evil facade. And I thought the songs were real good. the depths of the lyrics, wow, I didn't know David Bowie can be so profound! I found Sarah so courageous. It really strikes me, and how in the end she chose to face womanhood and adulthood maturely, accepting responsibility. I would have taken the easy way and stayed with Jareth, knowing that I'll get all my wishes granted.I think it's a great great movie, very profound and moving even though it's filled with muppets and targeted at kids being in the fantasy genre. It's definitely not dark, it's just deep. I actually rewatched to confront my childhood fears, didn't expect to stumble upon a cult of Labyrinth fans and even more rabid David Bowie fans who imagine fantasies of what could have been and what if Sarah ended up with Jareth. Hmm, wonder if they would feel the same way if Jareth didn't look like David Bowie but like some of his underlings! But somehow in spite of the age difference, the love story moved me greatly. I wonder why? Perhaps in all our secretest heart, we want a prince charming and live in a fairytale ending ever ever after instead of living in the real world, with its taxes, retrenchment, economic problems. So yeah Sarah chose bravely, I think I'm not so brave and I would have chosen differently.

Ironically, I've seen both Steve Zahn and Paul Walker in other things and liked their work (especially Zahn's), so you'd think I'd want to see them in this! I saw the horrible sequel DEAD AHEAD first and I think that in part is what kept me from watching this original. But I forgot one thing...sequels are RARELY as good as the originals, if they are good at all! And, boy, is this original a keeper! JOY RIDE is a surprisingly scary (and funny!) psychological road film that gets off to a somewhat slow start with Lewis Thomas (Walker) about to embark on a road trip to pick up his girl Venna (Leelee Sobieski), but along the way he must bail his troublemaking older brother Fuller (Zahn) out of jail. Along the way, the Thomas boys play a CB prank on trucker named Rusty Nail and it backfires on them as it turns out Rusty is a certified loon! At first, I had a difficult time getting into the story as the first 30 minutes seemed to move at a snail's pace, but in reality, it is necessary to reel the viewer in with a calm start, then the explosion! From minute 31 on, pure entertainment! What surprised me most about JOY RIDE is that even though there are several cliché scenes and moment that one would expect in a movie like this, the result is anything but cliché! I found myself literally laughing out loud several times during the movie at genuinely funny human moments and interactions, like when the Sheriff went off on the brothers after their hotel prank on Nail. That monologue was genuinely humorous and the delivery by the actor was spot on! There was also a diner scene where the boys were forced to walk in in their birthday suits and the dialogue for the punchline was cliché as heck, but the timing and delivery of it by the waitress produced perhaps the most laugh-out loud moment of the film. I was amazed at how much attention to detail was given to the minor characters in the film and this helped me rate it so high! A lot of movies, even good ones, just dismiss their smaller roles and give them thankless lines, but this one treats all characters like REAL people! Zahn is quite frankly hilarious in this. He really shines several times in the film and has a great sense of comic timing, yet he still does a good job with the suspenseful moments as well. Walker was really good as well and conveyed a real sense of fear and dread of their tormentor Nail. Sobieski is surprisingly good and wasn't (as I expected) a distraction to the plot and had some really good lines and moments herself. And what really made Rusty Nail effective was using the voice of Ted Levine (the creepy Buffalo Bill from SOTL).JOY RIDE definitely pays direct homage to Steven Spielberg's masterful DUEL with the road chase scenes of Rusty's mammoth truck terrorizing the youngsters and him being an unseen presence for most of the film. There are also several eerie night time motel scenes that might just remind viewers of another little film called PSYCHO! If you're going to copy a formula into an effective thriller, those are the films to copy from. Highly recommended!

And what really made Rusty Nail effective was using the voice of Ted Levine (the creepy Buffalo Bill from SOTL).JOY RIDE definitely pays direct homage to Steven Spielberg's masterful DUEL with the road chase scenes of Rusty's mammoth truck terrorizing the youngsters and him being an unseen presence for most of the film. There are also several eerie night time motel scenes that might just remind viewers of another little film called PSYCHO! If you're going to copy a formula into an effective thriller, those are the films to copy from. Highly recommended!

For some reason it has taken me some time to be able to see this one, so expectations have been building up for some years now. I must say, I haven't been disappointed.The cinematography is, as always, beautiful, sometimes spectacular. The opening scene is especially daring. A tracking shot, from a crane, lasting several minutes, switching focus, back and forth, between a pedestrian couple and a moving car. It seems impossible, but it works beautifully.The cast is also very attractive. It stars the somewhat robust Charlton Heston and the attractive Janet Leigh. Heston is a young, idealistic law enforcer (Vargas), who is surrounded by characters of a more dubious nature. Welles' character, Hank Quinlan, being his counterpart. Joseph Cotten makes an appearance, as does Marlene Dietrich, in a great role. We follow Vargas in a struggle to maintain his righteousness and Quinlan as his mask drops, revealing a corrupt policeman.However, the excellent storyline learns that there's more to it than meets the eye. There's always a second, and then a third glance. We learn that Quinlan has good reason to work the way he has up to now. We learn that Vargas may not be able to uphold his clean status forever (I am not here as a policeman, but as a husband he proclaims towards the end of the movie, in a rage). In the middle of the movie, Vargas is in a grocery store, which is tended by a blind girl. The camera focuses repeatedly on a sign that reads If you're mean enough to steal from the blind, help yourself. This, obviously, supposed to be something of a motto for the movie. Who are the blind? Lady Justice, for sure. Also the wrongfully accused (But are there really any in this story?) But in the final scene it may be Vargas who tries to 'steal' from the 'blinded' Quinlan...As in The Trial, Welles shows his skills as a storyteller, one being able to enrich his story with morality and careful study of human behavior. The whole thing reminded me of No Country for Old Men, because of the story, but also the excellent cinematography. Both movies cross the American-Mexican border now and then. Of course, in Welles movie there's never any comedy.All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to watch a movie more than ten years old. It's excellent.

The music score in this film is great and it doesn't get much more epic than Hercules regaining his Godhood; the music at that point gave me chills; personally I don't really care for Disney Songs but the songs in this did prove to be quite enjoyable especially Go The Distance; another job well done by Disney.8\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"12 November 2009","score":"","review":" The film struck me as terribly real.

Richard Donner's film was doubtlessly inspired by William Friedkin's earlier classic The Exorcist, and, along with Friedkin's film, one of the absolute must-sees involving satanic kids. This simply is a film that works perfectly on all levels The most intriguing Horror topic is illustrated with a spine-chilling and fascinating premise, and executed brilliantly on all levels. The film is an incredibly atmospheric, persistently suspenseful and genuinely creepy Horror Thriller and an intelligent Drama at the same time. The fascinating story is brought to screen with greatness in all aspects, be it the ingenious settings and cinematography, the constantly high suspense-level, the great acting or the tense atmosphere which is underlined by a simply unforgettable score.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American Ambassador in Rome. When his unconscious wife Catherine (Lee Remick) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, Thorn can't bring himself to tell her. At the suggestion of a priest, he exchanges his dead son with another newborn boy, whose mother has died in childbirth, making his wife believe the healthy boy is hers. Both his real son, who died, and the the other boy whom he accepts as his son were born under a bad Omen it is the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month; the year is 1966. The couple name the boy Damien... Five years later, the Thorns have moved to London, where Robert has become the U.S. Ambassador to England. With Damien's fifth birthday party, mysterious things begin to happen around the boy...The Omen is one of several 'demonic child' films from the 70s, but, in my humble opinion it is definitely one of the best ones. Personally, I would even say it surpasses both previous films that it is most often compared to Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby (1968) and Willaim Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973). These two films are both classics, no doubt, but while Rosemary's Baby has dated a bit, and also has its lengths, and the Exorcist has many unforgettably creepy moments but sometimes lacks cohesion, The Omen is incredibly suspenseful from the beginning to the end, and its coherent and extremely creepy script is brought to screen in a brilliant manner in all parts of the film, forming a stunningly uncanny and tense wholesome. The film has an intensely creepy atmosphere and a constantly gloomy feeling of doom from the beginning. The story simply is very creepy as such, and director Donner brings it to screen in a manner that is truly magnificent. The photography, choreography and settings, and, maybe most memorably, the brilliant, spine-chilling score - this film's atmosphere is rich in all aspects. At the same time, The Omen is also a compelling and highly intelligent film with complex characters. The acting is superb. Gregory Peck's reputation as one of the greatest actors ever in cinema is no coincidence, and he is once again brilliant here. Great performances also come from the other cast members, such as Lee Remick who plays the wife, David Warner, or Patrick Troughton, who plays a great little role and whom fellow Horror fans will also know for his roles in Hammer's films such as Scars of Dracula. Utmost praise has to be given to then-six-year-old Harvey Stephens, who once again proves that children can be the creepiest of all Horror creatures. His performance is scary and very powerful, one of the truly memorable child-performances in Horror cinema. The film mainly builds up suspense through plot and atmosphere and isn't very action-packed. Yet it includes several highly memorable disturbing and gory moments. The ingenious decapitation sequence is only one of them. The Omen is an absolute must-see for all Horror-fans and film- lovers in general. A remake was done in 2006, but I will probably never watch it (recent Horror remakes tend to make me angry). This original is a spine-chilling occult masterpiece that must not be missed... by anyone!

The music, acting, story, humor make this movie. The acting from Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery,Norman Reedus were excellent and they deserve to have credit for this film. The worst thing about this movie is...... Nothing. That's what i hate about his movie that there is nothing to hate.

It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just liked it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc &#x96; in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word timeless if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech video game he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors\/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and\/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sex&#x85;I love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made.
