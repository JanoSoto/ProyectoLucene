The stunts, the effects, the black suits and shades- The Matrix is dripping awesomeness. But unlike many other action and sci-fi movies, The Matrix has brains.The plot of The Matrix is like Terminator for the internet generation. Man created machine, machine rebelled, machine won. Human survivors fight machines in a constantly dark, post-apocalyptic world. But the machines created the matrix, a giant computer program where the farmed humans' minds live their 'lives'. It's complicated, but it all makes sense. The Matrix's plot demands brain and eye attention.The actors are perfectly chosen. Keanu Reeves in a role where he's supposed to be quiet and badass? Perfect! He was made to be Neo. Laurence Fishborne aces the wise leader, and he busts his chops during the interrogation. Hugo Weaving is really the show stealer though his Agent is so menacing, and when he opens up to Morpheus, it's very tense.This is an action movie, and boy is there action. The martial arts scenes are so incredible, and the insanity allowed because of the setting makes them even better. Running air kicks? Punches that break walls? It's all cool in the matrix. And the gunfights the iconic lobby shootout, and the even more iconic bullettime gives The Matrix identity in a sea of sci-fi.The action is boosted by the success of the effects. Agent bullet dodging, the explosions, the rippling bullets, your jaw will drop. The fluff effect in the lobby is so cool too. It made me wonder why this has never been seen in 3D. Also, the CGI machines are terrifying and realistic.You should see The Matrix, benchmark of sci-fi films for the past decade. Matching brawn with brain, you really can't miss this modern classic. 9.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 23The Matrix is an unreasonably awesome movie.

Maybe it was because the DVD version of Dawn of the Dead was the same as my director's cut version (which is cut), or maybe, more realistically, it was due to the fact that the version of NOTLD (which is how overweight virgin internet reviewers like to call it) was some f*cking b*stardized 1999 version with new footage added.A name cropped up in this new version. Bill Hinzmann. Now, 99% of the population have better things to do than know what this guy is all about. Us 1% that do care know that he was the original zombie in NOTLD (which is how etc)...who also made an eighties movie called Zombie Nosh about his character from NOTLD (which zzzzzz). Now the moron, along with original writer John Russo made a version of NOTLD (whi) that has new footage and takes 15 mins of footage out of the original. Because there's no copyright on NOTLD (w) and therefore any spazzy out there can do what the f*ck they like to NOTLD. So do you know why I did? That's right. I wiped my *rse on this particular version of NOTFLD and went out and bought the proper version for 2 quid.Which leads me to this review. Maybe one day I can watch the 30th anniversary edition withoutexpelling my lower intestinal tract out my ringpiece in a wide purple tubed arc in my living room, but not just now. Let's stick with the original.Barbara and Johnny head for a graveyard to pay tribute to their wasted dad who lives in a grave three hours' drive from their house, but once they get there BILL HINZMANN who is a zombie attacks them and you know the drill. Johnny gets wasted and Barabaararararara head for the farmhouse where, upon finding a stronger character called Ben, she just zones out and lets him do all the work.It's great this movie. Even though it's ancient, and in a geeky way doesn't adhere to the rules of zombieness, it's still great. You can never go wrong with loads of menace and shouting (see Al Pacino's career). There's not that much gore in here, but in my opinion the fact that the cast sit down to watch telly half way through the film just about sums the future up.....Anyways if you haven't seen it. See it. It only cost me two pounds. Any problems, I'll give you Bill Hinzmann's address and you can kick his head in.It's in black and white too, which isn't a problem to me but seems to fry certain brain circuits of people posting reviews on the IMDb.'i love notld its great but black n white but a kid kills its mom see it now' ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I had a bad feeling when picking up the Trilogy of the Dead boxset...can't quite explain it but it was there.
