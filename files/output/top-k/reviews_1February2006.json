Orwell's narrative is first and foremost an internal one, what is more, his characters must be careful not to betray their thoughts and feelings to others; this makes their effective translation to the screen rather difficult. The film-makers needed to be cleverer to succeed at this.The film's crumbling, bomb-scarred mise-en-scene and washed-out palette create an atmosphere of dismal oppression but never really invoke feelings of fear. The fear that Winston Smith's thoughts might be discovered is what lends tension to the book tension which is lacking in this film. John Hurt's beaten, cipher-like characterisation might ring true, but it hardly makes for engaging viewing (at least until he enters the torture chamber).Where is the sense of constant surveillance, of Big Brother's gaze? Where is the sense of liberation when Winston escapes this? 1984's world should, but does not, feel like a panopticon.The film also fails to make the love scenes between Winston and Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) suitably exciting and transportive. The tone of these scenes is hardly an improvement on the drudgery that precedes them. Indeed the rolling green hillside on which Winston first sees Julia undress, later becomes a motif for his torture-induced mental plane; this concordance is, I think, misconceived.Winston's little junk shop is another disappointment it has none of the nostalgic charm, none of feeling of a special place that is evoked by the book.I believe in judging a film for what it is; I am not interested in authenticity to whatever source material a film might draw from. I only make these comparisons because they are illustrative of the film's major failing the film is, as I've said, too flat; it is Orwell's novel drained of its gnawing tension and sensual releases.Winston's 'curing' constitutes a good third of the film a much larger proportion than it does in the book; Radford seems to have subordinated the novel's more natural tempo to the three acts mantra of the screenwriter's manual. The curing scenes just don't have the atmosphere to sustain them at their allotted length. The torturer's apparatus, including some hideously large rats, is complete, but the shooting of these scenes is so bland. Richard Burton's performance is passionless without sufficient compensating menace. Those who feel his chill feel only the chill of the circumstances his final film performance is sadly didactic and underwhelming.The film's final let down is the moment of Winston's breaking, which, after a slow build up, is skipped over far too glibly. The climax is, in a word, anticlimactic. An extreme close up, more fervour and volume in the delivery of John Hurt's lines, sound or visual effects something different needed to be done to add potency to this moment.The film finishes with an invented, rather dull epilogue. Something was needed, in this film at least, to demonstrate Winston's brainwashing, but this could have been more succinctly achieved.

Again (, or as a matter of fact for the first time in this movie-series,) the candy-stealin' bad guys are really bad, actually they behave like some braindamaged children and look like comic characters. They have long hair, they dress ridiculously and everything. They are ugly,but of course not as ugly as mr.Bronson. And for some reason they run all the time. Even Troma can't do anything as exaggerated and comically unrealistic as this. It's quite funny to see these future-good actors (here Jeff Goldblum, in the sequel Larry Fishburne) doing these far-out stupid roles. You can see how they steal the whole show, at least from the other motley cru members. But anyway, after the stupid start, the movie turns out to be much better than it first seems. As a matter of fact, at least to my opinion, it transforms almost to a different movie after the beginning.This is technically (as if such a thing would matter) better than the sequel; Photography is good, and of course the music, which is by Herbie Hancock. That alone might make the movie interesting to some people. It's also one of the very few movies, that has some scenes filmed with real snow (or fake snow that at least looks real). The movie is in every way more whole than the sequel. The film is overally deeper and much less nihilistic. One thing that makes Bronson's main character interesting, is how sick (althought seemingly normal and well-functioning) he is, at least at times, and of course for understandable reasons also. And it's also natural that in the sequel he's even sicker. (I have to check out some other sequel also.) There is some character development in this story; The main character learns things, and thinks about different possibilities (what to do\/what should be done with his life). It has interesting themes and juxtapositions Countryside\/City, Old\/New.It's funny how some pictures in this movie reminds of Taxi driver, which is made a year or two later. Maybe it's just New York (in the seventies). I don't know has Scorsese seen this before he made the classic, I think he has. Actually he maybe even made some homages to this film If I remember correctly, there is exactly the same kind of target board (with some mugger on it), which Travis shoots in Taxi driver and which here hangs very visibly in the police department's wall. Of course that could also be a coincidence. Of course the themes are also similar to some point, but that has to be put to the writer's account. I don't know when the Death Wish book has been published, and has Paul Schrader read it. Anyway it doesn't matter, because outside of the formalities these two movies don't have much similarities, and they surely are two totally independent works and both deserve their places in movie history. In any case it's interesting to see what kind of cultural atmospheres and grounds classics like Taxi driver has been made in. One more comparison In this film I like that it doesn't have any hurry (and still it doesn't last longer than one and half hours) In fact there isn't too much big happenings or big dramatic turns in the plot. I think Taxi driver would have to be at least an hour longer to get to this non-hurriness (, if it would still want to include the same events to the story).Actually I have nothing to complain about in this movie.

Overall I appreciated the grand visual style and the detail which really lifts this film into epic in my opinion. It adds realism and makes you wonder if it could be historically accurate. The film focuses on a love triangle between three main characters, and the acting by Walken, Kristofferson and Huppert is all good. I think the reputation of the film's production history has preceded it, and most negative comments seem to be by people who have already heard a lot of negative things about it. Now it is like a lost classic (IMO). I must add that I have not seen the longer version, nor do I feel compelled to do so, which is in no way a negative comment. The first time I watched the short version I was a little confused in some places i think, though i still liked it overall, and the second time it made perfect sense and felt as complete as it needed to be.

It is a classic story of protection and thinly disguised revenge that has tremendous satisfactory power, but Kurosawa knows enough to avoid over-simplifying the impact of his film by introducing fault into the characters being protected.It is never really proved whether or not Kikuchio's (Toshiro Mifune, a Kurosawa veteran) assertion that the farmers were not nearly as poor (and therefore unable to pay them) as they let on is actually true, but it introduces doubt as to whether they are perfect victims. This is, of course, a movie about people, not about two dimensional characters, and any forward thinking village is going to try to save up whatever wealth or food that they can compile in order to ensure their own survival. I won't pretend to understand completely what compels samurai to do what they do, to risk their lives for such little (if any) reward, but I know that it is something that is almost universally accepted by samurais, and if I'm not mistaken, the samurai that abandon that code are known as Ronin, a not very enviable title. The movie is definitely something of a commitment at three and a half hours, but it flows smoothly and it takes the time to get to know its characters, which allows it to present the real world so much more clearly, and I was surprised to find that one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film took place in the last minute or two of the movie. This is an intense anti-war film that allows you to identify with three different sides in battle, the victims, the protectors, and the oppressors (although that third not quite as much), and I think that one of the most important things that it does is that it provides a look into an ancient Japanese culture and makes an assertion about what may have happened that allowed for more flexibility in their culture rather than a strict adherence to established traditions, much like Chinua Achebe does in his novel Things Fall Apart, but I digress.One of the things that is introduced very early in the film is the fact that samurai are not entirely trusted by the villagers, and it is strictly forbidden that they mix with their culture, they are treated almost as subhumans, but their battlefield prowess is intensely desired. When a conflict arises about a local man's daughter becoming involved with a young samurai who is there to protect the village, he demands action and retribution, but the well-being of the rest of the village is deemed more important. There is a lot going on in the movie in terms of societal roles in Japanese culture, which affects the way things pan out in the movie (although Kurosawa was known for rebelling against such expectations, particularly later in his career), and like so many of Kurosawa's films, there is so much going at so many levels that multiple viewings of the film will reveal more and more things going on that went unnoticed on the first time.

It's a terrific story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. It is easy to see why It's A Wonderful Life has become a Christmas staple and one of the most beloved films of all time.Following the life of George Bailey of small-town Bedford Falls, It's A Wonderful Life actually begins at the end with George contemplating suicide. The angel Clarence is to be sent to persuade George to go on living but first Clarence must understand exactly who George Bailey is. So he, and we the viewers, are shown the life story of George Bailey. We see that young George was a man with big dreams, planning to go off to college and see the world. Then we see the twists of fate which will leave George forever trapped in Bedford Falls and finally we see what has led him to the darkest moment of his life. Through it all, James Stewart is brilliant in the role of George. This is a character who really evolved over time and Stewart's performance is terrific in conveying all the necessary emotions in tracing George's journey. And even when George is at his most desperate and not acting particularly nicely Stewart has been so charming, so likable, so seemingly good-at-heart, you can't help but root for him and that is key to the film's success. When George opines to the angel Clarence that the world would have been better off had he never been born we know how wrong he is before Clarence even gets the chance to try to convince him of just that.While Stewart's George is obviously the key figure the supporting cast is also top-notch, led by Donna Reed as Mary, the love of George's life. Wholesome yet positively radiant and endlessly charming, Reed makes it very easy for the audience to fall in love with her just as George has. Lionel Barrymore gives a memorable performance as the film's one true villain, the rich and rather obnoxious Mr. Potter. Barrymore proves the perfect foil to go up against the basic goodness we see in Stewart's character. Thomas Mitchell as the bumbling Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as the angel Clarence also do fine work. Bringing it all together, director Frank Capra really tugs at the heartstrings and ultimately delivers one of the most uplifting films of all time. Some of the situations and dialogue in the film may seem a little dated, perhaps even a little corny, by our modern standards. And some may feel It's A Wonderful Life is a little over-the-top in its goodness, almost too good to be true. If those are the worst things that can be said about a film then it must be quite a good film indeed.

Pretty much all the guys in the baby boomer generation fell in love with her when they saw this film in 1965, whether they were five or 25. And pretty much all the characters in the film fall in love with her as well. This was her first film targeted at the boomer demographic and her young appearance and relative obscurity were deceptive to her new fans. Six years later when Klute was released folks were staggered by how used up she looked, generally because everyone had just assumed that she was younger. In 1965 it was revolutionary for to see a film with such a strong, determined, brave, and resourceful young woman, especially for a western. Although Joan Crawford, Shelley Winters, and Peggy Castle had previously played tough saloon owners, there had never been anyone quite like Fonda's character. The times were a changin or at least beginning to change and this film both reflected and contributed to these changes.If you are thinking of watching Cat Ballou for the first time be aware that it has the standard 1960's western production design. Things are very studio back lot, very clean, and extremely orderly (insert not authentic here). And although classified as a comedy it is as much action\/adventure as comedy. The humorous elements are mostly supplied by Lee Marvin doing a parody of the heavy roles he usually played. Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole bookend the film as banjo playing western minstrels and also function as musical narrators who pop up within scenes throughout the movie, singing the story as it unfolds.

All in all it's a very good movie. The plot might have made more sense if I had seen it in the original language.10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"1 February 2006","score":"80 out of 106 people found the following review useful","review":" The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show Monk has become.Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as Monk, but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's Cinderella Man.For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.

His creative powers culminated in Evita in which the true life story of Eva Peron on stage is accurately enhanced by the projection of historical cinematic snapshots. The song The Art of the Possible, in which a game of musical chairs is used to represent the power struggle and eventual rise of Juan Peron in the Argentine military, is pure directorial brilliance. The staging and choreography for Peron's Latest Flame is likewise splendid. There are several other great moments provided by Prince and Fuller that also produce theatrical magic. The only drawback to their continued involvement is that today the production doesn't feel fresh anymore. The Bus-and-Truck-version that brought the Evita tour to Europe in 1989-1990 featured a dazzling Florence Lacey as Evita, an imposing Robert Alton as Juan Perón and a charismatic James Sbano as Ché, but was already then somewhat compromised by the reduction in size and orchestra. Still, Evita was a box office hit in Germany and the Benelux countries and made Flo Lacey the uncrowned queen of all Evitas. In this respect, the film adaptation is a treat big orchestra, huge choirs, lavish costumes and scenery, with Don't cry for me Argentina for the first time delivered by Madonna on the balcony of the Casa Rosada. All true and worthy of respect, only... the core competence and poignance of Evita is lost Jonathan Price is a sleepwalking Peron, morose and lethargic throughout the movie, Antonio Banderas is a plain Argentine student who bears little resemblance to the political Ernesto Ché Guevara. The complex psychological insights into the main characters drown into the opulence, the lushness, the screaming colours, the noise. In conclusion better see the concept musical with Hal Prince's utilitarian scenery which really puts the finger on it.

It may be lacking in character development and psychology, but it more than makes up for that with a brilliant concept have the villain as main character and make the audience his playful confident. The concept is aided further by eminently quotable lines and one great scene after the other of scheming, fiendishness and confrontations. One of the few pieces of criticism you can successfully throw at Shakespeare is that his central characters are often meek or feeble. Not so here! Tudor propaganda this might have been (it quite grotesquely disregards historical fact in a few places), this is storytelling at its finest.Richard Loncraine's 1995 film places the story in a fictitious 30s England reminiscent of early Nazi Germany. The device serves to make the proceedings more accessible (if only marginally since the original language has thankfully been preserved). It also makes for amusing situations (Richard of York telling his monologue while taking a leak in a public restroom - my Kingdom for a Horse! bellowed from a paralyzed jeep) and serves as further proof of the Bard's timelessness.Beyond the structural and technical feats - and they are quite excellent without exception, including Trevor Jones underrated dark jazzy score - lies what should be our main concern the cast. Sir Ian McKellen as Richard is a Machiavellian wonder, blowing both Lawrence Olivier's rendition and McKellen's earlier work away. His fiendish creation is a joy to watch and root for, despite the increasing gruesomeness of his crimes. The byzantine plot demands that recognizable faces be cast in supporting roles and the characters are magnificently portrayed by eminent actors giving it their best and succeeding admirably. Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent and Kristin Scott-Thomas are expectedly great, but the truly outstanding supporting performances come as surprises Annette Benning is all grief and fury, Adrian Dunbar is eerie yet very human as Richard's pet killer Tyrell and Nigel Hawthorne is incredibly moving as the meek Clarence.

A stupid waste it may be, but it'd be a shame if it overshadows the movie itself, as Robert De Niro's first stint as director provided the world with an excellent film, worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with any of the big players in the gangster movie genre.The movie tells the story of Calogero, a young Italian boy raised in the New York Bronx who has two very different father figures watching out for him. One is his birth father (De Niro), a low paid bus driver who doesn't want his only son to become involved in the wave of crime tainting the neighbourhood. The other is the local Mafia Kingpin Sonny (Chazz Palmintieri), who develops a bond with the boy when he refuses to rat on him following a murder in the street. As he grows up, he finds himself torn between these two distinct heroes who keep finding themselves at loggerheads, while violence in the neighbourhood threatens all of them.As the film plays out, the story becomes all the more riveting. De Niro is a triumph as always, but it is Palmintieri who really shines here. Sonny is perhaps the most human mafia Don the movies ever saw and his friendship with Calogero is really quite touching, despite the rift it creates with his birth father. But when all is said and done, Sonny has nothing but his best interests at heart, repeatedly encouraging him not to go down the same road he has and trying to steer him away from his rather deranged friends who seem fixated on becoming involved in crime.Whatsmore, the image of the Bronx we get is incredibly eye-catching, striking out like an urban wasteland of violence and dog-eat-dog ethics. Racial tensions between the minority groups manifest themselves in the street fights between Italian and African gangs, while a bar room brawl between the mafia and a bike gang early on leaves us in no doubt as to the hostile nature their world encapsulates.With the stereotypical depictions of many of the Mafia members (overweight Italians in vests with slick black hair engaging in 'business deals') remaining in place, A Bronx Tale covers familiar territory, but with the engrossing three way relationship between C and his two fathers, it also covers new ground.

William Nicholson's screenplay focuses on exactly what the title refers to the First Knight of Camelot. Portraying Lancelot as a nomad, the story line eventually brings in some of the classic characters, Malagant, Arthur, Guinevere, but leaves out the magic and the lore behind the traditional story.Witnessing Richard Gere portray Sir Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere takes some getting used to. However, Sean Connery as an aged King Arthur is a perfect fit too bad we don't see more of him.The scenery, story, soundtrack, and the performances are forgettable but the movie does have moments of each that make it worth watching. While this is a twist on an old myth, when the movie actually gets to the traditional story plots that we know and love you will recognize that this view of such a classic tale is a breath of fresh air.I recommend it for viewing but don't rely on it if you are going to be tested on Arthur the next day ;) ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2006","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" If you are an Arthurian purist you probably won't like this version of the classic tale.

I'm giving it a 1 because I think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put out such trash and the killer does not deserve this! It's a good thing it came late in his career... they said Elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for Jerry lee, had it come out some 15-20 years earlier! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis book and that's a shame to begin with. It's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with Lewis and there is far better books about the Killer, that could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! He is walking around in the picture, talking about his god-given talent and as a spectator, you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too! Silly gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. It's Grease all over again and whenever Jerry Lee take a ride around Memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music from it! Everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a damn shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the 500.000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f**k themselves... twice!
