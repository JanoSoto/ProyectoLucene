The people in Kicking and Screaming may indeed be satirized and heavily romanticized versions of people you'd encounter on a liberal arts campus on any given day - and for me, currently attending a liberal arts school, this one hit a bit too close to home - but their commonalities with their real life counterparts that you can't deny the satirical dial isn't turned up all the way past human recognition.The people in Kicking and Screaming are the type of people to put a sign on a pile of broken glass in their apartment identifying it as such rather than sweeping it up. They are the type of people who fear that their whole schedule will be thrown off irreparably when they move to Milwaukee, which poses a one hour time difference from their current location. They are the type of people to play impromptu games involving how many films involving monkeys they can name on the dime, as well as being the person to name all the Friday the 13th films the fastest with no assistance. Finally, they are the kind of people who think they're the only people going through the kind of quarter-life\/millennial identity crisis they are currently experiencing, and as such, feel better holding long conversations about living at home, getting drunk, masturbating, and repeating said events day-in and day-out until an opportunity's knocks are deafening or ambition hits them like a good buzz.We focus on four college pals Grover (Josh Hamilton), who breaks up with his girlfriend in the opening scene of the film when she reveals that she'll be bound for Prague in a few days, Max (Chris Eigeman), who often insights the ridiculous, aforementioned games, Otis (Carlos Jacott), who proclaims to only have two emotions, antsy and testy, and Skippy (Jason Wiles), who finds himself in that awkward stage with Miami (Parker Posey) between hooking up and going steady. After graduating, instead of moving on to bigger and better things, as many college graduates do, the four comrades remain on campus, happily indulging in the same food they condemned having to eat for the past four years and slumming around campus through endless nights of drinking and conversing about everything and nothing.The rapid-fire wit in Kicking and Screaming is probably the film's most laudable feature. Noah Baumbach has predicated a film, not so much on realistic conversation being that characters can often expunge a paragraph worth of ideas and ramblings without even breaking a sweat or stammering over their words, but on humorous and eminently quotable film that releases the confusing and often unorthodox mind of a young adult. Misery loves company and the reason Kicking and Screaming seems to resonate is its ability to speak the language most millennials understand and speak themselves - it's the language of anti-jokes and endless quirkiness in a manner that, initially seems condescending to outsiders, but is part of the broader comedy\/joke culture instilled in the youth of today.While we can reflect on the time when many of us didn't know where or what the hell we'd be, despite everyone, from friends to family, asking us that same question and our parents asking us when all that hard-earned money they spent was going to pay off, Kicking and Screaming plays it largely for laughs and the situational absurdity it deservedly earns. Despite this momentary bout of disillusionment and listlessness on part of a few wealthy, privileged white kids - who have spent their entire lives learning how to take and pass tests and quizzes and filling in bubbles on a Scantron - who are realizing their real world skills are crippled by a lack of know-how and ambition. As a result, when every option you can conjure seems either frighteningly far out of your comfort zone, irrational, or downright implausible, what else is there to do besides sit, drink, and contemplate.Kicking and Screaming is a film that pretty much showcases everything wrong, right, obtuse, and special about millennials in a way that uses all the devices they respond to - patronizing humor, sarcasm, and long conversations about absolutely nothing. While it can satirize them, it is not derogatory or mean-spirited towards them. The concluding monologue by Grover in front of an airport customs official has our main character stating how he wanted to do something daring with his life when he was young, while he still could and not be bound to family, finances, and immediate commitments. Those same words were probably coming out of the mouth of Noah Baumbach, who was twenty-five at the time of directing and co-writing (with Oliver Berkman) Kicking and Screaming.

I think the several one star marks it received, is a little harsh but OK, I'll try to highlight the good things about this movie rather than the bad. I've always been of the, if you haven't got anything good to say, don't say it, school of thought.I think some people watch movies needing them to evoke a strong emotional responses. They want to be moved, they want a journey, or at the very least they want the plot line to be extremely engaging & flawless; Godfather, Shawshank, Schindler's list etc&#x85; or those of similar ilk are classic examples. If a movie does not do that, or doesn't meet a preconceived criteria, they feel short changed. These are the I just wasted 90 minutes of my life people, the short attention span people, the people that fall asleep 10 minutes in unless there's a court jester juggling in the isle. They are not people that watch all kinds of movies all the time as their primary way of unwinding. When they watch a movie they want it to knock their socks off, pure & simple. A fair point, but Cocktail like many others, is not that kind of movie.Movies are like eating, there's something for every mood. I've been to New York & like millions of others, it's one of my favourite cities (where half of the movie is shot) & I've been to the Caribbean several times (where the other half is shot), both great locations. I love the electricity of a good bar atmosphere, having a few drinks & a wiggle, the prospect of maybe getting lucky, or at least getting drunk & having a sing song, don't we all? This movie includes all the above and more. The classic rock & roll sound track is great, Everly Brothers, Big Bopper, Little Richard, Hippy Hippy Shake etc... & there's some nice mellow reggae ones thrown in as well.For the above alone, this deserves more than 1 star. It was never meant to garner dozens of Oscar Nominations, set records or change the face of cinema, It's just good fun. We can vicariously live through Toms charming, cocky & confident Brian Flanaghan as he rises to the top of New York's upper east side bar scene & from then in the Jamaican paradise of Montego bay, lazily serving cocktails on the beach. And for the ladies there's plenty of romance.No major studios got behind this & it obviously didn't have a massive budget, so like a lot of movies around this time it suffers a bit with production values. There's a section where Cruise has obviously been called back for pickups to strengthen the interview montage at the start. He goes from Cocktail hair, to Rain Man hair, to Cocktail hair again. Same thing happens to Michael J. Fox in Secret Of My Success & that's one of my favourites. I find this comical more than anything else, it's just a period thing.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 November 2015","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Spoilers AheadI read so many attacks on this movie, I never understand why. It is very, very, funny. DeVito comes out from behind the camera where he struggled and returns to doing what he always did best being funny. There is a dramatic depth to the movie, a way of life is dying out. BB's partner has a heart attack and BB sees his future. A washed up aluminum siding salesman, all alone, with nothing to show for all those years. Even when DeVito tries to wreck BB's life by leaving him with his wife it doesn't work out well. The movie's dialog is the star here; both salesmen are embedded in social groups with annoying and irritating members (Mr. Breakfast, Mr. Bonanza). What is missed by many attackers on this film is these salesmen's inability to trust anything or anybody. They sling crap all day selling their overpriced siding and it cripples them emotionally. Maloney, BB's partner, right in the middle of one of their scams has a coronary. Levinson always has a deeply moral base to his movies like The Natural or Rain Man. Part of the reason this bombed is that people simply missed the costs of cheating people for a living. Levinson's moral theme is just not salient enough and the movie was accused of glorifying thieves like Used Cars. Maloney is the answer to that unfair charge. BB not only sees him damaged and all alone but filled with guilt leaving the business to become a shoe salesman.It features the great J. T. Walsh, one of the best character actors of the 1980's. Walsh always plays a creep like in House Of Games or The Grifters, Red Rock West. Here, he is the boss of DeVito's crew getting ready to groom declining salesman DeVito as the designated patsy for the government's investigative panel on aluminum siding sales scams. The banter is consistently funny and witty. The salesman's life of the up and down roller-coaster is not Glengarry Glen Ross but it is realistic. The feud between Devito and Dreyfuss, while hilarious, tended to obscure to viewers what Levinson is up to here. Both BB and Tilly are convinced that they are not effected by their dishonesty and swindling of customers. Tilly simply throws the IRS threatening paper out of the window; they have this Teflon psyche that soon proves to them how vulnerable they truly are. Tilly gets locked out of his own house, sleeping in his car, losing his wife; BB sees his lifelong partner almost die and comes to terms with loving someone outside himself which requires that unfathomable word for him Trust. We hear Tilly give the usual everyone is corrupt and evil, therefore my scams are standard procedure. It doesn't go well at the hearing. They have heard this crap before and goodbye sales license.No movie is perfect, The Fine Young Cannibals were thought, at this time, to be the next great musical group. Tragically, for Levinson, the group disappeared a couple years after this movie was released. They do the score, you will not enjoy it. All their songs sound exactly the same good luck understanding the words. Also, because it is so funny, the message gets lost in the movie long feud between Tilly and BB over the opening accident with Tilly ramming BB's new status symbol Cadillac.

The movie's dialog is the star here; both salesmen are embedded in social groups with annoying and irritating members (Mr. Breakfast, Mr. Bonanza). What is missed by many attackers on this film is these salesmen's inability to trust anything or anybody. They sling crap all day selling their overpriced siding and it cripples them emotionally.

Here, he is the boss of DeVito's crew getting ready to groom declining salesman DeVito as the designated patsy for the government's investigative panel on aluminum siding sales scams. The banter is consistently funny and witty. The salesman's life of the up and down roller-coaster is not Glengarry Glen Ross but it is realistic. The feud between Devito and Dreyfuss, while hilarious, tended to obscure to viewers what Levinson is up to here. Both BB and Tilly are convinced that they are not effected by their dishonesty and swindling of customers. Tilly simply throws the IRS threatening paper out of the window; they have this Teflon psyche that soon proves to them how vulnerable they truly are. Tilly gets locked out of his own house, sleeping in his car, losing his wife; BB sees his lifelong partner almost die and comes to terms with loving someone outside himself which requires that unfathomable word for him Trust. We hear Tilly give the usual everyone is corrupt and evil, therefore my scams are standard procedure. It doesn't go well at the hearing. They have heard this crap before and goodbye sales license.No movie is perfect, The Fine Young Cannibals were thought, at this time, to be the next great musical group.

At a socially progressive and supercharged time for tension, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner makes a lot of points about the changing world.Though many are frustrated with Mr. Drayton (Spencer Tracy)when he disapproves of his daughter's imminent interracial marriage. But Tracy brings more complexity to the character than that. It's not simply about making interracial marriage more commonplace or even whether it's legal all over the country (the Draytons are a liberal family), it's about the stigma. The film uses the perspective of each dinner guest to show that in 1967, when the film was produced, it may have been more widely accepted, but interracial marriage was still heavily stigmatized, and often dangerous for both spouses. Subtext such as this may not be spelled out as apparently by the dialogue, but it is clear. The film is well-written, even if some of the dialogue gets a little repetitive.In addition, though the movie happens in very few places (mostly the Draytons' home in San Francisco), the visual aspects of the film are dynamic and bright. Special attention was clearly paid to the set (as one would hope when it is largely the entire setting for a longer movie) to allow for dynamic movement of the actors and cameras as they drift from one perspective or conversation to another.This movement between people feels natural, as films go, and gives every character in the film a chance to compare their viewpoints and feelings to each other character. This was a very clever way of showing a take on race relations in such a chaotic time that I had not seen in film before.There are several strange sequences, such as Dorothy (Barbara Randolph), Tillie's (Isabel Sanford) assistant, dances off-screen to catch a ride into town. These sequences, however, provide a greater context for the conflict occurring inside the Draytons' home. It's a sort of meeting place for the external and internal to show that, Hey, this isn't the only crazy thing happening. It's an extremely crazy time for social issues. If nothing else, this movie is important. It should be revisited as society progresses, as it shows important things happening during an important time, and that context is something to consider historically. Historically significant and an example of good film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is a film that Americans should still be watching. If not for a better understanding of the country's roots in social issues, then for some great entertainment that might even strike a chord emotionally.

To judge by the barbed satire aimed at Broadway in All about Eve, relations do not appear to have improved much by the early fifties, and The Band Wagon is another film from the same period designed to show that anything Broadway could do, Hollywood could do better. Even putting on a stage production.Tony Hunter is a song-and-dance Hollywood star who comes back East to take the lead in The Band Wagon, a stage musical written by his friends, the husband-and-wife partnership of Lester and Lily Marton. (Tony is not only based upon but also played by Fred Astaire). Unfortunately, the production has fallen into the hands of Jeffrey Cordova, a pretentious, self-obsessed Broadway actor- director who wants to turn the Martons' light-hearted comedy into a portentous modern-day reinterpretation of the Faust legend. Predictably, Cordova's production turns out to be a total flop and its backers pull out, whereupon Mr Hollywood rides to the rescue. Tony offers to sell his personal art collection to refinance the show on condition he is given total artistic control. He ditches Cordova's ideas and restores the Martons' original conception; Cordova is enough of a good sport to recognise the justice of Tony's complaints and continues to act in the show. Equally predictably, Tony's production proves a rip-roaring success.A sub-plot deals with Tony's romance with the show's leading lady, a beautiful prima ballerina named Gaby. The two start off by taking an instant dislike to one another, but in that hoary old rom-com cliché (hoary even in 1953), hatred at first sight is always the prelude to true love. Gaby, in fact, already has a boyfriend, a choreographer named Paul, but as he proves to be a snobbish culture-vulture of the same stamp as Cordova, he can quite safely be discarded. So there we have it. Mr Hollywood proves that that he can direct a theatrical production better than any of those snooty Broadway types, and is rewarded for doing so by winning the heart of a girl young enough to be his daughter.A later Astaire musical, Funny Face, was famously (and in my view wrongly), attacked by the film critic of The Times for its alleged anti-intellectualism. (The film-makers' offence was to have poked fun at Jean-Paul Sartre, something of a sacred cow in the fifties). I felt, however, that the same charge could have been brought, with greater justice, against The Band Wagon. I found myself sympathising with Cordova much more than I was supposed to. Certainly, the man has his faults, but at least he has some sort of artistic vision and respect for culture. Tony, by contrast, is all too obviously the sort of man who, when he hears the words culture or artistic vision, reaches for his (metaphorical) revolver. We never get to see very much of what Cordova's Faust musical would have been like, but we see quite lengthy excerpts from the original version of the show, and it appears to be less a musical than a revue, a series of miscellaneous sketches with no unifying theme. The Louisiana Hayride number looks like a rip-off of Oklahoma!, Triplets is a novelty comic song and the finale is an attempt to turn a Chandleresque hard-boiled detective story into a musical comedy. (Yes, it's just as bizarre as it sounds).According to one legend, the report on Astaire after his first screen test for RKO read Can't sing. Can't act. Balding. Can dance a little, and (apart from the balding part) the same could have been said of his leading lady here, Cyd Charisse. OK, Cyd could dance more than just a little; she was a former ballerina who was perhaps the best female dancer in Hollywood at this period. She was also a great beauty who undoubtedly had the best legs in Hollywood, notwithstanding any claims to the contrary made on behalf of Betty Grable. She was not, however, a great singer or actress. The first of these problems could be overcome by dubbing her singing voice, but there was little anyone could do about the second. There is little chemistry between her and Astaire and the scene where they initially quarrel seems particularly contrived and artificial. This lack of chemistry is not necessarily simply due to the age gap; Astaire was to combine rather better with his co- star in Funny Face, Audrey Hepburn, who was eight years younger even than Charisse.On the positive side, the whole thing is very professionally and slickly produced; Astaire shows that his dancing skills had not been diminished by his advancing years, although to be honest he was never a great singer. (There may be some truth in that RKO legend). There are some decent songs, such as That's Entertainment! and Dancing in the Dark.

To judge by the barbed satire aimed at Broadway in All about Eve, relations do not appear to have improved much by the early fifties, and The Band Wagon is another film from the same period designed to show that anything Broadway could do, Hollywood could do better. Even putting on a stage production.Tony Hunter is a song-and-dance Hollywood star who comes back East to take the lead in The Band Wagon, a stage musical written by his friends, the husband-and-wife partnership of Lester and Lily Marton. (Tony is not only based upon but also played by Fred Astaire). Unfortunately, the production has fallen into the hands of Jeffrey Cordova, a pretentious, self-obsessed Broadway actor- director who wants to turn the Martons' light-hearted comedy into a portentous modern-day reinterpretation of the Faust legend. Predictably, Cordova's production turns out to be a total flop and its backers pull out, whereupon Mr Hollywood rides to the rescue. Tony offers to sell his personal art collection to refinance the show on condition he is given total artistic control. He ditches Cordova's ideas and restores the Martons' original conception; Cordova is enough of a good sport to recognise the justice of Tony's complaints and continues to act in the show. Equally predictably, Tony's production proves a rip-roaring success.A sub-plot deals with Tony's romance with the show's leading lady, a beautiful prima ballerina named Gaby. The two start off by taking an instant dislike to one another, but in that hoary old rom-com cliché (hoary even in 1953), hatred at first sight is always the prelude to true love. Gaby, in fact, already has a boyfriend, a choreographer named Paul, but as he proves to be a snobbish culture-vulture of the same stamp as Cordova, he can quite safely be discarded. So there we have it. Mr Hollywood proves that that he can direct a theatrical production better than any of those snooty Broadway types, and is rewarded for doing so by winning the heart of a girl young enough to be his daughter.A later Astaire musical, Funny Face, was famously (and in my view wrongly), attacked by the film critic of The Times for its alleged anti-intellectualism. (The film-makers' offence was to have poked fun at Jean-Paul Sartre, something of a sacred cow in the fifties). I felt, however, that the same charge could have been brought, with greater justice, against The Band Wagon. I found myself sympathising with Cordova much more than I was supposed to. Certainly, the man has his faults, but at least he has some sort of artistic vision and respect for culture. Tony, by contrast, is all too obviously the sort of man who, when he hears the words culture or artistic vision, reaches for his (metaphorical) revolver. We never get to see very much of what Cordova's Faust musical would have been like, but we see quite lengthy excerpts from the original version of the show, and it appears to be less a musical than a revue, a series of miscellaneous sketches with no unifying theme. The Louisiana Hayride number looks like a rip-off of Oklahoma!, Triplets is a novelty comic song and the finale is an attempt to turn a Chandleresque hard-boiled detective story into a musical comedy. (Yes, it's just as bizarre as it sounds).According to one legend, the report on Astaire after his first screen test for RKO read Can't sing. Can't act. Balding. Can dance a little, and (apart from the balding part) the same could have been said of his leading lady here, Cyd Charisse. OK, Cyd could dance more than just a little; she was a former ballerina who was perhaps the best female dancer in Hollywood at this period. She was also a great beauty who undoubtedly had the best legs in Hollywood, notwithstanding any claims to the contrary made on behalf of Betty Grable. She was not, however, a great singer or actress. The first of these problems could be overcome by dubbing her singing voice, but there was little anyone could do about the second. There is little chemistry between her and Astaire and the scene where they initially quarrel seems particularly contrived and artificial. This lack of chemistry is not necessarily simply due to the age gap; Astaire was to combine rather better with his co- star in Funny Face, Audrey Hepburn, who was eight years younger even than Charisse.On the positive side, the whole thing is very professionally and slickly produced; Astaire shows that his dancing skills had not been diminished by his advancing years, although to be honest he was never a great singer.

Aross this beautiful landscape we see a pack of riders, whipping their horses into a frenzy as they cut through the scenery. Then we cut to an idyllic looking encampment where we see gold prospectors and their families going about their business, a goat here, a dog playfully licking a man's face there... For some time we keep cutting between these two images and we just know that something bad is going to happen. Tension is building slowly until the riders are unleashed upon their victims and make quite the mess. They even shoot a cow and a dog. The dog, we learn, belongs to Megan Wheeler, played by a very young Sydney Penny (Bernadette, 1988) in a wonderful performance. It is her loss and the subsequent burial of the dog which triggers the entrance of the Preacher, through some suggested divine intervention. Clint Eastwood (Heartbreak Ridge, 1986) arrives as an ominous silhouette at first, on the heels of rumbling thunder and shots of rugged mountains, and ending up framed in the doorway of the Wheelers' as Megan finishes her bible reading with the quote And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death. As we learn later, the assault was part of a tactic by the shrewd villain, Coy LaHood, played by Richard Dysart (The Thing, 1982), to drive the prospectors off the land so he can get his hands on the gold which is hidden away in their creek, and Preacher is a man of God coming to lift their spirits and lend a hand. Literary, his introduction to Hull Barret, played by Michael Moriarty (The Stuff, 1985) is in the form of a brawl with LaHood's henchmen where he dispatches divine justice through the conduit of a bat. Eastwood lends heavily on Sergio Leone's archetype the man with no name, which he himself played to perfection in the 60s, but adds even more mystique to his character through all the religious implications and the semblance of a revenge motif from some mysterious past. Few, if any, can play the tough loner with the icy stare as well as Eastwood, and this character is no exception. Anyone crossing his path with ill intentions are met with silent intimidation of the kind that makes them quickly holster their guns and run away. The movie is not all brawn and myth-making though, the central family trio of prospectors, also including Sarah Wheeler, played by Carrie Snodgress (Murphy's Law, 1986), is the beating heart of the movie. All the performances are top notch. Every word spoken is done so with the utmost conviction and true to character. How Moriarty can churn out such a subtle and dramatically solid performance considering the rest of his 80s catalog (Q, The Stuff, Troll, It's Alive III...) is astonishing. There is some early hints that the young daughter is taking a romantic interest in Preacher, and when words about this is exchanged between the two, it seems certain that few screenplays can match the elegance at which it is handled.For anyone fond of westerns, this is a sure bet for a good time. Some might complain that the overall framework of the plot is formulaic, and if you don't like westerns this will probably not turn you around, but the quality in execution of writing, directing and acting are all top notch. This is a visual movie where the action, the framing of the shots and the gorgeous landscapes dominate the feel and atmosphere of the movie. It is also a movie with excellent use of music and sound, which always help in creating more tension or fleshing out the scenery. The movie is not especially realistic as there are a few logical flaws here and there, but most can be shrugged off as stylistic choices. Sure, it seems strange that one character would reach his destination faster on foot than another character on a horse cart with a head start, or awfully dumb when the main villain stands out in the middle of the street without cover while his men is combing the streets after a hidden and armed Preacher, but his defiance of a sudden death by lead just makes him look even more bad ass, and a worthy opponent for our mythical hero. The 80s were not a happy place for aficionados of the western, but this little gem almost makes up for it.

Tension is building slowly until the riders are unleashed upon their victims and make quite the mess. They even shoot a cow and a dog. The dog, we learn, belongs to Megan Wheeler, played by a very young Sydney Penny (Bernadette, 1988) in a wonderful performance. It is her loss and the subsequent burial of the dog which triggers the entrance of the Preacher, through some suggested divine intervention. Clint Eastwood (Heartbreak Ridge, 1986) arrives as an ominous silhouette at first, on the heels of rumbling thunder and shots of rugged mountains, and ending up framed in the doorway of the Wheelers' as Megan finishes her bible reading with the quote And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death. As we learn later, the assault was part of a tactic by the shrewd villain, Coy LaHood, played by Richard Dysart (The Thing, 1982), to drive the prospectors off the land so he can get his hands on the gold which is hidden away in their creek, and Preacher is a man of God coming to lift their spirits and lend a hand. Literary, his introduction to Hull Barret, played by Michael Moriarty (The Stuff, 1985) is in the form of a brawl with LaHood's henchmen where he dispatches divine justice through the conduit of a bat. Eastwood lends heavily on Sergio Leone's archetype the man with no name, which he himself played to perfection in the 60s, but adds even more mystique to his character through all the religious implications and the semblance of a revenge motif from some mysterious past. Few, if any, can play the tough loner with the icy stare as well as Eastwood, and this character is no exception. Anyone crossing his path with ill intentions are met with silent intimidation of the kind that makes them quickly holster their guns and run away. The movie is not all brawn and myth-making though, the central family trio of prospectors, also including Sarah Wheeler, played by Carrie Snodgress (Murphy's Law, 1986), is the beating heart of the movie. All the performances are top notch. Every word spoken is done so with the utmost conviction and true to character. How Moriarty can churn out such a subtle and dramatically solid performance considering the rest of his 80s catalog (Q, The Stuff, Troll, It's Alive III...) is astonishing. There is some early hints that the young daughter is taking a romantic interest in Preacher, and when words about this is exchanged between the two, it seems certain that few screenplays can match the elegance at which it is handled.For anyone fond of westerns, this is a sure bet for a good time. Some might complain that the overall framework of the plot is formulaic, and if you don't like westerns this will probably not turn you around, but the quality in execution of writing, directing and acting are all top notch. This is a visual movie where the action, the framing of the shots and the gorgeous landscapes dominate the feel and atmosphere of the movie. It is also a movie with excellent use of music and sound, which always help in creating more tension or fleshing out the scenery. The movie is not especially realistic as there are a few logical flaws here and there, but most can be shrugged off as stylistic choices. Sure, it seems strange that one character would reach his destination faster on foot than another character on a horse cart with a head start, or awfully dumb when the main villain stands out in the middle of the street without cover while his men is combing the streets after a hidden and armed Preacher, but his defiance of a sudden death by lead just makes him look even more bad ass, and a worthy opponent for our mythical hero. The 80s were not a happy place for aficionados of the western, but this little gem almost makes up for it.

In the opening scene homosexuality is evident, which sets the tone for the movie. The name Victor Victoria is a play on words, as one is generally a boy's name and the other is generally a girl's name, yet being of the same context it could be predicted that it is the same person or a gender battle.There is a lot of foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie. Victoria is starving and sees a man eating all this food, almost like a prince and the pauper setting, she then faints. The crux of the movie is when Victoria puts on a man's clothes. We begin to see a major contrast of how men and women differ, as well as the privileges and advantages there are of being a male in Paris in the 1930's.This is a modern classic as the issues that this movie deals with still rings true today. Women are far more accepted in the work place and they do run in high circles in these days, but in many countries, traditions and religions, women are still inferior to men. The issue of homosexuality is something that is still a tender issue to discuss in most cultures. It has become more acceptable to speak about it openly, and it has become more acceptable to people, however many people still see it as wrong. The issue of one man accepting homosexuality is still a major thing today.

The film apparently differs quite a bit from the book. It isn't the equal of Stalag 17 of 1953 or The Great Escape of 1963. But it comes close, and it introduces a couple of new aspects rarely covered in POW films. Those are interrogation before prisoner assignment to a POW camp, and racism among the American prisoners. The cliché &#x96; all is not what it seems, surely applies to this film. Hart's War is a gripping war movie about the Allied prisoners in a Nazi POW camp. I think it does rival Stalag 17 for intensity and intrigue. The situations are somewhat different, especially with the racism aspect. It's a solid, dramatic story that includes several issues -- patriotism, freedom, brotherhood, race, betrayal, sacrifice, murder and military leadership. And that's just among the prisoners. The Germans who run the camp don't stand out beyond the commandant. This is a great story that to the very end may have you in doubt, as it did me. Had I known the outcome before watching this movie, I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much. So, I recommend that those who haven't seen it yet not read reviews that give the plot away. The best appreciation of this film comes from seeing it through the eyes of Colin Farrell's character. As the movie unfolds, we see and associate with his feelings, his dismay, his confusion, his anger and his disbelief. Harts War is a powerful statement about honor, courage, integrity and leadership. No one can ever forget the ending. The cast excel throughout the film. Bruce Willis is the ranking Allied POW &#x96; Col. William McNamara. Farrell is the newly arrived POW, Lt. Thomas Hart. Romanian actor Marcel Iures is camp commandant, Col. Werner Visser. Terrence Howard is Lt. Lincoln Scott. Each stands out in his role, and the rest of the cast are superb.

The cliché &#x96; all is not what it seems, surely applies to this film. Hart's War is a gripping war movie about the Allied prisoners in a Nazi POW camp. I think it does rival Stalag 17 for intensity and intrigue. The situations are somewhat different, especially with the racism aspect. It's a solid, dramatic story that includes several issues -- patriotism, freedom, brotherhood, race, betrayal, sacrifice, murder and military leadership. And that's just among the prisoners. The Germans who run the camp don't stand out beyond the commandant. This is a great story that to the very end may have you in doubt, as it did me. Had I known the outcome before watching this movie, I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much. So, I recommend that those who haven't seen it yet not read reviews that give the plot away. The best appreciation of this film comes from seeing it through the eyes of Colin Farrell's character. As the movie unfolds, we see and associate with his feelings, his dismay, his confusion, his anger and his disbelief. Harts War is a powerful statement about honor, courage, integrity and leadership. No one can ever forget the ending. The cast excel throughout the film. Bruce Willis is the ranking Allied POW &#x96; Col. William McNamara. Farrell is the newly arrived POW, Lt. Thomas Hart. Romanian actor Marcel Iures is camp commandant, Col. Werner Visser. Terrence Howard is Lt. Lincoln Scott. Each stands out in his role, and the rest of the cast are superb. This movie makes an excellent 21st century addition for any serious World War II film library.

In the presence of others he is anti-social, nervous, unwilling to open. He deflect questions, and walk and walks and walks away from conversations. When he is alone he displays he worst insecurities; four locks and an alarm cannot keep out a well-meaning landlord leaving behind a birthday gift, which makes him uneasy. Is he 42, or 44? We do not know, and it is ironic that considering his line of work, that he could be so private. He shows tinges of Catholicism, but sleeps with a woman whilst paying her, and in the ending, destroys a statue of Mary in his paranoia and rage. Coppola immerses us into this slow descent in the mind of Caul, and it is a tremendous performance by Hackman, who seems truly terrified. He is contrasted by his competitor Bernie, who is self-dubbed 2nd best, but must talk endlessly and boast of his achievements, whilst Caul's talent speaks for itself. Through this we hear stories of a past wiretapping job which eventuated in three murders, and which provides the basis for the guilt that Caul is now wracked with. Coppola goes over the recordings again and again until we are as haunted by them as Caul is. The sound design is magnificent; we firstly are treated to snippets of the urban sounds, street jazz, mumbled conversations, which sharply focus and electronically distort as the crew seek to capture damning evidence of an affair. The first shot is a voyeuristic overhead from a telescope afar, as they search for the couple. Later, as the snippets invade Caul's mind, the imaginary footage is hand-held, natural and closeup, intimate yet distant. He replays the tapes over and over, and this seeps into his social (if you can call it that) life. Meredith pushes him to trust and confide in her, and as he opens up, unwillingly being recorded, the camera sweeps from the right to the left, from behind one shoulder to another, and then we cut and it does it all over again and again, and we are sure that even as he speaks of a love lost, his mind is racing on another matter.It is wholly invasive - he finds himself referring to the work of a client, though he knows its stakes are much higher. When he hears those haunting lyrics mirrored in Amy's bedroom singsong, he murmurs that he heard another person 'at work' carrying the same tune, as if it was just another day in the life. He isn't afraid of death, only murder, and keeps nothing of value in his apartment, but is troubled by what he has discovered. The slow zoom in characterises his growing dread very well. Initially, searching for a couple in a random day crowd. Then, as he relives the tapes and painstakingly constructs a lost sentence, we grow closer to the pair as he is desperate to find out, then he recoils as soon as he has, wishing he hadn't. Later, as he visits a confessional booth, and he slowly unveils his sins as we try to make out an ear behind that screen, but Coppola cuts before the priest responds, which speaks volumes about Caul's guilt. Finally, as he listens in on the other room, and we think he hears the murmurs of a domestic struggle about to occur. Does it matter whether it is really happening or not? We are focused on Caul. It has roots in Antonioni's Blowup, but also in Hitchock's masterpiece, Rear Window. His famous definitions of suspense and surprise are relevant here, of a bomb hidden yet in plain sight, waiting to explode, and a bomb exploding suddenly. In the thrilling climax in the hotel, we have both, a silent, slow and shaking tension as he creeps through the room. We believe, like Caul does, that a murder will happen here, and that is the suspense, but we are also unprepared for the bubbling pool of blood in the toilet, or a bloody hand thrust up against the glass wall, and there is the surprise. This is an extension of his paranoia and guilt. He plays his saxophone endlessly, his only joy, as a means to complete a recording in the same way as he is diligently at work. In times of sheer vulnerability, a tinkling piano tune substitutes; sitting alone in a nightime train, as the shock of Ann appearing in the elevator hits him, as he struggles to open up to Meredith. And finally he again resorts to his sax as he fails to find the bug in his apartment. Such a film would be different if made today. It would focus on the new marvels of surveillance technology, on the trickery and deduction of the trade. It would unveil exactly how Caul managed to bug the president in a fishing boat. That would expose Caul's power, but in a decidedly different way. Here, he is a man who is seemingly omniscient, unfazed and able to decipher the most private of conversations. It doesn't matter where the bug is or whether he finds it or not, or if there even is a bug at all. He has already been defeated.
