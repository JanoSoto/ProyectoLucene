[{"date":"16 February 2008","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I am stunned, but not in the way I thought I would be having seen Magnolia. I do not think I have ever come away from a film feeling more frustrated, more confused, more bored, more puzzled than I have coming away from Magnolia. When I say puzzled, it's not that I was confused by the plot for Magnolia it's because I like to think that whatever artistic or creative approach a certain director is taking to the material, I will be able to watch it, understand it and appreciate it &#x96; maybe this film was beyond me, maybe it needs multiple viewings, maybe I saw it with the incorrect mindset; I don't know.But sitting down to watch Magnolia is like sitting down next to a window and just watching what goes on outside, whatever it is that happens it can be lots of things, it can be nothing at all; either way, your patients will wear thin after a while and you will just get the feeling that you can be doing something else with your time. I have to admit, I did something that I hadn't done before during this film an hour until the end, I switched it off; yes, I actually turned off the film. When I think back to the films I have been tempted to do so during, Son of the Mask; Thunderbirds and Miami Vice spring to mind but I sat trough those until their horrible endings &#x96; but why not Magnolia? well, it just outstays its welcome; it outstays its welcome with its repetition of dialogue; its infuriating script and its dodgy narrative revolving around, well, a handful of people in Los Angles &#x96; but it could really be anywhere. If you've sat through Linda (Moore) pulling some sad faces and shedding the odd melodramatic tear once, you don't need to do it again; if you've watched Frank (Cruise) go on a personal ego trip once, you don't need to see it for a tenth time; if you've seen Jim (Reilly) talk some nonsense to an apartment tenant once, you don't need to see him leave; stop; think and then go back in order to speak to the same character all over again about absolutely nothing at all.You get the picture it would be boring for me to list every single character, the actor\/actress that plays them and what happens to them that made me almost cry with displeasure and pain but that's exactly what the film does. Clocking in at three hours, Magnolia is a film that sits you down at the proverbial window and feeds you dribs and drabs of some of the most uninteresting characters put to screen. What does it all mean? What does it all lead to? Why does it all have to happen? These are questions I do not know the answers to since I submitted to this cinematic torture with an hour to go but I get the feeling, judging on its aesthetical approach, the film does not even answer them. I left a police man cowering in a garden under fire, a former quiz kid bent over a toilet feeling sick, a sex therapist perhaps realising what a jerk he is and a poor boy being subjected to his own kind of torture when he is put through the ultimate humiliation of wetting himself because he wasn't allowed a bathroom break. I actually asked myself why I was watching this; why it was being presented to me and where it was going to lead to you know what? I didn't care, I simply did not care.On a flip side of film-making, films with big casts can often lead to more praise than the film deserves. So it has Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Tom Cruise, William H. Macy, John Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina &#x96; so what? If you want acting then go to and see a play. Simply, a great cast had made a terrible film. Tom Cruise almost plays himself as he sits in a chair, flicking his hair and twitching facial expressions answering questions on his company. Don't get me started on the company an idea that men take back what they are owed from women in the form of easy sex and false emotion; disgusting &#x96; Yes, the message is treat women like trash because men are scared of going through a period without sex.But the film fails on other levels. It has a tendency to have music playing throughout most scenes, muffling what it is the characters are saying and I'm not just taking about the scene in which a police man asks the tenant to turn the music down. But then again, whatever people say in the film doesn't even matter; I have had more exciting conversations with my cat, I have heard people say more interesting things in foreign countries in languages I cannot even understand. Yes, Magnolia is bad; it is shocking in its lack of anything interesting happening, shocking in its failure to develop characters beyond second gear and mind numbing in its dialogue. Like Michael Bowen's character in the film; you will scream at the screen for someone to do something, anything &#x96; you will grow irritable with yourself and those around you after seeing the film, you will sit in your chair after having seen the film &#x96; head in hands &#x96; wondering what you just sat through, maybe in shock but it is all for the wrong reasons. A quick question what did Bowen's character stand to gain if his son DID suddenly snap out of it and resume playing? I don't know; I don't even know if the film does.

In a big country, that's one of the nationally accepted stereotypes. But in a small country, it's often the story about what it means to be Cuban, Romanian, Czech.Its exaggerated by the fact that films themselves are distilled stories which become divorced from context when viewed later and far away. But I do think I can see into the soul of Swedes and Poles when I see unique trends in the better crafted films from those areas. That's why its so interesting when the Norweigian soul seems so distinct from the Swedes. And the Czech soul so radically different from the Polish. Its a matter of the Polish character that the world is essentially defined by human existence and humans are defined by essential goodness. This gives a delicate filigree of interaction that underlies everything else, including government, religion (which is always the church) and other human-triggered disruption. Polish films enter into what it means to be human, always choosing the most lovely, even holy notion of being.Czech films and life, however, seems to have completely different shuffle of the same layers. At root are the mechanics of God who instead of working with golden threads of human intent has his own ideas about pain, confusion and testing. Within this storm of fate humans try to sparkle, bond, love. But they are always fighting a storm, God's storm sometimes facilitated by clueless but comfortable apparatchiks. Its nearly impossible to make a good film with these constraints, with this national story, because what works to define self doesn't work in packaging something that needs to stand alone.This may be the only Czech movie made in the country that finds a solution. Its strange and unfamiliar, but it works. The key characteristic is that its rooted in the fact that there is no story. There cannot be a story. All real stories are hopeless and the best you can have (if you are Czech) are dreams about stories. The form of the narrative is extremely capricious we focus on different small groups apparently accidentally. Are they where the seed of thing will be planted and grow? The factory girls in their dreaming dormitory, the factory owner with the bosses, the aging reservists trying to score, the pianist who plays the girl into bed, the parents who annotate storytelling by wondering about the nature of story for 15 minutes. We end with the girl back with her dorm-mates not knowing whether she is recounting what we have seen or something rosier.Its an amazingly endearing story about the lack or stories, about the desire from love with no ledges.It is unlike anything I have seen before save two films.

It had been a year since I had gone to see The Lion King, an excellent film which I got a copy of on video shortly after it first came into stores. However, I was probably less impressed with Pocahontas than I had been with any other Disney film I had seen before. Because of that, I never saw it again until over a decade later, after rediscovering Disney. Unfortunately for me, I have found that the movie really isn't much different for me now than it was back when it was in theatres.In 1607, John Smith leads a crew from England to the New World in search for gold. Meanwhile, in the land where this crew is headed, Chief Powhatan wants his daughter, Pocahontas, to marry Kocoum, a great warrior who has just lead the tribe to victory in a battle. However, Pocahontas thinks Kocoum is too serious, and does not wish to marry him. Lately, she has been having a recurring dream about a spinning arrow, and believes it means that change is about to come. Seeking advice, she goes and speaks to Grandmother Willow, a talking tree, who tells her to listen to her heart. Very soon, change does come when Smith and his crew arrive on western shores, near the village where Pocahontas and her tribe live! As unlikely as it may seem, when Pocahontas and John Smith meet, they soon fall in love, but since Pocahontas' tribe and Smith's crew both view each other as enemies, this relationship will be hard to keep! One problem I have with this mid-nineties Disney effort is that usually when I watch animated Disney films, both early and recent, I can expect some good humour, but not so with this one. There is quite a bit of attempted humour here, usually involving Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon), Flit (a hummingbird), and eventually Percy (a spoiled dog owned by Governor Ratcliffe), but these gags rarely ever work at all. Personally, I think the funniest part is when Grandmother Willow scares two of the sailors off, which doesn't involve any one the three animal characters, but I think I can expect to find funnier gags than that in most of Disney's animated features. Aside from the lack of humour, the story seems pretty shallow at times, and seems like a rather simple commentary on racism. The songs in the film are probably not the worst bunch Disney has even done, but they've certainly done better. The most memorable song is probably Colours of the Wind.Some may criticize Pocahontas for its historical inaccuracies, but in my opinion, that is certainly not its biggest problem. It have pointed out quite a few things that I think reduce the entertainment value significantly. Now, the film does have some reasonably suspenseful moments here and there, the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith isn't too bad, and I can't complain about the animation, but apart from that, it really doesn't have much going for it. There are some Disney films that I don't like as much as I used to, but Pocahontas is the only one I can think of that I didn't seem to like much in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a horrible movie that both kids and adults should avoid, but the fact that I didn't even think much of it in my childhood just might really say something.

Very soon, change does come when Smith and his crew arrive on western shores, near the village where Pocahontas and her tribe live! As unlikely as it may seem, when Pocahontas and John Smith meet, they soon fall in love, but since Pocahontas' tribe and Smith's crew both view each other as enemies, this relationship will be hard to keep! One problem I have with this mid-nineties Disney effort is that usually when I watch animated Disney films, both early and recent, I can expect some good humour, but not so with this one. There is quite a bit of attempted humour here, usually involving Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon), Flit (a hummingbird), and eventually Percy (a spoiled dog owned by Governor Ratcliffe), but these gags rarely ever work at all. Personally, I think the funniest part is when Grandmother Willow scares two of the sailors off, which doesn't involve any one the three animal characters, but I think I can expect to find funnier gags than that in most of Disney's animated features. Aside from the lack of humour, the story seems pretty shallow at times, and seems like a rather simple commentary on racism. The songs in the film are probably not the worst bunch Disney has even done, but they've certainly done better. The most memorable song is probably Colours of the Wind.Some may criticize Pocahontas for its historical inaccuracies, but in my opinion, that is certainly not its biggest problem. It have pointed out quite a few things that I think reduce the entertainment value significantly. Now, the film does have some reasonably suspenseful moments here and there, the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith isn't too bad, and I can't complain about the animation, but apart from that, it really doesn't have much going for it. There are some Disney films that I don't like as much as I used to, but Pocahontas is the only one I can think of that I didn't seem to like much in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a horrible movie that both kids and adults should avoid, but the fact that I didn't even think much of it in my childhood just might really say something.

It had been a year since I had gone to see The Lion King, an excellent film which I got a copy of on video shortly after it first came into stores. However, I was probably less impressed with Pocahontas than I had been with any other Disney film I had seen before. Because of that, I never saw it again until over a decade later, after rediscovering Disney. Unfortunately for me, I have found that the movie really isn't much different for me now than it was back when it was in theatres.In 1607, John Smith leads a crew from England to the New World in search for gold. Meanwhile, in the land where this crew is headed, Chief Powhatan wants his daughter, Pocahontas, to marry Kocoum, a great warrior who has just lead the tribe to victory in a battle. However, Pocahontas thinks Kocoum is too serious, and does not wish to marry him.

Amityville 2 has addressed the problem of its predecessor being dull by packing in plenty of violence and demonic horror, but it's really just lead to another load of problems as this film fails on too many levels. The film is directed by Damiano Damiani, an Italian director who cut his teeth in the seventies with a load of Polizi flicks. I wasn't surprised that it's an Italian at the helm; rip offs of The Exorcist almost became its own genre in Italy after 1973, and really that's all this film is. The plot focuses on the house that was introduced to the world in the 1979 film and we follow the first family that lived there. The Montelli family move into the house not realising the evil that dwells there. It's not long before the son, Sonny, becomes possessed by an evil demon that instructs him to shoot his family. A local priest discovers what is happening and decides to try and save the boy's soul...Damiano Damiani clearly wanted to shock his audience with this film, but he doesn't manage it because every time something shocking is about to happen, the camera cuts away! I don't know if it was his fault or the orders from the producers, but this film completely misses the point of 'less is more'. The point of it is to make the audience think they're seeing something without actually showing it; but the camera cuts here make it quite obvious that we aren't seeing the shocking things in this film, and it just kills it. Had the film been well shot, it actually would have been quite a shocking horror flick, featuring things such as incestuous sex and young children being blown away; so it's a bit of a shame. In spite of these problems, the film is fairly good, story-wise, for the first hour. After the central set-piece, however, it all becomes rather superfluous and silly. The final third of the movie almost feels like a different film packed with silly demonic voices and rubbish special effects. Clearly this is not a good example of the horror genre, but it is at least interesting as a heavily flawed example of how NOT to make a shocking horror movie.

But, I HAVE seen the title in question. When I was 9 years old, we had the best cable provider ever. A cable provider that came with a channel called HBO Zone. It was all the good, R-Rated movies that your parents forbid you to watch. I was awestruck. All those movies. At my disposal. Anyway, I digress. A film came along called Deep Blue Sea. A shark movie. I was nothing more than excited to see a movie that had sharks, babes, and...Thomas Jane! I'll tell it to you like it is. The film was amazingly cliché-ridden and poorly written. It's as if the writers of the film were sitting at home watching Jaws drunk off there asses taking another toke of the pipe when they thought of the cure for Alzhiemer's and decided to put it into a script. Only instead of miraculously curing Alzehiemers, they cured abso-friggen-loutly nothing. I think the only amazingly amazing thing in this movie was when Samuel L. Jackson gets ripped apart by a shark during one of his drawn out, uninspiring, and poorly acted speeches. I'd jump into the Pacific Ocean and get my ass eaten just to shake hands with a shark for that scene.Of course, the movie had it's good parts. Like when Saffron Burrows took off her wet suit. Of course, there was a bra-and-panty issue but it was still Jack Hoff Material. Michael Rapaport as a scientist and technological expert was very uncomfortable, but watching him cower like Rain Man after watching Jackson get pwned was a giggle-moment for me. Stellan Sarsgard was the only amazing actor in this film, and he got shot through plate glass AFTER getting his arm bitten off. Did someone shout Unwanted Overkill? I think so. And the woman from The Sopranos getting blown up was the second most funniest thing I've ever seen in a shark movie. Thomas Jane wasn't that bad. And when he wasn't slipping, falling, and jumping into things, he was delivering a plethora of action hero lines in that deep Southern accent that we all love. But the worst part ever? Having LLCOOLJ in the movie and then playing two of his songs at the end that had a backdrop similar to the movie. Kinda like the theme songs to cheap, Direct-to-Store Disney videos that your kids beg you for but never watch. It was a bad addition and it made me want to kick LLCoolJ for actually agreeing to write it. BAD LLCJ! BAD! All in all, the movie wasn't bad, not great, not good, not even decent, but not bad.

I am baffled that this movie had so many big name actors, what were they thinking when they agreed to take part in this film? The premise of the movie is a teenage male who is living frustrated with his love life. He is surrounded by a bunch of perverted individuals who try to act like they are really trendy and prolific but really they are a group of wannabe intellectuals. Whoever wrote this movie did a horrible job of giving the characters individuality. All of the characters seem like the same person. They all seem to be bi-sexual, very fond of hedonism and bondage and they all act like they are on Ecstasy throughout the whole movie. Throughout this movie characters are paired of into scenes where they spanking each other, tugging on each others nipple rings, and taking designer drugs. The main character is always dwelling on the fact that he is an old fashioned type of guy living amongst a bunch of people who prefer to have multiple sex partners. In every scene they are in some wannabe sheik yuppie house. For instance one guys bedroom is covered from floor to ceiling with large words that read a bunch of depressing sentences that are supposed to be edgy or poetic. Another guys room has a large mural of himself holding a gun up to his head, totally corny and unrealistic if you ask me. The main group of characters are about to attend some trendy party, before they go they all take Ecstasy, which looks nothing like the real thing, it honestly looked like they were popping Mentos breath mints. When they arrive at the party they are surrounded by a bunch of pale women in tight latex, or mal-nourished boys with body piercing and cheesy haircuts. Some guy named Elvis gets into a fight with a drug dealer, claiming he sold him some bad drugs, Elvis ends up killing the guy by beating him in the head with a can of tomato soup, and the party dwellers barely seem to be phased, like they are too trendy to care that someone just got bludgeoned to death with some can goods.

Some rich yuppie in Southern California gave there son or daughter a bunch of money to make a movie that they thought would appeal to the youth of America.

They threw together this cheesy movie and decided to title it NOWHERE, thinking they were illustrating the hardships of being spoiled perverted brat in Southern California. All they really did was make a movie that leaves viewers with the feeling that they wasted 82 minutes of there life watching a movie that required no creativity to put together.

This is the first time I have watched a movie that was so awful that it made me angry it could actually be created! I am baffled that this movie had so many big name actors, what were they thinking when they agreed to take part in this film? The premise of the movie is a teenage male who is living frustrated with his love life. He is surrounded by a bunch of perverted individuals who try to act like they are really trendy and prolific but really they are a group of wannabe intellectuals. Whoever wrote this movie did a horrible job of giving the characters individuality. All of the characters seem like the same person. They all seem to be bi-sexual, very fond of hedonism and bondage and they all act like they are on Ecstasy throughout the whole movie. Throughout this movie characters are paired of into scenes where they spanking each other, tugging on each others nipple rings, and taking designer drugs. The main character is always dwelling on the fact that he is an old fashioned type of guy living amongst a bunch of people who prefer to have multiple sex partners. In every scene they are in some wannabe sheik yuppie house. For instance one guys bedroom is covered from floor to ceiling with large words that read a bunch of depressing sentences that are supposed to be edgy or poetic. Another guys room has a large mural of himself holding a gun up to his head, totally corny and unrealistic if you ask me. The main group of characters are about to attend some trendy party, before they go they all take Ecstasy, which looks nothing like the real thing, it honestly looked like they were popping Mentos breath mints. When they arrive at the party they are surrounded by a bunch of pale women in tight latex, or mal-nourished boys with body piercing and cheesy haircuts. Some guy named Elvis gets into a fight with a drug dealer, claiming he sold him some bad drugs, Elvis ends up killing the guy by beating him in the head with a can of tomato soup, and the party dwellers barely seem to be phased, like they are too trendy to care that someone just got bludgeoned to death with some can goods. Like I said, I cannot understand why all the big name actors took part in this movie. Some of the actors include Shannon Daugherty, Christina Applegate, Ryan Phillipe, that girl that played Mary Jane in half baked and the Mexican guy from half baked, the girl that played Claire in Beverly Hills 90210, Traci Lords, it even had the middle son from The Brady Bunch actor Christopher Knight. The only person I can honestly say I liked in the movie was the sixteen year old boy named zero, he almost seemed like a believable character who didn't act all artsy fartsy. This movie is garbage. While watching this movie I tried to envision the person who created it, and this is what I came up with. Some rich yuppie in Southern California gave there son or daughter a bunch of money to make a movie that they thought would appeal to the youth of America. This spoiled boy or girl must of been heavily into the rave\/club scene and thought they could come up with an abstract movie that would be groundbreaking.

Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie.

High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie.

Some of them had a very strict 50's upbringing and then that just shattered time and time again.They did have the Best America could offer then... Education, Opportunities, Music, Lifestyles, etc... America was on Top then, we had the whole world to ourselves The only thing we were missing was some Transparency with our government, business and race relations.I had to summarize the background of this move to show you how this it sort of wonders on after the Tumultuous 60's & 70's.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of them. Now, many people like the Ninja Turtles, but most seem to think it's childish and not worth their time. This is so not true, and the first movie, obviously titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, makes this evident.The movie tells the story of four mutant turtles trained by their rat master Splinter. Splinter learned the art of ninjistu from his owner back in Japan. When Splinter came to America he found the four turtles in a sewer. The turtles were mutated by some ooze and Splinter was too. He eventually taught them to be ninjas so he could take revenge on the man who killed his master, Oroko Saki, or, The Shredder.Okay, I'll admit, even as I wrote that it sounded far-fetched(but so unique), but the film takes this story and brings it down(under?) to Earth and makes it very believable. All the characters are written well, their stories are rich and interesting, and their development during the film is one of its strongest points. It's obvious there's tension among the brothers, they live in an enclosed sewer and they are usually aching to fight. This is played out well within the film. April and Casey are also well written.There's so much good to say about this film, and even though it has its flaws they are FAR overshadowed. The cinematography is gritty and just amazing. The sets are flawlessly crafted, it really feels like a cramped makeshift home down in the sewer, and New York City feels like an American city, not some glossy representation of one. The scenes on April's farm are so well shot...it's breathtaking to me. It's great to just take in all the detail.One source of criticism seems to be the dialog, and frankly, you either like it or you don't. I fall into the former group, these turtles feel like four teenage brothers and even though some of it's cheesy, the dialog never really gets cringe-worthy, so it's all good. The acting is also great, the four turtles voices are quirky and fun, and the human actors deliver raw and just plain realistic performances. April's reaction to the turtles is especially realistic, she has to portray so many emotions at once, and she pulls it off perfectly.The puppetry is top-notch, it's obvious Jim Henson was the master at this stuff, the detail on the turtles and the way there mouths move make it so much better. Just look at the muscles on their legs...perfect. The fighting choreography is great, it's obvious that there's limitations in using turtles in suits to portray ninjas, but the filmmakers got past that and made the action effective and interesting.I love the score\/soundtrack. It is really interesting, and the MC Hammer stuff is actually good. There's some subtle stuff that carries enough emotion to move us when it needs to. The direction is also really worth noting, and it's obvious the makers of this film really went far to please the fans, because it combines the best of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the gritty realisticness that made the comics great, and the fun dialog and humor that made the 80s show fun.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2008","score":"","review":" There's certain movies that seem to automatically get bad criticism because of their titles and subject.

In both story versions he's assigned to discover what's happening with the caribou population, and specifically how the wolves in this predator-prey relationship, are effecting the balance.The film shows some of the short sighted and over thought preparation for Tyler's mission, and shows us his isolation and how he copes with combating loneliness and the nature's environment. We see his struggle (more often humorous than not) as he comes to terms with creating his own predator-prey relationship, and further comes to an understanding with the locals to balance himself with their existence.

From then on, Ethan (Cruise) tries to find the man responsible for the ambush and death of 4 of his agents. He does this whilst being hunted by his own organisation which suspects him of being behind it. There are plot inconsistencies - why does Ethan decide to infiltrate the CIA's vault just to arrange a meeting with a cyber-terrorist who knows who the mole is? Why when he knows who the mole is, does he not go after him? Some loved the final sequence of a helicopter attached to a train, but it was that kind of enthusiasm that led to scenes like Boeing jumbo jets being split in half by lasers in later action films! Note most of this film is about Cruise being a hero with that occasional trademark smile. He does a good job of it.

He does this whilst being hunted by his own organisation which suspects him of being behind it. There are plot inconsistencies - why does Ethan decide to infiltrate the CIA's vault just to arrange a meeting with a cyber-terrorist who knows who the mole is? Why when he knows who the mole is, does he not go after him? Some loved the final sequence of a helicopter attached to a train, but it was that kind of enthusiasm that led to scenes like Boeing jumbo jets being split in half by lasers in later action films! Note most of this film is about Cruise being a hero with that occasional trademark smile. He does a good job of it.

However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King.
