I am not a person that is too religious, but this movie touched me. Robert Duvall, who wrote produced, directed, and took the lead role in this film proved himself to be a true master of cinema. There is not one weak moment in this film. Duvall plays a minister whose world is shattered after a sad string of events. He commits a crime of passion, and runs from the law. While on the run Sonny, the name of the preacher comes across a new path. I don't know why this movie hit me so much, it just did. The movie is incredibly low budget. The driving force in this film is the acting, and the writing. There is not a week moment in this film. How it is Robert Duvall could come up with this movie is beyond me. He wrote, produced, starred and directed this film, and he did a superior job. This man was nominated for an Oscar, and he lost to Jack Nicholson, for as good as it gets. Nicholson did a fine job in his role, buy Duvall deserved the Oscar, he did better in his part. The movie is just so simple and innocent in a way. There is nothing too complicated to this movie it is just a simple story told in a brilliant manner. The simplicity of this film is overwhelming in a way, in an era of these incredibly bloated films, whether they are phony epics, or these silly teen films they always are too complicated, and many times pointless. But this movie, with a fraction of the budget of a huge Hollywood film manages to be much more entertaining and insightful than almost any Hollywood film. One thing that makes this film so interesting is the supporting cast. Robert Duvall has picked an excellent cast for his film, they look, act and make their parts out excellently. They contribute nicely to this effort and make it that much better. Billy Bob Thornton has a small part but it is powerful and excellent. His small part contributes a lot to this film.What also amazed me about this film is how it kept you guessing. (SPOILERS)At first you didn't know how legitimate Sonny was. You really couldn't tell if he was a con-man, or legitimately felt if he was good intentioned, and that was the mystery in the first half of the film. But that was the beauty of the film. I felt like he was always unintentional, but at first he was preaching to people that didn't need his support and guidance. But as his journey progressed he did exactly what he had to do, and gave guidance to those that needed it the most. I felt like at first Sonny had a very different view of his religion from the view he had at the end. I think at first he felt like God controlled everything, and everything in his life was to appease his savior. But as time went by, as tragedy struck him personally he became much less materialistic This movie is just excellent. I was told it was good, but not this good. It was a pleasure and a privilege to watch this film. I was taken so much by this movie, I almost cried at the end. I didn't know how it was going to end, and I was on the edge of my seat almost the whole time. This is an excellent film and I recommend it to almost anybody. For the record I did not like the Farrah Fawcett character was not cool to me. She did a good acting job but she was a real prick. I would have been p***ed at her too. I felt bad for him at first even if I didn't identify with him. Anyways this is a superior film, wonderfully emotional, delightfully energetic, excellently written, and directed by Robert Duvall and an all around excellent experience. I recommend it highly.

I was interested to see some of his early work to see if I could find the progression to what led him to create the Forest Whitacre samurai story. Sadly, this was not found with Dead Man. What I did discover, and my wife commented on this as well, was a film directed and written by a man that thinks that he is a genius in the works of William Blake, the poet. We all remember these types of people from college. You know, the ones that sat in the back of the classroom wearing all black that read the works of Blake for fun and while getting high on a Friday night. Well, that guy sitting in the back of my class was Jim Jarmusch, and he proceeded to take his late night hallucinations and created the film Dead Man. This film was horrible. I don't use that word lightly, but this film ranks as one of the worst of 1995. While this film is on the top ten of most critics for that year, I would have to credit this to a lack of independent films in the mainstream market. 1995 was the year when independent films were just starting to become more mainstream. Audiences were not yet fully developed in films where actors would work for the art they were doing instead of the paycheck they were going to receive. So, I can only assume, that by today's standards this film would just be passed off as a normal film that was poorly written and horribly acted. BUT, in 1995, this film was praised as new and innovated because mainstream independent films had yet to be fully developed. This is the only reason that I can think for the popularity behind this film. The acting was horrible and the direction was choppy. Apparently, Jarmusch knew he could capture critics in his web by releasing a new-age story based in the Wild West. He also thought that he could use actors notorious for doing low-budget films (not yet called independent films) to create the story that he wanted. Unfortunately, what he got was a hodge-podge of different acting styles that just didn't seem to work in this film. The use of fade to black made me wish that he had used the song from the Rolling Stones to even further his point. This was also one of those films where Jarmusch knew he didn't have a very wordy script, so he included so many staring off into space scenes that were to symbolize life and complexities of nature. It didn't work for me in this film. I felt it was just more of filler than anything else. Also, I don't think that Neil Young's guitar was the best choice of music to bring me into the time (or era) that this film was based. I felt like I was, again, sitting in a dorm room one late night with a stoner who loved the poetry of William Blake and the music of Neil Young. In other words, had the entire pace of the film been quickened, perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective. I would like to end with a quote from a critic about the film Dead Man. If you understand this, then I think you will really like this movie. If you do not, then you can join me in the front of the class smoking my candy cigarette.Enter the town of Machine, and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail - they make the journey a bit annoying, and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency.What?

I do not normally do this with films, because it may scar my overall feeling of the film by hearing how the director had gas throughout the production, so I stay clear. The director of this film, Jean-Luc Godard is considered the Godfather of the French New Wave movement. I had to see a film by this man. I had to see what a film made back in 1959 has brought to modern cinema. While I was impressed with the style in which this movie was filmed, I was not impressed by the actors in the film. This was one of those movies that I could have watched without the sound. While the director uses film techniques that are now the standard in Hollywood, the actors that participated in this film left more to be desired. I know that I have used that phrase several times in this review, but it is my general feeling of this film. I went in expecting WAY too much, and came out with the feeling of sand falling through my fingers.The shots of the actors talking to the camera, the quick camera shots, and the cryptic story are amazing to see, but you can sincerely tell that he was experimenting with this film. The actors talking into the camera you can tell are reading their lines, forcing French words out of their mouth, while trying to bring the audience into the picture, into the world that these two main characters are trying to create. Then there was the quick camera shots which made me feel as if Godard was having a heart attack instead of bring artwork to the silver screen. Finally, there was the cryptic story. So many times you find yourself trying to keep up with what these characters are doing, what they are talking about, or who they are interacting with. I felt that sometimes their interactions were too minimal, while others were too long and in-depth. This film WAS interesting to watch because you can see traces of Scorsese, Tarrantino, and even Stone in this film, and where these 21st century directors learned their techniques. I would bargain to say that without this film perhaps there wouldn't be any of these three directors making amazing movies today. BUT that still does not mean, by any means, that this was a great movie. I actually hated this movie. I hated the characters the most. I could live with the story ... I could live with the new film techniques being used, but I could not ... and should not ... have to live with the characters. The actor and actress that carried the main parts in this story were, to be honest, horrible actors. I could not get into any of them. In Michel's final scene, I was looking at my clock wondering how long Godard would leave the camera on him, or if it would just be over with so I could get to my next film. Patricia was unbelievable and confused. While this film is trying to build a love story, you instead get bombarded with philosophy and art instead of love. I think Godard was trying to build a love story using these elements, but it never happened. Therefore, when Michel's climactic scene arrives, we feel nothing for him. Perhaps this was what Godard wanted us to feel, but then it does not go with the rest of the film.Overall, I do not suggest watching this film. I have read other reviews that talk about how film students need to watch this film to fully respect the field, but I would have to say I can't. I would give up on film if this was the best-of-the-best.

I do not normally do this with films, because it may scar my overall feeling of the film by hearing how the director had gas throughout the production, so I stay clear. The director of this film, Jean-Luc Godard is considered the Godfather of the French New Wave movement. I had to see a film by this man. I had to see what a film made back in 1959 has brought to modern cinema. While I was impressed with the style in which this movie was filmed, I was not impressed by the actors in the film. This was one of those movies that I could have watched without the sound. While the director uses film techniques that are now the standard in Hollywood, the actors that participated in this film left more to be desired. I know that I have used that phrase several times in this review, but it is my general feeling of this film. I went in expecting WAY too much, and came out with the feeling of sand falling through my fingers.The shots of the actors talking to the camera, the quick camera shots, and the cryptic story are amazing to see, but you can sincerely tell that he was experimenting with this film. The actors talking into the camera you can tell are reading their lines, forcing French words out of their mouth, while trying to bring the audience into the picture, into the world that these two main characters are trying to create. Then there was the quick camera shots which made me feel as if Godard was having a heart attack instead of bring artwork to the silver screen. Finally, there was the cryptic story. So many times you find yourself trying to keep up with what these characters are doing, what they are talking about, or who they are interacting with. I felt that sometimes their interactions were too minimal, while others were too long and in-depth. This film WAS interesting to watch because you can see traces of Scorsese, Tarrantino, and even Stone in this film, and where these 21st century directors learned their techniques. I would bargain to say that without this film perhaps there wouldn't be any of these three directors making amazing movies today. BUT that still does not mean, by any means, that this was a great movie. I actually hated this movie. I hated the characters the most. I could live with the story ... I could live with the new film techniques being used, but I could not ... and should not ... have to live with the characters. The actor and actress that carried the main parts in this story were, to be honest, horrible actors. I could not get into any of them. In Michel's final scene, I was looking at my clock wondering how long Godard would leave the camera on him, or if it would just be over with so I could get to my next film. Patricia was unbelievable and confused. While this film is trying to build a love story, you instead get bombarded with philosophy and art instead of love. I think Godard was trying to build a love story using these elements, but it never happened. Therefore, when Michel's climactic scene arrives, we feel nothing for him. Perhaps this was what Godard wanted us to feel, but then it does not go with the rest of the film.Overall, I do not suggest watching this film. I have read other reviews that talk about how film students need to watch this film to fully respect the field, but I would have to say I can't. I would give up on film if this was the best-of-the-best.

We all love watching inept farce unfold, but frankly there's some deeper evil in Battlefield Earth that surpasses it's poor direction and acting and becomes a grating background noise while you watch. I think it's the movies built-in dumbness.First off it's based on part of a rambling, dumb book. Not a good start, but many films have been made that can surpass the original source material and entertain us anyway. Not Battlefield Earth however, which just beats the viewer over the head again and again with it's dumb premise and plot twists so obvious they can be seen from space. The entire movie rests on the fact that these half-assed Klingons believe humans to be so retarded as to be useless, unable to even speak or master simple tasks. The whole plot rests on this one fact, yet the aliens are living in conquered human cities, have read our libraries, fought our nuclear powered, nuclear armed armies and space vehicles, yet seem to ignore this fact completely to make the film work. What?These aliens are so thick they actually do come over as the Klingons dumber cousins, with make up that seems to consist of big foreheads, huge platform boots and hands that are clearly those joke-shop rubber monster gloves. 12-year old kids could outwit these guys, yet we are to believe they have conquered masses of planets and have transporter technology that can send them clear across the galaxy in moments. If brains were dynamite they wouldn't have enough to blow their hats off, let alone conquer space and time, yet the film asks us to believe otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The final nail in the dumb coffin is that the ending rests on the fact that the atmosphere on the aliens home planet is highly explosive in the presence of anything more than minimal radiation, which makes us wonder how the hell these dummies ever evolved to their current claimed level of science.OK, outside of the plot written by pre-school kids how is the film to watch?In a word, crap. The direction sucks any pace out of the action scenes and frantic cuts during slo-mo fights just leave the viewer wondering what the hell is happening, or who is shooting at who? The effects aren't too bad, but remind me of TV sci-fi due to overuse of CGI when physical effects would have been better. Production design is very blah too, with guns that make little sense and vehicles that are a mish-mash of thousands of designs that have gone before. It's like someone realized early on that this one was going to suck, and decided they weren't even going to try and be original.That's it for me folks, it's a dumb movie that's not that easy to watch and drives me up the wall whenever I think about it. The only entertainment value is watching Travolta, Whittaker (run Forrest, run!) and a cast of nobodies hamming it up to the max. With a better plot, acting, scriptwriting and effects this might have been better, but that kinda goes without saying. 2 out of 10 for this willfully stupid movie.

Sure, the science of it all is nonsense, nothing about it is real. Except for the characters. A good writer can take an unrealistic story and turn it in to a reflection on the human condition, like Orwell and Huxley. X-men is essentially about racism, bitterness, the corrupting influence of power, and the fact that altruism isn't easy. People will not hesitate to judge you before they know you, despite your personal efforts. The first thing that I liked about the movie was that it succeeded in shedding the comic-book image. The characters were neither pretentious nor over-the-top, they gained a dimension. Ian Mckellen's role as the bitter, machiavellian mutant, is a brilliant creation. If you were oppressed, wouldn't you try to prevent it from happening again? Even if that means oppressing or killing someone else? I've never been in his shoes, but his by any means necessary-attitude is not helping mutantkind. Let alone the world. He is a man who believes in what he's doing, because he thinks that if he doesn't, the world will never be a safe place for mutants. He's not a villain out to conquer the world, he thinks he's saving his race. I like to think this is a subtle reference to the understandable, but utterly counterproductive feud between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Perhaps a call to end all wars based on historical retaliation? Hugh Jackman is great as the lone man without a past, Wolverine (his snappy one-liners come across, even with the bad hair day!). I also liked the fact that Anna Paquin's Rogue is not the token Southern Belle with the Superman-act like in the comic, but a shy girl, as one would expect. Being handicapped myself, it's nice to see a guy in a wheelchair run the show. After seeing Kevin Spacey in the Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer is my hero, the patron-director of all those, who are physically impaired! Jean-Luc... eh, Patrick Stewart IS the Big Wise Guy. It's always interesting to see how the bad guys outsmart the greatest psychic in the world, too. Like all characters, Wheels is just a human being, in spite of his awe-inspiring feats of mind- control. Now for the embarrassing part.

All he did is just lie about his genes. He is supposed to be dead in 30, and cannot do vigorous exercises because of the deficiency of his body.

Vincent and Irene both have inherent genes deficiencies as they are both born in a 'natural way'. At first, Irene does not know the secret of Vincent. She thinks she has fell in love with the most perfect guy in the world. Although there is a risk of being discovered, Vincent dares to tell Irene his secret. After knowing the secret, Irene doesn't give up Vincent but stand by his side and support him. I really think that this relationship is very romantic, especially under this tough background. In this competitive world, many people are wearing masks to hide themselves. It's very difficult to trust a person thoroughly. Honestly, I am really surprised by how exciting this movie is. This movie does not have exciting scene such as explosion, bloody scene of killing people or alien attacking the earth. The whole movie is very smooth. The pace is not fast but you will never feel bored. It gives me the feeling of excitement. When watching the movie, I was so eager to know whether Vincent can succeed as there are so many barriers to stop him. Furthermore, this film makes me think a lot. I imagine one day if people really have the ability to create a super baby who is intelligent and will never get sick. Is it good for human? I don't know. It is an interesting topic. Personally, I do not want it to happen. Life is interesting because it is unexpected. But one thing that I am sure is that discrimination must exist. In fact, discrimination always exists in the world. People judge a person by the color the one's skin, gender, sexuality, or even ages. I wonder. Are those things really reflect a person's quality? Of course not, that's why I hate discrimination. There is no double that we should not judge a book by it's cover but how many people can really do it?I highly recommend people to watch this movie!

The things that determine one's success is hard working, insistence, and faith. More importantly, he should be determine and believes that he can succeed. Having inherent disadvantages does not indicate one's future. We should create our own future by our hands! Though Vincent has genetic imperfections, he never gives up. He does not want to be the person that everyone thinks he should be.In the story, no one support Vincent. Even his parents think that he should give up his dream and His brother wants to arrest him. Nonetheless, he never gives up. Although he uses an illegal way to achieve his goal, I think he did nothing wrong because he is using his own power to achieve his goal. All he did is just lie about his genes. He is supposed to be dead in 30, and cannot do vigorous exercises because of the deficiency of his body.

It didn't come as a shock, I just didn't like it. The attempts at comedy almost always fall flat, and the film-makers are trying desperately hard to make you laugh, but end up being embarrassing for the actors as well as the director(come on, this guy did H20; that wasn't much, but it was definitely better than this). The plot is apparently supposed to be a rehash\/mocking of monster movies. It doesn't work well. It's poorly paced and thoroughly boring. The acting is decent enough. The characters are all one-dimensional and uninteresting; we don't care about these people, whether they live or die... and that ruins every chance of keeping the attention of the audience during the attack scenes. The film especially drags near the end; I was hoping, nay, praying that it would just end soon. The film didn't manage to keep my attention nor my interest for an hour and a half, and that's not even that hard to do. The special effects are pretty good, but that's pretty much the only positive thing to say about this film.

Unless he is handed an exceptional script, Bridges plays the same sort of character over and over again. I also had trouble with the female character of Mo in this film. It was never really understood what her relationship was to everyone until I read some reviews, which then made sense. I also had trouble with Cutter's physical condition.

So one night, I rented it and watched it after my parents fell asleep, and I couldn't believe it. This was a horrible film. I couldn't get into the characters, the story seemed forced, and nothing seemed to match what I remember hearing about when it was released. So, I decided to watch it again when I was older and wiser in the cinema world. I thought perhaps my perspective would have changed and this would be a better film. I had seen other Cronenberg films, so I was ready for this. Sadly, it was no better than the first time.I rented it and watched it, then suddenly returned it. I was unimpressed. Perhaps because I have seen scenarios like this work better in other films, or maybe it was just as I had described above. The characters seemed to just randomly do whatever they wanted, the story seemed forced and definitely not plausible, and finally there was just nothing spectacular about this movie. I really wanted Cronenberg to chisel his way into the human psyche after a traumatic accident like this occurs, but instead he resorts to a border-line sex film. While favorites of my like James Spader and Holly Hunter decently act their way through this film, there was nothing that made me excited about their characters. Their chemistry seemed basic and their on-screen connection seemed dull. They were not the best choices for this film. I felt as if Cronenberg was catering to the Hollywood community with this film. Overall, I needed a darker story, less sex and more character, and more Cronenberg. He has done better work, and I don't know why he gave up on this film. Perhaps he should take some lessons from David Lynch that may get him back on the right track.Grade ** out of *****  ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2004","score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  I remember watching this film about ten years ago when it was first released.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched it, but let me tell you it was one of the first films that I have seen that would not allow me to pinpoint a direct love or hate. At the beginning, when the plot was taking it's time to take off, I was not enjoying this film. I felt that I was having trouble really understanding John and Rae and the relationship that they have. I think this stayed with me throughout the film, and when they finally split up I finally began to enjoy it. I thought that there were some really wild scenes in this film. The infamous rape scene was intense. I never saw that coming at all. The chemistry between Zane and Kidman was perfect, while the connection between Rae and John was not. I think, honestly, Sam Neill was miscast in this film, or he was trying to play too deeply into his character. At first I felt that we were watching a film about robots, but then I saw our characters go into the water and I knew that technology wasn't around in the 80s (for fear of other crew being shocked). I also had trouble distinguishing the ethnic background of the characters. Kidman was heavy on the Australian accent, but Neill and Zane seemed almost American. Not that this normally makes any difference, but I think it would have put these characters on sturdier ground. I don't know my exact feelings on this film. It was good, it was bad, then it somehow seemed good again. The ending was completely laughable. I really thought they should have just ended with the two of them in each other's arms, but instead they had toss in there a classic clichéd Hollywood moment. It was a well rounded film, but somehow some edges were getting dull. It is almost like having a flat spot on your tire. You hear the noise, but know that you can continue driving if you want to. For those of you out there that are considering watching this film because you are a fan of Kidman, I would have you look at both sides of the story. This is not the best work from her, but it does give us a good indication on where she is going with her acting career. Second, she does get naked. So, if acting doesn't matter and you would rather see Kidman naked, than Dead Calm may be the film for you. I don't know why I am so wishy-washy with this film, but I can't seem to want to say if it was bad or good. Rather, more of a combination of both. The scenes with Kidman and Zane are the best, while Neill is what brought this film down. Nothing was revealed prior about him (or rather about anyone), so it is hard to connect with the characters, but it does carry some decent suspense. Overall, if you find this film for free somewhere, I think you should get it, but I wouldn't spend more than a penny on this film.Grade *** out of *****  ","genre":null},{"date":"25 September 2004","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Before director Phillip Noyce went on to do the Jack Ryan films, he made the little ditty known as Dead Calm.

I caught this idea as I was watching this film, and I thought it was amazing the way the director showed this transition. The first person, outside of Lytton, that Carrington falls for is a man who is only interested in a physical relationship. Although she claims she is not interested in him sexually, it is at this time in Carrington's life, she is interested in a man's mind, not what is under his pants. She breaks off this relationship to live with Lytton, a man who can give her the intellect that she desires. As Carrington grows older, she finds comfort in physical relationships. In fact, the majority of this film is about physical relationships. Carrington is never hesitant to jump into the arms of another man. A part of me thinks that she is constantly trying to find another Lytton out there, but there is another part of me that says that she was just trying to get the physical from men, because she had the perfect man at home (Lytton of course). So after being with a man that only wants to have a physical relationship, she jumps into the arms of a soldier. One that is great with the physical, amazing towards Lytton, and perfect for Carrington. As this comes to a surprising end, we see her jump into a relationship that was purely sexual. There was no interaction between the two except for when they were on his boat having sex. Carrington experiences the best sex of her life with this man, but it again ... much like the others ... comes to a complete halt when he tells her that he is not really interested in her sexually. Odd, isn't how this films started with Carrington and her first boyfriend. We have come full circle. If we were to look at this film in a symmetrical angle, we would notice a circle outside with Lytton in the direct center of this circle. The circle would represent Carrington's life. All around the circle would be the men that she has been with, while Lytton would be her stability point. All throughout her encounters with other men she always is able to find comfort with her center figure ... Lytton. If you watch this film closely, you will notice that there is only one point in the movie where Carrington goes outside the circle. It is when she is having a party at her house. Carrington goes outside only to sit down on a stump that happens to be facing the house. She is able to see all the windows in the house, and all of her past lovers with their new ones. Even Lytton with his new boyfriend.This is the moment that we see Carrington thinking about her life. Seeing what she has been a part of, and watching it somewhat crumble down. This is her only moment outside of the circle that she has built. Lytton is the foundation to this circle, and it is obvious that without Lytton everything around Carrington must crumble as well.

I attribute this, in part, to the fact that in 1986, one principal cast member had not yet come of age. At any rate, it's a timeless piece that I revisit often and each time I find it to be a genuinely rewarding experience.The plot and story line are based primarily on a true story of a family of thieves in the Midwest. The biographical aspect dramatically enhances the piece from a psychological standpoint, although I've always wondered how precisely the facts are portrayed. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie under any circumstances, I just believe that if the actual occurrences were as barbaric as they are illustrated here, the Whitewood family would be a household name nationwide. In fact, to this day I'm always on the lookout for biographical info on the family.Director James Foley brings out the absolute best in this star-studded cast, the core of which consists of Academy Award Winners, Sean Penn and Christopher Walken along with Mary Stuart Masterson. The supporting cast is impressive as well, featuring Chris Penn, Tracey Walter, Crispen Glover, Kiefer Sutherland and many others.As usual, Walken totally submerges himself into his character, the result of which should have earned him nominations for numerous awards. In retrospect this seems to be the point at which Sean Penn began to make his mark as a truly great, up and coming actor. His performance is sincere and passionate beyond anything he'd done previously. The film was made during the blissful period of his romance with, then wife, Madonna, who wrote and performed several hits for the soundtrack. I hate to admit it, but one tends to wonder how much influence she may have had on the dazzling success of his eventual achievements. She may very well have been the one who encouraged, even taught him to focus so deeply and channel his energy toward the burning performances for which he is now famous.In his adolescence, Penn's character, who has been raised in a poverty stricken environment, is reunited with his estranged father, (Walken), who lives in a near by town. He's already found the girl of his dreams, (Masterson), and is prepared to do whatever's necessary to provide a more comfortable lifestyle for the two of them. His newly found association with his father appears to be his ticket to their financial freedom. From there, the story evolves into a nightmarish tale based on a clan with strong family ties and a code of conduct similar to that of the Mafioso.There was one particular scene in the film that bothered me; it just didn't make sense. It involves a violent act from one of the primary cast members toward another and provokes a certain reaction from yet another. Again, It didn't make sense; the antagonist had to know, to some degree, what the consequences of his behavior would be. I couldn't understand why, in a film that was otherwise well structured, they felt the need to include this particular action. Then it hit me, this is a biographical piece and the assailant was obviously a psychopath. If this really happened it was far too important to ignore, no matter how illogical it may seen to the viewing audience.Any commentary, of the positive nature, that I produce is directed exclusively toward lesser-known films. After all, what's the point in my telling you how much and why I was enthralled by a flick that three quarters of the population has seen, or is planning to see. With this in mind, I honestly don't believe I'd be commenting here had this film had been released in the recent past. Considering the degree of respect that Penn's performances of this caliper have come to demand, I wouldn't have to. Most of you would already have seen it.

If this really happened it was far too important to ignore, no matter how illogical it may seen to the viewing audience.Any commentary, of the positive nature, that I produce is directed exclusively toward lesser-known films. After all, what's the point in my telling you how much and why I was enthralled by a flick that three quarters of the population has seen, or is planning to see. With this in mind, I honestly don't believe I'd be commenting here had this film had been released in the recent past. Considering the degree of respect that Penn's performances of this caliper have come to demand, I wouldn't have to. Most of you would already have seen it.

I attribute this, in part, to the fact that in 1986, one principal cast member had not yet come of age. At any rate, it's a timeless piece that I revisit often and each time I find it to be a genuinely rewarding experience.The plot and story line are based primarily on a true story of a family of thieves in the Midwest. The biographical aspect dramatically enhances the piece from a psychological standpoint, although I've always wondered how precisely the facts are portrayed. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good movie under any circumstances, I just believe that if the actual occurrences were as barbaric as they are illustrated here, the Whitewood family would be a household name nationwide. In fact, to this day I'm always on the lookout for biographical info on the family.Director James Foley brings out the absolute best in this star-studded cast, the core of which consists of Academy Award Winners, Sean Penn and Christopher Walken along with Mary Stuart Masterson. The supporting cast is impressive as well, featuring Chris Penn, Tracey Walter, Crispen Glover, Kiefer Sutherland and many others.As usual, Walken totally submerges himself into his character, the result of which should have earned him nominations for numerous awards. In retrospect this seems to be the point at which Sean Penn began to make his mark as a truly great, up and coming actor. His performance is sincere and passionate beyond anything he'd done previously. The film was made during the blissful period of his romance with, then wife, Madonna, who wrote and performed several hits for the soundtrack. I hate to admit it, but one tends to wonder how much influence she may have had on the dazzling success of his eventual achievements. She may very well have been the one who encouraged, even taught him to focus so deeply and channel his energy toward the burning performances for which he is now famous.In his adolescence, Penn's character, who has been raised in a poverty stricken environment, is reunited with his estranged father, (Walken), who lives in a near by town. He's already found the girl of his dreams, (Masterson), and is prepared to do whatever's necessary to provide a more comfortable lifestyle for the two of them. His newly found association with his father appears to be his ticket to their financial freedom. From there, the story evolves into a nightmarish tale based on a clan with strong family ties and a code of conduct similar to that of the Mafioso.There was one particular scene in the film that bothered me; it just didn't make sense. It involves a violent act from one of the primary cast members toward another and provokes a certain reaction from yet another. Again, It didn't make sense; the antagonist had to know, to some degree, what the consequences of his behavior would be. I couldn't understand why, in a film that was otherwise well structured, they felt the need to include this particular action. Then it hit me, this is a biographical piece and the assailant was obviously a psychopath.

This is a epic story of a subtle hero who ends up being painted, and with all right, as a god of warfare. You get to follow the Russian sniper through the battle of Stalingrad, in which he plays an very important role in taking back the Russian capital. A splendid movie that has you gripped in its immerse story-telling all the way to the end. A must see!Now all the acting in this movie are splendid and I especially liked Ed Harris and what he does with his character as the German officer who is, by his own request, sent in to terminate the Russian sniper, played by Jude Law. Law is good in his role but the real star of this movie is Rachel Weiz, who does a phenomenal job playing Jude Laws Love interest, also admired by Ralph Fines character who is one of the PR spokesmen for the Russian army.Now everything does not quite work out for Ralphs character but the end of the movie really took to my liking with him at least going with honor. A great movie.

Like The Odd Couple it owes most of its enduring success to the chemistry between Jane Fonda and Robert Redford (reprising his role in the Broadway show) as the hapless newlyweds trying desperately to make it work. This is the movie that is responsible for most of the mismatched romantic comedies we've ever seen, including Along Came Polly and TV's Dharma and Greg. It proves that flowery romantic prose isn't what makes a great love story, bold heroes and damsels in distress don't make a good love story. No, what makes a good love story are two people who, from start to finish, makes the audience go Oh, God in heaven, please let them work it out!The brilliant dialogue of Mr. Simon, the charm of Mr. Boyer and the majestic backdrop of New York City make this a must-see for anyone who loves 1, comedy, 2, love stories or 3, Robert Redford because after this, he never really made another movie that was at all comparable. Oh, I just remembered Laughter on the 23rd Floor. I guess it's a tie for best Neil Simon movie.
