[{"date":"6 April 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) runs a small neighborhood children's book family store handed down to her from her dead mother. Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) runs a large corporate box store about to put her out of business. Unbeknownst to either one of them, they are the best of internet friends. But in the real world, they can't stand each other.Director Nora Ephron rejoins with her 'Sleepless in Seattle' leads. The biggest difference is that the magic isn't there this time around. Sleepless doesn't let them get together until very late in the movie. Yet the radio talk show phone calls allow more magic in the story than the tippy tappy quippy internet correspondence. This time around, the forced separation really damages the movie. Having them involved with different people does nothing but drag out the movie. It does improve markedly when they are together after the closing of the store. This is not a special rom-com but it's reasonably acceptable.
