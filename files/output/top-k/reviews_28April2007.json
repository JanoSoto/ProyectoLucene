With each subsequent chapter in the franchise, the mystery behind Fred was stripped away, and he became less and less a figure of fear, and more of a wise-cracking pop culture icon to be loved and not loathed.Is it still even possible to watch the original movie and put this image out of one's mind? After many years of not having seen Wes's 1984 'classic' I decided to sit down and revisit Elm Street to find out.Craven's film starts with a credits sequence in which an unseen person crafts a pair of wicked looking razor-fingered gloves (all the better for slicing up teens with). We are then plunged into the first nightmare of the movie, as experienced by terrified teen Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) the poor girl is stalked by a hideously scarred man wearing the lethal gloves. This, of course, is Fred Krueger (Robert Englund), back from the dead to slaughter the children of those that took the law into their own hands years earlier, and sentenced him to death by fire.It seems that Tina is not the only one suffering from night-time visits from Fred most of the other teens on Elm Street have been seeing him in their dreams too. And when the kids start dying in mysterious circumstances, it is up to plucky Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), daughter of local policeman Lt. Thompson (John Saxon), to stand up to kiddie-killer Krueger.Whilst not perhaps deserving of its almost legendary status, A Nightmare On Elm Street is still, for the most part, a solid, fun and innovative movie which is well worth a watch. Craven makes good use of the whole dream idea, delivering some suitably nightmarish visuals accompanied by unnervingly creepy sound effects (most notably, the sound of Fred's 'fingers' scraping on metal). I can't say that I found the film particularly scary, but am willing to accept that this is probably due to my over familiarity with the whole Elm Street franchise.Craven builds the tension well, and the likable cast (including a young Johnny Depp) give reasonable performances, making the silly premise seem almost believable. And when the story threatens to drag, the savvy director has the good sense to pop in some creative and very bloody death sequences in order to regain the interest of the viewer.In fact, the film is pretty good up until the final showdown between Nancy and Fred, when Craven's script becomes a bit of a nonsensical mess, with our heroine dragging the killer into reality and luring him into several rather hastily set-up booby-traps. It is here that the film falters badly, with Nancy defeating Fred in a decidedly lame fashion (by ignoring him!). And then to make matters worse, the film finishes with a 'twist' ending which will leave you questioning what the hell just happened.If you are totally unfamiliar with the Elm Street series (which is unlikely, I know), then it is advisable to watch this one first to get the most from the film. As for the rest of us, don't watch this expecting to experience absolute terror&#151;it won't happen. Instead, sit back and enjoy one of the most influential horrors of the past few decades safe in the knowledge that, with the exception of maybe two of the sequels (Pts 3 and 7), they got a whole lot worse.

Sure, I realize my enjoyment of a movie can be affected by something like bad acting, but I as long as I find a certain level of entertainment in a movie, it's a good movie as far as I'm concerned and I rate it accordingly. So while I am perfectly capable of seeing the flaws in The Beastmaster, I have a blast every time I've seen it and have no problems rating it a 7\/10. And when you think about it, isn't having fun one of the most important things you can get out of a movie.I feel sorry for anyone who can't have a good time with The Beastmaster. I mean, what's not to like? If you can't have fun with an oily, buffed-up Marc Singer talking to his animals and swinging a nice sword; a half-dressed (and in one instance, a not dressed) Tanya Roberts; John Amos in S&M gear Rip Torn in dreads and a beak of a nose; ferrets; a tiger with a bad dye job; hideous witches; fights on a pyramid; an army on horseback with bat wing helmets; massive explosions; giant bird-like creatures who engulf their prey; and underground passages filled with crazed, berserker like guards, then you just don't know how to have a good time.Finally, I'm sick of hearing that The Beastmaster somehow ripped-off Conan the Barbarian (something I've heard repeatedly over the years). If you listen to the commentary on the DVD for The Beastmaster, you'll quickly realize that there is no way this movie could have been made in response to the success of Conan - it was pretty much in the can when Conan was released. The timing turned out to be a happy coincidence and I'm sure Don Coscarelli and Paul Pepperman were pleased with that. Conan created a market for Sword & Sorcerer movies in the early 80s. Admittedly, The Beastmaster rode that wave and, I'm sure, benefited form it. And it doesn't hurt that The Beastmaster is one of the best movies of this type that followed Conan.

The movie is based on two short stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke called In a Grove and Roshomon. There is a trial where the viewer is the judge. Four different people give their version of what happened in a murder. There is a bandit, a wood cutter, a wife and a woman medium who speaks as the dead husband. They all observed the murder, but they all have different stories. The Roshomon is a gate with different floors and levels where three men are discussing the murder and trial.This film was thought provoking because in court, there are usually at least two people who agree on what happened. In this case, each person presents different versions for different personal reasons. There are many unreliable narrators. They all lie. While some may say that dead men don't lie, I would say, well why can't they? The woodcutter doesn't tell the complete truth because he profits by selling one of the possible murder weapons. The bandit embellishes the story to make himself look tougher with sexual prowess. The wife calls on the appropriateness of the times and culture to protect herself. It would be a disgrace to show her shame in front of two men-one of them her husband. We really don't know what happened, but even the murdered husband could have lied via the medium to protect himself from embarrassment. I enjoyed this movie because it discusses motivations within the heart of man.The setting and atmosphere was wonderful. The play on light in the forest and grove was effective. The rain represented clearly the dark side of the sadness in life. Even the perspiration on the actors due to the actual temperature during filming worked in favor of the film. Two of the characters over acted. The bandit's laughing and the wife's dramatic crying was a little too much. However, when the wife abruptly stopped crying and became dead serious, she appeared almost mad. That portion of the film was well done.This film would most appeal to film study students who are interested in the technical aspects of film making and directing. It would also appeal to students studying the culture or country of Japan. Those who are interested in looking at human nature and watching films without the pat clear ending will like this as well. While this film was quite drawn out in some scenes, fortunately we have the fast forward button. I loved the emotion, tense scenes and the unique look at human nature. The significance of the film in view of reality, is pondering the question, can we ever really know what the truth is?

That portion of the film was well done.This film would most appeal to film study students who are interested in the technical aspects of film making and directing. It would also appeal to students studying the culture or country of Japan. Those who are interested in looking at human nature and watching films without the pat clear ending will like this as well. While this film was quite drawn out in some scenes, fortunately we have the fast forward button. I loved the emotion, tense scenes and the unique look at human nature. The significance of the film in view of reality, is pondering the question, can we ever really know what the truth is?

Never stooping to Republican style crusades like the fight for truth, justice and the American way, he battles the real bad guys, those in our society who pretend to be something they are not (and no the irony is not lost on me). The ruthless CEO, the corrupt cop, the sleazy politician. In this, the original movie, corruption has overtaken Gotham. In fact in Gotham police and corruption go together like. . .Batman and Robin. . .or police corruption and the NYPD. Tim Burton, visual magician that he is delivers a decent adaptation that felt too sluggish for my own personal taste. I know that it is supposed to be dark and foreboding, and it is. But it is overlong, filled with padding, and indulges Jack who is all too happy to play Jack in face paint. The finale had all the depth of a fireworks display. Plus I have been spoiled, Batman Begins reigns supreme in my mind as the high and mighty dark knight of comic book movies, leaving this and every other superhero flick in its dust.The film is more of an actors showcase than I am used to from Burton. At its center lies Michael Keaton as Batman\/Bruce Wayne, and there is something so perfect about his portrayal of Wayne. In him I see everything we want to be. Not just rich and selfless and able to bed Kim Basinger (three things the vast majority of people are not), but things on a more personal level. He's smooth and confident and charming. I love the way he is both the center of the city and a total recluse. While my apartment is busy being littered with pizza boxes, he lives in a mansion which means that somehow he has earned the right to be thought of as a dignified loner. Now he is much less of a butt kicker than new breed Batman Christian Bale, so we have to stretch our imaginations a little further during the fight sequences because Keaton's muscles are only suit deep. As far as Jack Nicholson as the Joker goes, I had as much fun as anyone listening to his hysterical laughter and watching him dance across the screen. I just worry that Burton felt as though if he filled the movie with enough Nicholson bombast then the rest would all fall into place. Sure he gets a few laughs, but you don't see the Joker you see Jack Nicholson overpowering the role.I know I'm weird for watching the second film before this one, but that is just how I roll. More than anything I missed the Penguin; he had such a vile presence that he elevated Batman Returns. The set design is more restrained here. What felt cartoony in Returns here still feels over the top but not really Burton-ish. And while I ripped on Returns for having bad, corny lines I will admit I sort of missed them this go round. Of course I'll take humor wherever I can get it, but this being about a caped crusader I know what is on the menu. The plot, about the Joker's plot to poison the cities hygiene products with something that makes them smile like him and then die is sort of funny but nothing overly grand. Sorry but most comic book movies are kind of bad and I am adding this one to the pile. I have affection for it, but it was about one producers cut away from being a good movie. But who needs this one anyways, we have another Christopher Nolan Batman on the horizon. **3\/4 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 April 2007","score":"","review":" I'm no comic book geek, but to me Batman has always been a favorite fictional character of mine.

One can often test the intellectual mean of readers, in fact, by asking them to describe its content. Less astute readers will mistake the story for being about the terror of constant surveillance, of having no thought left unchecked by the powers that be. While this is an element of Orwell's nightmare Oceania society, it is not the mechanism by which this awesome extent of thought control is achieved. And once one understands that Orwell's nightmare scenario had more to do with the modification of language in order to make divergent thought difficult or even impossible, the flaws in this film adaptation start to stand out like Patricia Heaton at a conference for adults with Asperger's Syndrome. It is somewhat ironic, because it is the things that the film omits that become its downfall.When Winston, portrayed here in a very convincing fashion by John Hurt, writes the date in his diary, the novel diverts into a thread about his doubts about the date. Since his job is mainly concerned with the rewriting of history, and a truthful history no longer seems to exist, he has little idea of what the date could truly be. For all he knows, it could be 1954, 2024, or 2084. This is a critically important point that a lot of modern essays regarding the novel miss. It was Orwell's way of saying this could be happening at any time, not just at some vague point in that point of dismissal we call the future. Another point the film misses is that the society depicted in the novel was in a transitional stage. The changes necessary to bring the society to the stage depicted in the film likely took place over so many years that, as stated in THX 1138, nobody really noticed until it was too late to complain. The changes still to come would likely take just as long, but that is an ancillary point to the story.George Orwell was quite a believer in the freedom of language, and nowhere is this more apparent in his appendix describing the principles of Newspeak. The real horror of Nineteen Eighty-Four was not the constant surveillance or the legality of torturing disbelievers. The real terror in Orwell's novel was the modification of language to make abstract thought impossible, and non-compliant thought incredibly difficult. Try this experiment on for size if you are having trouble with that idea. Think up all the words you know that describe a woman who is overtly sexual and unashamed of the fact, and think of all the ones that describe such a woman in a flattering manner. When you come to the realisation that the English language does not have any, you will realise that the language modification that Orwell described in his novel has been happening for some time, and continues to happen even today. Thoughts not in keeping with the party ideology must be corrected, even if it involves murdering children.And that is where the major fault of the film lies. Although it spares no detail in describing the squalor and hopelessness the protagonists live in, much of the detail of why they are in this situation has been lost. Describing the reason why the Two Minutes Hate ends with chanting Big Brother's initials or why loving relationships are outlawed except in very specific circumstances is a very tricky thing to pull off in film. Explaining that Big Brother, or rather the people behind that facade, feel threatened when furious, intense emotions are not directed towards them instead of elsewhere, is a task very few directors are equal to. And this is a real problem, because without those bits of background information to glue together Oceania and its motives, the story starts to come apart at the seams. We see moments that were quite evocative in the novel, such as Julia tearing off the party uniform, rendered as incredibly sterile and unmoving in film. Everything seems so perfunctory when it should be a cry to the heavens for answers.And with the true reason for the story's timeless quality lost, the film ironically ends up more dated than a calendar. All films are a product of their time, of course, but some manage to transcend their time and become a cultural icon for all of the ages. I think the fact that Orwell's novel is still read and debated near to sixty years after its publication says it all regarding the timelessness of the novel. The problem for this film is that a mere ten years after its first release, it was not only forgotten, but almost impossible to find. The DVD format allows it to be seen once again, but that only serves to highlight why it was relegated to the most obscure section of the weekly rental market in the first place. Even the most terrifying scenes of the novel, such as when we learn what actually is in Room 101, just come off as a lot of flat recitation in this film. Many libraries in various countries banned the novel for its revolutionary image.

Is there anyone who finds it kinda odd that it's on the second place rather than the first one? I mean, at the Top 250 -list this and Godfather has the rating of 9.1, but when you click on The Shawshank Redemption it seems to have the rating of 9.2 and even more votes than Godfather. Is it just that the staff at IMDb has just simply forgotten to update the list? Well anyways, to the review itself. I just watched this movie last night and I've seen it once before as well, as I am indeed the proud owner of the DVD. The movie is just pure excellence, or at least for me and it is no wonder it's ranked so high at IMDb. A perfect example of the fact that Stephen King is not just a writer of horror.What probably amazes me the most in this movie is that it's just so very well written. I mean, I think that a screenplay couldn't be more perfect than it is in this movie. It's just so good that it makes you smile throughout the movie, it just flows through so smoothly that it makes you think How on earth can it be this good? Pieces of the puzzle connect together in a rhythmic way, which make your eyes freeze because of the harmonic perfection it provides, it makes you show your emotions It makes you sad, it makes you angry and it makes you laugh. It's just so good you don't want it to end. Just pure completeness.The cast is just superb, every right actor for the right role. I must admit that I've never liked Tim Robbins so much, but in this movie the role given to him is just perfect and the role performance he does is his best yet to date. No other person can make that cold glance he does with his eyes, the whole cold substance he has. There is just something so spooky in him. Even when Tim Robbins does a great job, even more greater job does the all mighty Morgan Freeman, who I think is one of the best actors in the history of the movies. The man just doesn't have a bad role performance, maybe even not an average one. His role performance as Red, the provider of things at Shawshank prison, is for me just so ideal. I think that the choice of him being the narrator in the monologue is just brilliant. Morgan Freeman's voice is just so fitting to this movie that it almost makes your skin tremble. The monologue itself is also very well written and it progresses itself among the whole screenplay in a so magnificent way that.. Well, I already told you about the completeness.The one who is in charge of the music is the composer Thomas Newman, who I think is the perfect choice for composing the music to a movie like this.

Is it just that the staff at IMDb has just simply forgotten to update the list? Well anyways, to the review itself. I just watched this movie last night and I've seen it once before as well, as I am indeed the proud owner of the DVD. The movie is just pure excellence, or at least for me and it is no wonder it's ranked so high at IMDb. A perfect example of the fact that Stephen King is not just a writer of horror.What probably amazes me the most in this movie is that it's just so very well written. I mean, I think that a screenplay couldn't be more perfect than it is in this movie. It's just so good that it makes you smile throughout the movie, it just flows through so smoothly that it makes you think How on earth can it be this good? Pieces of the puzzle connect together in a rhythmic way, which make your eyes freeze because of the harmonic perfection it provides, it makes you show your emotions It makes you sad, it makes you angry and it makes you laugh. It's just so good you don't want it to end. Just pure completeness.The cast is just superb, every right actor for the right role. I must admit that I've never liked Tim Robbins so much, but in this movie the role given to him is just perfect and the role performance he does is his best yet to date. No other person can make that cold glance he does with his eyes, the whole cold substance he has. There is just something so spooky in him. Even when Tim Robbins does a great job, even more greater job does the all mighty Morgan Freeman, who I think is one of the best actors in the history of the movies. The man just doesn't have a bad role performance, maybe even not an average one. His role performance as Red, the provider of things at Shawshank prison, is for me just so ideal. I think that the choice of him being the narrator in the monologue is just brilliant. Morgan Freeman's voice is just so fitting to this movie that it almost makes your skin tremble. The monologue itself is also very well written and it progresses itself among the whole screenplay in a so magnificent way that.. Well, I already told you about the completeness.The one who is in charge of the music is the composer Thomas Newman, who I think is the perfect choice for composing the music to a movie like this. If I had to choose someone else, I think the closest one would be Micheal Giacchino, but I can't even think about that so much as the music in this movie is just so amazing in the way it is.

Here he is a wage slave in a huge life insurance company, a drone among many, but a bachelor with his own apartment much desired by his promiscuous bosses for their affairs. With the carrot of promotions dangled in front of him, C.C. obliges them by letting them use it and spends most of his off hours pacing in front of his apartment waiting for the clandestine couples to leave.the movie adds multiple layers to this. It is a comment on the soul-less offices of the day when men like C.C.'s bosses preyed on their female underlings and the loneliness of lives in the big city without community is highlighted.The black and white filming, stark in its depiction of New York, the sound track, the brilliant script which lifts what could be mundane to the level of the sublime, the believable characters of C.C. and Fran (Played by a luminous Shirley Maclaine) who never, even to the end, fall into a maudlin mess, all contribute to get a rare 10 out of 10 from me.Five viewings later, I'm looking forward to my sixth.

I saw it first in Ireland, many many years ago when censorship still reigned freely over that fair land and the scissors of the censor wore out with all the snips in this one ( another great cutting movie was Gigi, don't get me started!).When I saw it years later I was overjoyed at what an absolute delight it was. Imagine a movie about clandestine sex without any sex being shown at all. Not even one kiss between any of the major characters. Not even at the end when you know it's all going to work out and they're going to have a cottage and kids and everything.Jack Lemmon, playing C.C. Baxter, who was reined in pretty tightly by Billy, gives an outstanding performance. Jack underplaying anything is to be treasured (another wonderful gem being Dad).

The development of science and technology is far from what people expected several decades ago, we cannot make the moon liveable, cannot cure cancer, cannot find more efficient fuel, what a disappointed result! and plus the environments are worsened day by day.We'll definitely be cool when we face UFOs now because it's just a different form of life even though we don't know exactly the essence of life, we can research organic life precisely, but I always believe there's a more mysterious form of power that determined the uniqueness of lives. We are just too blind to see it.The grand specific effects in this film is simply stunning, hard to imagine how Spielberg made it work at that time! I think Spielberg assumed the way of the communication between human beings and aliens as a matter of course which was unreasonable, but who knows! Glad to see Francois Truffaut played a quite big role in this movie, the cast is good but I don't like they put too much emphasis on the obsession of UFOs by Richard Dreyfuss's role, intended to be dramatic but too over.Citizens can not do anything to government's lies which is ironic because truth is always hidden, we just sit at home, enjoy the news on TV and we think we know everything but we're definitely not.I believe extra-terrestrial, if not we are just lonely leftovers of the whole universe, a truth too cruel to accept!

We all have had something beautiful, exciting, and wonderful in our grasp, but some of us were foolish and scared enough to let that splendid something escape. Maybe we'll get another chance, maybe we won't, but the pain of regret in between can become unbearable.This is what our protagonist, Cary Scott, goes through. Cary (Jane Wyman)is a widow of a certain age, who feels trapped by her pristine, suburban existence. She has two children who are away at college, and she is beginning to realize that all her neighbors who claim to be her friends are a bunch of shallow, phony elitists. Cary is unexpectedly swept off her feet by dashing nature lover Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson, as ridiculously charming and brawny as ever). They fall instantly in love and Cary's zest for life is restored by Ron's kindness and simple life values. The fact that Ron is Cary's gardener and over a decade younger than she is doesn't sit well with her neighbors, her callow, eggheaded daughter, or her boorish son. Cary tries to be strong, but her role as the perfect, 1950s suburbanite blinds her to her heart's desire. Cary ends her relationship with Ron... and soon sees how stupid she was to care about others' opinions. Will she get another chance at love, or is she doomed to waste away all alone in a small-town Purgatory? Douglas Sirk drenches All That Heaven Allows in lush, autumnal hues and sweet, somewhat ironic, orchestral score. If it's not one of the best films ever made, it certainly is one of the most beautiful to look at. Wyman and Hudson ooze with romantic chemistry, and the supporting cast of actors are all deliciously hateful as the antagonists who try to tear our lovers apart. Hudson is charming and earthy as always, and with his soothing voice, broad shoulders and ready smile, you don't blame Cary at all for falling for him (who wouldn't??). I liked Jane Wyman as Cary, but found myself wishing she'd stop being so damn nice and just give her horrible kids and friends a good smack in the face and a proper chewing out for trying to dictate her life. There is so much more going on beneath the surface of ATHA Sirk, without being preachy, shows us the common, conformist attitude of the 1950s. How many people saw their loved ones be blacklisted during the McCarthy years... and cruelly abandoned them just because of fear of rumors and speculation? How many husbands kept mum when women were practically forced to be only wives and mothers? ATHA doesn't bring up these issues, but it does make one important point Conformity, injustice, and bitter silence ran rampant during that time. Yet older generations foolishly pine for the '50s with rose-colored nostalgia.But throwing away your dreams because of what others' think is an ancient problem in human nature, which Sirk primarily addresses. We must learn, sooner or later, that it is more important to do what we feel, not what others tell us, is right. Follow you heart, Sirk urges us. This is what Cary must learn, what we must all learn.

Is amazing how anyone can make an excellent film around the common and very used subject Who killed him?. Well this is an example of how a movie can be unoriginal on its basis but still become a good and original film; is a pleasure for the ones that like thrillers, and this one puts an erotic additional touch that make the movie even better. I liked the acting performances too much. Douglas plays an insecure, somehow innocent, decided but not very intelligent cop with some shadows in his past. Great!, Stone plays one of the greatest cold, manipulative, intelligent characters that i have seen so far!.About the Movie Michael Douglas plays here the role of detective Nick Curran, a police officer that has been assigned to a case where a former rock star, Johnny Boz is found murdered on his bed, naked and tied. Nick, with his mate Gus (Goerge Dzundza) traces the main suspect of the murder, the beautiful writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), girlfriend of the star, who almost a year before described on a book an exact type of murder.
