I've also seen some real howlers. Charlie's Angels has both feet firmly in the first category, and is easily one of the best movies of it's genre, ever.Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's slickly produced. But, unlike so many recent films to which that description could be easily applied (Hollow Man, The Cell), Angels is so obviously aware of it's own blatant ridiculousness. For this, it is to be applauded. Sitting through MI2, another 70's action-based TV show turned into a slick, effects-driven third-millennial movie, you get the horrible feeling that the directors really believed they could turn a ridiculous, campy TV show into some deep and meaningful social critique. No such high-brow pretentiousness in this film - from the opening scene, which slots in a barely-audible conciously self-mocking one-liner, all the way through every clever reference and spoofed scene, through every pointless chase and exaggerated fight-scene, through every nodding innuendo, predictable plot twist and traditional baddie, McG and his cast have made a film which acknowledges all the tongue-in-cheek sass and cheesiness present in the original.70s TV cop shows, of which Angels was perhaps the perfect example, revelled in their lack of plot but enormous amount of explosions, random car chases and beautiful characters. The clichés in this film are not lazily slotted in through lack of invention, but deliberately sprinkled throughout to give the whole piece a knowing quality. Even the cinematography is deliberately plagiristic of the 70s TV show.In fact, Angels is nearly as referential as anything Kevin Smith has put his name to. Just check out Drew Barrymore's ET shirt for proof of that. I get the impression that alot of people were expecting a MI2 style remake, and thus missed the point of this wonderful film.If you want a great Kung-fu movie, go rent Enter the Dragon. If you want a deep and meaningful plot, Fight Club has just been released on DVD, and Dancer in the Dark is still in cinemas. If you want a day-glo cross between Mystery Men, Austin Powers and any James Bond movie you care to mention, all wrapped up in a stunning soundtrack (NOT replicated on the CD, sadly) and very modern effects, go see Charlie's Angels.Seriously, if you have any memories at all of Farrah Fawcett and her high-kicking pals, you'll adore this film.

I can't find a single word that more accurately describes this movie.  I was looking forward to seeing it and expected to see a good movie.  I do have some spoilers later, so be warned.There's a woman who refuses to speak, for seemingly no reason at all.  I guess so that a movie can be made about it.  Stupid.  She's forced to leave whatever land she's from because her father has forced her to marry a man who lives in the New Zealand outback, one who she has never met or seen.  Stupid.I guess the biggest problem I had with this movie was that Holly Hunter's character, the heroine, is NOT LIKEABLE!  She is cold and unfeeling, and lacks any personality except when she pours her heart into her piano.  Like that's supposed to be enough to show us any real depth to her personality.  But I went with it.I actually liked Harvey Keitel's character, but I didn't buy his actions.  He becomes enamored with the piano and with Hunter's character, again for seemingly no reason.  Again, probably so they could make a movie about it.  She's cold and unfeeling.  She plays a few bars of something or other, and all of the sudden, he's infatuated with her.  Then, in an effort to impress and sweep his new bride off her feet, Sam Neill's character decides to trade Holly's piano to Keitel for some land.  Uh, yeah.  OK.  Like he'd really do that.  Like she says in the movie, IT'S HER PIANO!  HERS!!!  But again, they wouldn't have had a movie unless he did it, so it's OK.  So, to get her piano back, Keitel, who uses the piano as an aphrodisiac for some reason, agrees to trade her keys for favors, which are initially just weird, then turn sexual in nature.  Again, it doesn't make much sense, but I went with it.Then, Neil's character finds out and gets insanely jealous and angry.  Why?  Holly had given him NOTHING.  She has NO PERSONALITY.  What is there to be jealous of?  Throw her out and forget it.  Why does he even care?  I can't believe that he loves her, or even LIKES her.  Stupid.  Then, when she tries to contact Keitel again and Neil finds out, what does he do?  He CUTS HER FINGER OFF.  Actually, he CHOPS IT OFF WITH AN AXE.  This is where the movie reached a new plateau of stupid and ridiculous.  So much so, that I laughed out loud when he chopped off her digit.Neil then has a remarkable change of heart about the whole thing, again for seemingly no reason, and allows Holly to leave with Keitel.  On the boat ride out, Holly decides she doesn't want the Piano anymore and orders it thrown into the sea.  Now, I understand what's happening here.  She's found love and doesn't feel she needs the piano to express herself anymore.  That's fine, but she still loves the piano.  She loves to play it, and she loves that one in particular.  So she just wants to throw it overboard?  Again, it's utterly stupid, but I guess they couldn't express the metaphor any other way.  However, the stupidity of throwing the piano overboard just to express that metaphor pales in comparison to the stupidity of what happens as the piano goes over.Holly's foot gets caught in the rope tying that's tied to the piano, and she gets dragged down towards the sea floor along with the piano.  Wow, what are the odds.  And I knew it was going to happen before they even shoved the piano over.  Again, it was done only because they needed to have a metaphor of Holly truly escaping the piano, which is what she miraculously does underwater.Finally, the movie comes to a merciful end with a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY they lived happily ever after scene.  This scene is unnecessary whether you liked the movie and bought what it was selling or not.It's really disappointing to me that this type of high class drivel is made.  It's even more disappointing that this drivel is so highly praised.  The only thing redeeming about this movie is the performance of Anna Paquin, who is adorable as Holly's daughter.  Unfortunately, her performance is tainted because her only real purpose in the movie is to serve as a translator when writing and sign language might slow a scene down too much.  I also expected a great score, but thought it was extremely mediocre.  Any actor could have learned to play what was in the movie in a matter of weeks.STUPID.

Again, probably so they could make a movie about it.  She's cold and unfeeling.  She plays a few bars of something or other, and all of the sudden, he's infatuated with her.  Then, in an effort to impress and sweep his new bride off her feet, Sam Neill's character decides to trade Holly's piano to Keitel for some land.  Uh, yeah.  OK.  Like he'd really do that.  Like she says in the movie, IT'S HER PIANO!  HERS!!!  But again, they wouldn't have had a movie unless he did it, so it's OK.  So, to get her piano back, Keitel, who uses the piano as an aphrodisiac for some reason, agrees to trade her keys for favors, which are initially just weird, then turn sexual in nature.  Again, it doesn't make much sense, but I went with it.Then, Neil's character finds out and gets insanely jealous and angry.  Why?  Holly had given him NOTHING.  She has NO PERSONALITY.  What is there to be jealous of?  Throw her out and forget it.  Why does he even care?  I can't believe that he loves her, or even LIKES her.  Stupid.  Then, when she tries to contact Keitel again and Neil finds out, what does he do?  He CUTS HER FINGER OFF.  Actually, he CHOPS IT OFF WITH AN AXE.  This is where the movie reached a new plateau of stupid and ridiculous.  So much so, that I laughed out loud when he chopped off her digit.Neil then has a remarkable change of heart about the whole thing, again for seemingly no reason, and allows Holly to leave with Keitel.  On the boat ride out, Holly decides she doesn't want the Piano anymore and orders it thrown into the sea.  Now, I understand what's happening here.  She's found love and doesn't feel she needs the piano to express herself anymore.  That's fine, but she still loves the piano.  She loves to play it, and she loves that one in particular.  So she just wants to throw it overboard?  Again, it's utterly stupid, but I guess they couldn't express the metaphor any other way.  However, the stupidity of throwing the piano overboard just to express that metaphor pales in comparison to the stupidity of what happens as the piano goes over.Holly's foot gets caught in the rope tying that's tied to the piano, and she gets dragged down towards the sea floor along with the piano.  Wow, what are the odds.  And I knew it was going to happen before they even shoved the piano over.  Again, it was done only because they needed to have a metaphor of Holly truly escaping the piano, which is what she miraculously does underwater.Finally, the movie comes to a merciful end with a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY they lived happily ever after scene.  This scene is unnecessary whether you liked the movie and bought what it was selling or not.It's really disappointing to me that this type of high class drivel is made.  It's even more disappointing that this drivel is so highly praised.  The only thing redeeming about this movie is the performance of Anna Paquin, who is adorable as Holly's daughter.  Unfortunately, her performance is tainted because her only real purpose in the movie is to serve as a translator when writing and sign language might slow a scene down too much.  I also expected a great score, but thought it was extremely mediocre.  Any actor could have learned to play what was in the movie in a matter of weeks.STUPID.

I can't find a single word that more accurately describes this movie.  I was looking forward to seeing it and expected to see a good movie.  I do have some spoilers later, so be warned.There's a woman who refuses to speak, for seemingly no reason at all.  I guess so that a movie can be made about it.  Stupid.  She's forced to leave whatever land she's from because her father has forced her to marry a man who lives in the New Zealand outback, one who she has never met or seen.  Stupid.I guess the biggest problem I had with this movie was that Holly Hunter's character, the heroine, is NOT LIKEABLE!

It's haunting, pretty, minimalist, and has the ability to convey a wide range of emotions by mainly using slide guitar (maybe a lap steel).The story is of a man (Harry Dean Stanton) who has gone through a fugue. We find him in the beginning almost passing out in the desert from exhaustion, standing there dumbfounded, looking at his surroundings.  Later we learn that he has disappeared for a few years, while his son, Hunter, is now living with his brother and his wife (Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clement). Slowly he realizes what happened in his life, and he decides to dedicate himself to bringing his son back to his mother.  The story is simple, but at the same time, you find yourself questioning many things.  I'm not a huge fan of psychology, mainly because I find explaining my actions by the brain's accord too deterministic, but you'll do your share of wondering nonetheless.Another thing that makes this movie fantastic is the direction of Wim Wenders.  This is the first film I've seen by him (`Lisbon Story' was after that), and I was blown away.  The scene where Travis and Hunter are walking up the street is amazing.  The way the sunlight hits everything on the street, and how the odd angle up the street is concomitant with that will leave you awestruck.  On one sunny morning, Travis is cleaning everyone's shoes, looking at the shadow of an airplane at a nearby airport.  That may seem lame, but if you're open-minded and appreciate the beauty of landscapes, you'll understand what I mean.  Wenders managed to capture the beauty of the areas where he filmed.  He even brings out effulgence in dusty, rural streets.  You can see more of these types of pictures in a book by him called `Written in the West.'The settings are important also.  There are little things you'll notice (not necessarily symbolically as much as cinematically) with more viewings that will captivate you.  The `hotel' scene at the end is amazing to watch. And if this movie seems a little languid in its pace, that's because, for the most part, Sam Shepard writes that way.  There isn't a lot of flashy dialog, and there's not a lot of action.  You can probably expect that from someone who has written award winning plays.  But please, I beg you, don't watch halfway through and give up.

I was only 3 when it came out, but in comparison to most movies, it will outlast most you'll see now.Ry Cooder did the gorgeous soundtrack, which is intrepid on its own, but it adds ineffably to the movie, which you will see upon viewing it.  It's haunting, pretty, minimalist, and has the ability to convey a wide range of emotions by mainly using slide guitar (maybe a lap steel).The story is of a man (Harry Dean Stanton) who has gone through a fugue. We find him in the beginning almost passing out in the desert from exhaustion, standing there dumbfounded, looking at his surroundings.  Later we learn that he has disappeared for a few years, while his son, Hunter, is now living with his brother and his wife (Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clement). Slowly he realizes what happened in his life, and he decides to dedicate himself to bringing his son back to his mother.  The story is simple, but at the same time, you find yourself questioning many things.  I'm not a huge fan of psychology, mainly because I find explaining my actions by the brain's accord too deterministic, but you'll do your share of wondering nonetheless.Another thing that makes this movie fantastic is the direction of Wim Wenders.  This is the first film I've seen by him (`Lisbon Story' was after that), and I was blown away.  The scene where Travis and Hunter are walking up the street is amazing.  The way the sunlight hits everything on the street, and how the odd angle up the street is concomitant with that will leave you awestruck.  On one sunny morning, Travis is cleaning everyone's shoes, looking at the shadow of an airplane at a nearby airport.  That may seem lame, but if you're open-minded and appreciate the beauty of landscapes, you'll understand what I mean.  Wenders managed to capture the beauty of the areas where he filmed.  He even brings out effulgence in dusty, rural streets.  You can see more of these types of pictures in a book by him called `Written in the West.'The settings are important also.  There are little things you'll notice (not necessarily symbolically as much as cinematically) with more viewings that will captivate you.  The `hotel' scene at the end is amazing to watch. And if this movie seems a little languid in its pace, that's because, for the most part, Sam Shepard writes that way.  There isn't a lot of flashy dialog, and there's not a lot of action.

(Wu is the Chinese character for martial, and Xia for chivalry or chivalrous fighter.) If I have a find an film analogy for Americans to fully appreciate this film , it's X-men I would compare to. When in chaotic times (especially when at war , or when the society is extremely unfair,) authors (common in every culture) write story like this to express their anger toward injustice. I don't use Batman as an analogy, because in X-men, more political and emotional sides of human nature are discussed.  And that's why X-men, the movie got much higher rating on IMDB than that of Batman 3 or Batman 4.If you can accept the ideology of this fantasy, you'll find a lot of implicit story lines that you can come home with and mull for a long time.For those who don't fully comprehend the story because of the fast pace and huge amount of interconnected dialogue, Jen dies. Ang Lee didn't make such a big mistake to make this a ghost story.Another idea that is to be clarified is, for WuXia novel readers, those fighters don't fly. (WHAT A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING!) Those trained fighter must bounce against something to make a high jump, just like Wolverine, not Storm nor Rogue. It's called the light-body KungFu. Modern athletes tie lead straps around the ankles , and when without straps, they jump higher. That is the basic idea of this kind of training. It's just WuXia fighter boosts this jumping power by inner power (like the Force in Star Wars, this idea is better known to yoga learner. And Chinese KungFu has its roots from India with Buddhism coming to China)I do think the bamboo scene is overdone, a lot of WuXia novel readers think so, too. But the 1st fight scene is much more real. The close-body fight between Jen and ShuLien, I think that is something those of you have learned Tai-chi boxing understand. I suggest you guys rent Ang Lee's first famous debut Pushing hands, this is about the relation of an immigrant Tai-chi master and his son and American daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law is a perfect example of one who fears what she doesn't understand. And Tai-chi boxing are strongly founded on physics.The director's intention is to elevate action-packed traditional WuXia movies to the next level. And he did it. As for those of you who think the film doesn't live up to your expectations , maybe you should blame the Sony Classics' overdone promotional ads and campaigns. And which film promo doesn't overdo itself these days?I don't know why this choreography term has been overly inflicted on this film. Martial art is martial art. This term connotes dance, but has nothing to do with martial art.For those of you who think CTHD is not as good as The Matrix, CTHD is a rommance with action. Matrix is a sci-fi with action. They're not supposed to be the same. What they have in common are that they both hired YUEN HO-PING as martial art director to present the fight scenes. And They both deal with spiritual and skill elevation topic.For those of you who think CTHD's story lines are too vague, some friends of mine don't get what Matrix is about after watching. (Maybe their faults!) And CTHD requires more brainstorming to fully appreciate its petite treasures scattered everywhere throughout the movie.As a Taiwan viewer, I personally don't deem CTHD is my all-time favorite (which is actually Forest Gump.) But it's worth the admission. Maybe you should watch it again on DVD 6 months from now, but the unprecedented action scenes are something you can't fully enjoy at home -- unless you're rich enough to have a home theater.And someone compares the I must avenge my master's death part to Star Wars' dark side of the force issue, cum' on, this is a sub-sub-sub plot of CTHD.

(Wu is the Chinese character for martial, and Xia for chivalry or chivalrous fighter.) If I have a find an film analogy for Americans to fully appreciate this film , it's X-men I would compare to. When in chaotic times (especially when at war , or when the society is extremely unfair,) authors (common in every culture) write story like this to express their anger toward injustice. I don't use Batman as an analogy, because in X-men, more political and emotional sides of human nature are discussed.  And that's why X-men, the movie got much higher rating on IMDB than that of Batman 3 or Batman 4.If you can accept the ideology of this fantasy, you'll find a lot of implicit story lines that you can come home with and mull for a long time.For those who don't fully comprehend the story because of the fast pace and huge amount of interconnected dialogue, Jen dies. Ang Lee didn't make such a big mistake to make this a ghost story.Another idea that is to be clarified is, for WuXia novel readers, those fighters don't fly. (WHAT A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING!) Those trained fighter must bounce against something to make a high jump, just like Wolverine, not Storm nor Rogue. It's called the light-body KungFu. Modern athletes tie lead straps around the ankles , and when without straps, they jump higher. That is the basic idea of this kind of training. It's just WuXia fighter boosts this jumping power by inner power (like the Force in Star Wars, this idea is better known to yoga learner. And Chinese KungFu has its roots from India with Buddhism coming to China)I do think the bamboo scene is overdone, a lot of WuXia novel readers think so, too. But the 1st fight scene is much more real. The close-body fight between Jen and ShuLien, I think that is something those of you have learned Tai-chi boxing understand. I suggest you guys rent Ang Lee's first famous debut Pushing hands, this is about the relation of an immigrant Tai-chi master and his son and American daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law is a perfect example of one who fears what she doesn't understand. And Tai-chi boxing are strongly founded on physics.The director's intention is to elevate action-packed traditional WuXia movies to the next level. And he did it. As for those of you who think the film doesn't live up to your expectations , maybe you should blame the Sony Classics' overdone promotional ads and campaigns. And which film promo doesn't overdo itself these days?I don't know why this choreography term has been overly inflicted on this film. Martial art is martial art. This term connotes dance, but has nothing to do with martial art.For those of you who think CTHD is not as good as The Matrix, CTHD is a rommance with action. Matrix is a sci-fi with action. They're not supposed to be the same. What they have in common are that they both hired YUEN HO-PING as martial art director to present the fight scenes. And They both deal with spiritual and skill elevation topic.For those of you who think CTHD's story lines are too vague, some friends of mine don't get what Matrix is about after watching. (Maybe their faults!) And CTHD requires more brainstorming to fully appreciate its petite treasures scattered everywhere throughout the movie.As a Taiwan viewer, I personally don't deem CTHD is my all-time favorite (which is actually Forest Gump.) But it's worth the admission. Maybe you should watch it again on DVD 6 months from now, but the unprecedented action scenes are something you can't fully enjoy at home -- unless you're rich enough to have a home theater.And someone compares the I must avenge my master's death part to Star Wars' dark side of the force issue, cum' on, this is a sub-sub-sub plot of CTHD.  Star War is more adventure-oriented , and CTHD deals with subtle issues.  The emotional parts are for the heart, and the action scenes are for the eyes.
