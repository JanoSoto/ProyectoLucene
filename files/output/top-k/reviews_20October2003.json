The acting, especially that of Ms. Hewitt, is amateurish, at best; the direction was far below par; and the scares are wholly lacking in effectiveness. Furthermore, the twists in the plot were so predictable that we had it figured out less than half way through the movie. And the plot. Where do I begin? No, I won't do it. It's not possible. There IS no plot. No plot, no story, no cohesion, just mindless slasher-styled death. They failed to capture even the most animalistic need to see bloodshed. This flick is purely idiotic.I won't sit here and break down the entire movie. It doesn't deserve that.And the addition of Jack Black as a wanna-be Jamaican?! WTF?! It looked like he wandered onto the set from another movie. Perhaps an Adam Sandler\/Dana Carvey collaboration.This movie's only redeeming quality was the use of the houngon. It was the only nice touch in this otherwise dismal display of a horrid waste of film.It rates a 1.2\/10 from...the Fiend .
