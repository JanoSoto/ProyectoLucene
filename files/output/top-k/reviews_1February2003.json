This was one of those movies I had wondered about before I saw.  Will it just be another cheesy movie.  You know the type that uses well edited trailers with great soundtracks to draw you in.  Of course then you see it and then wonder why you were fooled.  This was one of those movies for me.  I thought it wasn't going to be scary.  I just wanted to see it and get it over with.  Throughout the movie I realized it wasn't a terrifying movie.  Not something that just scared you senseless, but there was something.  There was something there.  There was just something about it that creeps you out.  It was a little oddly scary.  Certain scenes like being pursued on the open road in the middle of nowhere by a maniac, well that's scary.  Just the idea, that it could happen.  As the movie goes on.  You realize (for certain reasons) this would never happen.  Although, the main idea, of a stalker tormenting you is scary.  I wouldn't want to see this movie and be on a long country road at night.  Just the same way as I wouldn't want to swim after Jaws or go camping after Friday the 13th.  Just alone I don't think these movies are particularly scary.  Its when you take the element of what parts could happen in reality thats when it becomes creepy.  You can totally put yourself in allot of these situations.  That is what will freak you out and that is what makes this a decent horror flick.  Its not the greatest, but I think it did its job well.  I hear the making of the second one is coming out. I am sure it will just be another blood bath.  It won't pass the first one because the unknown is no longer unknown.  Only time will tell if it can still bring a creepy quality to the table.  In closing I would recommend seeing this movie at least once.  Get a few friends together on a dark night and pop it in.  I'm sure you will have some scares.  Enjoy.

I read somewhere that Moulin Rouge was the kind of movie which one either loved or hated. I can't agree with this fact, as I would fall in between. It's hard for me to say it was an excellent movie and I certainly can not say it was a terrible one. I guess it usually depends on what you want to see.  An everlasting subject love. Everlasting, but rarely changing any more. Some stereotypes have been set and they are repeated. You can not expect of this movie to stun you with innovative ideas about love, as you can not expect Paul Anderson to do a good movie out of Resident Evil. Sorry there...got carried away.

That's perfectly fine by me, I know there are movies out there that others love that I really disdain as well...but in this case, to call this movie a 'gold polished turd' is really stretching it.  Sure you have your stereotype characters...this IS a Jerry Bruckheimer production afterall...he is by no means a genius director or producer, but he has a formula that works about 2\/3 of the time which is to make loud, fast paced, action packed movies with huge budgets that are thrown at our faces at a million miles an hour.  Movies like The Rock, Gone in 60 Seconds, and Enemy of the State all have this fast-paced, testosterone feel to them...but since most of them succeed in entertaining us, what is the big deal?  My question is this, were the people who truly hated this movie totally bored with it?  If the answer to that question is claimed to be 100% true with said person, I find it incredibly hard to believe.  But anyways, that's enough on that subject.I really like this movie, though by no means is it one of my personal favorites, it is still one of those that I love to watch every now and then.  I saw it with my girlfriend at the time, twice in the theaters and we loved it each time (it was the first movie I had ever seen more than once in the theater).  I swear though, most movies (except maybe Glory, Saving Private Ryan and Shindler's List) can't make me feel the emotional extremes that I love\/hate to feel in a movie, but this one always does.  There are several scenes in particular that get me every time, ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** one of which was when Will Patton's character, 'Chick', is walking off of the shuttle and there is his ex wife and child waiting for him.  The look on his face gets me every time.  Also, the moment of reckoning when Colonel Sharp realizes that Stamper can drill to the maximum depth and decides not to ignite the nuke.  Both scenes always give me a cold shiver, which to me is welcome.  You have a good script, good characters and wonderful special effects in addition to that feeling of humanity that looms around the impending doom that is headed towards Earth.  They truly did an incredible job making space feel almost as claustrophobic as it really is.My major complaints, of course, are with the direction, mostly.  It seems choppy and uneven in places, and a few scenes seem like they were cut too short.  Also, the characters are often given stupid lines and there is a slight air of cheesiness throughout the whole movie...but other than that (which are actually most of the complaints you will hear from those who simply hate this movie) I really like this movie and think honestly that it got a really bad rep by the sanctimonious critics.  I can't believe that 'Deep Impact' another movie with basically the same plot that was out at almost the same time as Armageddon, got better reviews than this one.  Deep Impact was a horribly acted, boring and sophomorish attempt at trying make the audience cry...it was all sappy and not exciting at all.  Armageddon, though sappy at parts, does in fact succeed in many scenes, especially the end which made most people cry in the theater when I saw it.  Also, the movie tries not to take itself too seriously and it, most importantly, is fun!So anyways, if you haven't seen it already, I encourage you to forget the rather harsh negative reviews on this one, check your brain at the door, and enjoy this emotional thrill ride. 8\/10 stars.

It's very entertaining. But as far as it having all these levels of meaning, in being ground-breaking in anything other than the interesting bullet time camera work? It wasn't here.The Wachowski brothers are more or less just very good hacks. They took the main plot directly out of Terminator and gave it a virtual reality twist and a techno sound-track. They even stole the idea of having a blue tinge to everything, then when they realised that was too obvious they changed it to green.The acting is somewhat of a let down, but it can be overlooked considering the nature of the film. It isn't meant to be high drama after all. Generally it is poor, especially from Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss. Their characters don't really require a lot of acting ability, but they still manage to seem wooden and unconvincing for the most part. This isn't helped by the poor dialogue throughout.There are some good performances though, particularly Hugo Weaving and Joe Palantino. Fishbourne was OK, but the rest of the cast don't deserve a mention - except for Marcus Chong, not for his acting, but for his real life career ending stupidity in getting kicked off the sequels by demanding equal billing in them. Considering his character was probably the most expendable that wasn't very smart.Another let down was the tacky love story. If you thought Episode II had a stupid, nonsensical romantic element, it's nothing compared to The Matrix. Trinity more or less falls in love with Neo because a) he's good looking and b) lack of other options.One other thing I didn't really like was the lead in to the story. The first half hour or so is spent trying to convince the audience this is going to be so cool, and meaningful, and deep, we are really on to something special here and when you have time to look back on it, this self hype to the main plot was poorly executed and cheapens the film a lot. A movie shouldn't insult its audience by trying to tell them what to think of it before it gets anywhere.Other than that this is enjoyable movie, which becomes sillier the more seriously you take it.

The movie never dwells on how and why Tom Ripley became the impersonator that he was. But it is unnecessary in this movie. Sadly because he could not share his secrets to anyone, he lived a lonely life. But Tom Ripley was a man with love and insecurities. His insecurities made him utterly selfish to the point of being inhumane, recluse and shy, but he had rather strong feelings. So many times he came close to confessing to Peter and even Marge. He even considered confessing to Inspector Roverini and Meredith. But he couldn't. There were so many times he thought he was totally cornered and that he had no way out. But he was not weak enough to commit suicide. His instincts of self-preservation (however crude they may have been) pushed him into committing murders so that he could move on. He was a doomed character unless he confessed to someone and let them take over his life and restore him. But he never could do it till the time shown in the end of the movie. That is why he had to push away all the people that he loved and that loved him (or hated him). And the only way he knew to push them away was by murdering them. And the only way he survived all this (or a person like him can survive all this) was through his intelligence and his three talents.Now onto the review of the movie. Matt Damon acted his very best. It is not easy for the viewer to understand and appreciate the character that Minghella wanted Damon to portray. I thought Damon did a superb job. Often times, he had to show Ripley's mind simply through his mannerisms. I thought he portrayed the conflict in the character very well. The disarming innocence and simplicity to the point of humility, the unassuming confidence about his talents, the discomfort of not fitting in, the charming or nerdy smile (as appropriate) and a seeming ignorance of his attractive traits were all superbly portrayed by him. I believe he should have definitely garnered much more recognition for the superlative performance. Jude Law and Jack Davenport were amazing in their roles as well. The character of Dickie Greenleaf is as complicated as that of Tom Ripley, except that they have been brought up in the opposite ends of the spectrum and their lifestyles show ample proofs for that. They both seek not too dissimilar ends, though they seek it through totally different means. The difference in their positions in the society is also shown by the denial-mode that Greenleaf is in, as opposed to a certain degree of understanding and acceptance of his personality by Ripley. This does not mean Greenleaf is dumb, as is evidenced in his last scenes before being murdered by Ripley. I definitely think Jude Law gave another superlative performance in the movie. Cate Blanchett was suitably artificial, while Gwyneth Paltrow was brilliant in flashes. My jury is still out on Paltrow's abilities. Philip Seymour Hoffmann was brilliant as well. He and Damon clearly depicted the uncomfortable understanding and anger that was always there between their characters in the undercurrent. Stefania Rocca was good in the very few scenes she was in.Much has been said about the cinematography of the movie and I completely agree with the praise. The script, editing and direction were first rate. That is ultimately why the film succeeded totally in its objectives. Minghella should have garnered a directorial nomination as well.

This does not mean Greenleaf is dumb, as is evidenced in his last scenes before being murdered by Ripley. I definitely think Jude Law gave another superlative performance in the movie. Cate Blanchett was suitably artificial, while Gwyneth Paltrow was brilliant in flashes. My jury is still out on Paltrow's abilities. Philip Seymour Hoffmann was brilliant as well. He and Damon clearly depicted the uncomfortable understanding and anger that was always there between their characters in the undercurrent. Stefania Rocca was good in the very few scenes she was in.Much has been said about the cinematography of the movie and I completely agree with the praise. The script, editing and direction were first rate. That is ultimately why the film succeeded totally in its objectives. Minghella should have garnered a directorial nomination as well.

After reading the comments, I was afraid that I had wasted my money before I had even gotten my DVD in the mail! Fortunately, I don't agree with the negative comments that I read on this web site at all.Not all gay people grow up aware that they are gay from birth! Gay people come from all different backgrounds\/parents\/walks of life. I grew up in Warren, Michigan, which is about a three-hour drive from Sandusky, Ohio where this movie takes place. Michigan is like the Alabama of the North and VERY closeted! There are stereotypes of gay people, because there are gay people like that. Maybe this movie shows all those stereotypes, but I have met all those types of people in my life and this movie made perfect sense to me. Maybe it is sad to say for some people, but this movie was my life! I had to stop watching this movie several times because it was all too real. In 1984, I met my former girlfriend\/wife and my best friend as Eric has in this movie. Annie Lennox and the Eurythmics were my favorite band in1984 and music was a very important part of my life. Annie is still my favorite Diva.Although I never worked at Cedar Point, I wanted to and went there almost every summer. I ended up losing my best friend, as the actor is this movie does and I found out the hard way that there are guys out there who will love you and leave you at the drop of a hat. The music, the actors, the story are great and very realistic. I would have LOVED to have this film in my life back then instead of a film like Last American Virgin or Porky's which made no sense to me at all because I could not relate.The acting during the bedroom scene between Eric and Maggie was perfect and very real\/good. It was difficult for me to watch because it was so good. I don't know how anyone can say the acting was less than perfect\/real for anyone in this film. Rod, Mom, the entire family and cast are very believable.I am not going to say this is the best movie ever made, but this film is NOT a Hollywood production and has a very tender way of showing what some (and I would guess what most people) go through when coming-out. The best example for me was when Eric goes to the record store to buy a Bronski Beat album and acts as though he were buying a porno magazine. Lea DeLaria is so great in this movie and I would have loved to have had someone like her in my life when I was coming out. I have seen a lot of movies gay and otherwise, and this movie while not full of special effects and razzle-dazzle, IT IS full of plenty of emotions and HEART. Very worthwhile to see!!! Very REAL!!!

If you didn't (or don't think you will) like this movie try watching it again (or for the first time) and consider what you are given.  Absorb the entire situation and ask yourself why the situations, dialogue, editing and (for gods sake!!) colors are the way they are.  Why is Amélie's room red?  What does that mean?  How does it reflect the part of her character that isn't plainly given?  If you love art, even if you kind of like art, and can understand that not every thing you see is what it is (symbolism does exist in movies!!) then you should enjoy this film.  Even if you aren't into art, and you just decide that the director and writer just randomly picked colors for scenes, you should still like this movie because it's happy.  There's nothing wrong with an artistic movie that is happy.  Also, if you are fluent in French or can understand even a little bit it helps (everything is subtitled don't worry) the reason being is that you get to hear the inflection, the ferocity, the joy, the sadness --everything!  Anyone can read dialogue, but when you get to hear and watch and just take in what these great actors and actresses are giving us it can really overwhelm you.  That's enough--bottom line WATCH IT, if you don't like it call me an idiot on here later but you'd better be ready to support your argument.

This great film of a unique friendship reminds you what it was like to be a kid hanging out with your friends, going on adventures etc.I have probably watched this film over 20 times, and it is still as good as it was the first time I watched it, the magic is still there.....Great performances, great actors and a great atmosphere (which seem to fill you with some kind of happiness). River Phoenix is terrific. The conversation pieces are brilliant, and several phrases will sit in my head forever.
