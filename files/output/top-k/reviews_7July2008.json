[{"date":"7 July 2008","score":"","review":" Rounders is a star-studded drama that glorifies the game of poker and over-dramatizes the heck out of the gambling lifestyle, all while dishing out poker is life metaphors like $5 dollar chips and providing an overdose of slick and arrogant narrative dialogue by way of the prince of the east coast, Matt Damon himself. Call it an exaggeration, but that's exactly how Rounders creators David Levien and Brian Koppelman up the ante in this film. If you're a poker lover, you'll love this film and if you're not, well you'll still probably enjoy it, but not as much as a real rounder would.Levien and Koppelman, who debuted with Rounders and have since teamed up for a variety of mobster and especially gambling related films (including TV show Tilt), are masters at jazzing things up. While Rounders doesn't exactly delve into the glamorous side of gambling, it acts like it does and it packs some excitement into a film that would otherwise be just another movie about guys with gambling problems trying to repay debt.Matt Damon and Edward Norton star as Mike and Lester aka Worm, two boarding school buddies who bottom line know how to win at poker. Mike, the true protagonist, is the more- level headed one (he's in law school and with a girlfriend (Gretchen Mol)) but he is still an ambitious gambler who finds himself losing everything to a neurotic Oreo-loving Russian mob dude played by the multi-talented John Malkovich. His buddy Worm is fresh out of prison, having done time for credit card fraud, and he has no other goals but to play more poker to make the money he needs to pay off previous gambling debts. Mike has quit poker, but he feels the itch and wants to help his friend.The cast also includes John Turturro, Famke Jenssen and Martin Landau, all actors who could get top billing in a film today. While they're all good, it's Damon and Norton that are able to really work the slick and snappy dialogue and also play it up for drama and not just kicks. These guys create some serious problems for themselves about halfway through the film and keep facing moral dilemmas despite their seemingly unstoppable poker prowess. It actually gives the film a lot of strength despite the pompous air it gives off.By the end, however, Rounders does turn back around and become more about the cool, edgy side of gambling, leaving a lot of the deeper questions out to dry while it hits you with what it thinks is an intense ending that proves to be too long and morally objectionable. Not that anyone is the authority on morals, but the film goes for the tagline mentality of play the hand you're dealt and not hey, you should stop gambling because you're $15,000 in debt. Despite realistic turns throughout and giving off the vibe that it's going to be more down to earth, the film goes for the super-smooth finish and it just feels like a waste. Other than getting long toward the end, though, it's certainly entertaining as slick usually is and the two star vehicles really help the film stand out.
