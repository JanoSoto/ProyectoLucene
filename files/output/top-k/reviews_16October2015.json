E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial right? Yes, and no. Though very similar and a lot less content worries, The Iron Giant, set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space, distinguishes itself from E.T. by one, 100 ft. metal man. Sent from outer space to be a weapon to destroy humans, the Iron Giant is remarkably friendly to humans. He soon befriends an 11 year-old pet- addicted boy, Hogarth,who had saved him from a close-to-death electrocution during the Giants feast on the metal of an electric station. Lonely for a companion, Hogarth visits the Giant and teaches him about the world. Thus begins the mental journey of the Iron Giant into the world of humans. Meanwhile, the government is called up about some weird discoveries. They send an agent by the name of Kent Mansley to investigate. He first dismisses the idea of a metal-eating Giant as too eccentric, but then after finding his car with a huge bite and a second later vanished completely, he calls the government which instructs him to find more evidence. Immediately, Kent suspects Hogarth and after many annoying and desperate inquiries he discovers a picture of Hogarth and the Giant. The next day, the army is in their backyard. The Iron Giant, rated PG for some violence, some bathroom humor and a bunch too many swears and misuses of God's name, is both hilarious but also heartbreaking, yet unlike many animation films, viewers will find its message comparably heavy and touching deeply on the truth of death and souls. There is one thing I disliked though. Every scene all are straight to the point and are never out of place. It would could have been extended by 15 more minutes and still prove the important points. Frankly, although the story is not new to most of us, The Iron Giant easily bests the others in creativity and spiritual truth (but not all on family-friendly content). Just as Hogarth says to the Giant, You don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be, we should not base ourselves on what others believe and want us to be.

I can not believe it! It was my first film since I watched as a child and I con not believe that those people are bashing this film and saying The Last Crusade is superior film to this one?! If you think that, than don't watch Indiana Jones films at all!!!!!! I think Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very decent action, classic adventure flick. It is a decent and a worthy sequel to superior film Raiders of The Lost Ark (1984) from beginning till end. It is my second favorite film alongside with Raiders of the Lost Ark. The first film will always be the best one in the series, but this film isn't bad either!! Raiders of the Lost Ark is ratedPG and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is also rated PG and I think it is a great, Entertain not boring f, but fast paced Action Adventure flick. By the MPAA Ratingis PG-13 nut in USA and other country's is Rated PG! So is PG!!! Yes the film has a flaws and mistakes, so what? Tell me any film that doesn't have a mistakes and errors in it? This film along side with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) that are very underrated and bashed for their credits for it! If you don't like this film, than you don't like Indiana Jones or any other film? What is your problem with this film? Seriously! Though not as spectacular as Raiders but boy is it entertaining I love Indy in this movie I love short round and I love the darker tone. It has a lot of Action in this film, yes a lot! It is a prequel that starts one year earlier before Raiders started. I love Raiders a lot, but for Me it'll always be Temple of Doom, that was the first Indy film I ever saw as a kid, and I liked how different it was from all the others, it was kind of like a horror film and it also had the best action out of all of them, Last crusade was good primarily because of Sean Connery, but it was too similar to Raiders for my taste. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark A Classic a very Underrated sequel in the series. I know I should choose The Last Crusade but The Temple of Doom was the first movie I ever saw in the Indiana Jones series. It Is a prequel movie to Raiders of Lost Ark (1981) but still a classic sequel. Very hated and poorly ranted from their fans, Everyone choose The Last Crusade but no one choose this movie. So I choose Raiders of the lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom over Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Hate me all you want, the fact is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very Underrated classic sequel from the 80's after a highly success of the first film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Both of the movies are rated PG while the Last Crusade and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull both of the films are rated PG-13 so thanks a lot. This film also won 1 Academy Awards including for best visual effects and Best Music, Original Score John Williams.When Raiders became a box office smash, no doubt Indy would be back. Bur how do George Lucas and Steven Spielberg top themselves with a worthy follow-up? They don't. They go the unheard-of prequel route. Yep Temple of Doom takes place a few years before Raiders as we learn a little about Indy's fear of snakes and his quest to save the Ankara stones from (yep I'll say it) Doom! Inserting Kate Capshaw and a Goonie (Short Round) into the mix was bizarre all on its own as Temple of Doom brought a dark side of Indy that left many fans annoyed but nonetheless entertained. Set in 1935, a professor, archaeologist, and legendary hero by the name of Indiana Jones is back in action in his newest adventure. After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, and stumbles upon a secret cult plotting a terrible plan in the catacombs of an ancient palace.Temple of Doom feels the most like a complete movie, flowing from start to finish, chock full of genuine humor, great action, and has a horror\/supernatural vibe that feels more authentic than the spiritual elements of both Raiders and Crusade.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a 1984 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.

I know those sound like the exact same thing, so I'll explain myself. The overall quality of the movie was about what I'd been led to believe it would be, but it didn't come in the way I had expected. Pretty much everything I'd heard about this movie before seeing it had something to do with Hannibal Lecter. Now, he's definitely a noteworthy and intriguing character, but not as much as his reputation seems to give him credit for. On the other hand, the serial killer plot with Buffalo Bill was more interesting than I thought it would be. Fortunately, this combination made it so that I wasn't disappointed by the hype, but that is something to be conscious of if you have high expectations for this movie, or any for that matter.I won't go into too much detail with the plot to reduce spoilers. The external plot with Buffalo Bill is the most prominent, and has a good progression that will surprise the audience at times and likely won't confuse them so long as they pay attention. Hannibal Lecter is important to this plot since he gives Clarice information about Buffalo Bill, but his pathological nature takes prevalence whenever he is on screen. If you're somebody who has a hard time following complex plots, I would recommend doing a little preliminary research on the plot beyond watching the trailer. And if you are one of those people but think this will be the movie where you are really going to latch on to every detail, keep working at it, but be honest with yourself and don't be afraid to ask a friend or blogger or FAQ page. It's not necessary to do that, but I think it will improve your experience and it's something I wish I had done.Our protagonist is an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling. She's confident in her abilities, but also aware of her youth and inexperience in the field. Both of these qualities are brought forward by the probing, vampiric, and insidious Hannibal Lecter, who seems to feed on people's souls as much as he does their bodies. He's got a lot of the qualities we love in our psychological villains in his ability to overcome the authority controlling him and the way he makes people like they are more prisoner than he is. I rather wish we got a closer look at how he deals with people he doesn't respect since Clarice seems to be one of the rare people that interest him. We see Buffalo Bill from a bird's-eye view, much as Clarice does. Most of what we\/she know about him are based on second-hand accounts or evidence. Fortunately, the buildup of his off-screen reputation proves not to be disappointing in the few scenes where we see him at work. He seems to be quite as interesting a character as Lecter, though in a less psychological way. The second-tier characters consist of Dr. Chilton and Clarice's superior Jack Crawford. They're developed somewhat impressively for minor characters and have a decent amount of screen time and plot relevance.I didn't find the acting hugely impressive, though the dialogue ranks among some of the better material I've come across. The directing is pretty good, creating suspense effectively throughout. The couple of action sequences might not have come off well in a strictly action movie, but since this is a thriller it worked just fine.Regardless of your genre preference, I would recommend that pretty much everyone give this a try, unless you're an extremely casual movie fan that likes to watch movies passively. Otherwise, there aren't many reasons not to watch it. There aren't really any disgustingly disturbing images like you might expect, though it is certainly an intense film. It won't be as appealing to modern audiences, but don't let it's age turn you away. Just be willing to pay attention and you should be able to enjoy it. Overall Rating 8.5\/10.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"16 October 2015","score":"","review":" I'm usually a fan of dated, camp science fiction movies but only when the camp is unintentional and not put on. Unfortunately with BARBARELLA, loads of effort has gone into making the film a camp comedy, one of those films you just know that the producers hope will be termed a cult classic, and there's nothing I hate worse than a film which tries to be funny like that.

Mankind has been eradicated by the Psychlos, an alien race who move from planet to planet, taking over one at a time. The remaining free humans have been driven from the cities into the mountains where they have reverted into primitive creatures. One of these men - Tyler - decides to attempt to do something with his life and ends up being captured and enslaved by the Psychlos. When they begin teaching him their language to work as a slave, Tyler realises that he has the knowledge to plan a revolt.It's not as bad as you might think it is. That's my verdict. I think the reason that this movie got so much negative press was that people were jumping on the bandwagon to proclaim it the worst movie ever made. Kind of like what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, only in reverse. Sure, BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bloated CGI-infested blockbuster, but it's no different to a dozen others currently doing the rounds at the multiplexes. Yes, it is a poor film, but it STILL manages to be better than GODZILLA was.I like a good old-fashioned science fiction tale as much as the next guy and this is what BATTLEFIELD EARTH is, when it comes down to it. It's a fairly simplistic yet far-reaching story of aliens taking over earth and one man fighting back to reclaim his planet. As with a number of science fiction films made in the last two decades, the film owes STAR WARS something for the impressive visuals of dogfights and planets exploding. The plot is fairly predictable, and the script unfortunately dumb and aiming for the lowest intellect, although there is the occasional flash of cleverness before the film slips into being too simplistic again.The acting is pretty bad too. John Travolta goes over the top AGAIN as the whiny villain, and this time he is most definitely annoying (I was kind of unsure in BROKEN ARROW as to whether he was cool or annoying, but here I'm 100% certain). Forest Whitaker stars as Travolta's assistant, and is all but unrecognisable under mounds of latex (and all the better for him I imagine). One performance I did like was Kim Coates', playing Barry Pepper's friend and ally. Unsurprisingly Coates ends up - spoiler alert - dying again, just like he does in every single film I've seen him in. What is it with this guy? The film was hugely expensive and all of the money is up on screen, with loads of CGI effects which aren't all that convincing but will suffice for a fantasy epic. With all of these negative comments you may wonder why I don't rate this movie lower. Well, the answer is that I did somewhat enjoy watching parts of it. The film has a sufficiently epic feel with lots of locations and characters. The aliens have their own personalities and characters for once instead of being bland menacing villains. Some of the action is quite well done and occasionally violent, with limbs flying off. You can't help but get the feel that everybody was TRYING really hard to make this film work, yet that they all failed in the end. I would recommend curious science fiction fans to at least give it a try to see what all the fuss is about. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is neither bad enough to be unwatchable or bad enough to laugh at.

I don't get why It did got 6.2 on IMDb I give it 10 out of 10. I love the action I love Danny Glover he is my favorite action star! From Lethal Weapon 1 & 2 he is terrific he is the action hero I wanted. Gary Busey and Danny Glover they both started in Lethal Weapon. In this movie they were great. I am a big fan of action flick Predator 2 and is not a stupid movie! I am comparing with Lethal Weapon 1. Because Danny Glover star of Lethal Weapon was the main cast and hero. Gary Busey from Lethal weapon was FBI agent and Glover's nemesis like was Gibson's nemesis in Lethal Weapon. The movie has great action tough the plot wasn't great but was 90's action and I love it. It is my childhood movie and the last good Predator film and worthy sequel of all time. I don't like Predators (2010) and I think Predators it is a rip off the first film. When people criticizing movies I love them because I am a big fan of Predator 1 & 2 so I really don't care. Arnold Schwarzenegger turn down the offer to reprise his role from the first movie he said the story set in the city would be bad idea and maybe it was. The new Predator the actor form the first movie had new technological weapons than in the first one. I love Predator 2 no matter what everyone say's I love my childhood movies and I enjoyed the score too and the movie it is not bad as people are saying, it is underrated I love it.There are many elements that I enjoyed in the film. The score, the action scenes and Danny Glover. The predator was there as a test of rites or passage which is pretty clear by the end with the elders showing up to collect his body. I think this film is highly underrated and no where near as bad as some say about it.Why I love this film as much, that I love the original film? because of action, it is sequel to the first movie, Kevin Peter Hall stars in this movie actor from the first movie , it has Predator movie theme score, more Predators showed up at the end. Glover gets a gun from 1717 sorry if I did not wrote correctly. I always love Predator 1 & 2 movies no matter what, if it was terrible or not.Some people are saying similar things about Predators but I am not listening them, I love them and I am listening to my self. Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990 so it should be set in that year. Kevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. Predator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever. More sci-fi and action more facts about Predator, they are more Predators.They are cops and FBI agents best action movie in 90s i love you Danny Glover killed him at the end of the movie Arnold did not killed him he only wounded him, Predator activated self distraction advise and he blows him self up,so Arnold did not killed him. A lot of people does not get this movie. So if you hate this movie than don't watch Predator 2,go and watch Smurfs instead stupid morons!Predator I and II are excellent films. Part III was outrageous and out of question. It has since become a cult film among fans.Amidst a territorial gang war, a sophisticated alien hunter stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran L.A.P.D. officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.This electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs.

I don't get why It did got 6.2 on IMDb I give it 10 out of 10. I love the action I love Danny Glover he is my favorite action star! From Lethal Weapon 1 & 2 he is terrific he is the action hero I wanted. Gary Busey and Danny Glover they both started in Lethal Weapon. In this movie they were great. I am a big fan of action flick Predator 2 and is not a stupid movie! I am comparing with Lethal Weapon 1. Because Danny Glover star of Lethal Weapon was the main cast and hero. Gary Busey from Lethal weapon was FBI agent and Glover's nemesis like was Gibson's nemesis in Lethal Weapon. The movie has great action tough the plot wasn't great but was 90's action and I love it. It is my childhood movie and the last good Predator film and worthy sequel of all time. I don't like Predators (2010) and I think Predators it is a rip off the first film. When people criticizing movies I love them because I am a big fan of Predator 1 & 2 so I really don't care. Arnold Schwarzenegger turn down the offer to reprise his role from the first movie he said the story set in the city would be bad idea and maybe it was. The new Predator the actor form the first movie had new technological weapons than in the first one. I love Predator 2 no matter what everyone say's I love my childhood movies and I enjoyed the score too and the movie it is not bad as people are saying, it is underrated I love it.There are many elements that I enjoyed in the film. The score, the action scenes and Danny Glover. The predator was there as a test of rites or passage which is pretty clear by the end with the elders showing up to collect his body. I think this film is highly underrated and no where near as bad as some say about it.Why I love this film as much, that I love the original film? because of action, it is sequel to the first movie, Kevin Peter Hall stars in this movie actor from the first movie , it has Predator movie theme score, more Predators showed up at the end. Glover gets a gun from 1717 sorry if I did not wrote correctly. I always love Predator 1 & 2 movies no matter what, if it was terrible or not.Some people are saying similar things about Predators but I am not listening them, I love them and I am listening to my self. Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990 so it should be set in that year. Kevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. Predator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever. More sci-fi and action more facts about Predator, they are more Predators.They are cops and FBI agents best action movie in 90s i love you Danny Glover killed him at the end of the movie Arnold did not killed him he only wounded him, Predator activated self distraction advise and he blows him self up,so Arnold did not killed him. A lot of people does not get this movie. So if you hate this movie than don't watch Predator 2,go and watch Smurfs instead stupid morons!Predator I and II are excellent films. Part III was outrageous and out of question. It has since become a cult film among fans.Amidst a territorial gang war, a sophisticated alien hunter stalks the citizens of Los Angeles and the only man between him and his prey is veteran L.A.P.D. officer, Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.This electrifying action sequel unleashes the deadly invisible Predator in another jungle -- the urban jungle of Los Angeles. Danny Glover stars as a lieutenant who mistakenly concludes that mangled bodies found by the police are the work of feuding gangs. Instead, he finds himself confronting a savage alien who has come from a distant world to hunt humans for sport. Gary Busey and Ruben Blades co-star in this action-packed, high-tech thriller.Predator 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film written by Jim and John Thomas, directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring Danny Glover and Kevin Peter Hall. The film is a sequel to 1987's Predator, and Kevin Peter Hall again plays the role of the Predator.10\/10 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio 20TH Century Fox, Silver Pictures Starring Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Ruben Blades María Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, Robert Davi Director Stephen Hopkins Producer Joel Silver, Lawrence Gordon, John Davis Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 48 Mins.

He is somewhat of a washed-up drunk and you really can't feel sorry for him and no wonder his wife (a deleted Lorraine Bracco) left him for a more stable man(Richard Jenkins) a fellow cop that works at the same station Pacino does.

He makes you despise the guy but at the same time root for him to catch the killer.Ellen Barkin just oozes sexiness like never before seen in her performances. She stole the movie for me. She was just that great and real. She and Pacino had great chemistry. To bad they didn't work together more. It would be close to 20 years when they would work together again in the same film.John Goodman as a fellow cop and sidekick of Pacino was just excellent. They both had a real chemistry.

Leake was spared because Pacino let him go when Leake brought his little son and Pacino didn't have in his heart to bust him at the moment but will later.

Best Indiana Jones and Steven Spielberg film ever.Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is.Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck). Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) also won 4 Academy Awards including for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration,Best Sound,Best Film Editing and Best Effects, Visual Effects.The Effects were awesome and amazing in this film, their wasn't any CGI in it but there were the special effects editing and visual effects were great! That made this film so great and it worked so well. The story and the plot were brilliant and intense. For me Harrison Ford is the only Indiana Jones that it is , an archeology professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. He acted the character believable like he was Indiana Jones a real adventurer. Paul Freeman as Dr. René Belloq, Jones' nemesis was one of the best villains out there, he acted his character terrific and convincing. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, a spirited, tough former lover of Indiana's was one of the most amazing female characters, she was really believable. John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, the best digger in Cairo and Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody did terrific as the support cast, they didn't had so many scenes in the film, but in the third entry they were both trough whole film. Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich did wonderful performance as the ruthless Nazi villains in the film. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) stays one of the best films in the series franchise and my favorite best Indiana Jones film ever. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job on this film. The year is 1936. Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. There you have the plot. The film that redefined adventure cinema, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark blends action serial thrills with old-fashioned Hollywood wit, and remains a beloved classic. Steven Spielberg had hoped to direct a James Bond film, when George Lucas told him he had something better for him. Spielberg and Lucas looked for a leading man for over six months. Then I saw The Empire Strikes Back, Spielberg said, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones To create the illusion of Nazis being zapped with the energy of the Ark, actors wore what were essentially light bulb squibs, timed to go off at one-second intervals. The film is bursting with great set-pieces (such as Ford being chased by a giant boulder) and has some memorable images, such as the rays of sunlight that open granite doors, the work of the great cinematographer Douglas Slocambe. John Williams composed the Oscar-nominated score for Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The support cast around Ford is good, too, with Paul Freeman playing a rival French archaeologist (René Belloq), Denholm Elliott playing Indy's college colleague Marcus Brody; Ronald Lacey as Gestapo agent Arnold Toht; and Karen Allen as the feisty love interest Marion Ravenwood. The film also crackles with humour. In one memorable scene, Indy is challenged to fight by a Cairo swordsman (played by Terry Richards). The actor had spent months in training for what was due to be a lengthy sword-versus-bull choreographed fight. But Ford, along with many of the crew, was suffering from stomach illness. He suggested to Spielberg that they cut the scene short. Spielberg agreed, resulting in the biggest laugh of the film. The Action scenes are terrific and stunning as the airplane scene was outstanding and I love it. Indy is challenged in to a fight ensues that is joined by a burly Nazi who pummels Indy before being punched backward and shredded to bits by the plane's propellers. Marion seizes one of the plane's machine guns and opens fire on Nazi soldiers, in the process setting a fuel dump aflame. The fire destroys the area and the plane explodes, but Indy and Marion escape. This is the best action scene ever! Indiana seize the truck containing the Ark. He survives a brutal chase and fight with Nazi soldiers, while he is driving the Ark to safety. The scene on the submarine is awesome, the illusion, spirits attacking the now-terrified Nazis, killing the entire contingent and destroying Belloq is awesome. can do.

For instead of having explicit violence to carry things along, Verhoeven goes along with explicit sex for the thrills here (a formula he repeated later in his flop SHOWGIRLS before going back to the violence with STARSHIP TROOPERS). Of course with a film like this there was a big fuss when it was first released and it achieved a certain notoriety for the infamous leg-crossing scene. Sadly when most people mention this they tend to forget that aside from the sex there is also a pretty good thriller plot to enjoy.The makers of this film tried to give it a film-noir style, perhaps even going for a Hitchcockian influence. What they did do is succeed in making a powerful, intense whodunit which keeps you guessing as to the identity of the murderess right up until the end - and even then, a final twists means that it's all still ambiguous. As well as all the sex that's going on, Verhoeven still finds the opportunity to put in some of his trademark graphic violence in the shape of a pair of icepick murders which see blood flying everywhere in an extremely grisly fashion.Michael Douglas is well-suited for the role of the cop on the edge, with slicked-back hair to make him look younger. I know that his nudity in this film is a basis for a lot of people to make fun of him, but when I think of other male actors around at the time I can't really imagine anybody else in the role. While Douglas has the fairly straight and unexciting role, Sharon Stone on the other hand is a revelation extruding an icy cold air and totally in control of herself and just about everybody else, her seductive siren instantly made Stone a star - and put her into the mainstream eye, away from the bit parts she had previously had in the likes of NICO ABOVE THE LAW. It's safe to say that this film contains Stone's best performance and that she's never lived up to it since, except maybe in her believable portrayal of a drug addicted wife in Scorcese's CASINO.In support, George Dzundza is good as a comic relief cop while Jeanne Tripplehorn also gives an excellent performance as Douglas' psychiatrist. BASIC INSTINCT is well worth a watch, and not just because of the obvious reasons. Fans of thrillers should check it out.

I mean, everywhere I look I see undeniably positive reviews of this film. That not to say I didn't like it at all, as Tim Burton is a skilled director who always puts a lot of style into his movies which makes them watchable. But I'd much rather sit through X-MEN again than watch this over-the-top, overlong supposedly epic movie which is ruined by the dreadful spectacle of Jack Nicholson going way over the top, so far so that he actually ends up completely embarrassing as the Joker. I mean, sure he looks the part but damn, he doesn't know when to call it a day. Any scene with him in ends up being silly or cheesy in a bad way, and only Burton's pleasantly dark set design and concentration on the gloomier, more disturbing parts of the mythos make it possible to sit through this movie.Sure, there are good points. The big budget for one. This means that many of the special effects are impressive, there are lots of cool stunts and action. Burton has also assembled a large cast for his first major movie. Michael Keaton essays the role of Batman and is good as the eccentric hero. Kim Basinger is the love interest who fails to make much of an impact and just ends up being another female-in-peril. Also appearing in minor roles are Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, Jerry Hall and, of course, Michael Gough as the butler, Alfred. Genre fans of course will know Gough from his starring roles as usually a mad scientist in many low budget '60s\/'70s British shockers, and again his character is a great one (shame he's underused like most of the cast).Another thing I don't care for about this movie is the running time - it seems to go on forever, with a number of drawn-out climaxes at the end so you think it's never going to be over. I don't know... maybe the sight of a man in a bat costume just doesn't do it for me. I've never been a fan of comic books either. I much prefer the camp delights of the original Batman movie over this one, no matter how cheesy it may be (and at least Cesar Romero was actually FUNNY as the Joker). I guess I'll just have to admit that this film is one of my blind spots. ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2015","score":"","review":" Am I the only person who doesn't like this movie?

While Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie.

The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins, an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask, it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned, now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters, one is the more-than- regular Stanley Ipkins, who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank, he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs, luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a green-masked party-boy maniac, ready to joke all around town, all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask, including dance scenes; one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself, seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a super-sized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled.

It's a small film, but it's one that opened the eyes of everyone to the comedic talents of Woody Allen. His flair for dialogue and comedic timing, both as a director and an actor, is prevalent. He also exercises his skill for dialogue, and this film is full of fresh, wonderful dialogue. Coming off the Vietnam War and world-known trouble in Latin America, this film was ripe for opportunity and Allen seized his chance. I love the satirical tone of the film, as it lambasts everything from politics to relationships. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and that is evident from such scenes as commentating on a sexual encounter as if it's a boxing match and the main protagonist becoming a dictator of a country. It's all quite funny, if you are willing to suspend your belief.Woody Allen's film is about a man named Fielding Mellish who is a consumer products tester. When his girlfriend dumps him, he decides to go to the fictional South American country of San Marcos for a vacation. But he gets caught in the political turmoil of that country, which is led for him to being nabbed by the FBI.The film doesn't have any stars to speak of, maybe other than Allen himself. He's quite funny and he delivers his own dialogue with expertise. If you don't believe, look no further than the courtroom scene, where he cross-examines himself. His girlfriend was played by newcomer Louise Lasser, and she does a really good job of coming across as the bored girl of the relationship. If you look closely, you may spot a cameo of Sylvester Stallone, before his Rocky days. I also loved the commentary delivered none other than Howard Coswell, one of the commentators on ABC's Wide World of Sports.Overall, Bananas is a sharp, witty motion picture that has the customary humor we expect from Woody Allen.

It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an inner-city school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films, like were Major League (1989) and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true, the best, cheerleading comedy in the film series. I love this film and I always will, it is my favorite film of all time. At least it is much better than they are teen comedy this days. Jessica Bendinger wanted to mix cheerleading and hip-hop, the two tastes that taste great together, it's like peanut butter and chocolate, which she did. The choreography very beautiful, the dance moves were pretty good and amazing. Long before Pitch Perfect became a hit franchise and every group of women became our #squadgoals, there were the Toros and the Clovers. Fifteen years ago this month, Universal released Bring It On into theaters, a low budget, high-school comedy about rival cheerleading teams that spawned four spin off films, a stage musical, and helped pave the way for the Barden Bellas, the McKinley glee club and many more The plot of the film centers on Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), who inherits the position of captain on her high school's cheerleading squad and attempts to lead her team to a sixth national title. However, Torrance is informed by the newest team member, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), that she is in possession of a stolen routine. When the originators of the work vow to win, Torrance and her squad must go to different lengths in order to create an original performance.The Toro cheerleading squad has spirit, spunk, sass and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship trophy for the sixth year in a row. But for newly-elected team captain, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hip-hop squad across town. Now the squad must scramble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.I love this movie and I am not saying that as a blonde or a cheerleader! No offense  \/ This is the best Bring It On movie out of all of them. Kirsten Dunst in an amazing actress. This movie is funny, very cute, and the original Bring It On! At Rancho Carne High School, cheerleading is everything to student Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), who aching to be named head cheerleader of school squad the Toros, continuing the aggressive pursuit of dominance started by graduating member, Big Red (Lindsay Slone). Requiring a new cheerleader to help fill a gap caused by an accident, the squad welcomes Missy (Eliza Dushku) to the team, though the new student isn't sure her cynical ways are a good fit, while her brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), welcomes the assimilation, attracted to Torrance and her indefatigable spirit. When she realizes routines established by Big Red are actually stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by icy Isis (Gabrielle Union), Torrance loses confidence, requiring support from the splintered Toros and outside influences as she attempts to rebuild what was lost. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger (who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's Stick It) favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in Bring It On. Summoning blinding cheerleading spirit, the production turns the quest for trophies into a cartoon, complete with aggressive close-ups and screamed line readings, while the writing retains finger-snap timing and an interest in developing its own vocabulary (e.g. Torrance demanding that the Toros are not a cheerocracy), always on the go in terms of characterization and plotting (a mid-movie detour with the Toros and a professional choreographer harboring an obsession with spirit fingers is amusing). The rating I am giving is 10\/10 for been Entertained sport film. The film isn't perfect, it has flaws. The Toros cheerleading squad should have win on the end of the film and they didn't. That move hurt the film. In all the sequels all cheerleading squad team won in this film they didn't. The film is good because of Kirsten Dunst. Believe it or not, it's been 15 years since everyone's favorite campy cheerleader movie, \u200BBring It On\u200B, debuted. Kirsten Dunst, aka captain Torrance Shipman, appeared on \u200BThe Late Late Show With James Corden \u200Blast night and talked about her first major lead role. None of us knew it would become a hit, she says.

But for newly-elected team captain, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hip-hop squad across town. Now the squad must scramble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.I love this movie and I am not saying that as a blonde or a cheerleader! No offense  \/ This is the best Bring It On movie out of all of them. Kirsten Dunst in an amazing actress. This movie is funny, very cute, and the original Bring It On! At Rancho Carne High School, cheerleading is everything to student Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), who aching to be named head cheerleader of school squad the Toros, continuing the aggressive pursuit of dominance started by graduating member, Big Red (Lindsay Slone). Requiring a new cheerleader to help fill a gap caused by an accident, the squad welcomes Missy (Eliza Dushku) to the team, though the new student isn't sure her cynical ways are a good fit, while her brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), welcomes the assimilation, attracted to Torrance and her indefatigable spirit. When she realizes routines established by Big Red are actually stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by icy Isis (Gabrielle Union), Torrance loses confidence, requiring support from the splintered Toros and outside influences as she attempts to rebuild what was lost. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger (who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's Stick It) favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in Bring It On. Summoning blinding cheerleading spirit, the production turns the quest for trophies into a cartoon, complete with aggressive close-ups and screamed line readings, while the writing retains finger-snap timing and an interest in developing its own vocabulary (e.g. Torrance demanding that the Toros are not a cheerocracy), always on the go in terms of characterization and plotting (a mid-movie detour with the Toros and a professional choreographer harboring an obsession with spirit fingers is amusing). The rating I am giving is 10\/10 for been Entertained sport film. The film isn't perfect, it has flaws. The Toros cheerleading squad should have win on the end of the film and they didn't. That move hurt the film. In all the sequels all cheerleading squad team won in this film they didn't. The film is good because of Kirsten Dunst. Believe it or not, it's been 15 years since everyone's favorite campy cheerleader movie, \u200BBring It On\u200B, debuted. Kirsten Dunst, aka captain Torrance Shipman, appeared on \u200BThe Late Late Show With James Corden \u200Blast night and talked about her first major lead role.

It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an inner-city school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films, like were Major League (1989) and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true, the best, cheerleading comedy in the film series. I love this film and I always will, it is my favorite film of all time. At least it is much better than they are teen comedy this days. Jessica Bendinger wanted to mix cheerleading and hip-hop, the two tastes that taste great together, it's like peanut butter and chocolate, which she did. The choreography very beautiful, the dance moves were pretty good and amazing. Long before Pitch Perfect became a hit franchise and every group of women became our #squadgoals, there were the Toros and the Clovers. Fifteen years ago this month, Universal released Bring It On into theaters, a low budget, high-school comedy about rival cheerleading teams that spawned four spin off films, a stage musical, and helped pave the way for the Barden Bellas, the McKinley glee club and many more The plot of the film centers on Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), who inherits the position of captain on her high school's cheerleading squad and attempts to lead her team to a sixth national title.
