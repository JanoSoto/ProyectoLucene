Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it's just not worth going, know what I mean? And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.It's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary, on both counts. And, it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since I first saw her in TV's Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s.The problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all it's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss &#150; sort of &#150; in the greatest city in the world. That's if you're a New Yorker...Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What &#150; Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse &#150; a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty &#150; but this time, as a prancing cross-dresser also &#150; once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role. And, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, bar none...Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all). By 1999, things had gotten better glitz was back, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready for you to bite into, if you had the moxie...So, naturally, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence, this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter, then definitely don't bother with this one.

Sinise's respect for the work is clearly evident throughout the film, and screenwriter Horton Foote doesn't stray too far from the original story, nor does he overlook many vital plot points.George Milton (Gary Sinise) is a small but quick-witted farm labourer. He'd be doing considerably well for himself, but for his self-appointed obligation to look after Lennie Small (John Malkovich), a slow-minded giant. Lennie is a fine worker, but his insatiable, child-like curiosity often gets him into trouble, especially when he underestimates him own strength. After Lennie unintentionally harasses a women (because he was compelled to feel her beautiful red dress), he and George escape persecution and strike out &#150; yet again &#150; for new employment.Their search leads them to the Tyler Ranch, where they meet up with a whole new range of diverse characters, including the withered, one-handed old swamper named Candy (Ray Walston) and his equally withered dog, the kind-hearted Slim (John Terry), the crooked-backed African American stable boy, Crooks (Joe Morton), the easily-aggravated boss' son, Curley (Casey Siemaszko) and Curley's lonely and largely-ignored wife, who symbolically remains unnamed (Sherilyn Fenn). Each of these characters is well-acted by a strong supporting cast, and each of their qualities contribute significantly to the richness of the story.George often speaks about how Lennie is holding him back, but we can see that he generally enjoys his company. On most nights, Lennie insists that George recite a well-rehearsed speech about how lucky they are to have each other, culminating in a brilliantly evocative description of the little house and a couple of acres they are to purchase, in which they live off the fatta the land and Lennie will tend to the rabbits by feeding them freshly-grown alfalfa.Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world...

I told my mother about it and she saw to it that I got it on video. It came from America and the actual video was amazingly old but still going strong after at least twenty years of being used. I secretly hoped I wasn't going to be disappointed because, according to the Halliwell's guide, The Happiest Millionaire was drearily inept (I don't know what it means but it certainly sound pretty bad) and was full of boredom but OH how they were wrong! In my mind, it most certainly was NOT drearily inept - bloody hell! What do they want?! They're only films not life-changing events! It was such a happy movie and I was so pleased and frankly relieved that I wasn't going to be let down. So many people are happy in this 145-minute film; vivacious, strong-minded Cordelia is happy (who also loud and excitable), the timid but determined Angie is happy (because of his dreams in Detroit), the gentle, kind-hearted John Lawless is happy (happy to be Irish and being the new butler of a wealthy family), Mrs Worth is happy who is also very kind to Mr Lawless at the opening when he arrives at the home of Anthony Drexel Biddle, who is the star. Ironically, Mr Drexel Biddle is not such a happy person but more like a middle-aged man who pursues sympathy and fears for her daughter and is emotionally drawn to her - although, he does have a good sense of humour and excellent one! When he keeps saying What's Wrong With THAT??!! all the time, treating his alligators like pet dogs and grumbling at the no-nonsense Englishwoman Mrs Mary Drexel (Gladys Cooper) and she, too, is funny. In the Uncut Roadshow Edition of The Happiest Millionaire, which runs for nearly THREE HOURS, there is an Intermission\/Entr'acte included and the ending is a lot more extended than what I saw in the cut, 1980s video. As we know, Cordelia separates with Angie when she learns that they were to live near his stuck-up, insensitive mother after their honeymoon but reunites with him at the prison and they go off to Detroit after all. After they leave, we see Anthony and his wife back at the mansion where it's quiet and there's no more liveliness now that Cordelia has left with her man, his wife sings Let Them Go to help him realize that his daughter is not a little girl anymore but a young lady and is now old enough to live her OWN life and I think it ends there (I'm not fully sure as I've only seen that version once).This is more-or-less like a version of Father of the Bride because in that the father can't let go of his daughter who is no longer a little girl only this is much more charming, much happier and has more story lines than just that one. Sadly, The Happiest Millionaire is horribly underrated from what I've heard from other critics across the world.

We all start this sixth stage in our trip in a plane and then the nightmare comes. The boy finds himself in a teenage shelter, in other words a prison for teenagers because Freddy's target is the female psychiatrist. They all believe the boy is Freddy's son. Wrong again. The boy is only the caretaker of one mission  bring the female psychiatrist to Springwood which is only two miles away. There Freddy will get three more victims, all boys. He definitely is a male-child molester more than a female-child abuser. But this time, with the help of another psychiatrist, male and black, the woman is going to get into Freddy's head, which is possible because she is his daughter and she has plenty of common recollections with him. She gets him out of the dreamscape in which he is protected and overpowerful and gets him into the real world where he is mortal. The final fight will lead to his absolute annihilation with his own claws and a good old stick of dynamite, his own penetrating and raping tools turned back onto him with the penis-like dynamite stick as a cherry to top it of, and he finally loses his cherry. The film though is more interesting than just that. First it is modern, it has grown up along with the world and we have electronic games, colour TV, consoles of all types, hearing aids and many other modern gadgets. Second it has also followed the growth of teenagers as an age group and the teenagers in the film are from our modern time  they are definitely rebellious, have been marginalized by drugs and many other things, including the abuse from their parents, and are now controlled by the police and other judicial institutions for delinquent teenagers. They are at least neurotic and can become psychotic in a minute, in the wink of a dream, when the real world becomes virtual, dreamlike, or even inexistent. But the film enables us to discover Freddy in his real life. He was married and had a daughter and yet at the same time had been the victim of adults and had developed a complete tolerance to any suffering. And here Rachel Talalay plays with us and introduces a blue-beard recollection in Freddy's daughter's discovering her father's torture chamber. Finally the technique used in the film has been updated to all kinds of modern special effects. This sixth episode though wants to be the end of the saga in its title and in its closing scene and song, though the last picture is still one of Freddy himself standing upright on his feet. It is well known that the strongest nightmares are forever and ever and ever again.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It takes a woman to bring about this sixth episode.

Rachel Talalay revives Freddy and gives him a new dimension. First he is revived through a boy and we may think we are back to the second episode. Wrong. We all start this sixth stage in our trip in a plane and then the nightmare comes. The boy finds himself in a teenage shelter, in other words a prison for teenagers because Freddy's target is the female psychiatrist. They all believe the boy is Freddy's son. Wrong again. The boy is only the caretaker of one mission  bring the female psychiatrist to Springwood which is only two miles away. There Freddy will get three more victims, all boys. He definitely is a male-child molester more than a female-child abuser. But this time, with the help of another psychiatrist, male and black, the woman is going to get into Freddy's head, which is possible because she is his daughter and she has plenty of common recollections with him. She gets him out of the dreamscape in which he is protected and overpowerful and gets him into the real world where he is mortal. The final fight will lead to his absolute annihilation with his own claws and a good old stick of dynamite, his own penetrating and raping tools turned back onto him with the penis-like dynamite stick as a cherry to top it of, and he finally loses his cherry.

The film is still centered on Alice but she is growing older and older. She has finally reached high school graduation time. She has also reached the time when she can have a real boyfriend, spend the night with him and get pregnant from him. But she is a daughter raised by her father who has finally promised to stop drinking his sorrow away. This motherless situation is dictating the new turn in the saga. Alice becoming a pregnant mother before being a full mother she is attracted by this motherly side of the tale, hence she reintroduces Krueger's mother and we can see the time when this mother, still not a mother, is locked up with a hundred insane criminals, and then her being more than menaced. We can see her giving birth to an abomination. And this leads to the death of the father of Alice's child, killed of course by Krueger who makes him practically commit suicide on the road and ram into a truck. Krueger is jealous of Alice's boyfriends. Before the end of the film he will get one more in his claws. But the religious theme is strong all along. Freddy is born within the total destruction of a church, which corresponds to his rebirth in the film. Then his mother, the nun, has to be found, liberated from her walled-in prison for her to fulfill her mission  protect Alice and Alice's child from her own son and undeliver Freddy back into her womb as being his new prison to bring the film to an end. The mother seen as the cause of all this evil and at the same time the one that has to be punished for it forever in order for other people and women and children to be able to live free and unmenaced. That is pushing Eve's original sin and guilt very far indeed. That is pushing Mary's mediating role definitely too far. Even if we can believe it is a cathartic way of getting rid of our guilt and sexist vision, we must admit the treatment is quite rough and more than just plain pungent, in fact definitely violent, terrorizing and lined up inside and outside with the grossest possible visions. Even Alice and her child, conceived out of wedlock and who is going to be born to an unmarried mother and widow, are shown in the best Christian light possible. She will keep the child and raise him the best she can. The last scene of the film is the vision of this baby raised by Alice, her best friend and her father, with the recollection of two young men, one his father, who have died for this child to be born. And sure enough the malediction is not far away. The rhythm of the film and the extremely rapid accumulation of horrifying, terrorizing and gross elements all of them intertwined together and interlaced one into all the others gives that film a real appeal and a deep effectiveness. We can feel terrorized at times and we definitely find the situation, Freddy Krueger and the whole world quite unbearably cruel to authorize such horror to exist in our midst.

Freddy was only a disguise for a real bad spirit in the world (Anne Rice has done that with her vampires and the Queen of the Damned, or Stephen King has also used this formula with his Dark Man in quite a few novels, like The Stand, and short stories) and this really bad spirit has decided to come back to the real world once and for all and under his own identity if possible, or under that of Freddy Krueger if the minds of people are obsessed by his existence. This evil spirit is of course the devil himself and it will be revealed in the very last scene. So the actors are playing their real parts and Freddy is invading their real world.

Unfortunately Jedi fell short of many people's expectations. This used to be my favorite Star Wars movie, but as I've grown older I've come to favor Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. I will start with the bad The most common criticism of ROTJ has always been there were too many muppets. I agree wholeheartedly. There were several scenes where I think Lucas went out of his way to make these creatures just to sell toys. Originally the Ewoks were supposed to be Wookies, but since Chewbacca had been established as an intelligent alien, Lucas replaced them with Ewoks. The muppets do not ruin the movie completely but they do degrade the quality of the final battle scene and both versions of the celebration scene. But this is not ROTJ's biggest flaw at all IMO.Return of the Jedi just lacks the freshness of the first two Star Wars movies. The first thirty to forty minutes of the movie bring us back to Tattooine, a planet we've already seen. The only new location is Endor, which is pretty boring compared to Mos Eisley and Hoth Base. The Death Star plot from the first movie has been rehashed, probably because Lucas needed an easy way to cramp the Emperor's death and the fall of the Imperial navy in one movie. The movie has a rushed feel as well, from Han Solo's rescue to Endor to Luke's conflict with his father. As an example, take the scene where Luke tells Leia that they are siblings. Never mind the fact that this makes certain scenes in Star Wars and Empire pretty disgusting, you would think Lucas would have included a scene or two with Leia having trouble coping with the fact that her father is Darth Vader, one of the most evil men in the galaxy! But no, Lucas had to wrap things up in two hours, so there was simply no time.By this point, most of the characters had developed as much as they could. Han Solo and Leia are marginalized big time. Ford is visibly bored in many scenes, and he just doesn't have the same flare anymore. Carrie Fisher is a zombie in this film (possibly due to her drug problems). Their material simply was not as good as the previous films. Harrison Ford didn't even want to be in Jedi; he thought Solo should have died because the character had developed as far as he could. Co-writer Lawrence Kasdan agreed with Ford. It is certainly an interesting idea and I think it could have worked. It would have finished Solo's character arc nicely, going from a selfish pirate to a martyr. Alas, the supporting characters are just there for the ride, which is all due to the cramped nature of the script IMO. I wonder how much Ford was paid. Trivia Section It is interesting to note that Gary Kurtz, the producer of the first two Star Wars films, insists that George had never agreed to only make three Star Wars films. The number was up in the air. I think Kurtz wanted to make a fourth star wars film, maybe even a fifth and a sixth. Lucas, however, had gotten tired of the series and wanted to wrap up all of the ideas they had for the future sequels in one movie. To be honest I don't know who is telling the truth, but the fact that ROTJ feels so cramped makes me think there is at least some truth to what Kurtz said. For example, Kurtz's Jedi would have been split into two parts Leia looking for Han Solo and the Luke\/Vader story. That means no Death Star Battle and no Emperor.After all of my ranting, here is the good stuff. The Jabba the Hutt scenes are fun with the exception of the dance number. Jabba himself is an interesting puppet creation. Luke's story, aside from the embarrassing twist that made Leia his sister, was handled very well. Luke is the only character who actually has something interesting to do, which is to turn his father back to the good side. Luke and Vader's interactions are very moving, and you can almost see the emotion on Vader's face through the mask. Luke's character arc over the course of the three movies was done very well.This movie's other treat is Ian McDiarmid, who makes a deliciously evil Emperor Palpatine. Aside from Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker, McDiarmid has been in more Star Wars movies than any other actor. It's amazing that make-up from 1983 can be superior to make-up from 2005! The final scene where Vader lifts the Emperor and throws him into the pit is one of the best scenes in the series.Even though I think the Death Star II plot hurt the film, I have to praise the technical qualities of the space battle. Even without CGI it looks just as realistic as the space battle in Episode III.Despite all of my criticisms, ROTJ is still a fun movie. The scenes involving Luke, Vader, and the Emperor really save this film. We can speculate all we want about how the movie would have been if Solo had died, or if they had made a fourth movie, but this is what we got. So we have to enjoy it for all it's worth.

The first thirty to forty minutes of the movie bring us back to Tattooine, a planet we've already seen. The only new location is Endor, which is pretty boring compared to Mos Eisley and Hoth Base. The Death Star plot from the first movie has been rehashed, probably because Lucas needed an easy way to cramp the Emperor's death and the fall of the Imperial navy in one movie. The movie has a rushed feel as well, from Han Solo's rescue to Endor to Luke's conflict with his father. As an example, take the scene where Luke tells Leia that they are siblings. Never mind the fact that this makes certain scenes in Star Wars and Empire pretty disgusting, you would think Lucas would have included a scene or two with Leia having trouble coping with the fact that her father is Darth Vader, one of the most evil men in the galaxy! But no, Lucas had to wrap things up in two hours, so there was simply no time.By this point, most of the characters had developed as much as they could. Han Solo and Leia are marginalized big time. Ford is visibly bored in many scenes, and he just doesn't have the same flare anymore. Carrie Fisher is a zombie in this film (possibly due to her drug problems). Their material simply was not as good as the previous films. Harrison Ford didn't even want to be in Jedi; he thought Solo should have died because the character had developed as far as he could. Co-writer Lawrence Kasdan agreed with Ford. It is certainly an interesting idea and I think it could have worked. It would have finished Solo's character arc nicely, going from a selfish pirate to a martyr. Alas, the supporting characters are just there for the ride, which is all due to the cramped nature of the script IMO. I wonder how much Ford was paid. Trivia Section It is interesting to note that Gary Kurtz, the producer of the first two Star Wars films, insists that George had never agreed to only make three Star Wars films. The number was up in the air. I think Kurtz wanted to make a fourth star wars film, maybe even a fifth and a sixth. Lucas, however, had gotten tired of the series and wanted to wrap up all of the ideas they had for the future sequels in one movie. To be honest I don't know who is telling the truth, but the fact that ROTJ feels so cramped makes me think there is at least some truth to what Kurtz said. For example, Kurtz's Jedi would have been split into two parts Leia looking for Han Solo and the Luke\/Vader story. That means no Death Star Battle and no Emperor.After all of my ranting, here is the good stuff. The Jabba the Hutt scenes are fun with the exception of the dance number. Jabba himself is an interesting puppet creation. Luke's story, aside from the embarrassing twist that made Leia his sister, was handled very well. Luke is the only character who actually has something interesting to do, which is to turn his father back to the good side. Luke and Vader's interactions are very moving, and you can almost see the emotion on Vader's face through the mask. Luke's character arc over the course of the three movies was done very well.This movie's other treat is Ian McDiarmid, who makes a deliciously evil Emperor Palpatine. Aside from Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker, McDiarmid has been in more Star Wars movies than any other actor. It's amazing that make-up from 1983 can be superior to make-up from 2005! The final scene where Vader lifts the Emperor and throws him into the pit is one of the best scenes in the series.Even though I think the Death Star II plot hurt the film, I have to praise the technical qualities of the space battle. Even without CGI it looks just as realistic as the space battle in Episode III.Despite all of my criticisms, ROTJ is still a fun movie. The scenes involving Luke, Vader, and the Emperor really save this film. We can speculate all we want about how the movie would have been if Solo had died, or if they had made a fourth movie, but this is what we got. So we have to enjoy it for all it's worth.

First its director is extremely experienced in that kind of frightening films. He is an expert in stringing together, one after another frightening elements and effects, and when fear is not used then it is grossness and we move to some level of disgust. Yet we are never terrorized, just horrified and disgusted. Why is that ? Because the audience targeted by the film bans the idea of terrorizing them. The film director doesn't want the film to be restricted. So the film is very careful not to show any unnecessary or just alluring flesh or skin. We are targeting teenagers, so please no sex. Yet in that line of extreme ability at interweaving frightening elements one into the other, the director reflects his time with a few elements that may be surprising for a 1988 film. The characters definitely smoke too much and quite very conspicuously, and yet this gesture of lighting a cigarette is systematically associated with a bad turn in the action. In 1988 we were starting to take measures against tobacco. This film is reflecting this anti-smoking discourse directed at teenagers. This element along with the sexless vision of these young people shows how the American society had changed within ten years and had become very puritanical, though it was going to go a lot further later on. This change, of course brought up by the director, is totally in phase with the second element I want to note here as a new development in the saga. It is the religious dimension of the film.

Along with the brilliant EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD is another personal work from Burton wherein he feels right at home with the story and its lead character of the gifted outcast. Whereas EDWARD reflected Burton's childhood, ED WOOD reflected on Burton as the imaginative outcast in Hollywood, as well as his friendship with the late actor Vincent Price (which was uncannily similar to Wood's own friendship with his idol Bela Lugosi). Johnny Depp really looks as if he is Ed Wood. The weirdness and all. But he is not, by any means, a mockery of the real thing. Instead, Burton and Depp revel in the eccentricity and odd imagination of the man. Instead of condescending the man's lack of any real talent or experience, Burton and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski embrace them man's love for his work and his insistence to do what he wants. Here we see he loves movies and not the business they make. Wood may be the worst director of all time as he is claimed to be, but does do it right. Other than Depp, Martin Landau's performance as the late Bela Lugosi is one you've got to see to believe. From the accent to the excellent make-up effects, Landau IS Lugosi. It sort of reminded me of the making of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE where Wood used stock footage and a double to make it look like it was the recently-deceased Lugosi's true final film. Well, Burton would have made Wood proud; this is the closest we can get to bringing the man who played Dracula back from the grave. I really love this movie.

Whereas EDWARD reflected Burton's childhood, ED WOOD reflected on Burton as the imaginative outcast in Hollywood, as well as his friendship with the late actor Vincent Price (which was uncannily similar to Wood's own friendship with his idol Bela Lugosi). Johnny Depp really looks as if he is Ed Wood. The weirdness and all. But he is not, by any means, a mockery of the real thing. Instead, Burton and Depp revel in the eccentricity and odd imagination of the man. Instead of condescending the man's lack of any real talent or experience, Burton and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski embrace them man's love for his work and his insistence to do what he wants. Here we see he loves movies and not the business they make. Wood may be the worst director of all time as he is claimed to be, but does do it right. Other than Depp, Martin Landau's performance as the late Bela Lugosi is one you've got to see to believe. From the accent to the excellent make-up effects, Landau IS Lugosi. It sort of reminded me of the making of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE where Wood used stock footage and a double to make it look like it was the recently-deceased Lugosi's true final film. Well, Burton would have made Wood proud; this is the closest we can get to bringing the man who played Dracula back from the grave. I really love this movie. Take my word for it, Ed Wood is a great film; one of Burton's best films and perhaps Depp's greatest and most eccentric performance to date. Rating ***** out of 5.

The depression was going to arrive soon with its unemployment, financial catastrophe, and nazism. All that is clearly reflected in the film. There are two levels in this city, the underground level for factories and the working class, and the top level for business people, politicians and other privileged people. The latter dance, feast, do nothing but enjoy what other people under them create and produce. This vision of a world cut in two social classes is quite common in those days though today it sounds a little bit schematic. In these days everything was either black or white. The trick in the film is that the son of the ruler of this metropolis falls in love with a certain Maria from underground who preaches the coming of some kind of Messiah to establish peace and freedom for all. She preaches in the catacombs exclusively to working class people. She represents some hope and patience. But it all runs afoul when the ruler decides to get rid of his main counselor and to encourage his inventor to kidnap this Maria to use her face on the inventor's robot. This robot then goes down underground and preaches rebellion and destruction. The real Maria, with the help of the ruler's son and his fired main counselor will save all the children trapped in the underground city and will catch up on the crowd of working class people looking for vengeance in the name of their supposedly lost children. Luckily the good news will change the atmosphere, though not the fate of the false Maria who is already burning at the stake, which reveals she is nothing but a robot. Then the inventor had managed to recapture the real Maria and the ruler's son runs after them. The inventor will be defeated, Maria saved and some kind of peace reestablished between the leader\/foreman of the working class and the ruler of the metropolis, thanks to the intermission of the ruler's son who appears to be the Messiah or go-between they were waiting for. The interest of the film here is that it is messianic because it foresees what is going to happen though it tries to avoid it or preach a middle way between the two extremes. We have to think of H.G. Wells and his Time Machine. The two worlds are not incompatible, just not able to communicate any more. The solution, the way out is for Fritz Lang the possibility to communicate again for these two classes, with a strong common ground which is found in some kind of Christian inspiration mainly from the Book of Revelation. But the main interest of the film is technical. It is a film that associates some kind of animation, the filming of pictures, images and objects, and the filming of real characters in the setting that these images represent. For the period it was very advanced and some of the special effects necessary for the depicting of the machines, the factories and the collapse of the underground city are extremely fascinating in spite of their rudimentary nature. It is also a mute film and the acting is extremely expressive, even if the quantity of text is rather important. The point is that the acting is probably just as expressive as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but not in a comic direction, rather in a very tragic and dramatic way. These actors and actresses are able to really express feelings only with their body language. The best case is the main actress who plays both the real Maria and the false Maria. She manages to contrast the two parts perfectly and only with her body language. Some of the visions contained in this film have since been used by many other filmmakers and imitated or even copied by many fiction writers. We should also note the music which accompanies this film. It is slightly repetitive but keeps some liveliness and originality.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2007","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is a myth. 1925-1927 in Germany was a crucial period.

It's a cultural treasure and justifiably beloved. But there is no getting around the fact that the role of Sam, the jazz pianist, is patronizingly written and the character is an unfortunate example of the Uncle Tom type of good black that so often crept into movies of that era.The character of the pianist\/singer in Rick's Cafe Americain was initially conceived of as a part for a female jazz artist like Hazel Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, or Lena Horne. Perhaps the subliminal sexuality of having a young African American woman so close to Rick (Bogart) made the Warner Bros. execs nervous. MGM, where Lena Horne was under contract, never quite knew how to deal with her beauty or sexuality. She was seldom part of a storyline but rather often featured as a performer in a nightclub sequence that could be snipped out in prints of the film being exhibited in the Deep South, thus not offending racists but not messing with the continuity of the plot. The role of the pianist was switched to a male character possibly to sidestep all the issues of miscegenation between the singer and Mr. Rick. Racial mixing was one of the last taboos to go during the 30 year reign and enforcement of the Production Code.Though the Bogart character is respectful of Sam and looks out for his best interests, making sure Sam is paid the same once he leaves Morocco, their relationship is not truly one of equals. Sam always refers to him as Mr. Rick and Bergman as Miss Ilsa. Sam takes care of Rick and worries over his happiness and well-being. We know nothing of Sam's life or needs.

He did also sing well, and his performance is part of the stuff dreams were made of at Warner Bros.---preserved for posterity in this wonderful though clearly not perfect film.

I am more of a samurai movie lover and only watch kung-fu movies on occasion. So please keep this in mind when you read this--if you are a huge fan, you'd probably give the movie an 8 or 9 but if you have little interest in the genre, this film probably will only rate a 4 or 5. If you can suspend disbelief and just enjoy the great stunt-work and cute story elements, you'll probably be pretty satisfied.Okay, the casual kung-fu viewer will certainly notice that the film is very grainy and washed out as well as possessing pretty awful dubbing. I really wish these films were available with subtitles instead, but in the 1970s distributors thought Western audiences wouldn't see a film with subtitles, so they slapped on absolutely terrible dubbing tracks. While this isn't the worst I've seen, it is bad and the film has no background sounds (other than slaps and celery crunching during the fight scenes)--so it sounds pretty weird. Also, the music is ultra-cheesy.However, despite all these shortcomings, it's obvious that the germ of an excellent film is hiding underneath. That's because the plot and idea of putting kung-fu action in Rome is inspired! Instead of the usual problems occurring in Hong Kong (or elsewhere in China), here we have something different. Plus, many times the action is pretty funny--with cute fight scenes and parodies of some of Lee's earlier films. For example, one of the Italian thugs uses Bruce's own trademark thumb brushing against his nose move. I also liked the cheesy effeminate voice used for the dub of the Chinese guy who worked for the mob--it was so silly and over the top you had to laugh. In addition, seeing Lee impaling the gunmen's hands with darts was a good way to explain away why this mob didn't just shoot Lee (though, inexplicably, again and again despite their hand being pierced, the wounds disappeared an instant later due to continuity problems).The film ended well with some excellent fights--particularly the finale in the Coliseum with an evil Chuck Norris. It's just a shame that they didn't have Chuck shave off his icky back hair first! This scary sight is repeated, by the way, in the first few minutes of THE GAME OF DEATH--Lee's final film and a total mess of a film due to his being dead during most of the filming!!

I loved the original SupermanThe Movie and this sequel. They are really good, but this sequel is a bit more fast-paced than its predecessor. Christopher Reeve is in top shape reprising his role. Margot Kidder adds laughs and romance to our famous hero once again. Richard Lester is an excellent director, putting in a lot of memorable moments in Superman II. From epic battles with three evil Kryptonian prisoners, to tongue-in-cheek laughs and perfect romance between Superman\/Clark Kent and Lois Lane. This sequel even has more special-effects than the original, which, although not quite as astounding to today's standards, is still colorful to watch. The kids and adults will definitely love watching this. A bit better than the original. It's imperfect, but then again that's not what we have come to expect. Buy any cut you want.

My friend introduced me to it about 7 or 8 years ago. I am eternally grateful to her. We used to watch it at every single sleepover and many other times apart from that. There was four of us in our group so we used to imagine it was us. I borrowed the video of my friend a lot. I was thrilled when I got to tape it of the TV and I bought it on DVD recently (the only thing is that I would have loved if the DVD had special features). The film tells the story of four 12 year old friend growing up in the 1970s in America. They all have different personalities and come from different family circumstances. Roberta is the leader of the group. She is a tomboy. Her Mum died when she was young. Chrissie is Roberta's best friend. She is quite naive and her parents are over-protective. Samantha is the clever, book-worm of the group and is interested in ghosts. Her parents break up during the film. Her best friend is Teeny. Teeny is the over-dramatic one, who loves dressing up and acting. Her parents barely even notice her. The film follows the girls as they deal with growing up issues such as liking boys, wanting freedom and problems such as dealing with divorce and death. These issues makes the film and storyline both very good and realistic. The cast are very good, especially the four young girls. I just love this film so much because it reminds me of my childhood and the things me and my friends used to get up to. I can relate it to my own childhood and the friends I had (and still have) and how we would do anything for each other and be there for each other. I am sure others have this same view.
