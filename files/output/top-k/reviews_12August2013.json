This time they bring in American and Russian military to the scene. A Russian submarine gets attacked and they blame the Americans for the happening. When they figure out that this is Godzilla returning back they want to use atomic warfare on it. But like the original Godzilla movie from 1954 the Japanese still have not forgotten the Hiroshima bombing and refuse to let the Russians and Americans use atomic bombs on Godzilla. They want to find another way to stop him.Actors These actors are not the best I have seen but did a fairly good job in this movie. Ken Tanaka have not been playing in any big things that I think people outside of Asia would know of. Yasuko Sawaguchi have acted in a bit more known works, like Godzilla vs. Biollante (1989), she have also been in another Toho Company monster movie called Orochi the Eight-Headed Dragon (1994). Yosuke Natsuki on the other hand may be the one who have played in most notable movies of these actors. The most well known movie he have starred in may be the Akira Kurosawa movie Yojimbo (1961), He have also been in other monster movies like Beauty and the Liquid Man (1958), Dagora the Space Monster (1964), Gihdorah the Three-Headed Monster (1964). Keiju Kobayashi have also been starring in a lot of movies but most of them not very well known outside of Asia. Maybe most known for his role in Kurosawa movie Sanjuro (1962). I actually think he did the best performance of the actors in this movie as the prime minister. Cinematography The sets here are all good like you expect from the Toho Studios when creating monster movies. The charming fact of the movies they make is what I mean is good cinema when you keep away from CGI at most. Like rockets from military wagons and planes they have created it themselves and it does not look very real but it looks cool. When you see they fire on Godzilla it is very cool scenes. The only CGI in most Godzilla movies are the radioactive breath that comes out of the mouth of Godzilla. I don't know if we should call it CGI actually but it is the closest to it you get in these movies. They create miniature versions of the cities and then the monster can go rampage there and it looks cool. And take note of what I say, it is not very good looking like wow but it looks cool and charming effect. Outside of all these bad CGI effects we get from Hollywood movies. One cool thing to take in mind before seeing this movie is a scene where a helicopter gets blasted down you see a billboard in the background of the Ghostbusters logo.Music\/Sound The music is nothing very special in this one but the sound in Godzilla movies is always a treat. The roar of Godzilla is the best monster sound ever. The only thing that comes near may be the sound of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and that sound was inspired by the sound of the original Godzilla movie. Costume\/Make-up In costumes I guess the only thing that can be mentioned is always the costume of Godzilla. It is a man inside that monster and that is what I love so much about the monsters in Asian monster movies. Not a computer generated monster but as close to the real thing that you can get and the costume is very good and detailed. The only other costumes to mention might be the ones that the military uses and well they are as they should be.Summary This is the first real sequel since the original Godzilla movie from Toho. And the first Godzilla movies since the original where he do not meet another monster to fight. The directors of this movie Koji Hashimoto and R.J. Kizer have not done much in main directing but many other movie related jobs. This movie is very good in the way that they wanted to take Godzilla to where he started if they succeeded or not is for each and everyone to decide. It may be a better watch for those loving the concept then the normal viewer. If you want the typical Hollywood way of movies stay away. If you like monster movies and foreign movies go for it.

Written and directed by Oliver Stone, Platoon is considered as one of the best war movies ever made. Another masterpiece of the same director, also with Vietnam war topic is Born on the Fourth of July with Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic real life war veteran, based on true story. Oliver Stone took part in Vietnam war (he served there from September 1967. until November 1968. being wounded twice and receiving couple of military decorations for his participation). After he returned home he decided to put his war experiences into a script of fictionalized war story which many years later was transformed into a movie inspired by war experiences that Stone had in Vietnam. That was how Platoon was made. A story with authentic background. Not popular with US.Army because it is telling of highly negative side of the war (showing terrible war atrocities against civilians and horrors of fighting in the jungle) Platoon is a strong and emotional story about different characters of different people put together on inevitable collision course with each other. Those hidden virtues and faults of those people have always been in themselves, they are only emphasized in a war madness that surrounds them. Three main characters Sgt.Barnes (Tom Berenger) on one side, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) on the opposite one and private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) between them come from different life backgrounds and often have opposite and confronting perceptions of the war and life itself. In every war, in every army, on both sides in every armed conflict there were always and there will always be people like three of them and people around them. Movie shows platoon divided between Elias and Barnes two centers of gravity and those who choose to be with one or the other.Sgt.Barnes is a battle hardened and ruthless warrior. A man who does n't care much for himself and others when it comes to having fire contact with the enemy. He lost his humanity and became like a blood thirsty animal itching for fighting because it is the only meaning of his life left. What kind of life and pain formed his personality we can only guess, but outside of war he has no place, he has no purpose. And he knows that. Deep inside he hates himself for what he is and he does n't care if he is going to live or get killed. He openly challenges others to take on him (It's just me and six of you guys, come on, no one's gonna know) but they don't dare to do anything. Two statements define his character and beliefs, first - Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told, but when he don't, the machine breaks down. And when the machine breaks down, we break down. And I ain't gonna allow that in any of you. Not one and second - You smoke this to escape from reality. Well, I don't need to do that, I am reality  which is kind of his life statement.Sgt. Elias is opposite of him. Battle hardened and experienced fighter too, but a man who can keep his balance, he will not cross the line, the point of no return that Sgt.Barnes crossed long time ago. Elias does n't have any illusions about the war, he had them on the beginning but they are lost meanwhile. As he says to Chris Taylor We are going to lose this one he considers it a wrong war to fight as he realized after disappointments that he had about its cause. If he lost his illusions he did not lose his humanity. A man who will do the right thing when it matters most and lose his life because of it. Chris Taylor is rebellious and idealistic person who escapes from life at home full of restrictions and rules trying to gain an experience of his own and what he finds is not quite as what he expected, if he had any idealistic illusions they are soon crushed by harsh realities of war and the way it transforms people pushing the best and worst in them to the limits of human tolerance. In the end he is left deeply traumatized with psychological scars that will take many years to heal and become bearable. Story about different characters of different people rejected by society but in war they have just what they need with some of them seeing it as a way to project worst parts of their personality and stay unpunished. As many other great movies, Platoon is a story about human character, about the best and worst in all of us. Part of us that makes us be the greatest humanists and part of us that makes us be the worst criminals. Chris Taylor puts it great when he says that he is a child of two fathers - Elias and Barnes because he has what both of them have. Humanity of Elias and killing instinct of Barnes because in the end he kills Barnes. Others are mere reflections like Sgt.O'Neill, an ordinary coward, psychopath Bunny, a dog of war released from his chains, or Rhah, King and Big Harold who can still find strength to joke after all. Joke is their best cure. For Chris and others there are many years left to heal from scars deep inside their souls as he says it in words that can be the point of the whole movie - I think now looking back we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves and the enemy was in us... But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.

As with a conspiracy theorist's perception of the world, the American (and one presumes other countries') society of They Live is unable to see the strings, let alone the puppet masters. To the everyday worker, everything seems normal. Wealth and social\/economic advancement are out of reach and the media give out subliminal messages designed to demotivate, produce calm obedience and distract. Some would compare They Live to the masterpiece 1984 in the way it predicts top-down manipulation of the working class and lower class by design. They Live adds humor and sci-fi, but the message is there. Some say that in the years since this film was created, some of the trends imagined in it have come to pass. I wouldn't argue with that.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Sport"},{"date":"12 August 2013","score":"","review":" I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially cliché and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out.But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would allow anyone to look up other student's scores.Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.
