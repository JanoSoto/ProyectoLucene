[{"date":"25 October 2011","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Wing Commander has to be one of the worst video game adapted screenplays to be released of all time, along with Street Fighter. The visual effects very abysmal, the acting and performances were atrocious, and the look of the whole movie is just atrocious. However I did like the performances by Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Saffron Burrows. This movie looks like it was made by somebody who was high off of his butt. What was the director thinking. Of all the people to direct it, it was directed by the guy who created the video game which got very good reviews. If you want to see a good video game adapted screenplay, I would recommend the first Mortal Kombat movie. Not the second one. That one is a total disaster like this movie. Do not bother with Wing Commander one. It is just a waste of time.
