Pretty much anything from 1600-1800 is just amazing to me. And yet, this film made it seem so silly and boring. Perhaps I should not be surprised when it was made by Roland Emmerich, who does not seem able to really add any gravity to his films. (See Godzilla.) The worst part is the casting of Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger is great in any part, but Gibson just looks like a thug coming down from a weekend bender. He has a few roles he has played well, but is overall forgettable. And he helped make this film forgettable.
