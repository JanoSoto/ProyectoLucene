Star Wars is established in the minds of people worldwide, young and old, to the extent that there has even been a push to create an official religion called Jedi. So AOTC has a lot to live up to. To all of those who say that AOTC and TPM are just movies, I have to state that it would be nice if that truly was the case. But such an effort has been made by many to integrate Star Wars into our thinking that one must expect at least a better story than something from the makers of TV movies of the week.Some reviewers claim that AOTC is hurt by bad acting. I disagree. Take a look at the other works of the main and secondary actors. Natalie Portman does Chekhov plays with Kevin Kline, for heaven's sake! You do *not* get asked to perform in such plays if you cannot act. Hayden Christensen was extraordinary in Life As a House so please do not confuse his performance in AOTC with bad acting. That's what logicians call a specious syllogism.Some reviewers slavishly praise Lucas for even making the films. I disagree. George Lucas knew going into this project that he had a choice in making the prequels. He could make a trilogy with mass appeal, or he could make a trilogy that *he* would want to see. Or he could try extra hard and give the trilogy a depth and dramatic power that would surpass the first trilogy's legacy. Of course, to do that would require making *HARD* decisions like personally deciding what he could or could not do well. And George Lucas is not a student filmmaker needing the support of Coppola anymore. He literally has *hundreds* of millions of dollars and guaranteed financial success behind him.Some people see Star Wars as entirely belonging to George Lucas and they even thank the stars that George is not beholden to Hollywood blowhards too famous for diluting or meddling in the creative efforts of visionaries. Well, kiddies, do not forget, please, that the other extreme is just as bad a film made by someone too famous and worshipped to be beholden to anyone but yes-men and sycophants.Some reviews mention the child actors in TPM and AOTC and categorically condemn them from having any part in successful and well-made movies. Does that logic apply to The Sixth Sense or Poltergeist or Harry Potter or half the films directed by Steven Spielberg? Or might it be the fault of the DIRECTOR??? Does Jake Lloyd deserve that much blame for TPM and its failures? Is that realistic, or are the critics looking for a scapegoat other than ... the DIRECTOR???These are the reasons AOTC is going to get judged more harshly by the fans and critics who know that it could have, SHOULD have been a better film than it is. This is a film franchise that has EVERYTHING going for it, so it should evolve and unfold at least to the same standards as the original trilogy. But this is George Lucas we're talking about here, a man who had to have Greedo shoot Han *first* in (Star Wars Special Edition) or change Luke's line to R2-D2 in ESB from, You're lucky you don't taste very good, to You're lucky you got out of there. (Think about how much time and money was spent just to make these changes in the Special Editions before you argue creative license on George Lucas' part.) This is the decision of the director, who seems now decidedly politically correct and without any edge. Movies about war need to be made by a director who has *some* kind of edge.If it was just all that, I would say that Lucas has no business directing his films as he clearly does not appear to handle all the nuances of key scenes. Lucas is just plain missing the point of directing and we, the audience, lose. But he also does not do something a writer and producer is *obligated* to do (by his\/her profession) and that is scrupulously and intelligently maintaining story continuity and a logical consistency to the storyline. George does not do this in either Star Wars prequel, and again, the audience suffers.Some will *then* argue that AOTC is a setup for Episode III, so it can be forgiven some atrociously laid out exposition. Actually, good writing makes a single episode in an ongoing story stand on its own merits. ESB has a horrible cliffhanger and still managed to stand on its own or people would *have* to watch ESB back-to-back with ROTJ every time they saw it. How many reading this who have seen ESB had to watch ROTJ to understand ESB? It is for this reason that TPM and AOTC are inferior films because they are written like books in a juvenile series, and not like integrated but stand-alone movies. It is why they get top heavy in exposition and confuse some of the audience. Put another way, it's bad storytelling.Oh, come on! I hear you say, It's 'Star Wars,' not the Bible! It's only a movie!! Well, it is NOW. Twenty-five plus years ago, Star Wars broke ground and set standards for motion picture action films not done since The Adventures of Robin Hood, and The Empire Strikes Back raised the bar both technically and from the viewpoint of really advancing a saga. And the entire series was about adding a believable spiritual ingredient to a traditionally two dimensional genre. Modern myths do NOT happen every day!

But here he delivers an exceptional performance that is, quite possibly, his best. He's a man who suddenly has his whole life turn into a bizarre, surreal world where nothing makes sense and everything is constantly changing. The way he handles the transition from easy-going to boiling-with-frustration is great, and we, the audience, buy the transition because we sort of go through it for ourselves as well.The film has its share of surreal images and art house movie moments, something I usually don't go for, but there was just something about this film that made it all work.

Even now, just a few hours after watching it, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened at the end.Co-stars Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, while completely untalented, don't distract too much from the film, but (especially in Cruz's case) there are plenty of moments when you realize how more effective the parts could've been with talented actresses in the roles. Kurt Russell is good (as always) as the psychiatrist who wants to help Cruise figure things out and determine if he is responsible for the murder he's being charged with.It's not a film I would watch over and over again, and it could have been a little shorter (a couple scenes went on a little too long), but overall it was a satisfying movie that will have you confused, frustrated, and amazed until the very end.

Normally I would just turn such a movie off and not bother finishing it, but as strange as this film was, I just couldn't look away. Something about it kept pulling me in further and further until I was as utterly confused and frustrated as Tom Cruise's David Aames as he tried to figure out just what the hell was going on.I've never really thought much of Tom Cruise as an actor, but more as an entertainer. But here he delivers an exceptional performance that is, quite possibly, his best. He's a man who suddenly has his whole life turn into a bizarre, surreal world where nothing makes sense and everything is constantly changing. The way he handles the transition from easy-going to boiling-with-frustration is great, and we, the audience, buy the transition because we sort of go through it for ourselves as well.The film has its share of surreal images and art house movie moments, something I usually don't go for, but there was just something about this film that made it all work. The revelation at the end wasn't close to what I was beginning to suspect it was, and I won't give it away here.

If you had never heard of this film, you would have been able to watch this sequence without knowing... (last chance to stop reading) ...that despite having a shaved head and wearing Nazi emblems, Danny is in fact Jewish. I had heard of the film, however. In fact I was scheduled to see it on September 13th at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival, but due to the events two days prior it was pulled from the festival.Early on, the film also shows flashbacks to Danny's days as a young boy in Jewish school, arguing with the teacher that any God who would order someone kill their own child is basically a bully. In this scene and in his scenes as a 20-something adult, Danny is shown as the most intelligent, articulate, and charismatic character on the screen, even when what he has to say is completely repugnant. He starts the film single-minded, but later he begins to become more conflicted and complex.The keys to the film are Gosling's possibly Oscar-worthy performance in the lead role, and the words that the writers have provided him to say. What works far less well are the other characters, who seem either one-dimensional or totally undefined. Mostly this didn't bother me while I was watching the film, with the exception of Lina's daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix), the love interest, who never made much sense.The editing seemed interesting. There were many jump cuts, which I guessed might have been made simply to get the best moments in various takes. But based on an interview I read with the first time director (Henry Bean, who also wrote the film), this was done to show that in a sense there are multiple Dannys. Note also that there is extensive use of handheld and often unsteady cameras (SpastiCam TM).This film is actually based on the true story of a Jew who was a member of the Nazi party and also the KKK until he was outed by a journalist in 1965. Despite winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in early 2001, it has had trouble getting distribution, finally showing on cable on Showtime in March, and only now getting theatrical distribution (locally starting 6\/14\/2002).I saw this at Camera Cinema Club in San Jose, CA on 6\/9\/2002. Unfortunately, no one from the film was available to talk, but the audience discussion was quite interesting. If you do get a chance to see the film, and I definitely recommend it, try to see it with an open minded group of people who can discuss it afterwards.

Paxton passes on Matt getting his own boat, and the sub crew finds themselves under a secret mission. They are to disguise themselves as Nazi sailors, board a disabled u-boat, and take the Enigma machine, a coding instrument that could change the tide (get it?) of the naval war. The operation is going smoothly until the American sub gets torpedoed and a skeleton crew jumps on the captured u-boat of the title. They are tracked by a German destroyer, and inside the u-boat's captain tries to sabotage their every move. The bulk of the film is a long set piece where the u-boat must attack the destroyer with an impossible plan and just one torpedo.Matthew McConaughey is very good as the officer who finds himself in command of his own ship in a most roundabout way. He is cautioned that he is too nice to the crew, and this fault plays an important role in his decision making. Harvey Keitel also plays an understated role as the chief NCO on the boat who often must put Matt in his place, whether by good advice or common sense lecturing. He has a really great role and does it well. Much of the name cast disappears early, but Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi are standouts. Bon Jovi is unrecognizable in a uniform, and he does his underwritten part well. Paxton is getting more mature roles now, no sign of that goofy grin of his, and I would have liked to see more of his character.Mostow cowrote and directed, and some of his camera shots are amazing. Watch for an over head shot as the u-boat freefalls lower into the ocean. The other effects are incredible, I did not think for one second I was watching some miniature sub models in a Hollywood swimming pool. The suspense is also timed out well, with the problems coming along believably and never overwhelming the plot.I did find a couple of things that I would like to have seen Mostow think his way around on, instead of going into sub film cliche. At one point, in order to fool the enemy, the sub launches garbage and a body out of the torpedo hole in order to look like they have sunk. I am not saying this maneuver did not work in the real war, but has there ever been a WWII naval film that did not deploy this trick? Also, the American cast is amazed at how deep the u-boat can go, when the almost exact scene was played to equal effect in Das Boot. These minor quibbles glared when offered, and kept this from being a perfect action film.Although the efforts of the British navy in capturing the code machines were slighted until a closing credits crawl, this film succeeds in what it was meant to do- entertain us. After Das Boot, it can at least be called the second best WWII German submarine movie of all time. I highly recommend it.This was rated (PG13) for physical violence, strong gun violence, some gore, and some profanity.

Being 17 when i saw it last year on channel4 in Britain, and also being male doesn't seem to make it easier telling your friends you were scared by a movie.  But when one of those friends agrees with you and you realise you're not the only one to think it, it does help.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is truly THE most frightening film i have ever seen.  I usually tend to be a fan of the horror genre, in fact The Shining is my favourite film of all time, but no film i have seen since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre has ever been good enough in creating the same impact and shock upon me.  When discussing it with people of a similar age what they thought of the film, most responses thought it was a lousy film and was funny in parts.  As a generalisation (and i know this isnt always the case) it seems a lot of people who think that the film isnt anywhere scary at all, do not know it was actually based on fact.  When i told some of my friends this (they didn't know) they changed their minds slightly about the film.This is the main feature when watching this movie is that knowing its based on fact, you can't help but feel for the characters.  Sure, you know they are being played by actors and aren't actually being brutally murdered, however you can't help being reminded in your mind that most of the gruesome scenes which are shown has actually happened to someone.There truly are disturbing murders shown and what becomes of the corpses, but this film's title shouldn't be taken too literally! - there is only one person shown that is actually killed by a chainsaw, however not every film is true to the title and you do also get the hint the main murderer - Leatherface (who wears a mask of human skin) does kill regularly with his chainsaw.  Probably one of the worst scenes that i remember in this film is of the murder of the first girl; having attempted to run away from leatherface, she is grabbed by him and dragged into the slaughter room, where her live body is hung on a meat hook, while in front of her we see Leatherface working on the dead body of her boyfriend - mutilating it with the chainsaw.  This is just one example of many in the film where in breaks through the boundary's of conventional horror.Marilyn Burns cannot be corrected for her brilliant acting and realism, when she plays the tortured survivor Sally Hardesty.  Having had her four other friends murdered by the disturbingly psychotic Leatherface, she becomes the only one to survive but has to endure an unbelievable torture by Leatherface's family of psychopaths.This, is another part of the film in which you really feel for the character.  Having been chased a long distance by Leatherface and his chainsaw, she finally comes to a man who appears she is safe with, only to find out he is part of the disturbing family and captures her, where she is being skinned at the dinner table.  Marilyn Burns plays on your emotions even more by the constant screaming, to which no one can hear (thus needing the tagline from Aliens - In Texas, no one can hear you scream).  An effective use of the camera also helps to sink more fear into you.  A close-up of her eye, which is moving all the time and staring completely helps to show us how she feels, in a way it puts us in her situation, feeling her fear.  A point-of-view shot in the same scene also does this, showing us the table with the family around and the youngest member mimicking her cries as he goes on to torture her.  It is only by a careless moment by this person that lets her escape, but even then it isn't over. When she runs out of the house, Leatherface is soon to follow her, chasing with the chainsaw again.  What perhaps is also disturbing in this outside shot, is that we can tell it is now daylight, having been captured in the dark night before.  So we can only imagine just how long she has been in there, being tortured.From the moment the horror starts, it never stops in this film until the end.  This was a low-budget film, but was a high budget required? the answer is no.  This film is a slasher-movie being propelled to its most potential in shocking you...and it works.If you think this film is rubbish, that is your choice.  I recommend this film to all die-hard horror fans, like myself (as i mentioned) but dont expect it to be similar to horror films you have already seen.

Having been chased a long distance by Leatherface and his chainsaw, she finally comes to a man who appears she is safe with, only to find out he is part of the disturbing family and captures her, where she is being skinned at the dinner table.  Marilyn Burns plays on your emotions even more by the constant screaming, to which no one can hear (thus needing the tagline from Aliens - In Texas, no one can hear you scream).  An effective use of the camera also helps to sink more fear into you.  A close-up of her eye, which is moving all the time and staring completely helps to show us how she feels, in a way it puts us in her situation, feeling her fear.  A point-of-view shot in the same scene also does this, showing us the table with the family around and the youngest member mimicking her cries as he goes on to torture her.  It is only by a careless moment by this person that lets her escape, but even then it isn't over. When she runs out of the house, Leatherface is soon to follow her, chasing with the chainsaw again.  What perhaps is also disturbing in this outside shot, is that we can tell it is now daylight, having been captured in the dark night before.  So we can only imagine just how long she has been in there, being tortured.From the moment the horror starts, it never stops in this film until the end.  This was a low-budget film, but was a high budget required? the answer is no.  This film is a slasher-movie being propelled to its most potential in shocking you...and it works.If you think this film is rubbish, that is your choice.  I recommend this film to all die-hard horror fans, like myself (as i mentioned) but dont expect it to be similar to horror films you have already seen.  If you have seen similar movies - they are most likely made after 1974.Great film, shocking, powerful and disturbing but a great film. This is not for the easily disturbed.

It was certainly an improvement after the over-the-top, ritzy-ditzy, incredibly-awful EPISODE I, but still not as good as the original trilogy. It had an even balance of ups and downs, making for quite a mixed bag in my opinion.THE GOOD POINTS The special effects weren't as overkill as they were in EPISODE I, and I liked the darker tone the film had. But for me, the best thing about this film was Ewan McGregor. Although I liked him in THE PHANTOM MENACE (the only other principle actor I liked in that movie besides Liam Neeson), he was much better this time around. At times, I felt as if I was actually watching a young Alec Guiness, and I could easily buy that this was the same war-hardened Obi-Wan we'd be seeing again in EPISODE 4. I know these prequels are about Anakin Skywalker, but I would have been perfectly happy if this film (and EPISODE III) focused entirely on Obi-Wan. He was terrific.Watching Samuel L. Jackson kick ass with a lightsabre was cool (and one of the things I was really looking forward to), but it was a moment that could have been much better. His fight with Jango Fett was too short. Temeura Morrison was good as Fett, but the character was rather underused I felt. He needed more presence in the film, and he should have been saved for EPISODE III, as he had the makings of a really interesting character. Jar-Jar, thankfully, is barely on-screen, though he's still a cringe-inducer when he is. And one of my favorite scenes is the one with Yoda and the young Jedi kids.The chase through the city on Coruscant was pretty good, but went a little over-the-top with Anakin successfully managing to catch a falling Obi-Wan, and Anakin, moments later, diving headfirst through the city. He must have an excellent sense of timing, because judging from the distance he fell and the time it took him to get there, the vehicle he was jumping to was nowhere near the vicinity of them. And even if it was, it would have been long gone before Anakin could have even thought about jumping out.THE BAD POINTS Hayden Christensen was quite bad, more so in some scenes than others, but overall proved to be a bad choice. I didn't buy for one second that this is the kid who will become the fearsome Darth Vader just a couple years down the road. Perhaps if his murder of the Tusken Raiders had actually been shown (and not just the two we did see), it might have helped a little. His emotional scenes were unconvincing, as were his scenes with Natalie Portman, who was as dull as she was in EPISODE II. And why must her hairstyle\/wardrobe change with every scene? It really gets laughable after awhile, especially with that pseudo-dominatrix outfit during the fireside scene.The always-watchable Christopher Lee arrived too late in the film, doing what he could with Count Dooku, another underused role that should have been a lot more menacing than it was. A weak villain, though better than Darth Maul. Yoda fighting Dooku was one of most hysterical moments I've ever seen on film. Using the Force to block objects being thrown at him was good (reminiscent of the confrontation between Luke and Vader in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK), but once he started bouncing around like Jim Carrey in THE MASK with a lightsabre, the sequence instantly well apart. And Anakin going double-lightsabre on Dooku was rather annoying, something you would expect in a John Woo movie, not a STAR WARS movie.And when will filmmakers learn that humans riding on the backs of thrashing animals doesn't look at all convincing?

And I will reiterate a comment I made three years ago about that last film.  Why is it that, in a movie with `Star Wars' in its title, are there virtually no outer space battle scenes in this picture?  Is that really too much to ask?A few other problems plague the picture.  R2D2 and C-3PO, whose one-sided bantering lent such charm to the original films, have become virtual extras in the story by this time.

No longer do these two uniquely nonhuman characters feel like an integral part of the action.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"12 June 2002","score":"69 out of 127 people found the following review useful","review":"  Say what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for setting himself a difficult task in `Star Wars Attack of the Clones' (and I do mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly high expectations of his millions of fanatical followers).   By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do &#150; which is to risk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central `hero.'  After all, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy, we all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the irredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the requirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo, though he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous side to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his internal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side (certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is privy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind of poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a better job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more than a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time &#150; hardly either the `greatest Jedi knight' we keep being told he has the potential to become nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.   His romantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala are embarrassing at best.  We have indeed come a long way from the fun love triangle involving Luke, Han and the feisty Princess Leia.In fact, that seems to be the basic trouble with this film, as it was with the previous installment, `The Phantom Menace.'  Somewhere along the way, someone drained all the FUN out of `Star Wars.'  The first three films seemed so fresh, so adroit, so light on their feet.  The prequels, though they are not without interest, feel bloated, top heavy and devoid of any real conviction or excitement.  One cannot fault Lucas, I guess, for becoming overly fascinated with his matted backgrounds, computer graphics and special effects, but it does no one any good to have all that hardware whirling by in the background when the action in the foreground is so banal and uninteresting.  Even the set pieces here &#150; a flying car chase through a crowded city that defies all known laws of physics, a cluttered battle scene that takes place in a gladiatorial stadium &#150; don't get the adrenalin pumping in the same way that the space battles in the original `Star Wars,' the race through the forest in `Return of the Jedi' or even the pod race in `The Phantom Menace' did.  And I will reiterate a comment I made three years ago about that last film.  Why is it that, in a movie with `Star Wars' in its title, are there virtually no outer space battle scenes in this picture?  Is that really too much to ask?A few other problems plague the picture.  R2D2 and C-3PO, whose one-sided bantering lent such charm to the original films, have become virtual extras in the story by this time.  And since the rest of the script is so entirely witless, the few moments they have together stick out too much as obvious (and not very effective) attempts at comic relief.  No longer do these two uniquely nonhuman characters feel like an integral part of the action.  Even worse, the once endearing Yoda, with his annoyingly inverted sentences and his never-ending string of sanctimonious pearls of wisdom, has, quite literally, become this movie's Jar-Jar Binks (who does appear but in a much more limited role).  The acting by Hayden Christensen (Anakin), Natalie Portman , Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor (a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and who is going to believe that McGregor will mature to become the distinguished Alec Guiness?) is serviceable at best, as the performers have been put there basically to deliver the stilted dialogue and serve as foreground for the upstaging special effects.So, after all these complaints, is `Attack of the Clones' worth seeing?  Surprisingly, the answer is `yes' and it really has nothing to do with the special effects.   The reason this film is worth seeing is because Lucas has undertaken to pull off something virtually unique and unprecedented in modern cinema.  He is attempting to tell a complete story over the span of six different movies.  Even when we can see how the film isn't coming together the way it should, we can't help but plug into the narrative development itself.  Because we know how it will all end up, we want to see how the missing pieces of the puzzle will fall in to place to give us the complete, total picture.   So even if each individual installment doesn't exactly carry us away, there's enough interest in the vision itself to keep us coming back for more.
