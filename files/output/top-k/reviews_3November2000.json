Supposedly, Peter Farrelly also went to the same school as I and used it for the movie albeit with a name change.

This works against her though, because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails.Then again, this isn't really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films, Girlfight defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.Diana is doing poorly in school. She beats up people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she has no need to defend herself, nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche', yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl.

This movie seems to be a highly entertaining fusion of the X-Files, any given showing of the Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, and the very best elements of Tom Clancy's novels. This film has everything one could possibly want in a film.  There are spies and informants, conspiracies, murders, cover-ups, family conflicts, high-tech espionage, greed, world-wide deception, global disasters, corrupt businessmen, political intrigue, potential supernatural occurrences, very real spiritual happenings, wars in the air and on the ground, and wars in the hearts, minds, and souls of all involved.  With all of this, this film carries THE most significant message any film could possibly deliver.In an instant, millions of people all over the world disappear off the face of the planet.  The world's babies and newborns are gone as well as men and women of all ages.  Even some teenagers have vanished.  We are first exposed to this jarring event when dozens of people disappear on an international flight piloted by Capt. Rayford Steele. To his horror, Rayford discovers that his wife and son are among those missing.  Steele's daughter, Chloe, remains though, and together the two of them (along with others who were also left behind ) search for the answers to this cataclysmic turn of events.The Left Behind novel, on which this film is faithfully based, has been heralded as the best selling novel of ALL time, so it was just a matter of time until it would be made into a film.  The novel tells a story on a global scale and makes it personal and involves the reader in a way that other books are many times unable to do.  It is a huge story and must be told in a huge way.  The real task was for Cloud Ten Pictures to tell this large-scale story with a tiny  budget of $17.4 million.  Despite the extremely restrictive budget, the Canadian film company pulled off a miracle and was able to deliver much of the punch that the novel delivered.  The scriptwriters did change some plot\/character issues, but overall, the film remained quite faithful to the novel.  The only complaint  it was too short.  The filmmakers packed a lot of story in about a 100-minute film. I wish they could have been bold and given the film a longer running time to capture the full impact of the novel.  Perhaps the shoestring budget prevented them from doing so.  If that's the case, then the filmmakers are forgiven.This film has seen a limited  release on video first but is gearing up for a theatrical release on February 2, 2001.  The filmmakers wanted to get a grassroots push prior to the theatrical release to get people to see the film.  Specifically, the ones targeted for the push into the theaters are the people who have not read the novel, those not familiar with the series, people not typically interested in end of the world prophecies that are being fulfilled in today's world.  Even if you are fortunate enough to see this film on tape, see it in the theaters.  It will jump out and grab you with a power that only the big screen can provide.  Additionally, there are rumors that the theatrical release will have a different ending than presented on the video version.Rush to see this film.  The book is still the best experience, but I love the medium of film.  This is still a powerful film with the most important message a film has ever delivered.  Even if you don't agree with the message of the film, you still walk away thoroughly entertained and you will be left with images and ideas that will stay with you for a long time to come.

Not only was it a Julia Roberts Vehicle, but there was the extra insult of having it be a big novelty that she played a sorta white-trashy, tough-talking, skanky dressing character. Oh, what a departure! Then I read lots of great reviews from reviewers I trusted, and thought again.I don't think she gives an Oscar-worthy performance, but she did just fine in the role. Erin Brokovich is a single mother who may not have the best social skills, or fashion sense, but her heart is in the right place and she refuses to tolerate injustice when she sees it. Plus, I know how it feels to be in such a b*tchy mood that you can't help wanting to use the f-word in every sentence. She has mouths to feed at home, so she gets a job at a small law firm, and stumbles upon a situation where a large corporation has made a huge mistake, and is being weaselly trying to get out of it.The fact that this movie is based on a true story and the main character based on a real life person really helps. Part of what turned me off in the first place was the fact that I thought the filmmakers made Julia Robert's character dress really trampy just to get attention. Now, I do think they over-do it in parts-no intelligent woman walks around in public with 90% of their bra exposed. Dressing sexy is one thing, but in real life, women know better than to wear a top that is so hideously mismatched with a bra that you like like you were dressed by a blind person. Also, the main character is not perfect- though her cursing is entertaining, she goes too far in some cases. We all have felt like using 4 -letter words to some of the people we word with to their face, but adults don't do this on a regular basis-or if they do, they are looking for a new job very quickly.

I am sure this is a common occurrence in the middle of the Atlantic. Let's see, its PG-13 so anyone with half a brain can't figure out the whole good-guy-vs-bad-guy thing. Such an obvious plot device to sway our opinion is a sign of poor writing. It was WW2 for pete's sake. We know who we were fighting ! As the crocodile hunter would say Craiky !

Set on a bus bound for Washington D.C., this film examines the problems and opinions of various of black men on racial issues in the 90's.Family, misogyny, homosexuality, religion, violence, education, and economics are all addressed here as well as other issues.  Spike does not only shed light on issues that pertain to black peoples involvement in White America, but the film also attacks color-consciousness among light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks (as he did in School Daze).  Like School Daze, this may be the only other Spike Lee film that seems to be aimed directly at Black America, and Spike shows the varying degrees of complexity with his cast of characters.  There is a rage-filled actor, a homosexual couple in the midst of separating (one out-and-proud, the other closeted), a sensitive cop, a level-headed family man, a gangbanger turned Sunni Muslim, a naive filmmaker, and a tired, defeated elderly man.  There is also an estranged father who sees the March as an opportunity to re-connect with his resentful, bound-for-crime teenage son.  His son has been recently convicted of burglary and has been ordered to remain chained to his father for 48 hours, the irony of which does not escape the other members on the bus.Given the film is almost set entirely on a bus, Spike restrains himself in dispensing out his evolving camera and editing styles, using only a brief sequence set in a desert to bleach the screen with a heavy yellow tint. Many Spike Lee regulars are in the film, like Ossie Davis and Isaiah Washington who give sound performances (Davis' I lost everything monologue is especially moving).  The real notable acting is provided by Andre Braugher as an angry, egocentric actor whose rage is fortunately balanced for him with a healthy dose of articulated intelligence and Roger Guenever Smith as a sensitive, bi-racial cop who works in South Central Los Angeles. Those two really are the stand-outs in this film.The dialogue is so flowing and casual in this film despite its topic matter, that you could listen to this film instead of watch it!

I feel like they missed the whole message for the few instances that might seem incredible to believe (the forest for the trees?).  Who cares?Sometimes a good movie isn't about the acting quality, or the director's vision -- it's about the MESSAGE.  I think sometimes you have to just judge a movie or book with your HEART and listen to that INNER WISDOM.  Forget about the technicalities!  Who cares if it is filled with cliches and emotionalism?  Sometimes that is what it takes to grab our hearts and help us to identify.  Look at the message!  Use movies like this as an opportunity for growth (yeah, yeah... I'm sounding like Oprah and some of her guests, but they've got a lot of wisdom and insight...)  Sometimes it's the little things we do in life that matter most!  I think that is the general point to this movie.I think most people who trash this film are people who are generally in a hopeless negative headspace who believe the world is totally screwed up and there is NO GOOD anywhere.  They would be the least likely people to do something nice for someone -- just because.  (I make this statement based on the comments they've made about the movie.  I have yet to meet anyone that I know -- who are good, loving individuals -- who didn't love this movie.)I think the people who like this movie are generally good people who truly want to see change in the world we live in.  This movie gives you hope that such a thing is possible with very little effort from yourself.  Out of the mouth of babes...  The whole thought that if someone does a random act of kindness for you, you have to just pay it forward and do 3 acts of kindness to someone ELSE.I'd recommend it highly and all 4 of us -- the 3 PhD's and a non -- would definitely see it again.  We felt it's one of the better movies we've seen this year -- just on it's message alone!
