This was the most pathetic pile of incoherent tripe that I ever had the misfortune of seeing, and I have seen a lot of bad movies. There is absolutely no plot of any kind, the acting is completely uninspired and unmemorable, and the story is... well, I would like to say absurd but that might possibly give you a misleading positive impression. The story is simply retarded.If this movie were about the adventures of a newly hired repo man taking other people's cars and running away, it might have been mildly entertaining, a light flick with car chases to help a boring afternoon pass sooner. But suddenly we have dead aliens(?!), some car with some radiation in the trunk which kills people and eventually gives it the ability to fly (no, I'm not making this up!), and several apparently conflicting government agencies hunting after it, with absolutely no sense to it all.This might look like I'm simplifying it too much, but really, that's all there is to it. It's a vapid pointless non-story about nothing at all.Many of the reviews here seem to idolize it as some sort of punk-rock anthem, imbuing it with a kind of coming-of-age symbolism, or claiming the absurdness is supposed to be off-beat or zany, and that you should watch this movie stoned.Believe me, no amount of chemicals can make this movie even remotely watchable. If you want a trippy movie, go watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or something. There is nothing particularly punk rock about this movie, aside from the generic angry teenager stereotype, nor does it have any other vaguely redeeming qualities. There is nothing funny, deep, or sci-fi about this movie. It's pure, concentrated, seizure-inducing BOREDOM.People who watched it as kids in the 80's seem to have some nostalgic feelings towards it, and that might probably explain their misguided scores\/reviews.If you've never seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and stay as far away from it as possible.

They even stated that this was probably the best World War II movie ever. I'm quite familiar with that kind of movies and I've already seen a big part of them, classics as well as new ones. The most impressive ones I already have in my private DVD collection (Saving Private Ryan, Patton, The Longest Day, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Cross of Iron,...), but I must say that these quotes really made me curious about this movie. On the other hand I didn't want to buy it before seeing it first, because I'm a marketeer myself and I'm all too familiar with good promo talk. They promise you heaven, but in the end you remain with your two feet on the ground while being very disappointed. Now that it was shown on television, I could finally watch it for myself and make up my own opinion about it.Even though The Big Red One is a WWII movie, it starts in the trenches of WWI. It's November 11 in 1918, just after 11 o'clock in the morning, when a German comes out of his trench and says to the surprised American soldier that the war is over. Of course he doesn't believe him and he immediately kills him. After taking the insignia with a red one on it from the man's uniform he returns to his own trench, only to hear that the war is really over and that he has murdered a man (during a war it's called killing, after and before one it's called murder). Almost 25 years later, he's back as a soldier, this time in WWII. He made it to sergeant and now leads a rifle squad in the same division in which he served during WWI, the First Infantry. They get their first battle experience when they invade the by Vichy France occupied Northern Africa. From there on they go to Sicily, France (Omaha Beach on D-Day), Belgium, Germany and Czechoslovakia. As they make their way through Africa and Europe, only five men, including the sergeant, seem to be able to survive. The others are replaced by new, anonymous soldiers who the 'veterans' don't want to know too much about because they will die soon anyway...If you want to know what to expect from this movie, than I believe that you have to see it as some kind of combination of Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day... But don't get me wrong. I wouldn't compare it to any of these movies and there are two reasons for that first of all was it created with a much smaller budget than those other movies and the second reason is that I don't think that any movie deserves to be compared and analyzed with another movie in the back of your mind. I'm convinced that every movie deserves to be seen on its own. Now that you know this, I can give you my opinion about the positive and negative sides of this movie.There is only one thing that really bothered me in this movie. They sometimes didn't take the time to fully develop all the possibilities a certain part of the story offered. Too many times I had the feeling that certain scenes had been cut in half, that they didn't stay long enough to fully tell the story about what happened in each country. And yes, I saw the long, restored version of the movie, so that can't be the problem. Also somewhat difficult for me was the use of an American Sherman instead of a German tank, but I'm willing to see past that for once because this wasn't the most important and interesting part of the movie. This movie deserves to be seen because it was one of the first war movies that didn't just rely on showing all the battle scenes and that didn't stay on one location, but followed a group of soldiers on their tour of duty while having big interest in the character of the man behind the gun and not just in his capability to fight. This is one of the few classic war movies that has taken its time to fully develop its characters and I truly believe that the viewers should pay more attention to that. What I also appreciated was that Sam Fuller, even though it's obvious that he couldn't make use of a big budget, was still able to make such a powerful movie out of it. The emotions are real, the fact that the veterans didn't pay much attention to the new-comers because they didn't want to lose another friend is the way it really was, the quiet sergeant who has to 'fight' against the will of some of his soldiers,... It all works.In the end this may not be the best WWII ever, many will be disappointed by the small scale of the battle scenes for instance, but when it comes to character development Sam Fuller sure didn't have to learn a lesson. Also the fact that the scenery in the movies was pretty accurate (Take for instance the part in the Ardennes in Belgium, where there were real pine trees, green hills,... instead of the olive trees and a sandy desert shown in The Battle of the Bulge), that the Americans too got killed and weren't some kind of supermen who could kill an entire German battalion with only three men and two rifles, made this movie a lot better than some other 'classics'. I really liked this movie and I'm sure that I'll buy it when I get the chance to find the fully restored version (probably called the director's cut or something like that).

Also watch out for references to STRAW DOGS , THE SHINING and NOSFERATU at the climax Even if you're burned out on those 90s stalker from hell thrillers you could do worse than watch this on a wet Friday evening ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"3 September 2005","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Scream starts with Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) receiving a phone call which she puts down to a wrong number, however the caller keeps ringing her back each time becoming increasingly hostile & threatening.

A fine film it is too. The script by Kevin Williamson plays around with all the slasher film clichés in a witty self referential sort of way. Scream is bursting at the seams with all the horror film in-jokes & homages, most people could probably watch Scream two or three times & still not spot them all. Like the horror film lover character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who knows all the traditional slasher rules & plays them to the hilt like if your a virgin in a horror film you die. The dialogue also pokes fun at the genre in an affectionate way like when the killer mentions going outside by oneself to investigate a strange noise as being stupid! It's great fun for horror fans, like myself, to try & spot all the references & mentions other classic horrors get. I thought the mystery element was great, Scream has plenty of red herrings & I was never sure who the killer was right up until the final effective reveal which is quite clever although the motive behind the murders is somewhat shallow & hardly surprising. I thought Scream dragged a little from after Casey was murdered for the next 40 odd minutes as no one dies at all, this witty & hip dialogue is all well & good to entertain up to a point but I would have liked a little more action as well. Technically Scream is as good as one could hope for on a relatively small $15,000,000 budget, director Craven creates some good set pieces & effective sequences especially the opening, the cinematography is very good, the music incorporates horror themes into itself particularly Halloween (1978) & as a whole Scream has that Hollywood polish about it. The violence & gore is restrained, a few stabbings & shootings plus Steven's guts spilling out at the start is about it, a little disappointing actually. The young attractive cast do a good job, Campbell makes for a likable enough 'scream queen' for the 90's & Ulrich is great & has a cold emotionless look on occasion that coupled with is boyish good looks you are never quite sure if he's telling the truth or not, Arquette makes for a suitably goofy deputy & Cox is perfectly cast as the bitchy reporter, in reality after meeting each other on Scream Arquette & Cox later married. The sequel Sream 2 (1997) reunites all the surviving cast members & is also well worth watching if you enjoyed this. Overall Scream is a great horror film that has to some extent reinvented the genre & just about deserves it's already classic status although I have slight reservations about it's slow pace at times which is my only complaint with it as a whole. An absolute must for horror fans & definitely worth a watch for more general audiences too although some of the horror film humour may pass you by. Still, highly recommend!

We instantly know it is a dark and sinister thriller which will haunt you throughout the movie, but is carefully hidden in the beautiful countryside of Stepford. The silent opening credits is also rather eerie.Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss are both excellent in their roles not to mention beautiful! Both were prefect choices for their roles, although It'd be interesting to see Susan Sarandon playing the role of Joanna, as she was originally scheduled to play the role.

Let's see you got the Wrestling Jock, The Prom queen,The trouble maker,the brain and the princess, all very 5 unique characters, all put together on a Saturday in a detention hall, in my opinion that is quite a unique premise, and John Hughes pulls it off perfectly, plus Judd Nelson cracked me up throughout the film, the only thing that bugged me was we never did get to hear the rest of his joke!. I found the closet scene quite powerful, as Gleason (Principal Vernon), delivered some harsh words for Judd (John Bender), as it also has some other great emotional moments as well, plus it leaves the viewer thinking a lot after the movie is finished.What i also liked is how all of the 4 characters constantly made Principal Vernon look like a fool (the toilet paper scene for example!), and how they always defied his orders, plus, each character had there own problems, and i really enjoyed hearing the stories all the characters told!. My favorite character had to be Bender, he was just simply put hilarious, and while i didn't agree with some of the things he said and did, more often then not he had me cracking up with laughter, and i always wondered if they would remain friends if this were to be a real story, plus i loved the scene when Bender keeps getting more detentions. This is simply put a masterpiece in all aspects John Hughes is a genius, and if you haven't seen it, i demand you go see it right this instant, you won't regret it!.The Direction is wonderful!.John Hughes does a wonderful job here, with fantastic camera work, and just keeping the film at an extremely fast pace!.The Acting is amazing!. Emilio Estevez is fantastic here, yes he is a jock but a very likable one with feelings, and you really care for his character and feel what he is going through, he also had some classic scenes with Judd Nelson, i loved him!

Molly Ringwald is awesome as the prom queen, she is beautiful, and had a great personality i liked her lots. Paul Gleason is fantastic as the asshole Principal, while i hated him, he was extremely good at it, he was especially good in the closet scene, and had some powerful lines!.Ally Sheedy is wonderful here, i loved her character, and was my 2nd favorite next to Bender's she is also very fascinating and quite beautiful!, i loved her.

This is not and never will be a Godzilla film. This was Hollywood yet again taking a name and using it for nothing more then profit. Or lack there of. Recent films and TV used for name value have also proved to be pure failures or garbage such as Garfield, The Honeymooners (maybe the worst), Kojack, The Manchurian Candidate, Charlie and the Chocolate factory and to many to mention here. If anything it is a poor rip-off of many films, including The Beast from 20,000 fathoms, that was done much better back in the day.Godzilla starts out in south pacific with French nuclear testing that mutates some islands and some iguanas at the same time. Years later some Japanese fisherman are attacked and their boat sunk. Devlin had to throw in the Japanese fisherman scene to have more than just the Godzilla name to his creature......it didn't work. Soon a monster is spotted near the Panama canal and they call in a bumbling worm scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Broderick) who is also an expert on atomic energy. After looking at a big footprint he concludes that its a big mutated iguana. It heads north to New York where it makes its appearance and runs through the city for the rest of the movie. The military somehow can't manage to find the creature (yeah I'll buy that) and when they do, they fail miserably to even hurt it. Watch as advanced weapons seemingly miss this creature and hit major buildings in NY. Dr. Nick discovers that the beast is pregnant and is going to make a nest. Dr. Nick soon runs into his old flame Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) a wannabe reporter who is a failure and eventually back stabs Dr. Nick, taking a top secret video for her breaking evening news report.

I had know through G-Fan since 1996 that this film would be garbage and it was confirmed as more time went by and pictures were revealed of this so called Godzilla. This is not a Godzilla film in any way, but just a badly written generic monster flick that seems to rip off many films while ruining the legend from Japan. This was one of the most hyped films of 1998 and yet I knew it would fail and it did. Devlin had claimed how Godzilla would be far superior and better than the old one. How is that, by running away from the military, not having his trademark radioactive ray, being killed with one rocket and laying eggs? A complete disgrace. The design wasn't all that bad for a creature, but not Godzilla. From the script to the acting, almost everything in this film is just awful. The acting is really bad, the blonde cant act and Broderick is not only terrible, but plays a really stupid scientist that one can't possibly believe would be smart enough to be in the position he is in and defeat this creature. I was surprised that Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer didn't start spouting Simpsons lines halfway through the film. Also, the American military is a complete failure when trying to kill or find the creature. How about follow the foot prints? Through out the movie there are many attempts at humor that fail on all levels. When watching this film, you'll find that much of it is joke, not that the concept is that serious, but the Original Godzilla was somewhat. The script and dialog are terrible, along with a movie that is much to long and relies heavily on movies of the past for ideas. Godzilla (obviously), the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, Jurassic Park, and a little of Kong at the end. Devlin and them ripped of War of the Worlds to make Independence Day. That worked out well I thought, but they failed miserably with Godzilla. The only area I give some credit to in this film are some of the special effects. I am not a fan of CGI by any means, but they were not bad in this film. Even today the CGI in this film holds up to more recent films that have been made. Although that's not saying much. Overall this is a poor film on almost all levels and was a opportunity squandered by Hollywood on what should have been a true Godzilla film. Overall 1 stars out of 10 stick to the Japanese version. Avoid the album as well its infamous for Puff Daddy destroying the legendary Led Zeppelin song Kashmir.

And by empowered, I mean a woman who instead of doing the sensible, ordinary, common sense thing of handing her husband to the police, decides to become a female James Bond and lays the smack down on her husband's candyass. Of course, J-Lo has her reasons for this, but none of the reasons make any sense. According to her, she can't go to the police because her husband is powerful. Well, he owns a construction company &#150; he's hardly the President of the United States. Another reason is that he has powerful connections. Well, he has one (one!) friend in the police force. Yeah, judges will be quaking in their boots and the entire police force will be moved to such an extent that they'll close ranks and engage in a nationwide conspiracy because one copper has a mate who doesn't like his wife. And another reason is that she believes that her husband will win custody of her child.This last reason is the most ridiculous. There's one scene where her husband threatens her best friend, her 'dad' (he's not her biological father, but he brought her up) and another friend&#133;with a gun! What judge, with three solid witnesses to back her up, would hand the kid over to the husband? Answer no judge in the world. And the husband doesn't make any sense either. When he's threatening everyone with a gun, he says that he can get away with killing them. He says he'll pretend it was dark. So he's going to pretend that he killed his wife's best friend, his wife's 'father' and another bloke purely by accident? But his wife was there too, as well as his child, so to get away with this master plan, he'd have to kill them too. I know there are a lot of accidental gun deaths in America, but that's kind of stretching things.But it wasn't meant to be this way. This was meant to be a dream marriage. I mean, there you are, a tough but kind waitress (she helps babies!) who doesn't believe in giving her real name to customers (even though nothing in her past suggests that she should be wary of men &#150; her ex is an obscenely decent guy) and you meet a guy who threatens another guy. What do you do? Why, you marry him of course! So in five seconds she's married. Then she has a kid. But then, when the kid is about four years old, the husband decides to become a psychopath. Is it possible to hide your psychosis from your spouse for half a decade? Well, we are talking about J-Lo here. All she wants to do is have some fun! (As the title music illustrates) She certainly doesn't pay attention to her husband's mental state. She's just content that she can give up being a waitress and become a fat, lazy, wealthy soccer mom. Life is good&#133;until hubbie starts beating her. Oh, the sympathy that comes gushing forth as we immerse ourselves in her plight. Isn't it terrible to have a husband that no longer wants to spend any time with you? Isn't it terrible that you're absolutely loaded? Most women would kill for that! I'm being facetious, but the moronic way that the film trivialises domestic abuse and serves it up as bottom grade entertainment deserves nothing but contempt.And how can I feel sympathy for J-Lo's character? She's irredeemably stupid (that she's heard of Finnegan's Wake is hilariously far-fetched). Just take the way she tries to leave her husband. She attempts to leave in the middle of the night, while he's asleep next to her. Why didn't she leave while he was at work, or while he was having sex with one of his tarts? Because the character's stupid, and because the film's stupid. It's just a clichéd attempt to try and build tension. And isn't it awfully convenient that J-Lo's real dad is fabulously wealthy? I'm sure most abused women have one of those lurking around somewhere. But J-Lo on the run is really an excuse for her to wear lots of wigs and so she can kit herself out in poor-chic outfits. Look at how her husband has debased her.And then there's the kid. What a sickeningly cute moppet she is. Really, they must have picked the most annoying, irritating, high-pitched kid they could find. Why the husband would want custody of her, I don't know. He should be glad she's gone. But the worst kid moments are during the car chase. She continually screams Mommy! at the top of her lungs. It's intolerable. And the kid does look genuinely scared. I don't know what they did to get her reactions, but they worked. Perhaps they played her J-Lo's latest album&#133; The worst thing of all though is the ending. In the space of a few martial arts lessons, she goes from being an ex-waitress to Jane Bond. All of a sudden she can plant traps, disable electronic equipment and kick ass. Yeah, as if I believe a waitress, after a handful of lessons, can kick the ass of a man twice her size. It's stupid. As is her reasoning. After breaking into his house she thinks she can plead self-defence. Oh, and she plants letters in his drawers so that she can set him up for something or other. Only she tells him. D'oh! Now he can burn the letters that she managed to get his fingerprints on. If only hubbie could beat her up. But now he can't. He's lost the power. So J-Lo kills him.

She's just content that she can give up being a waitress and become a fat, lazy, wealthy soccer mom. Life is good&#133;until hubbie starts beating her. Oh, the sympathy that comes gushing forth as we immerse ourselves in her plight. Isn't it terrible to have a husband that no longer wants to spend any time with you? Isn't it terrible that you're absolutely loaded? Most women would kill for that! I'm being facetious, but the moronic way that the film trivialises domestic abuse and serves it up as bottom grade entertainment deserves nothing but contempt.And how can I feel sympathy for J-Lo's character? She's irredeemably stupid (that she's heard of Finnegan's Wake is hilariously far-fetched). Just take the way she tries to leave her husband. She attempts to leave in the middle of the night, while he's asleep next to her. Why didn't she leave while he was at work, or while he was having sex with one of his tarts? Because the character's stupid, and because the film's stupid. It's just a clichéd attempt to try and build tension. And isn't it awfully convenient that J-Lo's real dad is fabulously wealthy? I'm sure most abused women have one of those lurking around somewhere. But J-Lo on the run is really an excuse for her to wear lots of wigs and so she can kit herself out in poor-chic outfits. Look at how her husband has debased her.And then there's the kid. What a sickeningly cute moppet she is. Really, they must have picked the most annoying, irritating, high-pitched kid they could find. Why the husband would want custody of her, I don't know. He should be glad she's gone. But the worst kid moments are during the car chase. She continually screams Mommy! at the top of her lungs. It's intolerable. And the kid does look genuinely scared. I don't know what they did to get her reactions, but they worked. Perhaps they played her J-Lo's latest album&#133; The worst thing of all though is the ending. In the space of a few martial arts lessons, she goes from being an ex-waitress to Jane Bond. All of a sudden she can plant traps, disable electronic equipment and kick ass. Yeah, as if I believe a waitress, after a handful of lessons, can kick the ass of a man twice her size. It's stupid. As is her reasoning. After breaking into his house she thinks she can plead self-defence. Oh, and she plants letters in his drawers so that she can set him up for something or other. Only she tells him. D'oh! Now he can burn the letters that she managed to get his fingerprints on. If only hubbie could beat her up. But now he can't. He's lost the power. So J-Lo kills him. What garbage.(By the way, the film also includes helpful captions like 'Hey' and 'How They Met' just in case you're too stupid to follow what's going on.)

Rob \/ Lane is 15 years older, has a job, but still struggling with relationships. The movies are strikingly similar -- music plays a key role in both; Cusack's character is dumped at the beginning; he finds true love at the end (albeit in BOD with a different person); there's a hodgepodge of bizarre supporting characters that move in and out of the story with, in the end, Rob \/ Lane and his true love being the only ones that are anything close to normal. There are differences, also, of course -- Rob speaks directly to the audience throughout, something Lane never does. For that reason, HF is a heavier film -- more drama, more black comedy, versus BOD with its lighter comedy bordering on slapstick at times, and dramatic elements which are present primarily in the background. Then there's the constant profanity, again perhaps inevitable, but an obvious difference.Even without making the comparison (unfortunately, for me every Cusack role ends up being inevitably compared to BOD), HF is still rather rough around the edges. Granted, it will have meaning to many, but I found myself halfway through being grateful that I got married young and don't have to worry about all this serial dating \/ relationship nonsense. Cusack is about my age, so I look at his roles as portraying people my age. I got married at 22 and have never regretted it; the idea of cohabitation with multiple partners without any sense of security of stability is therefore entirely foreign to me. Again, it probably means something to other people in my age group, but I'm personally glad I missed out on all that.My other criticism, alluded to earlier, is that this really isn't a comedy. I don't think I laughed once. On the DVD, I watched the trailer after seeing the movie and laughed out loud. The trailer is a thousand times funnier than the movie itself (and, in fact, contains several scenes that aren't in the final cut, while misrepresenting other scenes).

It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word credit mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, the desperation of a woman facing forty. And Heche doesn't project anxiety the way Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. In the original, the officer asks, Is there something wrong? Leigh Of course not. Am I acting as if something were wrong? The officer hesitates before replying Well, frankly, yes. That exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche isn't nervous enough.The worst change, without a doubt, is the substitution of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins is twitchy, bird-like, long-necked, cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. His every move (eating candy corn, with his adam's apple bobbing) and every utterance, the faint laugh, the arid chuckle, is spot on. He just can't be improved upon. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired beefy guy who was just discharged as a Lance Corporal from the U. S. Army. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word fallacy because it resembles phallus.) He could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to UCLA.The direction deserves a few comments. I don't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while peeping in on Anne Heche. I don't OBJECT to it. I wonder why it's there, just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there.And, I suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche is given underwear of all different colors -- green, pink, orange, and -- mango? Is that a color? If so, what the hell color is it? Never mind. The point is that in the original, when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the Phoenix hotel it captures Janet Leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later, after she has stolen the money, we see her in her underwear again -- this time both her slip and bra are black. Tis a small thing, but Hitch's own.At that, the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black-and-white shooting of the original was superb. The color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary, dull, and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of Las Vegas.Most of all, the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. I can remember seeing it in a drive-in in San Diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD -- half-way through the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before.That murder in the shower, in both movies, was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way, in which the author writes something like, The murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife. I'm not making that up. Well, not entirely. Even here, Van Sant's movie gives us excess. There is more blood and more bare flesh. And where Hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to Marian's blankly open eye, then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face, he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical, giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder, but a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. He practically twirls it on its axis.It won't do to call this a bow to Hitchcock because it's not. It's a pecuniary plundering of Hitchcock's material (already ripped off in Psycho I, II, III, IV, and Psycho The Beginning Years, and Come Into My Parlor Mrs. Bates' Revenge, and Hand Me That Knife, Would You? The TRUE story of Norman Bates.) A rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff, a crumenal act if not a criminal one. And that's not to mention the many homages in other films, especially the French, such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much-admired La Mere de la Nuit. (Maybe I'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when a chicken's guts grind corn, it's a crumenal act. I won't go on except to say these gags, shabby as they are, are more fun than the movie.)So who was it made for? I'd have to guess.

It's Friday the 13th, for crying out loud! ANY change in the direction of the series is welcome at this point. It seems as if the fans have forgotten how 'winded' the Jason series had become - after the absolute dregs of the series in Jason Goes To Hell, Jason Takes Manhattan and The New Breed, the series' creators were not just beating a dead horse, they were dragging it around the track behind a tractor. Jason X at least tries to give the horse a jolt with the defibrillator. In spite of the 2nd rate effects, and general silliness, the 10th film in the series has visual energy and freshness that has been missing for at least a decade. The characters are all stereotypes, but they are GOOD stereotypes in new, snazzy 'futuristic' costumes, and they get to use snazzy new assault rifles and hologram projectors and stuff to fight back. It doesn't work of course, and Jason still kicks everybody's butt, but the change in atmosphere and sets does rescue the film from the tedious dread of previous installments. There is some actual levity and some winking tribute to some of the classic conventions of earlier films (such as when Jason beats one camper to death with another one, but it's OK because they are holograms). And Jason gets a 'new look' in the middle of the film. It doesn't really add that much to the character, but again, at least it is different enough to help you 'see' the character again after decades of over-familiarity.

Many U.S. soldiers were killed, but most of them were mortally wounded. That's where the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, or MASH, units came in. Army doctors and nurses worked round the clock to help our wounded men. On one fine day, a sharp, brash, young Army doctor, Captain Hawkeye Pierce, arrives in Korea. He was assigned to the 4077th M*A*S*H unit. He encounters a very rude C.O., as well as another brash young doctor, Duke Forrest. Together, they borrow a Jeep and head south to the 4077th. The camp is run by Lt. Col. Henry Blake, who right away grew suspicious of his new surgeons. Hawkeye and Duke meet an assortment of wacky characters Blake's clairvoyant clerk Radar O'Reilly, Lt. Leslie, Pvt. Lorenzo Boone, and the chaplain, Father John Dago Red Mulcahy. Duke and Hawk also meet their new roommate, Major Frank Burns, who was a few beers short of a six-pack; The O.R. was always a bustle with wounded coming in at all hours. Hawkeye and Duke really knew their way around a human body. The next day they request that Henry get them a new roommate, and Henry managed to come through, so Frank left and in came Trapper John McIntyre, a loner out of Alaska; In Post-Op, one of Frank's patients died and he blamed it on Boone. Trapper John greeted Frank with a punch to the head. Henry placed Trapper under tent arrest.An attractive head nurse arrived at camp, Major Margaret O'Houlihan. She and Major Burns hit it right off. That night while they do the naughty business, Radar places a microphone under the bed while Hawkeye tampered with the P.A. system so the entire camp heard Margaret and Frank making whoopee; Hawkeye couldn't help but tease a humiliated Frank, who attacked him. After that, Frank was carted off to the funny farm; Captain Walter Painless Pole Waldowski was in a mess. He was a well equipt dentist and on this day, he was depressed, as well as impotent. He wanted to commit suicide, but Hawkeye had a plan to help change his mind. It involved a black capsule placebo and a very attractive nurse; Life around M*A*S*H can be pretty boring, so Hawkeye, Duke, Trapper, and the guys had to make their own fun. They did so by pulling away the wall to the women's shower and seeing Margaret in her birthday suit. She went screaming to Blake, but he could care less; Hawkeye and Trapper are chosen to go to Tokyo and help a congressman's son. They cause an uproar at the ward, take in a golf game, and return.General Charlie Hammond visits the 4077 camp. He is an avid football fan, which gave Hawkeye an idea they form their own football team, plus they send for the ultimate ringer Captain Oliver Harmon Spearchucker Jones. He got his nickname not because of his race, but because he used to throw the javelin. The game was on. Gen. Hammond's team was in the lead, but after half-time, when they brought in Spearchucker, the M*A*S*H team mopped the floor with them. Finally, the game was over. M*A*S*H won by three points; Before long, orders came to Henry Blake, stating that Hawkeye and Duke could go home. Needless to say they were overjoyed. Hawkeye bid a heartfelt fare well to Trapper, then he and Duke board the same Jeep they came in, and headed North.Well, what can I say about M*A*S*H? It's a good movie. A very good movie, but it's also very weird. It was made in the very late '60s and early '70s, and it reflects the culture of that era. It seems more like the Vietnam War than the Korean War. I wonder why they chose the latter? Vietnam would've made more sense. Donald Sutherland is Hawkeye Pierce, Elliott Gould is Trapper John, Tom Skerritt is Duke Forrest, Sally Kellerman is Margaret O'Houlihan, Robert Duvall is Frank Burns, Roger Bowen is Henry Blake, Gary Burghoff is Radar, and Rene Auberjonois is Father Dago Red Mulcahy. All very good in their roles ; As you know, in 1972, M*A*S*H became a hit TV series which ran 11 years. Gary Burghoff is the only actor from the movie to also star on the TV show. Alan Alda plays Hawkeye, Wayne Rogers plays Trapper, MacLean Stevenson plays Blake, now here's something ironic MacLean Stevenson died February 15, 1996 from a heart attack, and the very next day Roger Bowen died of the same thing. Everyone else is alive and well, except G. Wood who passed on in 2000; Many actors got their starts in this movie. It's directed by Robert Altman who had a tendency to make bizarre movies. He also directed Popeye in 1980, a very good movie. Anyway, if you're in the mood for a comical war movie, I recommend M*A*S*H, but it isn't an action movie. You want a war action movie, rent Patton. M*A*S*H is a realistic depiction of Army hospitals in wartime. If you like Robert Altman or the M*A*S*H TV series or if you've never seen it, then by all means see M*A*S*H The Movie. It's funny, it's serious, it's weird. I think people of this generation may not get this movie, but those who were alive during the Vietnam War will enjoy it the most. Rated PG for bad language, violence, and nudity. There was also a Rated R version, which wasn't much different. See M*A*S*H today.
