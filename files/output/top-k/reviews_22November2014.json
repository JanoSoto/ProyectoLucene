For example, in Shadow of a Doubt the viewer is asked to believe that a strong athletic Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) is somehow outmaneuvered by his young niece (Theresa Wright) into a situation whereby he falls off a train trying to kill her. Or how about all the machinations Ray Milland goes through in Dial M For Murder to get his wife Grace Kelly's key to their apartment when he could have just gone out and had one made from his own.What you have in Spellbound is an amnesiac portrayed by Gregory Peck who doesn't know who he is, has tortuous thoughts of possibly killing someone, and subsequently assumes that man's identity to take the head position at a psychiatric institution. Now I don't really know how amnesia affects someone other than loss of memory, but how is it that John Ballantine (Peck) shows up at Green Manors to impersonate Dr. Edwardes in the first place? See what I mean? Getting beyond all that, I guess you could say that Spellbound eventually gets off the ground as a fairly intriguing story, particularly in the second half when Ballantine and Dr. Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) make their way to the home of Dr. Alex Brulov (Michael Chekhov) and he puts both characters through their paces. Chekhov is particularly direct with Dr. Petersen, finding fault with her personal involvement in a patient and willingness to overlook the inconsistencies in Ballantine's behavior - We are speaking of a schizophrenic, and not a valentine.Where the story really held my interest was the build up to and eventual interpretation of the Dali dream sequence wherein Dr. Petersen finally confronts Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll) about his involvement with the death of Edwardes. That's the kind of stuff that earned Hitchcock his nickname as the Master of Suspense. But did it strike anyone else as odd that Murchison hung around at Green Manors after he 'retired'? Or that most of the other doctors on the staff looked even older than he did? Just wondering.A couple of other interesting components of the film for me - I was really struck by the creative camera work used to view through the bottom of the milk glass when Brulov drugged Ballantine. And at the finale when Murchison realized the jig was up and offed himself, I wasn't quite sure I saw what I saw with that momentary flash of red and had to play it back to be sure. That was really very cool.But you know what was really incredible? It seems there was a time when you could take a train from New York City to Philadelphia for $3.39 (plus tax of course)!

That is what the premise of this movie is, because there is nothing different as what the remake did. So, with that said, I thought The Karate Kid is a fine coming of age martial arts movie. It is not my favorite John G. Avildsen movie as much as I love his other movie Rocky, but that is just me. Avildsen does a great on directing the movie as what he does, when he is telling a story and knowing where to point the camera at. I thought the performance between Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita both have a great chemistry with each other, and they are both Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi. Elisabeth Shue does fine as the love interest, but it doesn't go well when her character becomes a cop out in the second movie which I will talk about that later. Robert Mark Kamen's script is extremely well written, and I thought he written really well on how to develop a great story and characters. Bill Conti's score is just as great as what he did with Rocky; although I like his music in Rocky more. The fight scenes in the movie is very well choreographed as what the remake did in its own way as the movie is more on Karate as the remake is more on Kung-Fu. Some parts of the movie are slow, which they should have cut a few minutes of scenes to keep the pacing going along. Nevertheless, I was still keeping interest.

I do know that Mikhail Kalatozov's I Am Cuba is Mike Leigh's third favourite movie, so on that undeniable recommendation, I had to see for myself. The film dramatises the country's urgent need for revolution, as political oppression stirs great discrepancies in the communities. It's formed of four allegorical vignettes, covering many war- torn scenarios; a Cuban woman who sleeps with Americans to make a living, a farmer whose land is taken from him, a rebellious student who rises up against the oppression, and another farmer who realises the only way to get peace is to fight for it after his land is blown apart. Even though characters are clearly symbolic of class divides, ideologies, religions and cultures, Kalatozov's approach still leads it to being an actor's playground, as they tackle tough moral dilemmas and impossible problems often without dialogue.Although it often breaches melodrama, they're always deeply tender. Admittedly, the characters are superficial, obvious regarding what they stand for and too fleetingly presented to get under their skin, but the film manages to conjure the stomp of a nation with its network of active characters. What's most notable about I Am Cuba is the sensational dizzying cinematography. It's constantly mobile, hand-held, with a distorted lens, and it often opts for Dutch angles. But there are some improbable camera moves that made my jaw drop as the camera passes stories and through buildings and across streets. Even in black and white, it has such a hot suffocating atmosphere and captures such tension in the air. Paired with the abrasive music, it's an utterly remarkable experience. This is the type of film i would've fallen head over heels for just a few years ago - now I'm a little more reserved, but consider me floored for I Am Cuba.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2014","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't know much about Cuba.

Plot In A Paragraph A long time a go in a galaxy far, far away a classic tale of good vs evil is being played out, After the rebels have been overpowered by the Empire on their new base, Luke Skywalker takes advanced Jedi training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader.What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? The story is filled with the standard elements, (love, betrayal, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it has a twist ending you'd never get away with in this day and age (the age of spoilers on the internet) I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. When I first saw this as a kid, I was so excited to see it, but I hated the downbeat ending with what happened to Luke and Han Solo, and even recall being bored. And even now over thirty years later, I still remember how disappointed I was, even if I appreciate it for it's part in the story. But It feels bloated and over long, it seriously drags during the 50 mins - 1 hr 25 mark, I checked my watch and could not believe it had only been on an hour, It felt much longer. Now that's out of the way.....We get to see the ice planet Hoth, The swamp land of Degobah and the beautiful cloud City of Bespin, whilst introducing us to Landon Calrisian, and more importantly The Emperor and Jedi Master Yoda. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is excellent as the eager hero Luke Skywalker, who is devastated to learn a family secret. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the cocky pilot Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks cute and feisty in equal measure. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's James Earl Jones who makes the biggest Vader impression and revelation. Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here. The score by John Williams is again another valuable asset to the movie. One of my favourite parts of the movie was the banter between Ford and Fisher, they had real chemistry and I'm surprised they never paired up again away from these movies. All in all Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of atmosphere it makes for excellent entertainment.

It received no awards or major nominations. It had an excellent cast, with top actors and stars on the rise. And, this is the most factual and true rendition of all the films made. It is also the most detailed in the purpose of the voyage, the ship and its crew, and the relationships of the men. It includes the mutiny, the voyage of survival by Bligh and his faithful crew members, and the fate of Fletcher Christian and the rest of the mutineersSo, for its historical rendering, The Bounty excels. Many of these details are not covered, or are skimmed over in the more popular movies. For instance, Bligh was a Royal Navy Lieutenant &#x96; not a captain. Bligh was the only navy man and only actual officer on board. Christian was not a first lieutenant, but a master. He and all the rest of the leaders of the crew had the ranks of noncommissioned officers and came from the merchant marine. Christian was a known friend of Bligh's before the voyage. Bligh's first mate had already been chosen, so Christian signed on as junior to him. But, Bligh later removed the other mate, Fryer, and put Christian in his place. Bligh was an accomplished and skilled naval officer. He had served under Captain Cook on his third voyage to the South Pacific, so he alone knew the area and Tahiti. Bligh was not the fierce commander who doled out heavy physical punishment. He was more lenient than most captains in that regard. But, he had a temper, and made many verbal miscues as an officer. All of these things and many more facts of the true story are in this film. It is an excellent account of the voyage of the HMS Bounty, the mutiny, the successful 3,500-mile sea voyage of Bligh and his loyalists on a small boat, and the plight of the mutineers. So, why then is it not the best, the favorite of all the movies? I think it's because the characters of the other films were much more interesting. Look at the 1935 film, for instance. Charles Laughton was outstanding as a fierce, fear-inspiring captain. Clark Gable was much more interesting as the flamboyant office and dashing ladies' man. And, then there's the amount of time spent on so much of the factual details. I think the 1984 film spent far too much time covering the five-month layover on Tahiti. The sailing scenes were better and more interesting in the earlier films. The performances in The Bounty were all very good. But, the screenwriters needed to do something to make the leads more interesting &#x96; especially Christian and Fryer. There were a couple of excellent supporting performances in this movie. Most notable was that by Liam Neeson as Seaman Charles Churchill. I am among those who find the 1935 Bounty with Laughton and Gable the most exciting and entertaining. I think that drives home a good point that people should not rely too much on movies for accurate history. A movie like the 1935 film can entertain by playing loose with or not including many of the facts or true aspects of the story. And, it can wet one's appetite for history. But, we need then to check the true story in the Encyclopedia Britannica or other sound historical sources. I thought viewers might be interested in some more facts. Although it had three masts, the Bounty was quite small as could be seen in the early loading scenes. It was only 90 feet long, 24 feet wide, and displaced a mere 230 tons. It had a crew of one officer and 45 men. Compare that to a Man-Of-War, the types of ships we have seen in some of the great naval movies and swashbucklers. For instance, Lord Nelson's ship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 (just 15 years after the Bounty mutiny) displaced 3,500 tons. It had three masts, each with three to four sails (some as long as 200 feet), and measured 227 feet long and 52 feet wide. It carried a crew of 850 men &#x96; nearly 20 times the size of the Bounty's crew. And, it had 104 canons; 4 in the bow, 8 astern, and 56 each aligned on three gun decks on each side. It could make 8 to 9 knots an hour &#x96; about 10 miles per hour. The HMS Victory is still in service as the flagship of the Royal Navy Fleet Admiral at Portsmouth, England. MGM used existing sailing ships for its 1935 film to represent the Bounty and the Pandora. Fewer tall ships existed by 1962, and MGM built a replica for its film that year with Marlon Brando. After the movie it sailed around the world as a tourist attraction, but sank off the coast of North Carolina after the crew abandoned it during a hurricane in 2012. Another replica was made for this 1984 film, and today it serves as a tourist boat in Honk Kong Harbor. In 1957, divers from National Geographic discovered the ruins of the Bounty at Pitcairn Island. And, that island today has about 56 residents, descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians who went with them.

Karen is a woman who tries to sleep her way into being a baroness. But once the baron has his way with her for a while, he tires of her and reneges on his promise to marry her. So, she turns to his brother Bror, who she knows does not love her, and offers him a deal if he marries her, she gets to be a baroness, and he gets access to her money. He accepts, and they leave Denmark to go to Africa and start a farm in the year of 1913.Having made her Faustian bargain, she starts right off being a sourpuss about the whole thing. You know, acting as if she is being neglected, as if her husband doesn't love her, especially when he feels free to do as he pleases. As he explains to her, she may have bought the title, but she did not buy him. Now, he is a bit of a jerk, but isn't that what you would expect from a man who would marry a woman for her money? After a while, we start to like her, but every time something bad happens, as when Bror gives her syphilis, we think, Well, that's what you get for marrying a man who doesn't love you. She gets the Salvarsan cure, but there is no indication that Bror is treated for the disease, and we have to wonder if she continues to have sex with him, especially since she becomes upset by his continued infidelities. Fed up with him, she tells him to move out of the house and get a place in town. But she does not want a divorce, because then she wouldn't have anybody. Huh?She eventually starts having an affair with Denys, who is a big game hunter. Denys is a believer in free love, figuring he can continue to come and go as he pleases, which hurts her feelings, because she has fallen in love with him and wants him to spend more time with her. He is surprised and dismayed by her attitude, but I could have told him that would happen. Exasperated, she tells him that everything has a price. Well, she ought to know. Denys is not willing to pay the price of being domesticated, so they split up, and he eventually dies in an airplane crash.As for that all that money she had, between the cost of supporting her husband and trying to grow coffee in Africa, she ends up so broke she has to mortgage the farm. Then, right after the crop is harvested, it is destroyed in a fire. When asked if she had insurance, she responds, That's for pessimists. As I said, it is hard to have sympathy for her. So, she loses the farm and has to go back and live with her family, which she admits she has nearly bankrupted. She removes the white gloves from a servant's hands, saying that was a mistake, and in saying goodbye to another servant, asks him to call her by her first name. I guess that means she finally realizes that being a baroness was just so much vanity. A lot of people like this movie, presumably because Africa is filmed so beautifully, and because her lover Denys is filmed so beautifully. But if she had stayed in Denmark and not wasted her money buying a farm and a title, she could have led a financially secure life and possibly found a man without a title who loved her and wanted to marry her.

Karen is a woman who tries to sleep her way into being a baroness. But once the baron has his way with her for a while, he tires of her and reneges on his promise to marry her. So, she turns to his brother Bror, who she knows does not love her, and offers him a deal if he marries her, she gets to be a baroness, and he gets access to her money. He accepts, and they leave Denmark to go to Africa and start a farm in the year of 1913.Having made her Faustian bargain, she starts right off being a sourpuss about the whole thing. You know, acting as if she is being neglected, as if her husband doesn't love her, especially when he feels free to do as he pleases. As he explains to her, she may have bought the title, but she did not buy him. Now, he is a bit of a jerk, but isn't that what you would expect from a man who would marry a woman for her money? After a while, we start to like her, but every time something bad happens, as when Bror gives her syphilis, we think, Well, that's what you get for marrying a man who doesn't love you. She gets the Salvarsan cure, but there is no indication that Bror is treated for the disease, and we have to wonder if she continues to have sex with him, especially since she becomes upset by his continued infidelities. Fed up with him, she tells him to move out of the house and get a place in town. But she does not want a divorce, because then she wouldn't have anybody. Huh?She eventually starts having an affair with Denys, who is a big game hunter. Denys is a believer in free love, figuring he can continue to come and go as he pleases, which hurts her feelings, because she has fallen in love with him and wants him to spend more time with her. He is surprised and dismayed by her attitude, but I could have told him that would happen. Exasperated, she tells him that everything has a price. Well, she ought to know. Denys is not willing to pay the price of being domesticated, so they split up, and he eventually dies in an airplane crash.As for that all that money she had, between the cost of supporting her husband and trying to grow coffee in Africa, she ends up so broke she has to mortgage the farm. Then, right after the crop is harvested, it is destroyed in a fire. When asked if she had insurance, she responds, That's for pessimists. As I said, it is hard to have sympathy for her. So, she loses the farm and has to go back and live with her family, which she admits she has nearly bankrupted. She removes the white gloves from a servant's hands, saying that was a mistake, and in saying goodbye to another servant, asks him to call her by her first name. I guess that means she finally realizes that being a baroness was just so much vanity. A lot of people like this movie, presumably because Africa is filmed so beautifully, and because her lover Denys is filmed so beautifully. But if she had stayed in Denmark and not wasted her money buying a farm and a title, she could have led a financially secure life and possibly found a man without a title who loved her and wanted to marry her.

He says he envisioned Johnny as having no father, and that Kreese is the closest thing to a father figure).

The fact he was nominated for the Oscar says it all. As much as I love this movie, and I do. It's not the type to be nominated for Oscars.The studio wanted to drop the drunk Miyagi scene, feeling it slowed the pace of the movie down. Director John G.

So I found this adaptation which not many people know about and in my opinion this movie does have enough to worth people coming back to it despite it only being a half done adaptation.So in case you don't know the story. Frodo is a hobbit who comes across a ring of great power that is made for a man of great evil and turns almost anyone who comes across it into insane addicts. Frodo somehow can resist the ring and a wise wizard named Gandalf decides for him and his friends to go the the Elven council to decide to throw the ring into the fire and must face the terrors that Middle-Earth has between Frodo's home and the Mountain.I may compare this movie to the Jackson films but if you've seen Fellowship Of The Ring and The Two Towers, the comparisons are inevitable. I think a big problem this movie had is that it becomes a little bit too reliant on exposition. It isn't as bad as every line we say will contain a form of exposition but some things are told instead of shown and sometimes both at the same time which in my opinion we do not need to be told.If there is one other complaint and yes, I may be seen as nitpicking when I say this too is the animation style... I know, This isn't Disney but seeing The Orcs and the Ring Wraiths side by side I could barely tell the difference between them, the Hobbits all look similar and the knights at Helms Deep... Was there a method of cloning in Middle Earth? Seriously every soldier looks the same. Again, it seems like nitpicking but it just takes away from the story. Oh and BTW, just as a side-note the Balrog in this movie is awful.In terms of what I liked, well a complaint I raised with Fellowship is that Frodo was less of a Luke Skywalker-style protagonist and more of a damsel in distress. Here, that is gone. I mean he gets stabbed and he does go to Rivendale but he fights back even after getting stabbed and he wasn't taken away by Arwen (who isn't in this movie). It just seems like he's the better person to follow then the one in the first movie. And before the fans of the Jackson movies have a heart attack, he did get better across the other 2 movies.The atmosphere and action of this movie is nailed right on the head. The scene where the Orcs are marching towards Helms Deep is probably one of the most atmospheric scenes I have seen in a fantasy movie. With the action, it feels a little more realistic - like when you see someone is stabbed you feel the impact of them getting stabbed. Although the action does have it's weak points like in the battle of Helms Deep the soldiers don't take cover when the Orcs are firing arrows at them.

The voice acting, except maybe John Hurt and a few others just doesn't feel right.

Don't get me wrong they do throw in solid performances but you just can't compare with the performances that got the characters seemingly perfect for the roles (I say seemingly because I never read Lord Of The Rings). Oh and by the way, Samwise is probably the most useless, annoying side-character (in this movie) since Jar-Jar.So I think that while the Jackson movies are inevitably better this does have some things well worth checking out.

So I found this adaptation which not many people know about and in my opinion this movie does have enough to worth people coming back to it despite it only being a half done adaptation.So in case you don't know the story. Frodo is a hobbit who comes across a ring of great power that is made for a man of great evil and turns almost anyone who comes across it into insane addicts. Frodo somehow can resist the ring and a wise wizard named Gandalf decides for him and his friends to go the the Elven council to decide to throw the ring into the fire and must face the terrors that Middle-Earth has between Frodo's home and the Mountain.I may compare this movie to the Jackson films but if you've seen Fellowship Of The Ring and The Two Towers, the comparisons are inevitable. I think a big problem this movie had is that it becomes a little bit too reliant on exposition. It isn't as bad as every line we say will contain a form of exposition but some things are told instead of shown and sometimes both at the same time which in my opinion we do not need to be told.If there is one other complaint and yes, I may be seen as nitpicking when I say this too is the animation style... I know, This isn't Disney but seeing The Orcs and the Ring Wraiths side by side I could barely tell the difference between them, the Hobbits all look similar and the knights at Helms Deep... Was there a method of cloning in Middle Earth? Seriously every soldier looks the same. Again, it seems like nitpicking but it just takes away from the story. Oh and BTW, just as a side-note the Balrog in this movie is awful.In terms of what I liked, well a complaint I raised with Fellowship is that Frodo was less of a Luke Skywalker-style protagonist and more of a damsel in distress. Here, that is gone. I mean he gets stabbed and he does go to Rivendale but he fights back even after getting stabbed and he wasn't taken away by Arwen (who isn't in this movie). It just seems like he's the better person to follow then the one in the first movie. And before the fans of the Jackson movies have a heart attack, he did get better across the other 2 movies.The atmosphere and action of this movie is nailed right on the head. The scene where the Orcs are marching towards Helms Deep is probably one of the most atmospheric scenes I have seen in a fantasy movie. With the action, it feels a little more realistic - like when you see someone is stabbed you feel the impact of them getting stabbed. Although the action does have it's weak points like in the battle of Helms Deep the soldiers don't take cover when the Orcs are firing arrows at them.

Plot In A Paragraph Mr Miyagi must return to Okinawa as his father is dying. Daniel asks to go with him, as Mr Miyagi is always there when he needs him. Mr Miyagi reluctantly agrees and upon landing it's clear why he was keen to leave Daniel at home, as an old love rival of Mr Miyagi, Sato, wants to settle an old score. Sato is Okinawa's top karate instructor, he and his best student Chozen set about making Miyagi and Daniels life hell. Ali (Elizabeth Shue) is quickly written out, with Daniel saying she fell in love with a soccer player from UCLA. Enabling our hero to fall in love in Okinawa with Kumiko (a stunning Tamlyn Tomita) and Shue is not missed.

I'm not sure if the character of Sato (Danny Kamekona) is meant to be a gruff voiced clone of Kreece, with his nephew Chozen (Yuji Okumoto) replacing Zabka as his best student. But that is how it comes off, and it does not help with the sense of we've seen all this before. Despite the final confrontation being a fight to the death, it lacks the intensity of the first movie, and the victory doesn't feel as joyous. That said there are some good scenes in this movie, the ice breaking competition is a standout scene, as is Miyagi's confrontation with a bitter Kreece who is attacking his students at the beginning of the movie. We also get a dramatic rescue during a thunderstorm and a beautiful scene between Daniel and Miyagi on a beach after Miyagi's father dies. It's a great scene with Macchio tugging on the heart strings whilst Morita speaks volumes without uttering a word. Great work by both in this scene. Like in the first movie we have a great song. This time is an Oscar nominated song Glory Of Love by Perer Cetera. Overall I've rated it a generous 8\/10 a significant drop from the 10\/10 first movie. Losing points for weak villains and being almost a clone of the original. It's plus points being some good scenes (as mentioned above) the song and the acting of both Macchio and Morita who have great chemistry together.

He hopes the reputedly haunted house can provide evidence of the paranormal. The three others in his group are Luke (Russ Tamblyn), an heir of the woman who owns the house, psychic Theodora (Claire Bloom), and Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled woman who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. It doesn't take long before strange things start to happen in the house and it seems to affect Eleanor most of all.Robert Wise's adaptation of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House is a bona fide horror classic that's influenced countless movies over the years. Wise was a director who proved he could excel at any genre he tackled. His first horror movies were when he worked with Val Lewton on some of his wonderful films from the '40s. Lewton's approach to horror was to leave a lot to the viewer's imagination. Show them just enough to get their wheels spinning but never enough to say definitively that the horrors were real and not just in the mind. This ambiguous approach that focused heavily on the psychological clearly influenced Wise's direction here. So many of the scares here are suggested rather than overt.The film benefits from a small cast. Richard Johnson is a solid actor who gives what could easily be a stuffy character some personality. His opening narration sends chills down your spine. Russ Tamblyn is the flippant young man foisted upon Johnson's team. He has a memorable final line. Claire Bloom is terrific as the spiciest character in the film, subtext-laden Theodora. Julie Harris is the one that seems to divide viewers most. Some, like myself, find her performance as the nervous, frightened, and unbalanced Eleanor very authentic and deserving of praise. Others have said she's over the top, unrelatable, and hard to like. You'll have to see it and judge for yourself. The real star of the film is the house itself. The exteriors were shot at Ettington Hall and the interiors were very believable sets created by Elliott Scott. After skimming through the reviews here, I was disappointed to see so many negatives. Most of which were the same too boring, too slow, etc. I hate to generalize and I hate to play the what's wrong with today's generation card...but man it depresses me a little. I guess that's what happens when kids grow up plopped down in front of a TV or computer screen from an early age. Everything has to be shocking and violent. Like all the great horror films (not just cheap slasher dreck), it's best watched late at night. There's much to appreciate about this (pardon the pun) haunting classic. The script, acting, score, cinematography, and direction are all superb. It's a truly frightening film at times with an uneasy atmosphere throughout. A film that everybody should see at least once.

I guess that's what happens when kids grow up plopped down in front of a TV or computer screen from an early age. Everything has to be shocking and violent. Like all the great horror films (not just cheap slasher dreck), it's best watched late at night. There's much to appreciate about this (pardon the pun) haunting classic. The script, acting, score, cinematography, and direction are all superb. It's a truly frightening film at times with an uneasy atmosphere throughout. A film that everybody should see at least once.
