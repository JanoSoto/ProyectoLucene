Of course, he didn't write this film, and that honour goes to Stephen Belber, whose play this film is based on. The dialogue itself is brilliant, and it's constantly fascinating to see how the characters are built up through what they say. Although we don't know anything about these characters before the film starts, by the end we know about them just through their dialogue, which shows the thought that has been put into everything the characters say. The plot is deliciously simple, which gives all of the characters room to expand and interact with each other. Basically, what we have here is two high school friends that meet up in a motel room for the first time in ten years. While there, they discuss the darker areas of their time together at school&#133; Of course, for this film to work, good actors are a definite must have; and this film definitely has them! Ethan Hawke massively impressed in Linklater's Before Sunrise, and he does so again here, albeit in a totally different way. The character he has been given here is much harder to like than his one in Linklater's masterpiece, but Hawke shows his worth as an actor by brilliantly stepping into the role, and giving his character a definite grounding in realism. His co-stars, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman give similar portrayals, and the ensemble helps to make the film what it is. What makes films like Tape great is their ambiguity. Many of the things that the characters say can be interpreted in different ways, and most people will have different ideas as to why certain characters say certain things. The story behind the immediate goings on is well orchestrated, and even though nothing that the characters are talking about is shown; it's still easy to picture it. What happens in the hotel room is also very well executed, and the playwright has made sure that his story is never boring. Linklater's use of the camera is good, with the swirling angles creating a claustrophobic feel within the small confines of the hotel room. Tape is the sort of film that can be analysed in all different ways, and that gives it infinite rewatch value and when the material is this good; rewatching can only be a pleasure.

Poor acting from people who should know better, cheesy dialogue and short-sighted directing from Paul WS Anderson, who should but obviously doesn't. My favorite moment in the entire film is when our heroes are completely surrounded by zombies in a tunnel with no way out. Anderson wisely cuts to a shot of an unrelated empty hallway and cuts back to the characters having made some sort of miraculous escape.And of course, there's the ending, where the enjoyable Jason Isaacs makes a good-sport-style cameo in a rather pointless scene that doesn't appear to connect with anything we've just witnessed, including a creature that would make a Harryhausen stop-motion flick look like Lord of the Rings.

And when you see that look on O'Quinn's face during the climactic showdown, you'll know what I mean.To strengthen matters, the other performances are quite good for this type of movie. Schoelen is appropriately childlike yet adolescent as Stephanie, and Hack, as Susan, is maternal, yet vulnerable. Ruben's direction is smooth, careful and restrained. He's smart enough to back off when O'Quinn is doing his thing, but brings a stylish (yet no less creepy) eye to the picture.When the hour and a half was up, I was satisfied and glad that I decided to miss 'Family Guy' to watch this!

It has a decent story, good characters, and stunning scenery. This is why you go to the movies, isn't it? If compared against Ford's acknowledged masterpieces, Dononvan's Reef does not measure up, but measured against other escapist films, it is a great movie. John Wayne's performance is consistently good, and as always, believable. Wayne was so real in his films, that he is never considered to be a good actor, but if you look at his body of work, you have to admit he could do it all. His Guns Donovan character is certainly up to snuff, and he does well with what he has. His interaction with Lee Marvin as Boats Gilhooley is as good as any of his other brawling, head-butting clashes with legends like Ward Bond or Victor McGlaglen. Lee Marvin is very funny and clever in his scenes, and very rarely over the top. He could always deliver on a character that was supposed to be likable, but mentally ill.Aside from the fun, we have a significant plot element of prejudice considering the behavior of Guns, Boats, and Andre, where they hide the Doctor's half-caste Polynesian children from the All-White Bostonian daughter, Amelia. Paradoxically, we have Chinese stereotypes in the form of goofy looking morons with toothy grins and heavy accents.

You've got the perfect character...an odd teenage boy that lives in a bubble. Write up an adventurous plot and throw in a cameo by Fabio and some M. C.

OK, it is somewhat of an overused plot Boy falls in love with girl; Girl gets engaged to someone else; Boy interrupts the wedding to get the girl back. You've watched enough movies like this to know how it is going to end, but, as always, it's the journey that Bubble Boy takes to get there that makes this movie interesting and redeeming.

It is best expressed by Jimmy's dad who is really the only normal character, and only speaks once in the entire movie. He asks, What if Neil Armstrong flew to the moon, but never set foot on it? This movie is about taking chances...breaking out of our so-called bubbles, and experiencing life...not just sitting around watching it pass us by.The dialogue and the jokes can be lame sometimes, but the humor really comes from the absurdity of the characters and the improbable situations the main character runs into. I have to give the writers an A+ for imagination. The movie is sanitized for younger viewers, but gives a wink and a nod to more mature viewers.

It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash, but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman, and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia. After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher, informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using. It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen- and accepted as fact- is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head. It turns out that there is no such person as Charles Herman; he is a figment of Nash's imagination. Although it appears that Nash did indeed do some work for the CIA, Parcher is also an imaginary figure and the supposed Soviet newspaper code which Nash has desperately been trying to crack has no existence in reality. There is a suggestion that Nash's fantasies are ways of compensating for his own perceived deficiencies; Charles is outgoing and confident whereas Nash himself is shy and reserved, and the melodramatic adventures in which he becomes embroiled with Parcher perhaps reflect an unfulfilled desire for physical excitement. The rest of the film details Nash's attempts, with the aid of his doctors and the loyal Alicia, to overcome his illness and to return to productive life as a mathematician. Like a number of Howard's films, this one has been criticised for its alleged sentimentality. This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards. There is some truth in the criticism, but at least A Beautiful Mind sins less grievously in this respect than does another recent Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. Like that film, however, it is saved by some excellent acting performances. I knew from Gladiator and Master and Commander that Russell Crowe was a gifted actor; A Beautiful Mind showed me that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles, these latter two actors coping well with the difficult task of portraying characters who are, even in the context of the story itself, fictitious, having no reality outside the mind of another character. It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. It has, for example, been criticised for not mentioning allegations of affairs with both men and women, although I am not sure whether details of his supposed bisexuality were omitted at the behest of studio executives who felt that a main character who was anything other than a red-blooded heterosexual was bad for the box-office, or of gay activists who disliked any possible association between homosexuality and mental illness, or of Nash himself who has denied the allegations. It has also been pointed out that Nash's real-life relationship with Alicia was rather more rocky than the one shown here; they were actually divorced and remarried, something omitted from the film. No biography, however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasise. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather than a biographical treatise this approach works well enough. 7\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"22 September 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Ron Howard has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and A Beautiful Mind is no exception.

There is a suggestion that Nash's fantasies are ways of compensating for his own perceived deficiencies; Charles is outgoing and confident whereas Nash himself is shy and reserved, and the melodramatic adventures in which he becomes embroiled with Parcher perhaps reflect an unfulfilled desire for physical excitement.

This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards.

I knew from Gladiator and Master and Commander that Russell Crowe was a gifted actor; A Beautiful Mind showed me that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles, these latter two actors coping well with the difficult task of portraying characters who are, even in the context of the story itself, fictitious, having no reality outside the mind of another character. It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. It has, for example, been criticised for not mentioning allegations of affairs with both men and women, although I am not sure whether details of his supposed bisexuality were omitted at the behest of studio executives who felt that a main character who was anything other than a red-blooded heterosexual was bad for the box-office, or of gay activists who disliked any possible association between homosexuality and mental illness, or of Nash himself who has denied the allegations. It has also been pointed out that Nash's real-life relationship with Alicia was rather more rocky than the one shown here; they were actually divorced and remarried, something omitted from the film. No biography, however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasise. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather than a biographical treatise this approach works well enough. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Ron Howard has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and A Beautiful Mind is no exception. It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash, but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman, and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia. After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher, informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using. It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen- and accepted as fact- is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head. It turns out that there is no such person as Charles Herman; he is a figment of Nash's imagination. Although it appears that Nash did indeed do some work for the CIA, Parcher is also an imaginary figure and the supposed Soviet newspaper code which Nash has desperately been trying to crack has no existence in reality.

The story focuses on the life of one of the most famous British film directors of the 1930's, James Whale. In his prime, Whale directed many successful movies, but it's for his horror movies that most people remember him for, particularly the infamous 'Frankenstein' and 'Bride of Frankenstein' movies. However it's the circumstances of Whale's death which helped to secure him a place in the history books, and in the hearts and minds of many Whale is still one of the best British film directors of the twentieth century. In 1957 Whale's body was found in the swimming pool at his Hollywood mansion, it was the end of an era for the classic horror genre. Later it was concluded that he died of unnatural causes. The last few days of Whale's life still remain to this day a complete mystery, and it is these last few days that 'Gods and Monsters' tries to shed some light upon. It has since been ruled that Whale's death was suicide, but at the time there was much speculation as to whether this was the case and some suspected foul play. Even to this day there are probably people who remain unconvinced. But Whale had previously suffered a series of debilitating strokes, and though his motor abilities had been left 'relativity unimpaired' he became increasingly frustrated by his inability to concentrate, and by the memories of a past he had spent most of his life trying to outrun, which now continually overwhelmed him. In all senses of the word the movie is a drama. A dramatic, yet truly realistic and believable portrayal of what the last few days of Whale's life may have been, with some references to horror true to Whale's own style of film-making. Many of the characters including Clayton Boone - Whale's young and inexperienced gardener (portrayed by Brendan Fraser) and Hannah (Lynn Redgrave) the loyal and kind hearted house keeper, are totally fictional and as far as anybody knows never existed. However they were so expertly created by Christopher Bram in his novel that they still remain as real as Whale himself, making 'Gods and Monsters' a truly unforgettable experience, and an absolute must see for all avid movie goers. Starring award winning actor Sir Ian McKellen as James Whale 'Gods and Monsters' strives to and succeeds in creating a truly believable depiction of the last dying days of a man blest with a deliciously unique mind. The film respects it's moral duty towards it's audience. It certainly seems to understand the many questions it raises regarding the morality of the human race, as it strives to tell Whale's final story (just as Whale strove to tell that of 'Frankenstein') with sensitivity and understanding. The movie combines flashbacks to significant parts of Whale's younger life, with enactments of his troubled dreams and clips from Whale's own 'Bride of Frankenstein' succeeding in arousing a feeling of disorientation in the audience, providing a valuable insight into the mind of an ailing man at the crossroads of his life. The movie also offers many opportunities for in-depth film and character analysis for anybody interested in this field of media interpretation. I myself as an ex media studies student and aspiring actress was very impressed with the way Whale ans Clayton's friendship was handled even after Whale's death and found many of the scenes between McKellen and Fraser exceptionally moving. One particular scene that really caught my attention involves Clayton with his son towards the end of the film. This scene tells us a lot about how close Whale and Boone's friendship really was. Their relationship was a short one but one that had a heavy and long lasting impact on both of their lives. At times it was emotional and intense (however it becomes evident quite early on that there is no trace of sexual desire between the two of them) and towards the end they share a bond that will bridge the gap and shattered relations between them from beyond the grave!

In the battle he meets a frightening black knight. Fighting this knight Connor is fatally wounded and should by all means die. But he doesn't. Believed to be in league with the devil, he is cast out from his village and seeks refuge in the highlands. There he is sought out by Ramirez, an ancient Egyptian with flair. He tells Connor that he is immortal, he has no weaknesses but one. If he is decapitated he will die. There are but a few immortals in the world and they generally fight each other. The last one will gain all knowledge and power from all the other immortals. The black knight Connor fought, Ramirez tells him, is The Kurgan, the strongest warrior of them all. He must not win. In today (1986) NY Connor is named Russell Nash, and the final battle, the Gathering, is closing. And once again Connor will meet the evil Kurgan. At the same time the NY Police is confounded by all the headless bodies that keep turning up.Comment This is a classic, I remember seeing it many years ago and thought that it was so cool. Now, I must say, that a lot of the sword fighting and special effects feel pretty outdated, and in my minds eye, they were a lot better. However, accepting that it was made in the mid 80s it is still a very good movie. A nice story that jumps from the spectacular Scottish highlands to the dark dull NY. In addition there is good music (by Queen) and one can hint at some philosophical questions when Connor's first love dies while he has not aged a day since they met. Cristopher Lambert actually makes a good effort. I believe a lot will find his acting stiff, and that is just the case with his NY persona that has gone through a lot and does not dare to live, knowing that he will always lose whatever love he will find. His Scottish persona is much more open and living, though he will win no awards. Connery is much better as Ramirez and I really liked Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.

Now, I must say, that a lot of the sword fighting and special effects feel pretty outdated, and in my minds eye, they were a lot better. However, accepting that it was made in the mid 80s it is still a very good movie. A nice story that jumps from the spectacular Scottish highlands to the dark dull NY. In addition there is good music (by Queen) and one can hint at some philosophical questions when Connor's first love dies while he has not aged a day since they met. Cristopher Lambert actually makes a good effort. I believe a lot will find his acting stiff, and that is just the case with his NY persona that has gone through a lot and does not dare to live, knowing that he will always lose whatever love he will find. His Scottish persona is much more open and living, though he will win no awards. Connery is much better as Ramirez and I really liked Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.

It is considered as a drama, but in my opinion this fantastic and entertaining movie has no genre.

Despite not having a great success while it was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people is having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from their boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the story makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and unexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that when the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more because the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a masterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie would be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't know really how to express myself.

After watching 'Singin' in the Rain' again yesterday, I'm strangely left with a similar feeling &#150; it's magnificent, but it's not really a movie, is it? That is to say, although it is on the outset even a movie about movies, about Hollywood and about the making of movies, it's not really cinematic. 'Singin' in the Rain', for all its spectacle, just doesn't do what great movies, in my mind, do and ought to do &#150; namely, tell a story in a way that is specific to the movie as a form. Of course, the dancing is wonderful, but it strikes me as being a beefed-up Broadway show put on the screen.Don't get me wrong. I love this movie. I absolutely adore it. It's like a birthday party with cake and soda for two hours straight. So, this isn't really offered as negative criticism, at least I don't think so, because I really don't want to speak badly about something wonderful. It's more a kind of puzzlement.What is the specifically cinematic anyway? Well, it's hard to say, as it could be a lot of things, but let's look briefly at one possibility. If you look at Bergman, for instance, (yes, an unfair comparison if ever there was one), you'll find the cinematic in an exploration of the unification of photography and theatre &#150; the two antithetic sources of cinema. Yes, if you want to play Hegelian, you could say that there is dialectic here. Theatre is the theses &#150; it's all about the forward movement of the plot in time, it's action-packed, it's a temporal art form. The action is viewed at a distance. We know characters by their actions. The antithesis is photography. Here we have slices of time, extrapolated from movement and frozen in single moments. Photography makes close-ups possible. It allows a different way of knowing people. It lets us look for an essence, a timelessness in them, by way of the exploration of portraits. The synthesis of these two forms is the cinema, realized at it's height by Bergman in movies like 'Scenes from a Marriage', and perhaps above all 'Cries and Whispers'. Perhaps it reaches it's peak (or perhaps it goes too far and turns back on itself) in the relatively unknown 'Karin's Face', which consist of a series of photographs, a montage.The cinematic could be a lot of other things as well, of course. In Fellini it is produced by the way the scenes are linked and cut. But I won't go further with this now.Anyway, Singin in the Rain, despite taking movies as it's very theme, never becomes cinematic. It never moves beyond the theatre. There are hardly a close-up of a face throughout the movie. Those that are there seems either just not important, like the one of Gene Kelly in the beginning, or actually attempts to turn the face into another comical prop by treating it as a plastic instrument, distorting it, actually removing human personality from it &#150; I'm referring to the, admittedly side-splittingly hilarious, funny faces made by Donald O'Connor.Well, I don't know&#133; I could be way off the mark here, it was just something that occurred to me.

I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old classics. This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.

I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old classics. This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi.
