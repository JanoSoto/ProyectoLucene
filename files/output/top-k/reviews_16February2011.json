This film didn't even take 2 million dollars to make, but it surpasses a lot of movies out there with way bigger budgets.

And the story goes on from there with some humorous manner and amusing at times. Although some of the characters may seem one dimensional, almost every actor and actresses in this done a really good job and actually memorable for the most part. Christina Ricci's character isn't fully explained in this or explored enough for the audience why she didn't just run away during few scenes.

Finally you get to see the slashed scenes and that what was cut in order to get an R-rating. (from the 'evil empire' MPAA- I hate censorship !). But Part VIII wasn't trimmed as heavily as Part VII. The effects weren't so good to begin with. I LOVE the Friday The 13th franchise, especially the first four movies are awesome. (Part 1 and 4 had fantastic make-up effects by master Tom Savini). Part VII could have been better received but it was for many viewers a little bit of a disappointment due to the lack of bloody killings\/special effects. A few minutes of gore was cut due to the MPAA. When you see those deleted scenes, it becomes an entire different (and way better) movie !! That cannot be said when it comes to Part VIII. It isn't a good movie to begin with, especially for the Friday fans there's a lot out of place here; - Young (and old unmasked) Jason looks nothing like the previous and especially first movie. - Jason can't swim, but here he seems to be in form. - Jason seem to move faster than lightning in this movie. - 4 people in danger decide to split up (?? really) - A black guy hits Jason's mask numerous times (?? how dumb is that) - Jason Takes Manhattan (only in the last 20 minutes..)So a couple of things were removed to get the R-rating, but it's nothing shocking. Even the scene of the darts-in-the-eyes can be seen which was eventually replaced by another scene. But it's just a couple of seconds of gore you get to see, like a close-up shot of the first murder.

Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations.Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece Out of the Past, released the same year as Crossfire) and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn.

I first saw it in 2006, I guess just a little less than ten years after its release, and during my first viewing, I thought it was pretty bad, even though I hadn't thought that way about any Burton films I had seen before this one! However, I think it was only about 24 hours after that when I watched it for the second time, this time with a slightly better understanding of what the idea of the film was. With that second viewing, I still didn't think it was great, but certainly did find it to be better than I previously had. About four and a half years after those two viewings, I have now seen it for the third time, and this viewing turned out to be even better than the second.Many flying saucers come from Mars and surround planet Earth! The President of the United States, James Dale, is eager to announce this historical event to the country, and when he does, it obviously excites many people. The first of these spaceships lands in the Nevada desert, where a meeting has been set up. Many military personnel and civilians have gathered to witness this landing, and the Martians that come out of the ship are greeted by General Casey. According to a universal translator, these beings claim to have come in peace, and in response to this, a hippie in the crowd releases a dove. However, one of the Martians shoots this dove down while it's flying, and then the extraterrestrials kill many people who are present at this gathering, using laser guns that leave nothing but bones! It is possible that this incident was a cultural misunderstanding, but this possibility is ruled out when more Martian attacks take place, making it clear that all these creatures want to do is destroy! There are lots of characters in this film, and a very talented cast to play them. Jack Nicholson plays President James Dale, and also plays a more minor character named Art Land. Unsurprisingly, his talent and usual wry style help with the quality of Mars Attacks! Glenn Close, Pierce Brosnan, Martin Short, Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, etc. also help make the cast as a whole a strong one. As a comedy, this movie isn't usually hilarious, but I still often laughed lightly, and found some occasional big laughs. Most of Press Secretary Jerry Ross' (Martin Short) encounter with a Martian disguised as an Earth woman may not be among the strongest points, but the outcome is perhaps one of the funniest parts of the film! The over-the-top Martians can provide a lot of the humour. To add to the entertainment value, this sci-fi comedy also has many scenes that are bound to have viewers in suspense, plus the special effects and the set design for the inside of the Martian spaceship are very nice to look at.This film came out the same year as Independence Day, a more popular alien invasion movie, but I personally think that one is overrated and this one is underrated. I actually wasn't impressed with the Roland Emmerich blockbuster at all when I finally saw it all for the first time last year, and think this Tim Burton film is SO much better! If you ask me, this one has better cast performances (nobody here is anything like Randy Quaid as Russell Casse in the other film or those who play that character's offspring, thank goodness), more outstanding characters, and I guess a more entertaining plot. Another reason why Mars Attacks! is far superior is perhaps because Independence Day takes itself too seriously, which this other alien invasion film of 1996 certainly doesn't. I'm giving this sci-fi comedy an 8\/10, even though I've given the same rating to more than one other film directed by Tim Burton which I've found to be better.

At the moment I had entered to our house, my mom said to me that we are going to movies. I was a bit surprised, because usually we did not go to movies too often back then. She said the name of the movie, but it didn't ring any bell. I did not even get the chance to change my clothes, they clearly had been waiting for me. We went to movies together by our old -87 Mitsubishi Lancer - my mom, me, my brother and my cousin. The reason why I remember that day so well is that it changed my life literally forever. I was 11 years old.When we arrived at the movietheatre I saw the poster. There was this young man with curly hair, looking down to his hand in which he held a golden ring. I thought this wasn't very promising. There were really many people in the theatre waiting. This was very unusual, because we lived in small town and usually there was like 30 people in one viewing. But that day the theatre was full - all 302 seats. I thought this must be some big blockbuster film, which it of course was.And then the film started playing. The very first scenes of the film impressed me, and the movie took me away with it. I found the movie very fascinating. The story was so good I had never before seen anything like it. Sure I had seen Star Wars films, but I didn't like them when I was 10 and I do not like them now either. When the movie ended I was totally speechless. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. I had just seen something that made me to want direct movies. Immediately the next day after I had seen the film I borrowed Lord of the Rings -trilogy from the library and read it in two weeks (not bad for an 11-year-old in my opinion). Few days later I went to see the movie again. After that I went to see it again, so I saw it 3 times in movietheatre.To this day, I have seen The Fellowship of the Ring about 25 times. I love this movie so much I can watch it again and again and again. The two sequels for it were to me almost as good as the first one, and I've seen them as many times as the FotR. Usually I watch them in a row. The extended editions are of course the versions I prefer watching than theatrical, because the bring so much more in the movie, but since the theatrical cuts were released on Blu-ray almost a year ago, I'm always facing a hard decision which version to watch) There are still new things I notice while watching this film, and it is actually quite rewarding after so many times. The meaning of the movie to me grows every time I watch it, and I am glad of it. I wouldn't be me as I am today this day without Fellowship of the Ring, so thank you J.R.R. Tolkien & Peter Jackson! Now you must be thinking what kind of review for the movie this is. Well, I would say this tells my personal relationship for the movie. I thought it might be more interesting to read than other dull review. I am pretty sure everyone knows what this film is about, so I'm not going to tell the story. As sure as I am about that, I also know that most of you reading this have seen all the three LOTR films already. So you do must know how perfect this movie is in every imaginable way, so I don't have to explain myself to you. Just watch it NOW if you haven't seen it yet.The effect the movie had on me after seeing this film for the first time lasts still on me. Firstly it made me a total movie freak; I go to movies almost every weekend and usually I watch 1-3 movies\/ day. The second thing is that I still want to direct movies. And to that dream I have lived to this day. At the moment I study cinematography in Finland, so there's still a long way to become a director, but I'll try and probably someday I might direct a proper movie...

At the moment I had entered to our house, my mom said to me that we are going to movies. I was a bit surprised, because usually we did not go to movies too often back then. She said the name of the movie, but it didn't ring any bell. I did not even get the chance to change my clothes, they clearly had been waiting for me. We went to movies together by our old -87 Mitsubishi Lancer - my mom, me, my brother and my cousin. The reason why I remember that day so well is that it changed my life literally forever. I was 11 years old.When we arrived at the movietheatre I saw the poster. There was this young man with curly hair, looking down to his hand in which he held a golden ring. I thought this wasn't very promising. There were really many people in the theatre waiting. This was very unusual, because we lived in small town and usually there was like 30 people in one viewing. But that day the theatre was full - all 302 seats. I thought this must be some big blockbuster film, which it of course was.And then the film started playing. The very first scenes of the film impressed me, and the movie took me away with it. I found the movie very fascinating. The story was so good I had never before seen anything like it. Sure I had seen Star Wars films, but I didn't like them when I was 10 and I do not like them now either. When the movie ended I was totally speechless. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen.

Lilia Skala, as the mother superior, has the truly thankless role of the authoritarian who believes that if you trust in God you needn't worry about anything else, but she delivers. You might not think so when you see her in action because the character is so stern and lacking in humor. Poitier is to Skala as fire hydrant is to dog.

The Enterprise crew are still on Vulcan and they only ship they have is the Klingon bird of prey they escaped Genesis with in the third film. When they return home they discover that a strange alien probe is destroying Earth. The only way to communicate with this probe is through humpback whales, a species that went extinct hundreds of years ago. Kirk and his crew make a very spontaneous decision to travel back in time to retrieve a pair of humpback whales in order to save the Earth. They travel back to 1980's San Francisco and make plans to steal two whales who are currently in captivity, but are preparing to be let loose into the ocean soon. The strangely comedic antics that transpire while in the past make this Star Trek film one of the strangest and most different Star Trek films. In some ways this is a good thing, but in other ways it is not.The Voyage Home prides itself as a comedy. I guess Star Trek was tired of being a serious sci-fi melodrama and decided to take it a little more light hearted for the fourth film. This would have been OK if it had worked out better. I laughed pretty hard at moments of this film. Sometimes it was because they were genuinely funny, like a taxi driver calling Kirk a dumbass for walking out in front of the moving car and hearing Kirk retort back with double dumbass to you! Then there were other moments that I laughed at because they were really pretty stupid. The range of comedy that is available in a scenario of humans from the 23rd century walking the busy streets of a 20th century city is wide but it has its limits. The Voyage Home picked the most cliché and predictable of these scenarios that really ended up being silly. There's a cringeworthy scene where Scotty tries to use a 20th century computer. I just shook my head in shame as he tried speaking directly to the computer, then trying to speak into the mouse. Maybe I was just caught off guard when this film suddenly turned into a lighthearted 80's comedy, but the comedy didn't always work for me.Overall, The Voyage Home has an interesting and very creative story that takes Star Trek on a very different route than we've ever seen. The story isn't executed in a way I would have expected, but it doesn't make it any less intelligent. It also returns Star Trek to its roots of having a deeper purpose than to just entertain. The message here is blatantly obvious. It is a go green save the whales film and it doesn't try to hide that fact. It even gives us a little whale trivia during a tour of the whale museum Kirk and Spock find themselves in at one point. I found the film to be a little preachy when it came to all this, and I got a little tired of it after a while. I respect Star Trek's maturity and ability to bring to light an important issue like whaling, but it could have toned down the blatant PSA-esque feel it sometimes had.I didn't love The Voyage Home, but I didn't hate it either. It isn't a particularly bad film, but it didn't hit any notes for me. I felt the comedy was awkward and out of place, and the whole idea of time traveling didn't seem to be executed to its full potential. The movie also lacks an actual villain which was pretty disappointing. There are tiny obstacles the characters encounter while trying to retrieve the whales, but nothing that puts them in real danger, or at least believable danger. This definitely wasn't my favorite Star Trek film, but it isn't the worst ever made.

It takes off where the third film left off, only a few months later. The Enterprise crew are still on Vulcan and they only ship they have is the Klingon bird of prey they escaped Genesis with in the third film. When they return home they discover that a strange alien probe is destroying Earth. The only way to communicate with this probe is through humpback whales, a species that went extinct hundreds of years ago. Kirk and his crew make a very spontaneous decision to travel back in time to retrieve a pair of humpback whales in order to save the Earth. They travel back to 1980's San Francisco and make plans to steal two whales who are currently in captivity, but are preparing to be let loose into the ocean soon. The strangely comedic antics that transpire while in the past make this Star Trek film one of the strangest and most different Star Trek films. In some ways this is a good thing, but in other ways it is not.The Voyage Home prides itself as a comedy. I guess Star Trek was tired of being a serious sci-fi melodrama and decided to take it a little more light hearted for the fourth film. This would have been OK if it had worked out better. I laughed pretty hard at moments of this film. Sometimes it was because they were genuinely funny, like a taxi driver calling Kirk a dumbass for walking out in front of the moving car and hearing Kirk retort back with double dumbass to you! Then there were other moments that I laughed at because they were really pretty stupid. The range of comedy that is available in a scenario of humans from the 23rd century walking the busy streets of a 20th century city is wide but it has its limits. The Voyage Home picked the most cliché and predictable of these scenarios that really ended up being silly. There's a cringeworthy scene where Scotty tries to use a 20th century computer. I just shook my head in shame as he tried speaking directly to the computer, then trying to speak into the mouse. Maybe I was just caught off guard when this film suddenly turned into a lighthearted 80's comedy, but the comedy didn't always work for me.Overall, The Voyage Home has an interesting and very creative story that takes Star Trek on a very different route than we've ever seen. The story isn't executed in a way I would have expected, but it doesn't make it any less intelligent. It also returns Star Trek to its roots of having a deeper purpose than to just entertain. The message here is blatantly obvious. It is a go green save the whales film and it doesn't try to hide that fact. It even gives us a little whale trivia during a tour of the whale museum Kirk and Spock find themselves in at one point. I found the film to be a little preachy when it came to all this, and I got a little tired of it after a while. I respect Star Trek's maturity and ability to bring to light an important issue like whaling, but it could have toned down the blatant PSA-esque feel it sometimes had.I didn't love The Voyage Home, but I didn't hate it either. It isn't a particularly bad film, but it didn't hit any notes for me. I felt the comedy was awkward and out of place, and the whole idea of time traveling didn't seem to be executed to its full potential.

After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.The other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.Now we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.Now when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.Full Plot Leone Léon Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or cleaner, as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the Supreme Macaroni Company restaurant. Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his best friend,3 and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.On a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman Stan Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Léon.Mathilda discovers that Léon is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a cleaner; she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. Léon shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying Léon's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to Léon several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.After increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Léon, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that what he calls the Italian hit-man has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering Léon's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is from Mathilda, then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open Léon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Léon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune Léon had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can clean as Léon had. Tony sternly informs her that he ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid! Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and Léon's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with Léon's houseplant in hand.
