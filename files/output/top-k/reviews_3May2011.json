He doesn't even have time to defend himself, Lenny, played by Guy Pearce, kills him ruthlessly, until we see the stains of bloods and drops going in reverse, and understand the direction the film will take, for our delighted surprise.'Remember Sammy Jenkins' Lenny's motto, the only thing he conditioned himself to remember. It's the story of a man suffering from his same short-term memory, until it ultimately killed his wife. This probably is the element that justified the use of the backwards narration because it shows the deadly nature of Lenny's memory problem, Lenny who just killed a man thought to be his wife's murderer. Two parallel stories, one bloody murder, one revenge story, a short-term memory, a story in reverse, a claustrophobic setting, there's something quite uneasy in this cinematic journey. And the dizziness is the same as when you sit in the opposite seats of the train's direction, but you will arrive at destination. And that the identity of the murderer will be revealed, or no, that the revelation will be shocking. Because Memento is not your typical whodunit film &#x85; Basically, the reverse thing's point is to teach us, not to believe in the appearances. Lenny's condition needs proofs, things written, everywhere, tattooed in his body, pictures with names on it, and devices written as to warn himself from the danger of being teased. The guy killed in the beginning, named Teddy, surprisingly seems to be Lenny buddy and helper, but he's tagged as suspicious in his photography. Every hint has to be material, but the more we get in Lenny's conditions, the more we realize that these precautions act like a double-edged sword. So the movie basically, prepares us to a biggest surprise about the identity of the murderer, who's probably not that Teddy. How could we be so sure? Simply, because the movie is a mystery, and the resolution can only come at the end. Besides, such a powerful film can't afford an ordinary ending.

Then, she was convinced, and so were we. That was a comic relief scene, but how about the one where she comes with her face beaten, asking for his help, until we realize in the previous-next scene that he was the one teased to hit her in the face.

In both respects Rambo III falls short. Where as in the first two there is an underlying theme off a brave, good man repeatedly being let down by his country and the men he tries to protect, in the third movie the theme is dropped and replaced with a plot not only dull and typical but also completely senseless. Meanwhile in the action department the film starts off at a terrible pace and we only get to see the Rambo we know and love busting his moves 40 minutes into the film.The whole film is terribly forced. It takes quite a bit of effort to imagine John Rambo throwing away the life of peace he worked so hard for at the drop of a hat. In my opinion, the Coronel acts completely out of character considering the events of Rambo II. There is no way I could believe that the character would really approach Rambo once again like a total asshole. On a similar note, while Rambo surprised us over and over again with his special ops traps and camouflage tricks, when he's suddenly taken out of a dark jungle and placed in a well lit Russian camp in the middle of a desert it's hard to believe he could pull off the same stunts.The action is generally poorly executed and the climatic final battle is ludicrous. Firstly I can't get over how a Russian army composed of helicopters and tanks lost to some dudes on horses with petrol bombs. Secondly, the surreal showdown between Rambo and Zayzen where Mr. baddie decides to charge against a tank with a helicopter 5 feet off the ground directly in line with the cannon, as opposed to flying up and launching the laser guided anti tank missiles it has from a safe distance. It's obvious at this point they weren't even trying. Suffice it to say that these last 20 minutes are cringe worthy.The ending scene was pointless and showed no signs of effort to give some sort of closure to the film. Also, we were continuously introduced to a bunch of lackluster, useless characters who do nothing but slow down the action. I also had an issue with the bullet wounds in several instances. At one point Rambo is shot by a helicopter round in the leg. 99% of the time that happens your leg is blown off into little bits. I understand Rambo is the main character so at first I thought it would just break his leg and so he would continue his carnage like a bad ass while limping. To my disbelief a few seconds later he's OK again running like a bloodhound and the giant hole going through the middle of his leg is never mentioned again.In conclusion, unlike the other 3 Rambo films (yes, even John Rambo is better than this film) this one left behind nothing of value that you could take home. The story is really forced and unoriginal, the script is inferior, the action is scarce and usually makes no sense and the majority of the cast is boring and bring nothing to the table.I'm not going to say this film is of the worst action movies of all time, but if they do make a list of them, Rambo III deserves an honorable mention for ruining a franchise in the laziest way possible.

You mean Scarface the movie with zero Oscar nominations, and a Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma as worst director, the movie which many pseudo cinematic purists constantly denounce the all flash and no substance-ness, its new popularity among gangsters rappers, Al Pacino's over-the-top performance, a laughable script and so on and so forth... you mean THIS movie is overrated??? Sorry man, but if one thing, this movie is absolutely and criminally underrated! And its iconic status, its place in IMDb Top 250, and tenth position in the American Film Institute's Top Ten Gangster films, are only the kind of justices that cinematic Gods have owed this masterpiece for a long time.Yes, Scarface is a masterpiece, because it precisely didn't try to be one and the result is not unintentional either the writing, the direction, the acting, everything points out a deliberate will to create an entertaining gangster flick. But I'm not sure Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma and Al Pacino expected this movie to become one of the most revered, quoted and of course, emblematic of the gangster genre, yet it did. Why? One word guts, the kind of guts that break the walls and rhyme with balls. This movie had it. It's made of the same vein of classic pre-Godfather gangster flicks such as Little Caesar, The Public Enemy and of course, the original Scarface  the Shame of a Nation, Hawks' classic to which this film is dedicated. Scarface has the virile magnetism and rebellious detachment of these films mixed with the exuberant flamboyance of the 80's. Not kitsch, not dated, the film couldn't have had a better setting, it's all about posing and showing off richness and power, it's a success story made during a time were it was indeed glorified.This is the thought-provoking 'guts' of Scarface and why the film deserves its comparison with its more mature and respected predecessor The Godfather. Scarface is to the 80's what Coppola's film was to the 70's a reference, if not a milestone. It brought something new, assuming a dazzling celebration of the gangster world appeal without the preachy morality of the 30's or any attempt of glamorization. Every single character is depicted as an unredeemable scumbag and that was before Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. They're not totally unlikable or amoral either, they're just victim of their own vision of succeeding the easy way.Because Scarface literally pushes a certain idea of the American Dream to its bloodiest limit, to taste freedom and capitalism until getting an indigestion, to live the drunkenness of power until an ultimate hangover &#x85; so what did you expect the movie to be a romantic Shakespeare tragedy à la Godfather or a realistic epic drama à la Goodfellas? No! The approach was right, it had to be a gripping fantasy about the Gangster world. It was naturally bashed by the critics, but at least, it could exorcise all the violence, and whatever was appealing in the lives of gangsters, with an acid but so flamboyant portrayal of the American Dream, before the same subject would be handled by a more tormented and cerebral Scorsese. Using a Scarfacian metaphor, the film is like a great sex with a painful orgasm.How dare you blame the portrayal of Tony Montana, for being over the top? The guy is a thug suffering from a Napoleon Syndrome?! All he got in Cuba was an experience of being beeped by communism, which all naturally, encouraged him to change the position in the only country that could allow that, a country neighboring his homeland enough to be the object of a cult with a view of freedom, money and prosperity so idealistic it twisted his morality. Tony wanted the American Dream in an excessive way, because that's all the way he viewed America, as a fantasy, It had to be a fantasy from the eyes of an emigrant, an emigrant who dreamed of driving beautiful cars, having his mansion with his initials graved in his chair and of course &#x85; getting the blonde.He wanted the world, and everything in it. He wanted money and power. And now you blame him for being over the top? Would you blame Norma Desmond to be too theatrical? Or Jack Torrance to be too weird? Tony Montana is a caricature only to those who can't see how caricatured the way the image of USA could be reflected, and to those blind people, De Palma even conceded that the movie's portrayal of Cubans wasn't reflecting blah blah, as if we needed to know that &#x85; come on, over the top? It's a movie and a damn entertaining one, whose over-the-top-ness is the extra depth the haters fail to see &#x85;.And the script, is probably one of the most memorable elements of the films. It drops so many F bombs, it's almost a punctuation mark creating delightful situations where we see Tony interacting with his sidekick, Steven Bauer as the unforgettable Manny, or his soon-to-be ex-boss, with his friends and enemies, until facing some anger management issues &#x85; Many people said it was Pacino's downfall, I think this was his rebirth, the new Pacino in his 40's, and his greatest role after Michael Corleone. The proof of Pacino's incredible talent is his ability to portray a range of gangster from Mafia boss to thug, in such a natural way, I'm sure he's an unsung icon to many criminals in the world. The script is just a verbal ode to the violence portrayed in this film, a violence that will leave red stains in your TV screen until it dirties your nice pajama &#x85; a violence reminding that for every fortune criminally earned, there is a Damocles sword upon your head waiting for a fatal mistake.So call it violent, over-the-top, dated, flashy &#x85; I say, Yes, man'g! and this is precisely why Scarface is a masterpiece !

It is the getting there within which the problems lie, those to whom the film is pitched will have to suffer the sitting through of misplaced phone sex sequences and some needlessly colourful language, while the rest of us, for whom the adult content will just sail past, will have to sit through a message-movie that'll already have been mapped out in most of the audience's minds if the natural conclusion point to which the film arrives hasn't already been prefigured before in their lives. Ultimately, The Truth About Cats & Dogs happens for absolutely no reason at all; other than to perhaps shuffle onto screens a meek message-movie about looks, rational thinking, male presumption and so-forth which are all items that happen to have been dealt with before and in more engaging fashions. The truth about The Truth About Cats & Dogs is that it's just not up to an awful lot.The film eventually comes to cover three predominant characters, the one with whom we start being a local disc-jockey in a warm; welcoming movie version of Los Angeles named Abby Barnes (Garofalo), a disc-jockey whose show specialises in veterinarian problems and animal issues. Seemingly lonely, living by herself in an apartment with her pet cat, and sexless for three years, she excels at her job more often than not made easier by the subdued level of callers whom ring in with the slightest of problems that she's usually capable of fixing without breaking a sweat. Abby's neighbour at her apartment complex is the ditzy, flimsy Noelle (Thurman); essentially a bit of a write-off of a human being, a model with some serious marital issues of her own in that she appears able to have most men without possessing the ability to maintain any kind of lasting bond with them. A woman, who upon hearing Abby has abstained from sexual encounters for all of three years, appears somewhat disturbed at such a happening.Enter Brian (Chaplin), a young English photographer working in L.A. whose call to Abby's show spawns all manner of events; a man in love with Abby's demeanour and intelligence but with Noelle's looks when he comes on down to the studio; the lab rat around which the study of male perception of the opposite gender, or how a woman's looks can blind a man to some seemingly obvious truths, plays out. For the most part, Chaplin essentially does the Hugh Grant act the dozy but charming British male, who's a bit bleary eyed, but we don't mind 'cause that's all part of his charm, as he fumbles through these exchanges with women, usually foreign, in a happy and jolly manner in a desirable enough locale. Curiously, with Brian arrives an air of misogyny; distorting sequences with an African American supporting character who's a work colleague of his carrying with them notions of ill-thinking and nastiness, so much so that we question as to whether Brian would even work with a man of an African American ilk given his rather raging narrow mindedness. The item of persona swapping which later plays out between the women appears in contrast to that of Brian's own in-presence\/not-in-presence attitudes in regards to the female characters when he certainly acts in a less appealing way.Young Brian is put through the proverbial wringer when Noelle and Abby decide to enforce that switch idiotic and po-faced, but strikingly beautiful, Noelle now the expert veterinarian with Abby relegated to that of, well, a nobody living next door with her cat.

Ultimately, The Truth About Cats & Dogs happens for absolutely no reason at all; other than to perhaps shuffle onto screens a meek message-movie about looks, rational thinking, male presumption and so-forth which are all items that happen to have been dealt with before and in more engaging fashions. The truth about The Truth About Cats & Dogs is that it's just not up to an awful lot.The film eventually comes to cover three predominant characters, the one with whom we start being a local disc-jockey in a warm; welcoming movie version of Los Angeles named Abby Barnes (Garofalo), a disc-jockey whose show specialises in veterinarian problems and animal issues. Seemingly lonely, living by herself in an apartment with her pet cat, and sexless for three years, she excels at her job more often than not made easier by the subdued level of callers whom ring in with the slightest of problems that she's usually capable of fixing without breaking a sweat. Abby's neighbour at her apartment complex is the ditzy, flimsy Noelle (Thurman); essentially a bit of a write-off of a human being, a model with some serious marital issues of her own in that she appears able to have most men without possessing the ability to maintain any kind of lasting bond with them. A woman, who upon hearing Abby has abstained from sexual encounters for all of three years, appears somewhat disturbed at such a happening.Enter Brian (Chaplin), a young English photographer working in L.A. whose call to Abby's show spawns all manner of events; a man in love with Abby's demeanour and intelligence but with Noelle's looks when he comes on down to the studio; the lab rat around which the study of male perception of the opposite gender, or how a woman's looks can blind a man to some seemingly obvious truths, plays out. For the most part, Chaplin essentially does the Hugh Grant act the dozy but charming British male, who's a bit bleary eyed, but we don't mind 'cause that's all part of his charm, as he fumbles through these exchanges with women, usually foreign, in a happy and jolly manner in a desirable enough locale. Curiously, with Brian arrives an air of misogyny; distorting sequences with an African American supporting character who's a work colleague of his carrying with them notions of ill-thinking and nastiness, so much so that we question as to whether Brian would even work with a man of an African American ilk given his rather raging narrow mindedness. The item of persona swapping which later plays out between the women appears in contrast to that of Brian's own in-presence\/not-in-presence attitudes in regards to the female characters when he certainly acts in a less appealing way.Young Brian is put through the proverbial wringer when Noelle and Abby decide to enforce that switch idiotic and po-faced, but strikingly beautiful, Noelle now the expert veterinarian with Abby relegated to that of, well, a nobody living next door with her cat.

Sure that two hours that you watch the film will not be a boring event in her life but every little detail of her life is in the film. And through this film you kind of have to infer what has happened in her past and how she got to these two hours in her life. It seems like a hard film to write just because there is so much extraneous detail that has to be inserted into the film subtly, while still making every detail of the characters life an interesting story. The main character of the film, Cleo, is roaming around Paris while awaiting the medical test results from the doctor. She meets with several friends and strangers and discusses her thoughts on mortality which is a big issue for her at this point in her life. These people seem unsympathetic towards her cause so she starts to question her solitude and whether or not she has anyone in her life that she can lean on for support. She finally meets a stranger who happens to be a soldier from the Algerian war. He is able to comfort her and is able to relate to her. And in the end he accompanies her to the doctors appointment to receive her results.

Night Shyamalan's missing the mark with Lady in the Water, The Happening, and The Last Airbender. But if you can let go of the baggage that subsequent events have loaded onto this movie, it's a decent, watchable movie. It does have some flaws, but it's well above average as entertainment and gets points for originality from all parties.So what's it about? It takes a little while to declare itself. Initially it seems to want to be a suspense drama. And then it morphs into a sci-fi invasion drama. And then, at the end, it finally declares itself it's about unlikely events providing a redemption for a man of faith who, for a while, lost his faith.First things first Gibson. Up until we were inundated with recordings of his ugly tirades of venom spewed at his ex-girlfriend, and his anti-semitic tirade during his DUI arrest, Gibson was a genuinely likable actor who could project a streak of craziness that made him suspenseful to watch. There was also a sense of humor about him; at any moment in a serious drama, he might break out with a comedic moment that lightened things up. And he conveys these things in the character he plays here, but he also gets across to us that this character is a man who has lost his calling and doesn't know how to fill the empty place it left.Working with him to move the plot forward is Joaquin Phoenix as his younger brother, a man who hasn't lost anything of a calling because he hasn't found anything to hold him yet. He exists in this movie mostly as a foil for Gibson's character, and he plays that part well. He's an actor who is sexy and charismatic and has a feel of dangerousness even when you know he's solidly on the side of good things.Through a series of events surrounding an alien invasion, Gibson takes actions to protect his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (an adorable, and tiny, Abigail Breslin). As events proceed, we get flashbacks that lead us to the source of Gibson's disillusionment and loss of faith, the death of his wife in a freak car accident.This leads me somewhat obliquely to what I have to regard as this movie's biggest flaw Shyamalan doesn't seem to have much faith in the ability of his audience to see what he's getting at. He is not subtle in getting his major premise across; he wants to spell it out, then repeat it for emphasis, and then finally beat us over the head with it to make sure that we get it. This is jarring, to say the least, and it works against the movie it's hard not to feel that maybe if he feels the need to be obvious, BLATANTLY obvious, perhaps he's unsure of himself and his craft as a writer and a director. He doesn't want the material to fail but I think that if he wants to craft movies that are more than workmanlike entertainment, he has to take chances in trusting the audience and trusting himself and his ability to get things across to the audience without spelling them out so obviously.He doesn't want to take that chance, and that shows. And it hurts the movie.I kind of think that it affected Gibson and Phoenix, too. There are some moments in the film when it seems like they're just going through the motions, just reading their lines, not living them and making them live. Gibson does this more than Phoenix does, and it makes me wonder was Shyamalan afraid to call him on this and demand better from him? It's obvious to the whole world now that Gibson has quite an ego, and with his experience both in front of and behind the camera, he must be an intimidating presence to direct. Was he holding back and just going through the motions because he didn't like some of the material? Was Shyamalan unaware of how Gibson came across, or was he afraid to demand better? I don't know and it doesn't matter. Those moments when Gibson is obviously not engaged in the material are jarring.In the end, I want to recommend this film with some reservations. It's decent entertainment and has originality. It also has flaws that hold it back.But I think the bottom line in deciding whether you want to watch this film or not is whether you can disengage what you know about Gibson, Phoenix and Shymalan off the set from what's happening on the screen.

He exists in this movie mostly as a foil for Gibson's character, and he plays that part well. He's an actor who is sexy and charismatic and has a feel of dangerousness even when you know he's solidly on the side of good things.Through a series of events surrounding an alien invasion, Gibson takes actions to protect his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (an adorable, and tiny, Abigail Breslin). As events proceed, we get flashbacks that lead us to the source of Gibson's disillusionment and loss of faith, the death of his wife in a freak car accident.This leads me somewhat obliquely to what I have to regard as this movie's biggest flaw Shyamalan doesn't seem to have much faith in the ability of his audience to see what he's getting at. He is not subtle in getting his major premise across; he wants to spell it out, then repeat it for emphasis, and then finally beat us over the head with it to make sure that we get it. This is jarring, to say the least, and it works against the movie it's hard not to feel that maybe if he feels the need to be obvious, BLATANTLY obvious, perhaps he's unsure of himself and his craft as a writer and a director. He doesn't want the material to fail but I think that if he wants to craft movies that are more than workmanlike entertainment, he has to take chances in trusting the audience and trusting himself and his ability to get things across to the audience without spelling them out so obviously.He doesn't want to take that chance, and that shows. And it hurts the movie.I kind of think that it affected Gibson and Phoenix, too. There are some moments in the film when it seems like they're just going through the motions, just reading their lines, not living them and making them live. Gibson does this more than Phoenix does, and it makes me wonder was Shyamalan afraid to call him on this and demand better from him? It's obvious to the whole world now that Gibson has quite an ego, and with his experience both in front of and behind the camera, he must be an intimidating presence to direct. Was he holding back and just going through the motions because he didn't like some of the material? Was Shyamalan unaware of how Gibson came across, or was he afraid to demand better? I don't know and it doesn't matter. Those moments when Gibson is obviously not engaged in the material are jarring.In the end, I want to recommend this film with some reservations. It's decent entertainment and has originality. It also has flaws that hold it back.But I think the bottom line in deciding whether you want to watch this film or not is whether you can disengage what you know about Gibson, Phoenix and Shymalan off the set from what's happening on the screen. If you bring their baggage to this movie, I don't think you will enjoy it at all.

While the storyline isn't anything too special and some of the acting is not very good, the film possesses an incredible imagination and a look and feel that elevate it way above most of its peers. It concerns the aftermath of a car crash, where the one survivor (Candace Hilligoss) emerges from the depths of the river-bank only to immediately start to experience all manner of otherworldly events, including regular visions of a strange and ominous amorphous man.Director Herk Harvey only ever did make this one feature film, which clearly is very unfortunate, as he displays considerable ability and ambition. The very dreamy nature of the film is really extremely well done. The camera-work is consistently good, with all manner of unusual angles and some highly effective freeze-frame stop-motion work that gives the scenes with the ghouls a very strange feel. The over-all ambiance of the movie is dreamy and weird; this is helped immeasurably by some great locations like the organ factory, the shopping mall and especially the remote carnival. This latter location is perfect for the final scenes and typifies the overall feeling that the film aims for. What helps set Carnival of Souls apart from most horror films of the time is that it just doesn't resemble any other one very much at all. It's a mood-piece as much as anything, and seems to be a genuine attempt at an art film. The look, the music and the feel are all very distinctive indeed. It only has one clear weakness and that is the scenes involving the neighbour over the hall. These parts are highly clunky, with bad dialogue. The actor playing the neighbour was a very annoying presence and his relationship with Candace Hilligoss's character was both unconvincing and completely pointless. This whole segment could have quite easily been removed with no damage to the film over all. But to a certain extent this is splitting hairs because these scenes withstanding, Carnival of Souls remains a highly atmospheric and original supernatural thriller. It's a great example of what impressive things can be achieved with so very little money.

Romero and Russ Meyer etc., and all the more, he could outshine them by a notch.The film is an authentic template of a first-rate thriller\/horror opus, which I will not bother to outline the details (for instance the over-examined bathroom slaughter scene) inasmuch as there are a wealth of professional dissertations everywhere in the digital era. I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years. The performance is uneven, in spite of the fact that the film earned the one-and-only BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Oscar nomination for Janet Leigh (which sounds not equivalent to her monumental fame though), a leading-actress-goes-supporting set-up was an unanticipated stunt for its audience at that time, which is rarely seen presently. Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's actor equals animal methodology, they are more like props than real flesh. Arguably this is my favorite Hitchcock's film right now, I think only VERTIGO (1958) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) might have the chance to overthrow it from the throne. I know it is definitely my fault and I still don't figure out how could I miss this two. P.S.

This is even the case when many of the original cast and crew members remain the same. The first Godfather movie was an exemplary classic, the second a little weaker but still largely deserving of the honours it received. Their director Francis Ford Coppola became a respected and influential man about Hollywood, although he was never quite able to recapture that success. It was almost inevitable that, after a series of disappointing features in the 1980s, he would begin flogging dead horses' heads again.Al Pacino's 80s career had been somewhat paltry as well. Not that he lost his touch - there just simply hadn't been the right roles available to him. And sadly a return to the character he portrayed in two of his finest performances isn't the much-needed booster one might expect. Aged up somewhat, he piles on the weary, decrepit mannerisms just a little too thickly. It basically looks as if Michael Corleone has got a bit of a bad back, and sounds like he has a cough. Fortunately his younger co-stars are a little more up to the game. Andy Garcia plays a hot-headed mafia scion with a degree of subtlety not normally seen in such parts. Sofia Coppola, the directors daughter, received a lot of bad press for her performance (including a Razzie), but she is really not that bad.And her father is still showing all his usual prowess as a director. Those early scenes after the award ceremony show Coppola's superb handling of mood and rhythm. His camera typically hangs back from the action &#x96; a passive observer. There are few movements or close-ups and the editing all soft cuts from one similar shot to another. Even business within the frame is fairly restrained, carefully orchestrated bits of movement, no character too animated. Eventually it becomes apparent that the whole thing is set to the languid pace of the aging Pacino. Compare this to scenes where Andy Garcia is in control, in which the action is far more jumpy, the dialogue snapped out and the players closer to the camera. The rhythmic control is carried through in the neat sequencing of events to the music of Cavalleria Rusticana and the final revenge sequence, which is almost as good as the one in The Godfather, even if it is no longer original.And a lack of originality is really what brings this movie down. Coppola's motivation for re-opening the Godfather series - supposedly he felt Michael Corleone hadn't suffered enough - is itself rather a dubious reason to make a motion picture. The Godfather Part III doesn't really make much sense if you aren't familiar with the previous instalments, and is filled with blunt references to the original that don't really add much except nod to fans of the series. This even carries as far as the shot compositions and staging. For example Pacino's meeting with the corrupt cardinal is an obvious redoing of The Godfather's famous opening. It seems Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo were so intent on working in this sort of business, they forgot to put in the intriguing plot and strong characterisation that made the originals what they are. And by sacrificing his real-life daughter in the role of Mary Corleone it even looks as if Coppola is trying to make some dreary statement about his art.

Zarkov is viewed as threat by the terrible Emperor Ming ( Max Von Skydow) who lives on another planet in the galaxy. Ming skyjacks the air bus that Flash and Dale are operating, along with capturing them in the accompaniment of Zarkov and here is where the film takes on its major animation.While still focusing on saving Earth, now from Enperor Ming, Zarkov, befriends Flash and together they set in motion the idea of saving the planet Earth from his plan of destruction. Emperor Ming views Dr. Zarkov as a threat to his kingdom, and wants his memory wiped clean back to his birth, but he manages to manipulate the process to keep his own thoughts safeguarded. This is your typical hero type of movie that saves the day, where Flash Gordon is the hero, originated from a comic strip just as Superman or Spiderman are turned into superhuman form in film, so is Flash Gordon. Maintaining the theme it becomes a battle of who will rule the galaxy, as the beings from Emperor Mings galaxy begin to lose ground against the three humans who eventually gain the trust of some of Ming's own people. Ming's galaxy is still divided by the different class of citizens, like the winged citizens, versus the others. Each battles for their own identity within the kingdom to begin with, and now you throw humans into the mix. None are quick to take sides with the humans to overthrow the terrible Emperor Ming but in the end, this is exactly what happens. Earth is saved from Ming's destruction, and Ming's kingdom is turned over to his daughter and her husband, after the destruction of Emperor Ming. The hero is none other than Flash Gordon, as is emphasized in the end, with a human gesture of saying Thanks. The hero saves the day, galaxy and Earth. Not bad for a days work!

Although it brings us a nice message about our natural environment and its preservation, many points in this movie annoyed me deeply. In my opinion, the biggest problem of the movie is the lack of scientific coherence. For example, in the movie, the crew lives inside that ship just as if they were in Earth's gravity, but there is no explanation or device that could create such gravity. Explosions in the space make loud sounds, although sound waves do not propagate in vacuum. OK, you can argue this is a fiction movie and in a fiction unimaginable things happen; but these things are more than unimaginable, they are scientifically incoherent. Also the reason why the ships with those forests were in the orbit of Saturn is not explained and seems a complete nonsense to me.Other reason for the low score is that some scenes are boring, stupid and add nothing to the movie. Seems they were filmed only to occupy time. The robots seems to be homemade, just like some scenes. In my view, the positive points of the film are only two the special effects are good for a movie made in 1972, and the message the it brings is nice. I watched this movie because Arthur C. Clarke mentioned it the epilogue of the book 2001 Space Odissey, but I'm really disappointed. I expected more from a movie cited by one of the more incredible science fiction books ever written.
