Being origially promoted as a intelligent teen horror film it became so much more and it will live to become a cult classic. This film will live on as one of the seminal films of its time because it is so incredibly well made. The film was amazingly well cast and it succeeded to create suspense and drama with a shoe-string budget where as films with millions of dollars fall flat on their face.Donnie Darko should be viewed at least twice so that you can pick out details that you may have missed during the first run through. It's an incredibly deep film and there is a lot to be inferred from the subtext. If you don't have the patience to go through it multiple times and pick things out then I'd recommend seeing the director's cut. While the film is longer and it explains a lot more of what happened and why, I feel that it sort of dumbs down the experience and hands the viewer the story rather than having them invest themselves in the film.

He works for a sprawling company, has an expensive condo, nice clothes, and an average routine. But life is boring--- full of anonymous people, hotel rooms, Ikea, and TV dinners.Enter Tyler Durden, a bizarre and addictive man who lives in a terrible house and is the absolute antithesis of corporate America. He is intriguing, amazing, dangerous--- everything Edward Norton's character wants to be. Enter Marla, a strange young woman he meets in the support groups he attends (through a false name and a pretend illness).

And for some reason I have never seen the movie for myself until now. And now 10 years after it was originally released, I can now see what all the praise is about. And in my opinion, no movie in my mind even compares to this one. Not ever have I felt this way before after watching a movie. When I finished watching this film it took me a good while to realize where I was and realize that what I was watching was not in fact a part of my life. This movie let me escape reality for a little while, and made me forget about everything that was going on in my life. When people are stressed and want to get away, they spend thousands of dollars on a vacation. But if you don't have money to spend, just watch this movie. Even though you only escape from your everyday life for a couple hours, it will make you feel like you were away for a long time. And will give you a better sense of how important it is to keep hope, and to never give up, as life is too beautiful to run away from. This movie really should be #1 on IMDb but #2 ain't bad. Definitely my favourite movie ever because it is so much more than a movie. It's a means of just escaping the stress in your life and in the end, makes you feel really really good about life. Whenever I'm feeling down, I'll put on this movie, and realize how beautiful the world we live in is.

The following is a list of comments I have read and felt deemed a response. I am not a movie critic, and I'm not a writer which means the following comments will be simple.1. This movie is too long. It is long. I did not feel it was too long. There have been movies that were excellently done and I have wondered why they cut it short. I didn't feel that way during this movie. It was just right.2. Too many characters are developed. I'd like to hear from those who said this which characters didn't need to be developed. Everyone played a role, everyone had a purpose, and everyone did a good job.3. It's too chaotic\/Too many subplots. I'd like to hear from those who said this what they would have eliminated from the movie. We needed to see the old Tom Hanks in the beginning so he could tell his story. We needed all the steps in between to feel crushed when John Coffey is executed. We needed to see how the death of the girls unfolded. Nothing was out of place and nothing was extra. It's also worth mentioning that a complicated canvas of characters and events more closely resembles life. Perhaps it's time movies start doing this more often. If a Russian novelist can get awards for writing a painfully detailed story, why shouldn't a movie?4. The acting was subpar. Come on. Right. I don't want to be the one to say that crying during a scene means it was well done; that is certainly not correct. You cry during the Green Mile because you are in the movie. When someone acts badly, it's hard to suspend your disbelief. The acting was not goofy.5. The humor threw the rhythm of the movie off. 3 hours of serious is a lot of serious. Stephen King likes to throw humor into even his darkest of novels (and movies). It works in the horror stories, and it works here.6. What's the deal with this supernatural stuff? Hey, it's a cool addition. Probably it could have been written without the flies and healing, but why? After all, it is Stephen King.7. The Delecroix execution was too violent. And electrocution isn't? Hey, we live in a society where we kill people for being too bad. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the ethics of it, but if they author was trying to make a point, he did it well. And again, I say It's Stephen King. He likes the violence, and this was a nice way to get it in there.My final opinion, being the completely unqualified and inexperienced critic that I am, is this movie is really good. The acting was precise, the unfolding of events was well orchestrated, the development of the plot was enjoyable, and most will not feel like it is too long.

It was an ingenious idea--$2 mm home movie, highly improvised, fine director in Steven Soderberg, a very talented cast, complex movie within movie (within movie--as the last shot shows) structure--but the result is far less than the sum of its parts. It's a dirty patch on the bootsoles of all involved comparable only to Spielberg's AI--which was until I watched Full Frontal the worst film by a talented director I had ever seen.I won't bother reprising what passes for a plot. Suffice it to say that the film covers 24 hours, and feels longer. It's rather like being trapped watching the home movies of a group of very artsy, very neurotic, very self centered, and ultimately very boring people. If I were to single out one aspect that is particularly like fingernails on the blackboard, it is Catherine Keener as Lee. I must say that it's probably a pretty good piece of acting, since Lee is every man's nightmare--needy, self centered, manipulative, cruel (her office behavior would get her fired at any decent firm--of course the character is an HR person, and so there is a drop of reality there), and completely loathsome. She makes any Woody Allen neurotic look like the poster child for mental health. It's probably not an unrealistic portrait of a certain kind of woman. The question is, do you want to spend even 101 minutes with her?I decided to watch this based on favorable buzz I had heard. Learn from my error. Avoid at all costs. This is 101 minutes of mind-numbingly self centered Hollywood masturbation, without a single relieving touch of charm or humor. I hope that Mr. Soderberg has the grace to blush when this leaden turkey is mentioned.

Sure, forty-plus years of pop-culture saturation had made me aware of the basic outline of Psycho--the plot, the music, the shower scene--but never had I sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Well, no time like the present.What is it that makes Psycho haunt and disquiet us, even today? Certainly there are plenty of movies out there that are more gruesome, with higher body counts and more graphic portrayals of sudden and bloody death. And there are many films good at providing sudden scares and shocking denouements. Yet so few make us glance uneasily over our shoulders or shiver in quiet moments long after they've ended. Perhaps it's because Alfred Hitchcock has created a picture of evil that is not only very real on screen, but is also disturbingly recognizable and accessible.In Psycho, we are reminded that darkness and death are far closer to us than we like to believe. That any person, given desperation enough and temptation enough, might resort to grand theft as Marion Crane (Leigh) does.That someone so shy and genial as Norman Bates (played to perfection by Anthony Perkins) can be possessed of terrible secrets. That the space between life and death is a brief one indeed, one which we can cross (or be pushed over) at any time or place through a door, at the top of the stair, or--of course--when we are naked and vulnerable in the shower. We don't think about these things; we cannot if we are to function in life. But Hitchcock makes us pause and remember them for a few moments.With so much focus on that famous shower scene, it's easy to forget that there are many moments of brilliance here. Such as Marion's clearly-drawn paranoia when she's absconding with that money. The deliberate manner in which Norman cleans up after Mother. The death of Detective Arbogast, in its own way as sudden and shocking as poor Marion's demise. And the final revelation, which was no doubt a surprise to the first audiences and which now in retrospect makes the rest of the film even more chilling.And of course, there's Norman Bates himself. Nervous, accommodating, and seemingly harmless (at least until he's revealed spying on Marion's room), the last person you'd expect to have blood on his hands. But after all, isn't that what we always hear people saying on the news, as some neighbor or relative is taken away for a brutal crime? I can hardly believe it...he was quiet and kept to himself, but he seemed like such a nice person.

We have long grown accustomed to this aspect of life, no longer shocked or even surprised at what goes on even in our own neighborhoods. A Clockwork Orange, although extreme in its depiction of terror, is actually not that far from the mark of realism. Made in 1971, this was considered a very brutal film for its time. In 2002, I still wonder why this movie is only rated R. It contains a lot of scenes of rape, nudity, graphic violence, and other mayhem that I believe caused it to be banned in several countries. But it has also won praise from many critics and is considered to be a cult classic.Set in near-future England, this film tells the story of Alex. On the surface, Alex (played by twenty-something Malcolm McDowell) is a typical teenage boy who engages in meaningless conversations with his parents, puts on a good show in front his counselor... and does other things to keep up appearances. However, Alex is a gang member who indulges in every sort of impulsive criminal activity possible while listening to Beethoven to psyche himself up.One night, Alex and his gang break into a lady's house. The rest of the gang is outside while Alex struggles with the lady until he eventually kills her. After Alex leaves the house, his gang turns on him and leaves him to fend for himself until the police arrive.Alex is sent to prison. After a while, Alex wants to reform. He has a chance when a new behavioral experiment called the Ludovico treatment is in need of guinea pigs. Alex volunteers. The experiment is a brainwashing method that causes Alex to be sickened by any form of sex or violence. It even causes him to be sickened by Beethoven's music. After Alex is released from prison, several things happen. His family disowns him, his former friends are now police officers that assault him, and the experiment has other side effects than just eliminating his urges. He is no longer able to defend himself when attacked as well.This is not an easy movie to watch with the numerous physically and emotionally violent scenes, but it does make you ask yourself a few things. Is society justified in destroying a predator by creating a victim? Or who needs reform the most the criminals or the society that continues to punish them after their legitimate sentences have been served? The film is not one that offers any quick or easy answers, yet it shows a perspective of societal problems that is equally timely for 1971 or 2002.Clearly not for mixed audiences, this film demands an open mind as well as a worldy view. To look inside of the warped mind of a recreational violent bully and search for the human hidden somewhere requires much forgiveness and a sense of wanting to help rather than seek revenge. An important film, indeed. Sadly, extremely violent and disturbing scenes make this film unsuitable for teens up to age 15 or 16. At a mature age, this film shold be viewed by everyone as a Scared Straight lesson about the role of violence in modern society.

School shootings, child abductions, wars in various parts of the world, evil inflicted on innocent fellow human beings. We have long grown accustomed to this aspect of life, no longer shocked or even surprised at what goes on even in our own neighborhoods. A Clockwork Orange, although extreme in its depiction of terror, is actually not that far from the mark of realism. Made in 1971, this was considered a very brutal film for its time. In 2002, I still wonder why this movie is only rated R. It contains a lot of scenes of rape, nudity, graphic violence, and other mayhem that I believe caused it to be banned in several countries. But it has also won praise from many critics and is considered to be a cult classic.Set in near-future England, this film tells the story of Alex. On the surface, Alex (played by twenty-something Malcolm McDowell) is a typical teenage boy who engages in meaningless conversations with his parents, puts on a good show in front his counselor... and does other things to keep up appearances. However, Alex is a gang member who indulges in every sort of impulsive criminal activity possible while listening to Beethoven to psyche himself up.One night, Alex and his gang break into a lady's house. The rest of the gang is outside while Alex struggles with the lady until he eventually kills her. After Alex leaves the house, his gang turns on him and leaves him to fend for himself until the police arrive.Alex is sent to prison. After a while, Alex wants to reform. He has a chance when a new behavioral experiment called the Ludovico treatment is in need of guinea pigs. Alex volunteers. The experiment is a brainwashing method that causes Alex to be sickened by any form of sex or violence. It even causes him to be sickened by Beethoven's music. After Alex is released from prison, several things happen. His family disowns him, his former friends are now police officers that assault him, and the experiment has other side effects than just eliminating his urges. He is no longer able to defend himself when attacked as well.This is not an easy movie to watch with the numerous physically and emotionally violent scenes, but it does make you ask yourself a few things. Is society justified in destroying a predator by creating a victim? Or who needs reform the most the criminals or the society that continues to punish them after their legitimate sentences have been served? The film is not one that offers any quick or easy answers, yet it shows a perspective of societal problems that is equally timely for 1971 or 2002.Clearly not for mixed audiences, this film demands an open mind as well as a worldy view. To look inside of the warped mind of a recreational violent bully and search for the human hidden somewhere requires much forgiveness and a sense of wanting to help rather than seek revenge. An important film, indeed. Sadly, extremely violent and disturbing scenes make this film unsuitable for teens up to age 15 or 16.

Although Kurosawa himself thought of this film as a mere dress rehearsal,a preparation for Ran, Kagemusha carries its own distinctive essence which makes it a work in the same category as its successor.The story deals around one of the greatest feudal lords and generals in Japan's history, Takeda Shingen, showing his unexpected and untimely demise. Although Shingen is the most powerful figure here, he is used as a monument around which everything revolves and not as the principal hero.This film is full of sad and tragic moments, starting with Shingen's untimely death and culminating with the rebuking of his impersonator, Kagemusha. Nakadai plays the dual roles wonderfully. He is so emotionally involved in his part as Kagemusha that it seems almost uncanny. Thus we see why Kurosawa has chosen him as Mifune's successor. The other actors are also splendid and specially young Daisuke Ryu makes a startling appearance as Shingen's arch rival Oda Nobunaga.The ending is very hard to watch, both the scene where Kagemusha is thrown out in the rain and the last scene which illustrates the death of the Takeda clan. What makes this film a pleasure to watch is the incredible cinematography and photography, specially in the incredible dream sequence where the ghost of Shingen chases Kagemusha through red clouds, as well as the hauntingly beautiful music and marvelous performances.All in all, this is a great film that will grow on you the more you watch it.

In fact, despite a pretty faithful cult following and a starring role from Mel Gibson, I don't think this movie has or ever will be widely embraced by the mainstream, and time certainly won't be doing it any favors. But this was the 80's, probably the decade I'm most nostalgic towards (either that or the mid-90's), so I can at least view The Road Warrior as an effective time capsule for what passed for escapist film-making back then, basically a lot of blood, rusty cars, double-barreled shotguns, and an armored-up eighteen-wheeler that does a whole lot of smashing. Yeah, I miss the 80's.The Road Warrior is the follow-up to the low-budget revenge piece Mad Max. Set presumably a few years later, civilization around the world has apparently collapsed due to decreasing gasoline production and the resulting world war. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), still driving aimlessly in the middle of nowhere, spends his time getting into chases and scavenging whatever gasoline he can get his hands on. With a little information obtained from a gyropilot (don't ask), Max discovers a fuel refinery that's being besieged by a gang of marauders. Using the situation to his advantage, Max offers to provide them with a means of transporting the gasoline in exchange for a few gallons of the fuel. The group accepts his offer, but complications arise that get Max further involved than he'd anticipated.Never a great movie to start with, The Road Warrior is distinguished more by its interminably slow pace than anything else. The worst part is that all the slow moments aren't devoted to the usual details that make an action film great, namely character development, plot, smart dialogue, etc. There are actually a number of long, wordless stretches in the film in which the protagonist does little more than observe a hostile situation or merely just walks around from one arid destination to another. Max might have been the film's most potentially interesting character, but writer\/director George Miller is perfectly content with letting Gibson do nothing more than scowl, wield a gun, and occasionally drive his (quite dusty-looking) car. It's fair to say this may have been the simplest approach given the premise, but it's certainly not the most enthralling one. The group Max finds himself defending is considerably less interesting, a slightly disorganized band living in a cleverly constructed compound whose occupants have somehow managed to maintain their sanity amidst the chaos. The group lacks the strong sense of camaraderie that's needed to sustain life in such a primeval setting (though there is sort of an unspoken, mutual understanding among them). A couple of heated arguments between the leaders aside, the tribe doesn't really do much other than serve as fodder for the car chases.The villains are a little more interesting, but they're given the short shrift. Two particular standouts the hockey mask-wearing Humungus, who has a distinctively gravelly voice and a pretty twisted sense of leadership (he literally leashes up one of his men for disobedience). And as Brian Wright of Cavalcade of Schlock already pointed out, there's a you have to see it to believe it scene where he's waving his arms around, looking like he's composing a score while a number of good guys are being tortured. The other standout is Vernon Wells' Wez, and if you're at all familiar with Wells' work in Commando, you know he just makes a great over-the-top villain. Unfortunately, the other villains aren't the slightest bit distinguished except for the manner in which they're dressed.To sum everything I've said up to this point, characters and plot aren't the reasons to watch the film. Rather, it's the film's chase scenes that make The Road Warrior recommendable, and while they seem kind of sparse when considering the really long dead spots in the picture, there's no question that the action hits hard and fast when it comes. By far the best sequence is the climactic fourteen-minute desert chase, with nearly a dozen vehicles vying for the gasoline being transported by an eighteen-wheeler. Even Brian May's bombastic score, which sounds like Bernard Herrmann on steroids, works wonderfully. About the only thing that doesn't work in this scene is the use of sped-up footage, but that's a minor gripe compared to the sheer thrills of the spectacle. Without a doubt, it's easily one of the best and most elaborate chase scenes ever filmed. Interestingly, 1981 proved to be a breakout year for action stars. Kurt Russell took leading man reins in Escape From New York and, more famously, Harrison Ford slung his way to superstardom in Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film which continues to overshadow The Road Warrior, if only because it was far more accessible to mainstream audiences. Well, that and the fact it's a much better movie. The Road Warrior was followed by a sequel, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, which, however blasphemous and atypical this might be, I actually liked more.

It's not a truly absurdist play, nor a true tragedy. It's not supposed to be. It is, however, in both written and acted (movie and stage) form, existentialism at its finest. Its not an easy play or movie to understand. It may even take reading the play before watching the movie to grasp what it's truly about and what these characters are saying. I've read it twice and just recently seeing the stage play brought out things (forshadowings, subtext, etc) I hadn't noticed while reading it.

It's not a truly absurdist play, nor a true tragedy. It's not supposed to be. It is, however, in both written and acted (movie and stage) form, existentialism at its finest. Its not an easy play or movie to understand. It may even take reading the play before watching the movie to grasp what it's truly about and what these characters are saying. I've read it twice and just recently seeing the stage play brought out things (forshadowings, subtext, etc) I hadn't noticed while reading it.

That's exactly what happened here. I never felt like buying or even renting it, because it looked like a typical brainless James Bond movie with a lot of explosions and stupid gadgets (sorry for the people who love James Bond movies, it's just not my style). But I have to admit that this time my feeling was completely wrong.It was shown on television on a Saturday night. I didn't think I would like it but I taped it anyway, because the reviews in the magazines were quite good. Today I didn't have much better to do so I watched it and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story isn't unique. A CIA agent, one day away from his retirement, tries to save a young colleague out of the hands of the Chinese. He was captured when trying to liberate the woman he loves from a military prison. He's being tortured by the Chinese and he'll be executed the next 24 hours. Nothing new I hear you say, a typical Hollywood script you think. True, but Robert Redfort and Brad Pitt really acted very well and the director, Tony Scott, did an excellent job by using flash backs all the time. At first these flash backs made the movie a bit confusing, but as the story progresses it really gives you a better idea on who these people are, what they have in common, why they are in that particular situation ...All in all this is an intelligent spy movie, who will not be liked by everyone (especially not by people who want to see plenty of action shots with a lot of guns and explosions), but which certainly appealed to me. I give it a 7.5\/10.

I love it not so much for the so-so plot, but because of the edge of your seat action and mind blowing special effects. Keep in mind when watching this movie that every twister in the movie was computer generated, amazing! If you have a good home theatre system, with a surround sound stereo setup and a big screen HDTV this movie will take you on a great thrill ride. I was just glad I was watching the movie and not *in* the movie, scary stuff! I'm in California so this movie probably amazes me more than it would someone that lives in tornado alley. Those people would probably feel the same amazement about an earthquake movie that I felt about this tornado movie. I think Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt did some great acting as well. BRAVO!
