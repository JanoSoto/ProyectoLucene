I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.This film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.Despite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.To sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy.

I think it is right to say that the film is a classic not just in Disney terms but for cinema as a whole. There is something truly magical about the film, it is such an enjoyable film that once it grips you it is impossible to forget. It is clear that this is the work of Walt Disney, the Sherman brothers and the excellent cast all at the top of their games. It is one of a select range of films that will never go out of date and can be enjoyed at any age, it remains a wonderful achievement.The story sees the dysfunctional Banks family of London in need of a nanny to look after their two children. The seemingly magical Mary Poppins fills the role and sets about trying to bring the children closer to their rather distant father. With the help of Cockney jack-of- all-trades Burt, Mary and the children go on a series of adventures with the view to improve the family's relationships. The story is now extremely well-known, but that doesn't lessen its impact in any way and I think as a straight-up story it could not be bettered. I like how there's more going on than simply making the family better, with the whole idea of helping Mr. Banks himself. The story knows when to add more drama or add more fun and that's what keeps it so feeling so fresh.As a person who doesn't enjoy signing in films I have to admit I think every single song used in the film is fantastic. It's amazing how well- crafted and catchy all these songs really are, with the Sherman Brothers deserving acclaim for their work. The songs are all so good in their own ways, I love the serene 'Stay Awake', the emotion of 'Feed the Birds' and the sheer energy of 'Step in Time'. They are all classic tunes for a reason and they stay in your head in the most pleasant way that is possible.The performances were key and thankfully all the cast are excellent. Julie Andrews won an Oscar as Mary Poppins as she puts in a truly wonderful turn as the stern but sweet nanny. Everything from her firm delivery to her lovely singing hits the mark, she also has superb chemistry with the rest of the cast. It is hard to think of anyone else in the role. Dick Van Dyke presents one of the dodgiest Cockney accents of all time, but luckily his performance makes up for it. You won't see many actors put as much energy into a part as he does and that's what wins him over, his incredible dancing and comic abilities are put to full use here. He is also naturally likable and makes Burt someone we enjoy being around, a key piece as he acts as the audiences guide. Elsewhere David Tomlinson is brilliant as the strict George Banks, a man who cares about being king of his castle a little too much. He has a soft charm that allows you to understand Mr. Banks' plight despite his harsh actions. The sweet natured Glynis Johns is very amusing as Winifred Banks, always pushing for women's rights. Both Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are excellent as the Banks children, they avoid usual child actor traps as they are both very charming and have many funny moments. The support from Ed Wynn as the easily amused Uncle Albert and Reginald Owen as the eccentric Admiral Boom is top notch. These are all memorable characters that are impossible to dislike.The film is also a visual marvel. It shows the stunning production work that went into proceedings as the film was filmed entirely in Disney's California studios. It has such an authentic feel to it and manages to visualise the streets of Edwardian London in a style that is just beautiful to view. From the cobbled streets to the murky rooftops it all looks wondrous, not to mention the scenes showing the London skyline and the red sunset as they just look glorious. The scenes that involve animation blending with the live-action look very good, they have hardly dated to be fair and it's a technique that is somewhat enchanting. When you have Dick Van Dyke dancing with animated penguins then it is hard not to get carried away. There are so many memorable scenes to be appreciated. The visit to Uncle Albert's which ends up being a Tea Party on the celling, the merry-go round that leads to Mary Poppins winning a horse race or the already mentioned Step in Time scene which is so entertaining that you wish it would never end. The most poignant scene is certainly Mr. Banks walk to the bank for the last time, the sombre image of him walking through deserted streets is quite something, as the crisp lighting and beautiful music add massive amounts of atmosphere. It's great how the film allows there to be some deeper pieces as that offers it even more balance.I'd have to say Mary Poppins is a true classic. It really is a film that can appeal immensely to any age, as there is something here that anybody can relate to no matter what. It's so difficult to find any faults with the film and I think that is praise enough, nothing really needs changing because it is all so good. The performances of Andrews and Van Dyke cannot be praised enough, the support (especially Tomlinson) is outstanding, the music is so of the best put to film, the visuals are stunning and there is a real emotion to the story that draws you in. Mary Poppins is just a magical experience that can be enjoyed over and over again.

In this corner is Steven Spielberg, the prince of Suburbia, who &#x96; more than any other filmmaker &#x96; understands the world of middle-class America. In the other corner is Tobe Hooper, the mastermind behind one of the best and most unsettling horror films of the 1970s, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Their efforts together create a brilliant haunted house movie that both tenderly shows us a family in crisis but also the strange, supernatural events taking place around them.The credits give the reigns to Hooper, but Spielberg is the architect here. He was contractually forbidden from directing a film while preparing E.T. so he gave Hooper the directing credits. We see Spielberg's world, the same settled-in American suburb that we have seen in Close Encounters, E.T. and Jaws. Their home never feels like a set. There is a lived-in feel to it. Look around the living room, the kid's bedroom, the kitchen. Everything feels like it's been there for years, not like a prop man set it up just before the cameras rolled. That, I think, settles our minds into the reality of this house.Hooper's style comes from the special effects elements. We are familiar with his other films and we can see some of the inspiration of Texas Chain Saw Massacre here - rotting corpses, flesh ripping, demonic faces, and decay. We remember his elements in that Texas house all those years ago and much of it exists here.The villains here are hardly ever seen. They're ghosts, lots of them apparently. We are never sure how many. There's some discussion of The Beast but what does that mean? In the supernatural half of the film we are led to believe that they are full of surprises, that they can open a portal to the next dimension and take the family away. On the reality side of things are Spielberg's favorite villains &#x96; corporate America, the same kinds of people who didn't want to close the beaches in Jaws for fear of losing summer dollars. Here their machinations are much worse, a real-estate company that made a very bad decision.Yet, this film is successful, I think, because of the human characters. There's a close-knit family, and to our surprise, one that we actually care about. Mom and Dad &#x96; Steven and Diane Freeling &#x96; Steve is a real estate agent and former football player. Diane is a former flower child turned doting mother and housewife. The kids are just as defined. There's 16 year-old Dana, whose forward-thinking attention is more attuned to her social life than anything going on at home. There's 8 year-old Robbie, who finds fear in the most normal of everyday objects like a stuffed animal and a tree outside the window. And there's 5 year-old, cherubic Carol Anne, who is prone to sleepwalking and whose attention seems unsettlingly distracted.If not for the production design and the well-defined characters, the movie would be a complete wash-out. Like The Exorcist or Carrie the movie has to be grounded in reality for the supernatural stuff to be effective. That's especially true of the characters who arrive later, after Carol Anne has been kidnapped and taken to the next dimension. It might have been fatal if the movie had been led by the investigating parapsychologists or even the erudite medium that blows in to explain the situation. Their work is so foreign to us, that putting them at the film's center might have made the movie seem like an episode of The Twilight Zone. If there is a weakness in the film, it probably comes from the myriad attempts to explain what is going on. The parapsychologist has her explanation. The medium has hers. Even the evil real estate developer has his explanation. Yet, it never really comes together, and after a while they all feel like club-footed theories. Late in the film there is a long-winded explanation of the supernatural forces that have kidnapped Carol Anne, and why, slows that I think slows the picture down. It reminds me of the blabbering psychiatrist at the end of Psycho, who comes on to explain the plot, when we in the audience don't really care. Get on with it.Yet, it is unfair to be snide about a movie like this. You kind of have to go with it. If there is an illustration of where Poltergeist succeeds, it must be in its comparison with The Amityville Horror which tells almost the same story but is a complete mess. That film did everything wrong that Poltergeist did right. It was a haunted house movie that only cared about the special effects, tossing the characters around like pegs. Also, that film allowed the horror to extend outside the house for no reason. In Poltergeist, the terror stays home and that lends it a bit of credibility. Grounding the supernatural events to the house allows us to orient our minds to some measure of limits. There have to be rules, otherwise the movie feels like it's just a bucket of special effects with no purpose.

There's 16 year-old Dana, whose forward-thinking attention is more attuned to her social life than anything going on at home. There's 8 year-old Robbie, who finds fear in the most normal of everyday objects like a stuffed animal and a tree outside the window. And there's 5 year-old, cherubic Carol Anne, who is prone to sleepwalking and whose attention seems unsettlingly distracted.If not for the production design and the well-defined characters, the movie would be a complete wash-out. Like The Exorcist or Carrie the movie has to be grounded in reality for the supernatural stuff to be effective. That's especially true of the characters who arrive later, after Carol Anne has been kidnapped and taken to the next dimension. It might have been fatal if the movie had been led by the investigating parapsychologists or even the erudite medium that blows in to explain the situation. Their work is so foreign to us, that putting them at the film's center might have made the movie seem like an episode of The Twilight Zone. If there is a weakness in the film, it probably comes from the myriad attempts to explain what is going on. The parapsychologist has her explanation. The medium has hers. Even the evil real estate developer has his explanation. Yet, it never really comes together, and after a while they all feel like club-footed theories. Late in the film there is a long-winded explanation of the supernatural forces that have kidnapped Carol Anne, and why, slows that I think slows the picture down. It reminds me of the blabbering psychiatrist at the end of Psycho, who comes on to explain the plot, when we in the audience don't really care. Get on with it.Yet, it is unfair to be snide about a movie like this. You kind of have to go with it. If there is an illustration of where Poltergeist succeeds, it must be in its comparison with The Amityville Horror which tells almost the same story but is a complete mess. That film did everything wrong that Poltergeist did right. It was a haunted house movie that only cared about the special effects, tossing the characters around like pegs. Also, that film allowed the horror to extend outside the house for no reason. In Poltergeist, the terror stays home and that lends it a bit of credibility. Grounding the supernatural events to the house allows us to orient our minds to some measure of limits. There have to be rules, otherwise the movie feels like it's just a bucket of special effects with no purpose. Poltergeist is a prime example of how to make a haunted house movie under the best of filmmaking talent.***1\/2 (of four) ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"2 February 2014","score":"","review":" I was so shocked with Pink Flamingos that it's hard, I mean really hard to give my opinion about it.

This mindset of how the world works results in the rich being prosperous and entitled while the poor are miserable and shunned. In short, various developments (whether it's the invention of new technologies or events that make us question the unity of humanity) have made us more selfish and isolated from one another. I'm saying this since I believe the primary reason that silent film legend Charlie Chaplin had a lasting impact is because while he confirms that we live in this kind of world, he pulls off something in his films that's very difficult to do. He somehow reassures us that everything will be okay no matter how hard you fall and that there are still people out there who help out other people. And very few films of Chaplin's have proved this more effectively than his 1931 silent masterpiece, City Lights. This silent romantic comedy follows Chaplin's famous Tramp character as he meets a pretty but blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) who mistakes him for a millionaire. That night, the Tramp also meets a drunken millionaire (Harry Myers) and saves him from suicide. As a way of thanking the Tramp for saving him from himself, this millionaire immediately considers him a friend and welcomes the Tramp to his mansion. After they go for a chaotic night on the town, the millionaire sobers up the next day unable to recognize the Tramp in the slightest and kicks him out. So, the Tramp runs into the blind flower girl again and starts initiating a special relationship with her. He also runs into the same millionaire a second time and in his drunken state invites him back to his mansion. From there, certain events eventually ensue in which the Tramp does whatever he can to help pay for the blind girl's eye operation by taking advantage of his unusual friendship with this millionaire. To write, direct or star in a film with or without sound is one thing. But to write, direct AND star in a film that is technically silent yet has a few bits of sound and a musical score is another thing. With City Lights, Charlie Chaplin had successfully pulled off an intensely strenuous task. On top of the fact that he decided to make a silent picture in the midst of the talking pictures becoming the talk of the town, he had to write, direct AND act in this film. Anyone can tell you that it's a monumental responsibility to pull off all three of these tasks and still produce a high quality film. And the reason that Chaplin had rightfully become a major influence on the film industry isn't just because he's written, directed and starred in excellent pictures, but because these pictures are still being enjoyed by modern audiences today even if they are silent. That's the true sign of a timeless piece of filmmaking. What I particularly loved about City Lights, as well as with Modern Times (1936), is that its direction is emotionally equivalent to an efficient and smooth roller coaster ride. In other words, Chaplin does a fantastic job at switching back and forth between comedic and dramatic moments seamlessly. One moment you're genuinely laughing at the trouble that the Tramp gets into, the other moment you're feeling pity for the troubles he's experiencing. One moment you feel like your hopes are crushed and nothing's going to be okay, the other you feel like all hope is restored and everything will turn out fine. The bottom line is that this is the kind of experience you can expect from City Lights throughout. An example of a scene that demonstrates this emotional experience in action is the boxing scene. The scenario is this. The Tramp has to fight in a fake boxing match to win money that will help with the blind girl's financial troubles. A fellow boxer agrees to split the prize 50- 50, so that they both technically would win. Unfortunately, this boxer has to bail out of the match since the police are on to him and the boxer that the Tramp has to contend with now says that the winner takes all. And throughout the match, the Tramp uses a hilarious strategy to try and win the match by hiding behind the referee as much as he can. I won't reveal anything else at this point to those who haven't seen the film yet and want to. All I can say is that this entire scene is representative of the film as a whole a film that walks steadily on a fine line between comedy and drama and pulls it off perfectly. What's even more admirable is that it's all done solely through visuals and background music. Seeing that this is a silent film, it makes sense to incorporate some over exaggerated actions namely Chaplin's clumsiness in the restaurant with the millionaire. Like animated films, silent pictures depend heavily on their visuals in able to help the film express itself more strongly since of course there's no sound to assist the visuals. And most of the time, the only way it can pull off such a thing is by over exaggerating certain actions. By doing so, we can get more of an idea visually of what our main character is experiencing and therefore be able to relate to him more. And Chaplin hits just the right note as far as that's concerned. Chaplin's silent pictures, especially City Lights, have lasted more than any other films from the silent era and for good reason. Their stories about persevering to the best of your ability no matter what harsh circumstances you're under have been nothing short of inspiring and uplifting. And no one can fail at seeing that.

","genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"2 February 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called spaghetti western trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series Rawhide when the films were produced but since then has achieved super stardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protégé, the incomparable John Wayne.I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen.Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated.In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film Dr. Zhivago were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.

The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series Rawhide when the films were produced but since then has achieved super stardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protégé, the incomparable John Wayne.I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen.Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated.In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film Dr. Zhivago were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.

Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made.

However, we, as the viewers of the 21st century find it really hard to absorb that imagination in the pure form of its initial motives. Do we see the real only? Do we even bother with some products of our minds? Has technology made us a more 'down to earth' practical children of modern times? Can we genuinely smile at the protagonist who crosses the borderline of 'normal behaviour'? Or, in his case, do we rather seek some psychological attempts, some sophisticated stuff that would put the character within a drawer with effort to psychoanalyze him. Lee Ryan's quotation I have entailed at the beginning of this review might prompt certain answers to some of the questions.The strength of Henry Koster's movie (and his 'vivid and droll direction' as Bosley Crowther memorably points out) lies in this 'unreal' aspect of the story. James Stewart, interviewed in March 1990, recalled that this was one of those movies of his that he had a soft spot for. A truly versatile actor recalled this very role as unique in its seriousness and wit alike. It is him, apart from some wonderful co-stars, who makes this movie unforgettable. Let me focus on his performance for a while.JAMES STEWART beautifully combines the serious and humorous aspects of his character. The seriousness lies in the whole creation of his inner world, his pal - a big rabbit called Harvey - who, at times, truly may infect our vision and make us all (like his sister) visualize a character who somehow stands at his side. This desire of someone's presence that may ease the pain of loneliness is an excellent inspiration for some psychoanalytical notions. At the same time, humour helps us all resist the temptation of falling into tense stuff that would result in some scientific approach. Humour is superior in most of the scenes and James Stewart delivers it, inspires it and creates it skillfully. This wonderfully warm and sympathetic presentation of a character mentioned by Bosley Crowther and its wistfully sweet appreciation of the innocence of a benevolent lush are revealed in Stewart's performance. Other co-stars.JOSEPHINE HULL with the theatrical aspect in her acting and the tremendous impact upon the emotional resonance of the people who 'live with' the protagonist leave a lasting impression in every viewer. From the absorbing moments of wit to some touches of (today we might say) overacting perfectly work in creating a captivating character who, by the way, is easily scandalized and yet influenced by 'an imaginary friend.'

You have to take into an account that this movie helped bringing down the so called Motion Picture Production Code of Hollywood in 1968.

I can't really imagine how I would have accepted this film if it was made in 2013 for example, but I'm pretty sure that it still would have been a sensation. Why? Well, because it is open-minded, symbolic and we, as society, still have almost all the same prejudices. It's not really about breaking through them, it is more about expressing what we feel and stressing out that there aren't so many values left in this chaotic egocentric modern society. The fashion photographer is a symbol of glamor, style and fulfillment. But when we look at this blowup, we see nothing more than chaotic actions leading to dissatisfaction and alienation. The truth is that the main character is lost in his art and his job and feels frustrated that he cannot express himself the right way.

But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends.Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten.

Now, i watched it again a quarter of century later and I'm amazed to see that the fantastic here is that the movie is still totally actual, albeit it's dated historically as the boy is a great fan of Star Wars merchandising. I can read that Spielberg was more at the helm that it seems if i can't tell what really happened, this movie is for me the house next block to the Elliot's one. In other words, ET and Poltergeist share the same world, the same feeling, it's the same Californian suburb, the same family meeting supernatural and they have both excellent soundtrack! The only difference is the first is about light and the second is rather darkness. Now, i don't find the movie really frightening (see my review for Prince of Darkness) but I'm rather moved by the family great home, liberal and caring parents, sweet kids. The cast is just amazing and for sure, little Heather facing the big screen (her TV as well the movie one) is just happiness, innocence, childhood incarnated (helped with big brother Oliver) and her late fate (as well as big sister Dominique) just make me cry...

Robert Redford is probably too handsome an actor to be cast as a reform prison warden, but once that's out of the way, this is an effective and gripping story that's bound to put the viewer on edge for all the corruption on both sides of a jail cell. Particularly frustrating was the attitude of the political types who play the part of reformers, but when it comes time to take action, they become more than a part of the problem.There's an early scene that baffled me a bit that I'm still thinking about. When Brubaker (Redford) first enters Wakefield, he's working his way into the facility in a line of fellow convicts, and it appears that a guard with a rifle nods to him as if to give some form of recognition. I played it back to be sure, but nothing ever came of it later on, so I'm still scratching my head about it.Very cool for film fans is the ensemble cast that includes names like Yaphet Kotto, Jane Alexander, Morgan Freeman in an early role, and M. Emmet Walsh doing a smarmy gig as a corrupt businessman using convicts for slave labor and matter of factly justifying it. Knowing Redford's politics I got a kick out of his use of the term 'token liberal' to describe one of Lillian Gray's (Jane Alexander) associates. With his old pal Paul Newman gone and now getting on in years, Redford's liberalism is becoming more pronounced. I liked him better as the Sundance Kid.

To his surprise, he makes two amazing discoveries along the way -- he can actually do some good, AND find true love.I had seen this roller coaster of a movie a while back and rediscovered it recently on Sundance. I was amazed at how well it has held up, with all its talk of Obamacare-style socialized medicine and even references to the cool vegetable du jour, kale. There is amazing work here by Warren Beatty, who not only stars but also wrote the trenchant and hilarious script. Beatty is a poignant and believable protagonist on a high-speed road trip of outrageous public performances and flights from a suspected hit man in shades.Among the many interesting things that Beatty highlights in this film is an appreciation for plain-spokenness in the African-American community -- as contrasted with endless beating-around-the-bush by white folk.He says a lot about race relations that rings true today. And though he's a longtime supporter of Democratic politics, Beatty skewers both parties for being self-serving and money-grubbing.The plot twists and casting in this film are of the highest order.

Usually not in comedies, he has some of the best scenes and I love how he always gets on his brother's tail a lot.Overall, this is a wildly entertaining film.

This film has everything from gangster violence to gun-filled action to laugh-out-loud comedy. The dialogue is extremely sharp and pretty funny. There are stand-out performances by everyone especially Brad Pitt.Guy Ritchie's film could be seen as a simple, but layered story. The movie follows a group of people from a Russian gangster to a pair of boxing promoters as they try to recover a valuable jewel. This story is significant because every character in this film has one way or another to do with this jewel.The acting is very good in this film. I think Brad Pitt delivers a crazy performance as the very fast-speaking Irish gypsy. His accent really is the joke of his character. I think the best overall character is played by Jason Statham. Usually not in comedies, he has some of the best scenes and I love how he always gets on his brother's tail a lot.Overall, this is a wildly entertaining film. If you did not like this film, I urge you to watch it again because I think it may need a second viewing. Guy Ritchie has been known for his crazy but funny films and obviously Snatch is one of them. It's a perfectly funny and thrilling British film and one of the best to come from that country. I rate this film 9\/10. ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"}]
