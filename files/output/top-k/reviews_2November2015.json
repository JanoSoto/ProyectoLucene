But those things are often discussed, and are primary reasons this film has received its overrated status.On the other end of the spectrum, you have the people who detest this film simply for its content. Specifically the rape scene in the car. They feel the need to give the film 0 stars because they disagree with an interpretation of the director's intent which they've come up with on their own. Now there's a certain amount of fairness to that, art is supposed to be interpreted and Leone agreed with this. But to simply watch the movie, be reviled by the rape but kind of okay with the rest, and then give the movie no credit whatsoever - that's also unacceptable. If you disagree on a fundamental level with what's happening on screen, then don't watch it. But then where would A Clockwork Orange be? So anyway, you could say those same words to me at the end of this - If you disagree, don't watch - but the thing is, I loved watching this movie for the first 2 hours, even knowing how incredibly disappointing it would be at the end. I watched it twice in two days. That's 8 hours. So, I'm a fan. Which is why I'm writing this.Sergio Leone originally wanted to release this as two separate movies. If that would have happened, time between the release of the first half and second half might have possibly caused the audience to simply forget how loving Max (James Woods) was with his gang\/best friends. From their childhood meeting until the very night that Max fakes his own death, steals all their money, and HAS THEM KILLED, he shows nothing - NOTHING - beside respect and love for them. And this is my main problem with glowing 10-star reviews of this movie - they are overlooking this huge, massive blow to the credibility of the story.It's not one of those things where you can just be like well, you just don't understand what's happening - because nothing happens. Literally, the whole story up to that spot is pointing in a singular direction, and then it all changes course over a matter of a few minutes. And don't give me the whole Max's dad was insane thing... it was never written into the story in a way that was convincing or even important. You can argue just how important the times were when Max hits Noodles because he calls him crazy but that's an impulsive move, not an incredibly calculated one like what we are to told he masterminds on the fateful night. Also, if you believe that the film after the opium den is NOT a hallucination\/opioid dream (I do believe it is), then you see how Max definitely is not in an insane asylum by the time he's even much older than his dad was when he was committed.Max was in love with Noodles. Some say that this repressed homosexuality caused his socio- and psychopathic behavior. I think that's a long shot too. Why have every person who has ever fully accepted him as their brother killed? Max is the one who insisted that they always split the money they made evenly, now all of a sudden he wants it all for himself and is going to take it in THE MOST BRUTAL WAY POSSIBLE? It's simply too much to ask of me as a viewer.People may disagree with me, but these are the reasons I am giving this movie 6 stars instead of 8,9 or even 10 if the third act trouble had been properly resolved.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"2 November 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A largely historically accurate account of the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack itself, this is a very good film but it could have been an excellent one. Made by Fox, it was an attempt to emulate the success of its previous epic World War II film The Longest Day but it is not on the same level. My major criticism of the film is that it is slowly paced. It is too long at 2 hours and 28 minutes, particularly since the attack does not begin in earnest until 1 hour and 50 minutes into the film.The first hour and a quarter of the film, give or take, is very effective as we are shown both the Japanese planning the attack and the Americans' lack of preparation for it. These scenes are filled with a great sense of tension, foreboding and a terrible inevitability. The American sequences are very well directed by Richard Fleischer - as I said in my review of Soylent Green, a master at maintaining tension - while the Japanese ones are handled equally well by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku. After that, however, it becomes a bit of a drag until the planes actually arrive at Pearl Harbor. I didn't really feel that I needed to see multiple scenes of said planes or the Japanese fleet in the process of travelling to Hawaii. I don't think that they really added anything to the film, to be honest. The scenes of American mismanagement and bureaucracy prior to the attack were far more necessary to the plot but they were not done as well as the similar scenes in A Bridge Too Far. I liked the fact that the Japanese scenes, which comprise almost half the film, are actually performed in the relevant language as it gives the film a great sense of authenticity. I had never seen in a film wholly or partly in a non- European language before so that was interesting. Although there were too many flying scenes, they were nevertheless spectacular, as were the often deeply affecting battle scenes when the attack finally began.The best performance in the film is given by Sō Yamamura as Admiral Isokoru Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. He orders a preemptive strike on the US Pacific Fleet as he believes that destroying it represents the only serious prospect for victory. Even so, he does not share the optimism of senior Army figures and politicians who long for war with the United States. He is personally opposed to the war on the grounds that it would be disastrous for Japan. The Emperor Hirohito, who is not depicted in the film presumably because he was still alive and still reigning when it was made, has no desire for war either. However, they both find themselves on the losing side of the argument. Yamamura does an excellent job of depicting Yamamoto's conflict between his loyalty to his country and the realities of sound military strategy. Since I do not know a word of Japanese other than tora, I found that I paid more attention to his facial expressions than I usually do and they played a major role in conveying that conflict. At the end of the film, Yamamoto observes, I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. There is no evidence to suggest that he ever actually said this but it is difficult to disagree with the sentiment.On the English speaking side, the best performance is given by Martin Balsam as Yamamoto's American counterpart Admiral Husband E. Kimmel. He is depicted in the film as a good man and a competent commander whose ability to perform was severely constrained by the incompetence of others and bureaucracy. Kimmel is under severe pressure for much of the film but manages to keep a level head throughout. Ten days after the attack, he was relieved of his command and demoted. He retired in disgrace in 1942. Played well by Jason Robards, General Walter Short is treated less sympathetically in that he is depicted as an obstinate and often short-sighted man. He is shown to be more concerned with the risk of sabotage than outside attack. In a plan that backfired drastically, he orders that the planes be positioned in the middle of airfields so that they would be safe from sabotage. Unfortunately, he might as well have painted giant bullseyes on them.The most sympathetic characters in the film are perhaps Colonel Rufus Bratton and Commander Alwyn Kramer, played by Balsam's 12 Angry Men co-star E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy respectively. On the night of December 6, 1941, they make a valiant effort to alert the US authorities that an attack is imminent, having learned of it from decrypted Japanese messages. However, their warnings are not taken seriously until it is too late. The film also features great performances from Joseph Cotten as Henry L. Stimson, Eijiro Tono as Admiral Nagumo, James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, Edward Andrews as Admiral Stark, Leon Ames as Frank Knox, Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminski and Takahiro Tamura as Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the attack. Fuchida is the only major character who was still alive when the film was made. After the war, he settled in the United States. I can't imagine that he went to see the film though.Overall, this is certainly a very enjoyable film but it never reaches the level that it should. It should have been edited more tightly as it is about half an hour too long. Still, it is the best film that I have seen on the subject of Pearl Harbor.

The Emperor Hirohito, who is not depicted in the film presumably because he was still alive and still reigning when it was made, has no desire for war either. However, they both find themselves on the losing side of the argument. Yamamura does an excellent job of depicting Yamamoto's conflict between his loyalty to his country and the realities of sound military strategy. Since I do not know a word of Japanese other than tora, I found that I paid more attention to his facial expressions than I usually do and they played a major role in conveying that conflict. At the end of the film, Yamamoto observes, I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. There is no evidence to suggest that he ever actually said this but it is difficult to disagree with the sentiment.On the English speaking side, the best performance is given by Martin Balsam as Yamamoto's American counterpart Admiral Husband E. Kimmel. He is depicted in the film as a good man and a competent commander whose ability to perform was severely constrained by the incompetence of others and bureaucracy. Kimmel is under severe pressure for much of the film but manages to keep a level head throughout. Ten days after the attack, he was relieved of his command and demoted. He retired in disgrace in 1942. Played well by Jason Robards, General Walter Short is treated less sympathetically in that he is depicted as an obstinate and often short-sighted man. He is shown to be more concerned with the risk of sabotage than outside attack. In a plan that backfired drastically, he orders that the planes be positioned in the middle of airfields so that they would be safe from sabotage. Unfortunately, he might as well have painted giant bullseyes on them.The most sympathetic characters in the film are perhaps Colonel Rufus Bratton and Commander Alwyn Kramer, played by Balsam's 12 Angry Men co-star E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy respectively. On the night of December 6, 1941, they make a valiant effort to alert the US authorities that an attack is imminent, having learned of it from decrypted Japanese messages. However, their warnings are not taken seriously until it is too late. The film also features great performances from Joseph Cotten as Henry L. Stimson, Eijiro Tono as Admiral Nagumo, James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, Edward Andrews as Admiral Stark, Leon Ames as Frank Knox, Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminski and Takahiro Tamura as Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the attack. Fuchida is the only major character who was still alive when the film was made. After the war, he settled in the United States. I can't imagine that he went to see the film though.Overall, this is certainly a very enjoyable film but it never reaches the level that it should. It should have been edited more tightly as it is about half an hour too long. Still, it is the best film that I have seen on the subject of Pearl Harbor. ","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"2 November 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A largely historically accurate account of the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack itself, this is a very good film but it could have been an excellent one. Made by Fox, it was an attempt to emulate the success of its previous epic World War II film The Longest Day but it is not on the same level. My major criticism of the film is that it is slowly paced. It is too long at 2 hours and 28 minutes, particularly since the attack does not begin in earnest until 1 hour and 50 minutes into the film.The first hour and a quarter of the film, give or take, is very effective as we are shown both the Japanese planning the attack and the Americans' lack of preparation for it. These scenes are filled with a great sense of tension, foreboding and a terrible inevitability. The American sequences are very well directed by Richard Fleischer - as I said in my review of Soylent Green, a master at maintaining tension - while the Japanese ones are handled equally well by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku. After that, however, it becomes a bit of a drag until the planes actually arrive at Pearl Harbor. I didn't really feel that I needed to see multiple scenes of said planes or the Japanese fleet in the process of travelling to Hawaii. I don't think that they really added anything to the film, to be honest. The scenes of American mismanagement and bureaucracy prior to the attack were far more necessary to the plot but they were not done as well as the similar scenes in A Bridge Too Far. I liked the fact that the Japanese scenes, which comprise almost half the film, are actually performed in the relevant language as it gives the film a great sense of authenticity. I had never seen in a film wholly or partly in a non- European language before so that was interesting. Although there were too many flying scenes, they were nevertheless spectacular, as were the often deeply affecting battle scenes when the attack finally began.The best performance in the film is given by Sō Yamamura as Admiral Isokoru Yamamoto, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. He orders a preemptive strike on the US Pacific Fleet as he believes that destroying it represents the only serious prospect for victory. Even so, he does not share the optimism of senior Army figures and politicians who long for war with the United States. He is personally opposed to the war on the grounds that it would be disastrous for Japan.

It is based on the French sci-fi featurette 'La Jetée'. It stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt. Time travel is the basis of a major section of the literal storyline. After a virus wipes out 5 billion people in 1997, the remaining human population is forced to abandon the surface of the earth and somehow survive underground, while the animals reclaim control of the surface of the planet. Bruce Willis' character James Cole is picked as a volunteer who is going to be put in a time machine so that he can go back in time so that he can acquire some information about the virus at its unmutated state which would help the scientists in the present to come up with a cure. We are informed that a group named the 'Twelve Monkeys' was behind the spread of this virus in the first place.The script by David and Janet Peoples which is based on Chris Marker's script for 'La Jetée' is brilliantly written. The beauty of the screenplay lies in its versatility and with Terry Gilliam's visual flair and bravura, the film elevates to the next level. There can be various interpretations for the film. I think Gilliam's style of storytelling actually provokes varied interpretations. There are red herrings, there are subtle hints and there are unanswered questions. This can be seen as a straight up sci-fi film set in a dystopian future with the phenomenon of time travel in it. The concept of whether time and history can be altered or not plays a big part. However it can also be seen as a film about trauma and reality-escapism. Everyone knows that Terry Gilliam is one of the champions of standing up against the mechanical and overly commercialised treatment of the art form of cinema by the big studios and this discontentment and anger is present in the film. Gilliam clearly again makes subtle commentary about the ill-effects of uncontrolled capitalism. We see people make monologues about the materialistic life, the exposure to commercials,etc. Cruelty towards animals is another topic that is addressed which subtly refers to the repression of the poor by the rich.The film is another example of Terry Gilliam's visual bravura. Just by looking at the dystopian future presented in the film, a viewer would know that this has been made by Gilliam. The look of the film really reminded me of Blade Runner and it has a cyberpunk-esque vibe to it. The film looks bleak and almost dirty, but very intentionally so. The music composed by Paul Buckmaster is beautiful too. When it comes to the acting, I think this is my favourite performance by Bruce Willis. This was back in the day when Willis actually cared about playing a character rather than himself in every film. He really goes for it here and shows range. He is terrifying, he is weird and at times he exudes child-like innocence(which is important in the context of the film). Madeleine Stowe is also very good. She actually has a tough job of playing the most 'normal' character in the film while all hell is breaking loose around her. Brad Pitt is a dynamite in the film. He has to be admired for deciding to play a character like this at a stage in his career when he could have easily used his looks and played generic characters in romantic comedies. He thoroughly deserved the Oscar nomination.'Twelve Monkeys' is a philosophical sci-fi film that leaves the door open for varied interpretations.

So what better place to start than a cult classic I've first heard of as a teenager but never saw until I became a twenty something...Barbarella!Based on the French comics by Jean-Claude Forest, Barbarella covers the many absurd adventures of an astronaut, many of which involve sex (sounds very French to me). Since it's syndication was short lived making a faithful film adaptation seemed easy, and the results are laughably bad, or should I say so-bad-its-good. Let's get into more detail about the flick itself...It's set sometime in the 41st century, and our eponymous heroine (Jane Fonda in the title role) is tasked with visiting the Tau Ceti's 16th planet to apprehend the scheming of Durand-Durand (the film's mad scientist, not my native Birmingham's new wave band!), who plans on levelling entire planets with his Positronic Ray. Once she's given some hilariously dated science-y technology (a Brain Wave Detector, making our iPhones laugh at it) and crash lands onto the 16th planet she's kidnapped by some feral children and left to perish by a mild annoyance, which in their case is slow-moving dolls who bite.Barbarella is then rescued by Mark Hand, a ranger\/hairy tick who suggests sex. She explains that the people on Earth no longer have penetrative intercourse but instead consume exaltation transference pills and press their hands together to set off psychocardiograms in perfect harmony. After they choose good Ole' fashioned penetrative, Barbarella departs once Mark repairs the ship and burrows through the planet into a vast labyrinth outside SoGo, the City of Night.One pattern you'll quickly notice is that Barbarella gets captured a lot and requires other people to save her, a trope in fiction I cannot stand because it's not exactly a positive character trait. For instance when she's captured by the city's Black Guards, a blind angel named Pygar saves her; when she's captured by SoGo's residents, she's saved by a one-eyed wench; and when she's captured by Durand and caged to be pecked to death by canaries (either that was in the comic or director Roger Vadim REALLY liked The Birds), she's rescued by the subtly-named resistance leader, Dildano. You know you're a bad protagonist when even blind or partially-sighted people have to save you!In her last kidnapping and costume change, which Barbarella does a lot of (changing into a total of eight colourful costumes as if she's doing a Vogue shoot rather than a film), she's tortured in the Excessive Machine which backfires and locked away in the kaleidoscopic Chamber of Dreams. There she finds the one-eyed wench from earlier, named the Great Tyrant, Black Queen of SoGo. She then releases a silvery liquid essence named Mathmos, cleverly named after the company that manufactures lava lamps and even has some of it in the background, and it destroys all of SoGo; Barbarella, Tyrant and Pygar escape unharmed, though it's a bit of a downer ending for what's otherwise a campy, fun cult film.The other issue I had with it (the first one being the heroine existing purely as the damsel in distress), was the special effects which are really cheap and shoddy-looking. And it's not forgiven that this was released after 2001 A Space Odyssey and before Marooned, both of which have been praised for their realistic depictions of outer space and future technologies. Surprisingly though, Barbarella has the exact same budget as 2001, so I'm guessing that money went towards the elaborate sets and costumes!Everything about it was great; it had a lot of good actors in it like Anita Pallenberg, the former muse of Rolling Stone Keith Richards as the Great Tyrant; Irish character actor Milo O'Shea (who's done a lot of British TV and films) as Durand-Durand; mime artist Marcel Marceau as his first talking role Professor Ping; and cult actors David Hemmings and John Phillip Law as Dildano and Pygar respectively. The feel of the film was psychedelic at best, and even has a pop soundtrack! Oh yeah because when I think of science fiction, my first thought is always soul band the 5th Dimension! Oh and a couple of interesting tidbits...the password Dildano uses for his headquarters is a real-life village in Wales called Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch; and SoGo is abbreviated for the Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Whoever said films aren't educational?At first it went largely ignored but after a 1977 re-release it achieved the status of cult film, and a sequel and remake were both considered. The former never fell through, and the latter in my opinion would be impossible since it's purely a film of it's time...the Swinging Sixties. If you think about it, it was already remade; Flash Gordon! Seriously think...both are based on comics adapted by Dino De Laurentiis, both have a blonde good-looking hero, both travel to planets ruled by flamboyantly-dressed tyrants, both have a colourful yet schlocky look to them and the only thing that stops their quests is a black-clad antihero with questionable behaviour. They're the same film!Overall I'm glad I got to see it, and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a great time riffing films together.

The feel of the film was psychedelic at best, and even has a pop soundtrack! Oh yeah because when I think of science fiction, my first thought is always soul band the 5th Dimension! Oh and a couple of interesting tidbits...the password Dildano uses for his headquarters is a real-life village in Wales called Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch; and SoGo is abbreviated for the Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Whoever said films aren't educational?At first it went largely ignored but after a 1977 re-release it achieved the status of cult film, and a sequel and remake were both considered. The former never fell through, and the latter in my opinion would be impossible since it's purely a film of it's time...the Swinging Sixties. If you think about it, it was already remade; Flash Gordon! Seriously think...both are based on comics adapted by Dino De Laurentiis, both have a blonde good-looking hero, both travel to planets ruled by flamboyantly-dressed tyrants, both have a colourful yet schlocky look to them and the only thing that stops their quests is a black-clad antihero with questionable behaviour.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"2 November 2015","score":"","review":" It's kind of odd that despite being a lifelong cinephile, I've never got round to creating an account on here until now, nor have I talked in-depth about films I've truly enjoyed to the world at large (it was mostly in person to small groups of friends and\/or family members). So what better place to start than a cult classic I've first heard of as a teenager but never saw until I became a twenty something...Barbarella!Based on the French comics by Jean-Claude Forest, Barbarella covers the many absurd adventures of an astronaut, many of which involve sex (sounds very French to me). Since it's syndication was short lived making a faithful film adaptation seemed easy, and the results are laughably bad, or should I say so-bad-its-good. Let's get into more detail about the flick itself...It's set sometime in the 41st century, and our eponymous heroine (Jane Fonda in the title role) is tasked with visiting the Tau Ceti's 16th planet to apprehend the scheming of Durand-Durand (the film's mad scientist, not my native Birmingham's new wave band!), who plans on levelling entire planets with his Positronic Ray. Once she's given some hilariously dated science-y technology (a Brain Wave Detector, making our iPhones laugh at it) and crash lands onto the 16th planet she's kidnapped by some feral children and left to perish by a mild annoyance, which in their case is slow-moving dolls who bite.Barbarella is then rescued by Mark Hand, a ranger\/hairy tick who suggests sex. She explains that the people on Earth no longer have penetrative intercourse but instead consume exaltation transference pills and press their hands together to set off psychocardiograms in perfect harmony. After they choose good Ole' fashioned penetrative, Barbarella departs once Mark repairs the ship and burrows through the planet into a vast labyrinth outside SoGo, the City of Night.One pattern you'll quickly notice is that Barbarella gets captured a lot and requires other people to save her, a trope in fiction I cannot stand because it's not exactly a positive character trait. For instance when she's captured by the city's Black Guards, a blind angel named Pygar saves her; when she's captured by SoGo's residents, she's saved by a one-eyed wench; and when she's captured by Durand and caged to be pecked to death by canaries (either that was in the comic or director Roger Vadim REALLY liked The Birds), she's rescued by the subtly-named resistance leader, Dildano. You know you're a bad protagonist when even blind or partially-sighted people have to save you!In her last kidnapping and costume change, which Barbarella does a lot of (changing into a total of eight colourful costumes as if she's doing a Vogue shoot rather than a film), she's tortured in the Excessive Machine which backfires and locked away in the kaleidoscopic Chamber of Dreams. There she finds the one-eyed wench from earlier, named the Great Tyrant, Black Queen of SoGo. She then releases a silvery liquid essence named Mathmos, cleverly named after the company that manufactures lava lamps and even has some of it in the background, and it destroys all of SoGo; Barbarella, Tyrant and Pygar escape unharmed, though it's a bit of a downer ending for what's otherwise a campy, fun cult film.The other issue I had with it (the first one being the heroine existing purely as the damsel in distress), was the special effects which are really cheap and shoddy-looking.

Carlito also has a real arch enemy lawyer, riding his tail, so wanting him back inside, where like one scene in it's starting, where Carlito theatrically, addresses the court, that makes a smarmy, with his victory, it's so much fun again where these two rivals, are back in the same room. The first dying scene, may'be we could of done without, as it would of been much more intriguingly suspenseful, especially nearing it's closing in a wonderfully orchestrated shootout scene, to see if Carlito was gonna beat em', but like we know in many other examples, that's rising a flimsy chance and desperate hope.

Also John Leguizamo as a new wannabe gangster, Benny Blanco, moving up, but not favored by Carlito, who reminds him of what he used to be, gives some of his best work, while truly creating a memorable bad mafia dude.

Know reviewing the movie, I would say that The Big Boss might had been the best action movie during its period back in the 20s, but now is nothing compared with movies of this century. Talking about the movie, the hing i did not understand is, if Bruce Lee(Cheng) kept her mother a promise of no fighting again, there is no reason for him to break up that promise just because someone in the Fabrique broke his necklace, I do not thing is a big deal, because he could have fixed it. I think the director did it to make the movie entertained.I do not understand why people disappear on the movie just like that, with no reason, then realize they hide the inside the ice.

Make Room! by Harry Harrison, this is an extremely engrossing and thought-provoking film. Set in 2022, it depicts a world which is suffering from chronic overpopulation - New York alone has a population of 40 million - and a perpetual heatwave caused by the greenhouse effect. As a result, resources have been severely depleted and things such as meat, eggs, soap, clean water and even new paper are luxuries enjoyed by the idle rich. Food, if you can call it that, is derived from high energy plankton by the Soylent company. Real food may be expensive but life is cheap as the world has become a dark, unfeeling, depressing and cold (figuratively if not literally!) place. The terrible state of the world has brought out the worst in human nature and I have to say that it is very realistic in that respect. The highest position that any young woman can aspire to is to be the concubine - or furniture - of a wealthy man. This provides some very good social commentary on sexism and the objectification of women. As with another Charlton Heston film Planet of the Apes (1968) and another Joseph Cotten film Citizen Kane, I was aware of the final revelation long before I saw the film due to pop culture osmosis but that did not effect my enjoyment of it in any way. The film has an excellent script by Stanley R. Greenberg and the direction of Richard Fleischer, a master in the art of maintaining tension, is superb.Charlton Heston gives an extremely good performance as the protagonist Detective Thorn. He is an extremely bitter and cynical man but this is hardly unusual given the society in which he has grown up. However, he shows a softer side when it comes to his relationship with his elderly and increasingly infirm researcher \/ book Sol Roth, whom he cares for and is hinted to love like a father. This is also seen in his relationship with the furniture Shirl. At first, he treats her with the same mild contempt that he treats most things. He demands sex from her during his investigation but this is seemingly standard practice for a furniture so she is in no way offended or even surprised. However, over the course of the film, Thorn becomes genuinely fond of her and protective of her. She is played well by a young Leigh Taylor-Young, the film's last surviving star who will hopefully live to see the real 2022.The best performance in the film, however, comes from Edward G. Robinson. After a hugely impressive career of more than five decades, this was Robinson's final film. At the time that it was made, he was in the final stages of bladder cancer and he knew that he was going to die very soon. This knowledge likely influenced his performance as the world weary Sol Roth, the oldest character who regularly hearkens back to a time when food was plentiful and there were seasons. The best and most moving scene in the film involves Sol going to a euthanasia clinic - or going home - as he is unable to live with the terrible secret of Soylent Green. There is a beautiful moment in which Thorn is reduced to tears by footage of wild animals (hinted to be extinct), rivers and mountains, all of which he is too young to remember. This was the last scene that Robinson ever filmed and he died less than two weeks later.It was an excellent idea to cast Joseph Cotten as the former Soylent executive William R. Simonson, whose murder Thorn investigates throughout the film. He only has two scenes but he was a wonderful actor and brings a great deal of pathos to his performance as the guilt-stricken Simonson, one of the wealthiest men in New York. Not only that but the casting of an old Hollywood star in the role meant that Fleischer successfully subverted the audience's expectations as they would assume than an actor of his standing and calibre would have much a bigger role. The film also features great performances from Brock Peters as Thorn's superior Lt. Hatcher (depicting a black man in a position of authority over a white man was still quite unusual in 1973 so I appreciated that), Chuck Connors as Simonson's suitably intimidating bodyguard Tab Fielding, Whit Bissell as Governor Santini, Leonard Stone as Charles and, in her final film, Celia Lovsky as the Exchange Leader.Overall, this is an excellent film which is extremely effective in painting a picture of a bleak, hopeless world on the brink.

Instead it's going to slowly unravel them, intriguing me every so often and making me feel smart when I work something out. And that's exactly what happened.

The shape of the dialogue could have been inspired by the likes of Tarantino but it stands on its own. Although the film can deal with brutal themes at times it is very comedic. There are little references to other films as well allowing the viewer to feel clever when they recognize them. The only issue with the story is that it is obviously a story for a specific audience. Not much context around the world of the characters is given making it difficult for westerners to feel sympathy for what the characters are going through because they simply don't understand the gravity of the situation.Technically, the film works okay. I understand the decision to make this film black and white but I don't think it needs it. It's not a subtle reference to the world of the film so it just feels like one of those wanky artistic decisions. Additionally, some of the shots could have been very beautiful but they simply weren't as they looked cheap.

What is this film about, who are these people, what are the rules of their world and why? These are questions that I was asking myself for the first half hour of the film and then I realised that the film is not going to blatantly give me the answers as I'd expect. Instead it's going to slowly unravel them, intriguing me every so often and making me feel smart when I work something out. And that's exactly what happened. I found the story and plot to be fairly original in the sense that we haven't seen this type of story telling before this film. The shape of the dialogue could have been inspired by the likes of Tarantino but it stands on its own. Although the film can deal with brutal themes at times it is very comedic. There are little references to other films as well allowing the viewer to feel clever when they recognize them. The only issue with the story is that it is obviously a story for a specific audience.

But if you go in without expectations of a typical Hitchcock film, this is an entertaining movie with some very nice touches, such as a wondrous scene in which Hitchcock brilliantly uses the camera to bring Maximillian's description of a moment with Rebecca to life. The cast is good, particularly Judith Anderson as Danvers, and the film is handsomely mounted. It's not near Hitchcock's best, but it probably deserved to win an Oscar as much as any of the movies nominated that year (Sullivan's Travels, which came out the same year, should have won but wasn't nominated).

I think maybe he saw the last 3 movies then took a breather. Anyways, If they did Starwars 1-3 ala 1989-93 then Kirchner would have directed with Robocop2, Predator 2\/Terminator, graphics inspired by Ridley Scott and HR Giger I would turn my head and look. At least clone wars would have been done correctly. Then you would have two wins. A still youthful cast to cont the franchise via the best comics in history. That's right I bought Jedi Knight Dark Empire i &ii during those times. Luke joins the dark side...the emperor is cloned...the introduction of world destroyers and tie phantoms, the empire is hurt a little. The clone bats are destroyed, Anakin Solo is born. Obviously at the end of the novel, the jedi are rising or winning even if Pinnacle moon was destroyed. I highly doubt an advanced civilization like that would just crumble and fall. They would get singed at the end, that's it. So they should have winged it, do 1-3 and 7-9 in the years before computers. Models=automatic win, harder but better. Pull off a harry potter with dark empire i-ii. Make the final movie like how you see it today, remove phantom menace and rotj completely from existence, or at least make it rots, a little more darker (not for kids..dark). Make phantom menace in the tradition of a new hope. Have attack of the clones as another win, change title to the Clonewars..or make the cartoon into a live action series idk. Make rots as a win or lose (rotj felt like an ultimate win, puppet wars however the good guy wins throughout the movie, making it not to believable, hence the empire is millions strong, they would just reform which they did). Rename 3rd movie as rise of the empire since it felt the empire should be rising and you have a compilation. Phantom menace lost bad, it was like phantom menace with a race scene. Remove the race scene, put like an escape scene again. Darth maul needs to be more hostile, he needs to be the Bobba Fett before Boba Fett arrives and returns via a sarlac pitt. Also Jango Fett could clone himself, but maybe black market some alien's blood instead. It makes sense if the alien is intelligent in form etc. A modern Jesus, or a race of giants, idk. 1989-1993 then 1994-96 the dark empire, return of the sith, and rise of the jedi. Then A New Hope, empire strikes back, return of the jedi. A phantom menace, the clone wars, RISE OF THE EMPIRE (in order last part is first). A compilation needs to work as a full movie. With plot points, firstly...no one even knows who the sith are. Why suddenly make them into an army? That's what the title implies and the expanded universe avoids. You move too fast even in the title. The sith aren't an army, rise is an influential term for a large group. Return of the sith because they are an old republic in the comics. Words can be redundant on a compilation. Attack of the clones is a good title, but clones to me say artificial life, or androids in the form of the movie aliens. The Clone Wars should have started in A Phantom Menace, then became apparent in Clone Wars. Attack of the clones means the clones are attacking, but maybe in star wars land, they need years to be made. And in star wars land, this would be order 66, a full movie called Clone Wars. Also I'm not dumb. The last movie rise of the empire would have been made correctly. The old republic needs to feel old or in peace. The empire would have won, they are the winning factors of a new hope. Has anyone seen the extended Luke skywalker joining the darkside hidden scene?

His inability to die, in spite of having at least 11 bullets in him by the end of the movie, was explained in a later sequel, one that was later retconned. Hmmm.
