They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did. So I say, go check it out, see for yourself what you think.

Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing.

I had already seen it, nevertheless the experience of watching it again was (as it always is) very refreshing! It's like admiring a painting by Michelangelo or DaVinci for a second time and being mesmerized by every detail, every color, every line.For a bit of plot summary, the movie follows captain Willard (Sheen) who during the Vietnam war is given the mission of killing a highly decorate Colonel, Kurtz (Brando). Kurtz has retrieved deep within the Cambodjian forest, exercising his command without any restrains and leading a group of native followers who constitute his army. So Willard must pick up his track and get to him by hitchhiking a ride with a patrol boat crew up the river and into the heart of the forest, or more fittingly into the heart of darkness.This movie should not be viewed as a docudrama from the GI's point of view, shedding some light on the horrors of the War in Vietnam, or of war in general. Apocalypse now is more of a soul searching experience within a war background, a war whose worse aspects provide the elements needed to create the canvas in which the story evolves. If I'm allowed to indulge in some free interpretation, the movie is an exercise on the worst side within the human psyche, its darkest side, and the path leading to it, a path that Sheen's character is forced to pursue as he searches for Kurtz. As he begins to understand him he also starts to get closer to that darkness within him. So the whole journey up the river can be understood as an allegory for a journey into the soul, into that dark side where Kurtz supposedly has reached and which is very well suggested in the narrative by his encroaching in the heart of the jungle. As a matter of fact there are enough suggestions and key moments in the movie to support this (possible) interpretation. It's as if John Millius and Francis Ford Coppola tried to adapt Joseph Conrad's book (The heart of darkness), as a kind of Dante's Inferno blended in the Vietnam war.But this abstract and stylistic journey isn't brought fourth by merit of the script alone. The visual style, the editing, the score, all contribute to this complex canvas as I called it Vittorio Storaro's cinematography alternates between a pale daylight and the dark night photography, sprinkled with only a few bright lights giving a sense of otherworldly atmosphere to the whole movie. That along with Carmine Coppola's eerie score ultimately emphasizes Willard's psychedelic journey.I must say that although I haven't seen the original version for over ten years, I think the redux version is better. The biggest throwback in this version might be the French plantation scene in which Coppola indulges in considerations about colonialism and patriotism. And although its subject is not devoid of merit (or mishandled for that matter), the fact is that this scene completely stops the movie just as Willard's journey is near the end. However the scene itself can be appreciated for its worth as it doesn't play down all the other inserts in the movie which add a little more depth in secondary characters (like Willards boat companions) alluding to the fact that they too join Willard in his human hellish descent.It wouldn't be fare to go without mentioning the acting the trio Sheen, Brando and Duvall stand out! Martin Sheen is very convincing, as a man that doesn't fit in society. A soldier aware of his terrible part in the war and a perfect Dantesque character for the journey ahead; Brando and Duvall impersonate the characters already gone that far up the river, which highlights the hypocrisy of the generals who condemn Kurtz yet condone Colonel Kilgore's (Duvall) equally unsound warfare. As for Marlon Brando&#x85; well, he always distinguished himself portraying characters on the edge of a strait razor, and here he paints yet another wonderful performance in the history of cinema, despite his short screen time.Aside for this a note worth mention the arduous work by Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece possible is documented in the hearts of darkness, a documentary about the already known troubles that plagued the shooting and production of this movie.

So Willard must pick up his track and get to him by hitchhiking a ride with a patrol boat crew up the river and into the heart of the forest, or more fittingly into the heart of darkness.This movie should not be viewed as a docudrama from the GI's point of view, shedding some light on the horrors of the War in Vietnam, or of war in general. Apocalypse now is more of a soul searching experience within a war background, a war whose worse aspects provide the elements needed to create the canvas in which the story evolves. If I'm allowed to indulge in some free interpretation, the movie is an exercise on the worst side within the human psyche, its darkest side, and the path leading to it, a path that Sheen's character is forced to pursue as he searches for Kurtz. As he begins to understand him he also starts to get closer to that darkness within him. So the whole journey up the river can be understood as an allegory for a journey into the soul, into that dark side where Kurtz supposedly has reached and which is very well suggested in the narrative by his encroaching in the heart of the jungle. As a matter of fact there are enough suggestions and key moments in the movie to support this (possible) interpretation. It's as if John Millius and Francis Ford Coppola tried to adapt Joseph Conrad's book (The heart of darkness), as a kind of Dante's Inferno blended in the Vietnam war.But this abstract and stylistic journey isn't brought fourth by merit of the script alone. The visual style, the editing, the score, all contribute to this complex canvas as I called it Vittorio Storaro's cinematography alternates between a pale daylight and the dark night photography, sprinkled with only a few bright lights giving a sense of otherworldly atmosphere to the whole movie. That along with Carmine Coppola's eerie score ultimately emphasizes Willard's psychedelic journey.I must say that although I haven't seen the original version for over ten years, I think the redux version is better. The biggest throwback in this version might be the French plantation scene in which Coppola indulges in considerations about colonialism and patriotism. And although its subject is not devoid of merit (or mishandled for that matter), the fact is that this scene completely stops the movie just as Willard's journey is near the end. However the scene itself can be appreciated for its worth as it doesn't play down all the other inserts in the movie which add a little more depth in secondary characters (like Willards boat companions) alluding to the fact that they too join Willard in his human hellish descent.It wouldn't be fare to go without mentioning the acting the trio Sheen, Brando and Duvall stand out! Martin Sheen is very convincing, as a man that doesn't fit in society. A soldier aware of his terrible part in the war and a perfect Dantesque character for the journey ahead; Brando and Duvall impersonate the characters already gone that far up the river, which highlights the hypocrisy of the generals who condemn Kurtz yet condone Colonel Kilgore's (Duvall) equally unsound warfare. As for Marlon Brando&#x85; well, he always distinguished himself portraying characters on the edge of a strait razor, and here he paints yet another wonderful performance in the history of cinema, despite his short screen time.Aside for this a note worth mention the arduous work by Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece possible is documented in the hearts of darkness, a documentary about the already known troubles that plagued the shooting and production of this movie. But that, is for another review&#x85; I hope my words have been of some help to you!

You get a genuine sense of the simmering anger, the shifting allegiances, and the small reward system of the social world these pathetic people live in.Pfifer is the central figure and he sweats a lot. No brighter or better than he should be, he's pressured from one side into dealing cocaine by local mogul Delroy Lindo. On the other side, he's pushed by the manipulative but well-intentioned detectives Harvey Keitel and Stanley Turturro. Pfifer's handsome and upright brother is under arrest for murder but Keitel believes that Pfifer is the culprit. Pfifer's brother is simply too good, too compliant, to have done the deed.Nice ambiguity. Lee convincingly nails the diversity and solidarity of the community. It's like John Ford in the ghetto. Pfifer may be innocent of the crime of which Keitel is convinced he's guilty but he also deals dope. Keitel, for all his ploying the system, is determined to bring the guilty party to justice, though he may play a little dirty in getting the job done. And when he finds out that he's been wrong about who committed the murder, he does what such a person would do in real life. He hides his guilt behind a tirade of threats.In a way, it's an improvement over Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. It doesn't turn all the cops into heavies. And it doesn't end with an ominous quote from Malcolm X.The weakness of the film lies in Lee's allowing conversations to go on for too long. Pfifer gets a lot of screen time and when he's not chewing out his young brother (who will save his life) he's whining about his innocence. The exchanges, sometimes rising to shouts, go on too long and become tiring.It's a devalued life these people lead. They wear clothes and they groom themselves in ways that appeal only to those in their immediate and limited social worlds. I'm beginning to develop an idea. The more you resemble someone who is upper class and British, the more your social worth. The farther removed you are from this model, the lower your status. If you could take Pfifer, dress him in riding clothes and teach him to play polo, and have him say eck-tually instead of aks, and have him grow some hair on his shaved and shiny skull, he might not be thought guilty of anything except being too polite.

Basically in New York, Don Birnam (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ray Milland) is an unsuccessful writer and long-term alcoholic who has been trying to kick his drinking habit, but constantly fails and turns to the bottle on a regular basis. He is supposed to go on a weekend in the country with his brother Wick (Phillip Terry), who he shares an apartment with, and his girlfriend Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), but he stays home, and he finds some money, which he uses to spend on booze at his favourite water. At Nat's Bar on Third Avenue Don drinks and reminisces with Nat (Howard Da Silva) about how he met Helen, who worked for Time magazine, they met at the Metropolitan Opera when there was confusion of their coats, at first he found her rude, but they connect and she invited him to a cocktail party, where he had tomato and avoided alcohol for weeks. One day he was supposed to be meeting Helen's parents, but overheard them talking disapprovingly of him, so he phoned her and he returned to drinking, and he confesses to his problem to her when she finds his bottle, but he says being drunk gives his ideas for writing, but they are forgotten sober. Back in the present, Don cannot find his bottles that he hid, so he goes to bar advertised on a box of matches, and there he steals a woman's handbag, is caught by her, but he is let off by her and simply thrown out. The next day he is getting constant phone calls, but he ignores them assuming it is Helen, and to make some money for booze he tries to pawn off his typewriter, but all the pawn shops are closed, and visiting Nat he is refused service. Don does get a little bit of money from the at first unhappy Gloria (Doris Dowling), but in his bad state he falls down the stairs and is knocked unconscious, waking up in hospital in an alcoholics ward, and those there try to help with with advice and support about DTs (the shakes). Later that night he steals a coat, wearing it over his pyjamas, and in his second attempt he manages to escape while the staff are distracted by another unstable patient causing a disturbance. Helen meanwhile has slept on the stairs to his apartment hoping he will return. the landlady is sure he is one on of his benders, she also says it would probably be better if he was dead. Don meanwhile steals a bottle of whiskey from a liquor store, and when he returns home he still ignores the phone ringing, and in his drunken state he is tormented with the vision of a mouse coming through the wall and being eaten by a bat, 'Bim' Nolan (Frank Faylen) explained this as a symptom, seeing small animals. The landlady had heard his screams and Helen rushes to see and help him, she vows to look after him and stay until he can go without drink and start writing again, but this does not seem to work. Don disappears again and gets money from pawning her coat, returning he claims their relationship is over, and she spots he has hidden a gun in the bathroom, so she distracts him with drink so she can take it and stop him doing anything with it, but he spots her. As Helen tries to convince him to stop drinking, Nat comes round to bring back the typewriter he dropped falling down the stairs, and Don commits to finishing the story he started, The Bottle, recounting his time and the events in the lost weekend, dropping a cigarette in the whiskey instead of drinking it. Also starring Mary Young as Mrs. Deveridge and Anita Sharp-Bolster as Mrs. Foley. Milland gives a powerful, moving, realistic and award worthy performance as a desperate alcoholic who will do anything for a drink, normally the actor is rather bland so it is clever casting, Wyman is also great as the woman who sympathises with him and hopes that he will get over his addiction, and the direction by Wilder is superb as he paces the story well. It is a simple story, mostly just seeing a man drink himself nearly to death as he suffers terrible writer's block, the music throughout using the instrument called Theremin (used in Ed Wood) is tense, especially in the scene while walking down the high street, and there are some clever sequences, like the nightmare sequence, it is grim but a highly watchable drama.
