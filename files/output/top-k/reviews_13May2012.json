We can thank screenwriter John Sayles, then a writer for hire (his other genre credits during the period being Piranha and The Howling) for its wit and ambition, and Lewis Teague (Cujo, Cat's Eye) for the efficient, right-to-the-point direction and genuine thrills.It exploits the old urban legend of alligators in the sewers for maximum entertainment, telling the tale of a gator named Ramon flushed down the drain as an infant and making its home in the Chicago sewer. It grows to mammoth proportions after having feasted on dead dogs that had been injected with a growth hormone by a dubious pharmaceutical company. It's up to dedicated police detective, David Madison (the likable Robert Forster, in a perfect Everyman role) to find and destroy the out-of-control beast when other attempts by the police prove to be unsuccessful.Sayles shows here that the trend of referencing bits of pop culture most assuredly did not begin with Scream, as here he makes jokes referring to Ed Norton, the character on 'The Honeymooners' who worked for the sewer department, and Orson Welles's character from the classic The Third Man. He gets some great chuckles from some of his lines, and also adding to the humour is the performance of Henry Silva, as an egomaniacal big game hunter. Adding sex appeal is husky voiced redhead Robin Riker as the movies' reptile expert. A wonderful supporting cast includes swaggering Dean Jagger as the corporate creep, Bart Braverman as the pesky reporter, Perry Lang as an eager beaver young cop, original Lolita Sue Lyon as a TV reporter, Sydney Lassick as a pet store owner, Jack Carter as the sleazy mayor, and the hilarious, raspy voiced Michael Gazzo as Madisons' boss on the police force. Other familiar faces in small roles include Angel Tompkins, Royce D. Applegate, Simmy Bow, Stan Haze, Micole Mercurio, John Goff, and Mike Mazurki.Among the touches Sayles and Teague bring to the material are the idea of the gator eating its way up the socio-economic ladder, heading for the man who created it in the first place, and a willingness to treat many characters as fair game, even children. The sequence where the gator (brought to life by more convincing special effects than usual) first emerges into the outside world is a corker, as is the big set piece where it runs amok at a wedding; there are some amazing stunts during this sequence. The pacing never flags and Forster and Riker are an endearing main couple; he plays exactly the kind of hero for whom WANTS to root.Any monster movie fan tired of the routine cheese fests, featuring animated creatures, that come out nowadays, is strongly encouraged to check out this solidly entertaining little flick.

It reminds me of public access TV talk shows or the films of first-year film students and it generally causes the viewer's attention to drift. it has to be done with style, in other words the lighting and theme of the film should match the remote, impersonal feeling of the camera-work. That's exactly what this film does. Just about everything about this film works, and works powerfully. It's a dark film both thematically and literally, and the characters are so real and believable I couldn't stop watching it even during a second and third viewing. The outcome of the film, I think, is supposed to be predictable. Realistic films are often predictable because life is often predictable. The propensity of the mental hospital director (James Hampton) to evaluate Karl (Billy Bob Thornton) based on a the kind of superficial blanket diagnosis he learned in medical school is a typical and dangerous problem with mental health professionals. The treatment of mentally ill people should be taken on a case-by-case basis, taking into account every part of their entire life situation, past and present, but of course that kind of attention, research and care takes a huge amount of time, money and effort for overworked mental health workers. This film shows that not doing that work can result in something much worse than making one's job more difficult, such as people being locked up for no good reason or, as in this case, people being released who are killers. Mental health consumers are generally more intelligent, diverse, and complex and HUMAN than the people who try to control them think they are, or HAVE to think they in order to control them. As far as the acting, i think the Lucas Black as the boy Frank and Dwight Yoakom as Linda's sadistic boyfriend Doyle are better than Billy Bob Thornton as Karl because Karl's fixed facial expression makes his acting easier, even if keeping that expression was physically painful. The scene where Doyle was trying to act nice to Linda and Frank out of fear of losing Linda was a masterpiece. That's exactly how a sadistic *sshole like that would act and talk in that situation. Even in trying to act nice he'd twist things around to make himself seem more important and indispensable to them. In the garage scenes, you can sense the unspoken boredom and desperation and disappointment with life in Karl's coworkers. I hope the gay character Vaughn (the late John Ritter) wasn't just thrown in because in 1996 it was just starting to be the style in Hollywood to throw in a gay character. It seems like that because the existence of his character doesn't help set up the film's conclusion and everything else in the film does, but he's very funny and believable and his speech is typical of the new gay political correctness. One line by the boy Frank, when speaking about Vaughn, is totally implausible Queers do better in the big town. A 9-year-old boy, especially one who lives out in the sticks, wouldn't know something like that, but that's nitpicking in a great film like this. It's strange, though, how Linda (Natalie Canerday) doesn't have a single close-up in the entire film. The closest the camera gets to her face is a middle-range-shot in the baptism scene. In the scene where Karl kills Doyle, it was a good decision not to show the blade actually striking the head. Everyone can imagine what a cracked skull looks like. It doesn't make the scene any more powerful to see it, in fact probably less. I think generally it only works to show an ultra-violent act on film if it's a documentary in which you're trying to convince the viewer about the cruelty and sadism of some actual group or person, because in that case the viewer is already swayed by a deeply-engrained false opinion and need to be wrenched out of it by something visceral and visually shocking. The background music in the film seems to add dignity to these unhappy characters while simultaneously making the impending tragedy seem more inevitable. It's not an entirely realistic world this film creates, maybe EVEN more dark and murky than life usually is both visually and thematically, but it's realistic enough to draw you into its darkness.

Upon reflection, I realized what the problem was the movie is actually very poorly written. In fact, the only thing that saves it is Hanks's powerful, largely wordless depiction of a man struggling to survive in the harsh environment where he has been stranded. Everything else about the movie is pretty bad. Here are a few of the main flaws.Poor dialog and characterization The characters don't behave like real people, they behave like movie characters. A classic sign of an untalented writer. This is especially true of the main character, Chuck, who undergoes the largest amount of development. His character changes, but everything basically occurs offscreen. First we are presented with an exaggerated caricature of a work-obsessed businessman. Once he arrives at the island, we see him face some of the challenges of life away from civilization. Then four years later, we see the character transformed into a kind of Robinson Crusoe, toughened by years on the island, grimly determined to survive in his harsh environment. Finally, we see him back in society, pretty much the same as before but more subdued, having found new meaning in his life as a result of his isolation. This is all well and good, but the problem is that the movie doesn't really give insight into the nature of this transformation, it just tells us the results. There's not really a sense of gradual change, just before and after pictures.This leads to the second major flaw, a poorly delivered message. The message itself -- that we should appreciate life, pursue the things that matter to us while we still can, remain open to new opportunities, and so on -- is a good one, though certainly one that we've all heard before. But the writer, in delivering this message, uses the same tactic of telling the viewer what to think rather than showing it naturally. The main character even has a monologue where he tells his friend (and the viewer) what he's learned from his time on the island. And the movie ends with a particularly blatant scene of the main character standing at a literal crossroads as he considers his future. The writer clearly thinks that viewers are idiots and won't understand the message without scenes like this. Give the viewers some credit! That kind of didacticism is both unnecessary and ineffective. It cheapens the message to the level of a greeting card or self-help book.The third major problem is inept pacing. In an attempt to create a certain unity of action, the writer introduces us to all of the characters before the island part, then shows us them all again at the end. This isn't always a bad thing, but he spends far too long doing so. A more skilled writer could suggest all of this background with a few deft strokes. This writer, though, gets bogged down trying to show us all the details and tie up the loose ends. This is distracting and tedious, especially given the unrealistic dialog as I already mentioned. Also, it gives the movie a distinct sense of unevenness. Nothing really happens during the beginning and end scenes. The writer is just telling the viewer the setup (at the beginning) or telling the viewer the epilogue and delivering the moral (at the end). The result is that instead of a natural sequence of rising and falling action, we are given a kind of plot inselberg (in a double sense) in the middle surrounded by flat, rolling hills of boring exposition at the beginning and end.Even with so many flaws, I'd still recommend this movie. Tom Hanks gives a truly gripping portrayal of a man almost completely cut off from society, forced to depend entirely on himself for survival. For best results, just fast forward until you see the main couple opening presents in the car, then turn off the movie after the scene with the cargo ship. The rest is just a waste of time.

This writer, though, gets bogged down trying to show us all the details and tie up the loose ends. This is distracting and tedious, especially given the unrealistic dialog as I already mentioned. Also, it gives the movie a distinct sense of unevenness. Nothing really happens during the beginning and end scenes. The writer is just telling the viewer the setup (at the beginning) or telling the viewer the epilogue and delivering the moral (at the end). The result is that instead of a natural sequence of rising and falling action, we are given a kind of plot inselberg (in a double sense) in the middle surrounded by flat, rolling hills of boring exposition at the beginning and end.Even with so many flaws, I'd still recommend this movie. Tom Hanks gives a truly gripping portrayal of a man almost completely cut off from society, forced to depend entirely on himself for survival. For best results, just fast forward until you see the main couple opening presents in the car, then turn off the movie after the scene with the cargo ship. The rest is just a waste of time.

It has nowhere near the amount of horror, gore and atmosphere that the last two films were known for. However, almost everyone can agree that Army of Darkness is one of the funniest films ever made, full of great one-liners, action and special effects that make it so enjoyable. The film boasts a healthy number of fans, and is considered a classic along with its two previous installments.At the end of Evil Dead II (1987) our main protagonist 'Ash' (Bruce Campbell) is thrown into a time portal and ends up in the year 1300 AD. Trapped in the past, and battling hoards of the undead, Ash must bring peace to the land, and find a way back to his own time.The violence in Army of Darkness seems to have been toned down to try and gain a wider audience. This would also explain why the film was titles Army of Darkness instead of just simply 'Evil Dead III'. Army of Darkness begins with a recap of previous events, so it's possible to watch this film without having seen the first two. But is this what fans of the previous films wanted? I'm sure that some of the fans, particularly those who are also fans of the horror genre, were disappointed with Army of Darkness's family friendly approach. I know that I was slightly disappointed. However, it was the comedy that won me over. The slapstick gags were all right on cue, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. The plot is very original, not following the formula set forth by the previous films.The special effects of the movie were very well done, especially the work on the makeup. It was convincing enough for the audience to suspend disbelief and get lost in the story. A lot of people agree, me included, that the use of CGI is overused in modern films. This is what makes army of Darkness so visually appealing, relying on the use of puppets and makeup. It's a refreshing change from the CGI we see a lot of today.Bruce Campbell is still just as brilliant as ever, giving his character plenty of attitude and, well, character. I still have trouble deciding whether Ash is a hero, or just a man caught up in a series of great events. At times he can seem incredibly brave in the face of danger, and at others he can be incredibly arrogant and even cowardly. It makes his character more complex than the usual hero. The whole joke of Army of Darkness is that the fate of the world is left in the hands of a man whose ego is matched only by his incompetence. Ash means well, but he is far too concerned with his own problems than the big picture. Campbell is always a riot to watch, with a great presence on screen. He's definitely an under-appreciated actor.Army of Darkness isn't as funny as Evil Dead II, which relied on satire and black comedy. Army of Darkness still packs plenty of laughs, but through the use of slapstick instead of over the top violence. The action is great fun to watch, blending in well with the humour. Sam Raimi's trademark camera work also comes into play, remaining entertaining and fresh after three films.Overall, if you're a fan of the previous films you should definitely see Army of Darkness. It's a fun adventure, and is guaranteed to get at least one laugh out of you.

Very few films can mix the genres of horror and comedy, but Evil Dead II manages to do this, and do it very well. It really can make you scream and laugh at the same time.

It's more of a retelling than it is a remake. This gave the film makers a greater degree of creative control, because they could make up the rules as they went along. If there was something in the original film that they disliked, they could completely ignore it. Likewise, if there was something they wanted to do for the first film, but were unable to, it could now be included.Evil Dead II doesn't have the same atmosphere or buildup from the first film, instead opting for going straight to the action. This makes it less of a horror film than the first, although it does contain enough scares to warrant a viewing from horror fans.In Evil Dead II, Ash is constantly battling his own demons, literally. Throughout the film he frequently becomes possessed, alternating between the characters of 'Ash', and 'Evil Ash', further blurring the lines between hero and villain. This amps up the danger from the first film, because Ash is now becoming the creature he's been trying to destroy.The fact that Ash is his own worst enemy is played up even further when his hand becomes possessed.

Evil Dead II shows us what would have happened had the original film been created on a greater budget. The effects are better and the gore is slightly more realistic.

It's got all of the wonderful sets, costumes, and special effects that money can buy, and has plenty of dark and stormy atmosphere. The set pieces are memorable, as are the various guises for the immortal blood sucker, who in this instance is connected to the real life historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, who loses his beloved wife Elisabeta upon her receipt of (false) news of his death, and furiously renounces God, living on through the centuries as an undead fiend who decides to put down roots in late 19th century London. He fixates upon the lovely Mina (Winona Ryder), the spitting image of his long lost love, but an intrepid team of vampire hunters are determined to prevent his reign of terror from enduring. Right from the start, it's amazing just how much pizazz Coppola and company put into this thing, and he and his cast & crew deliver entertainment on a grand scale; the ambiance is just overwhelming, and the film not only succeeds on a visceral level (with generous doses of the red stuff) but an emotional level as well. It's important to note that Dracula is not an entirely unsympathetic figure, and his scenes with both Mina and Lucy (Sadie Frost) have the appropriately sensual, seductive quality. The most potent ingredient in the mix is the phenomenal performance of Gary Oldman, one of the great actors of his generation who is never less than completely convincing, whether he's being forlorn or just plain creepy. Anthony Hopkins (as Van Helsing), who actually generates most of the laughs, Richard E. Grant (as Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (as Arthur Holmwood), and Bill Campbell (as Quincey Morris, the Texan) comprise a wonderful supporting cast, and singer Tom Waits is most amusingly cast as the inimitable Renfield; Keanu Reeves gives the role of Jonathan Harker an honest effort, but he's simply miscast and tends to stick out too much. Be sure to look out for the likes of Monica Bellucci and Jay Robinson in small parts. A first rate technical crew includes cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, production designer Thomas Sanders, costume designer Eiko Ishioka, and composer Wojciech Kilar, who immerse us in this vivid environment totally and completely; the period recreation is as good as one could want it. The film gets particularly rousing towards the end with the journey to Dracula's castle through snowy weather, although the final battle is over rather quickly.

Even though it tells a truly saddening story, it's mostly presented in a very joyful manner, with spectacular performances and great dance-and-sing acts.Christopher, a young English writer, arrives in Paris in order to follow the Bohemian Revolution that started in the city's underground world. However, after he is introduced to the prostitute and drug infested community things start to spiral out of control. He meets a beautiful courtesan Satine and deep affection soon follows. The romance takes a hold of this young couple, but nothing can be complete without a few problems on the road. Mainly, the Duke, the sponsor of the whole play, has a thing for Satine too. And in order for the great performance to come to fruition she has to stop running around with Christopher and give in to Duke's filthy desires&#x85;It's amazing that through this simple story Baz Luhrmann is able to depict the harsh truth about our lives. Even if we love someone dearly and with all our hearts, there can always be someone to stand in our way.

Sometimes I just really don't like them, such as 2001 A Space Oddysey, or the Tree of Life. Other times I like them, but find them so over-rated such as last year's Drive. A lot of these films have a similar problem, they are much more Style over substance, and I don't have a problem with that, I enjoyed Transformers, and Roland Emmerich is one of my favorite directors. But with these films, the style just get's boring. I don't want to watch two people sit motionless for twenty seconds, or watch crap float through space for five minutes, or cut to dinosaurs for twenty minutes for no reason. Yet Donnie Darko doesn't really have that problem.There actually is quite a bit of substance here. The film does have some really good ideas, like how Donnie's visions all come together near the end, and how he criticize therapy. And like a lot of these other art house movies, it looks great, I like how the music tells the story at times.However there are two problems I really had with this movie. One was that some of the characters, don't act like human beings. And the other was the ending. Warning, this has spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen the movie.I know the ending wasn't supposed to be clear.

As a knight, he would have brutally sent many people to their deaths but now, facing his own mortality, he encounters fear. He could (misguidedly) kill in the name of God with an unflinching, black and white faith but now as he sees the true nature of death, he begins to experience doubts as to whether God exists at all.The film's simple but striking technique of showing death personified of course recalls the portrayal of the Grim Reaper throughout the art of the medieval period and the idea of death playing chess with those he stalks is a striking and simple one. The fact that the chess scene takes place on a beach, a meeting place between two worlds (land and water reflecting life and afterlife) is also subtle yet profound.Bergman's trademark austere cinematography is at its best here, highlighting a bleak world largely devoid of a human population. The bleakness reflects the lack of hope in the era and in the character's spiritual struggle and serves to undermine any idea of the Middle Ages as a romantic time of chivalry. Block's character, shawn of such a facade is shown to be a man who has committed great evil as a member of the military and now struggles with his guilt and his mortality.His dialogues with Death are profound with the scene in the confessional being particularly well-realised. Even when trying to confide in a priest does death stalk him and haunt his thoughts. Perhaps this shows the futility of a religion (medieval Catholicism) that caused such horrors as the Crusades to occur in the first place.Likewise, flagellates roam the land but they, too, have no answers. They merely reflect, and add to, the horrors around them.As he searches for signs of God he overlooks the simple, hopeful life of the naive members of the traveling theatre troupe and, especially, their joy in their new child. Inarticulate, they cannot express philosophical truths but they live them. Their banal, low cultured performances may not bring much respite to the surrounding villages but their joie de vivre despite all that is happening life a faith.

Of course, it is tempting to read post-1945 horror films as reflections of the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps and Dr Mengele's experiments but, in more general terms, this film is a critique of the arrogance of academics and their disengagement from humanity.In this sense, the scientist figure embodies all of the arrogance of the academic clever in his own field but insular and so focused on a goal that he cares not who he hurts in the process. Fortunately, he does not simply go down the path of delivering a hammy mad scientist performance.Like many horror films, then, there is a rejection of the excesses of the extreme fringe of the enlightenment in the sense that when the pursuit of knowledge comes at the price of compassion and human understanding it is no longer worth the cost. indeed, the caged dogs the doctor keeps for his experiments shows that it is not just his daughter's face he is trying to save but he is also intent on the pursuit of knowledge at the cost of these animals' suffering.At the same time, he is able to save lives at his hospital and it is the power over life and death and the notion of valuing one life over another that are also at the core of this film.His hospital\/manor residence, set at a distance from Paris again symbolises academia and the idea of the ivory tower. The fact that the experiments occur in a basement symbolise his fall into depravity and the hellish nature of what he is doing. Whilst the life-saving hospital is above ground, the hidden world of unethical experiments lies below, hidden beyond the walls of the garage. Perhaps this is also a reflection of ideas that a human is merely a machine with replaceable parts as easy to fix as any automobile.The female characters are mostly marginalised. They invoke sympathy as victims of his experiments but it is, of course, the faceless character who takes vengeance against the man who is, ironically, supposedly doing it all for her. Scob's performance is a strong one with her face hidden behind a mask, her eyes and body language must convey her emotions. Largely mute, her motivations are never clearly defined beyond her clear compassion for her father's victims.One could read the idea of her as a faceless person, locked away from society in terms of female dis-empowerment, that without beauty they are worthless (in fact, she is even denied access to a mirror, symbolising loss of all self-hood.) These ideas echo the motif of the imprisoned woman without a voice found throughout much Victorian literature, most famously Jane Eyre. Indeed, this was a key focus of Gilbert and Gubar's seminal academic work, The Mad Woman in the Attic. However, this notion is subverted by the fact that this woman is in fact the moral heart of this story; though she has no face and rarely a voice it is her ambiguous final action, compassionate to the trapped females and dogs and yet brutally violent towards her father, that brings the film to its resolution.Perhaps the director is saying that female solidarity is stronger than loyalty to one's father or perhaps this is just a reaction to the horror before her that she has slowly uncovered.The quietness of the film lends to its mood as does the slow pace. The bleakness, again, is reminiscent of much British and American horror of the period, relying less on gore than a feeling of the uncanny.Beyond Scob though, this film is marred by its weak performances, its unadventurous cinematography and uninteresting use of settings and lighting. The suspense never really builds and the ending, whilst a case of poetic justice, when the dogs are set free by the faceless girl, turn on their master and mutilate him in turn is extremely predictable and telegraphed from the outset. Overall, one can therefore only consider this a weak film by French standards though fans of the horror genre and feminists are likely to find it of much more interest.

It is quite hard to believe that the film was once subject to controversy; not only is it reasonably tame compared to modern standards, but it is also pretty realistic and doesn't fetishize or glamorize the violence (as opposed to the modern torture porn genre for example). It is additionally confusing when one looks back onto a film that is about as morally-sound and positive as you could hope &#x96; pretty much to a fault actually.The plot sees Caine getting drawn into violence and ultimately we all know where this is heading from the start because the film is from a certain period and a certain genre. Watching it again it is disappointing that so much of the film seems clichéd and rather obvious in terms of the dialogue, but maybe this is because it has been done so often since, it is hard to say in retrospect, but for sure the film does feel very obvious across the telling. This doesn't make it a bad film though &#x96; just perhaps a little clumsier than I would have liked. The delivery is still impacting though and the film does well to create a sense of characters with no future but death or jail; there are moments of relaxing and family, moments of joking around and moments of violence &#x96; the film does well to make them all just seem like part of life here.

This was my childhood from as early as I can remember and I still watch them to this very day.The concept for this film was nothing short of epic and director Dick Donner pulls out all the stops to deliver the goods and for the most part he pulls it off.Probably Donner's most inspired choice was in the casting of the magnificent Chris Reeve. Reeve is a proper actor, flexible and convincing in almost everything he does and in this his character acting shines through as he plays the dual roles of the heroic Superman and the bungling Clark Kent. Gene Hackman also provides a wonderfully colurful villain in Lex Luthor. The production of the film is as big as you could get for the time and you can tell that meticulous detail was taken to shoot every scene.Unfortunately this is where the praise slows down. The problem is that the entire film is just too slow. The opening scenes in Krypton and Smallville are wonderful, dramatic and extremely touching but the whole film takes a major downfall when we enter Metropolis. Superman does very few actual heroic deeds and there just seems to be a lot of talking in between. The epic drama was great for the origin at the start but the rest needs much more meat and the lack of a proper physical foe in favour of disasters really doesn't deliver. The other problem is that the film is a product of it's time. I have absolutely no doubt that Dick Donner and the whole cast and crew did the most cutting edge work that they could, but the reality is that the level of effects that Superman needs to be convincing just didn't exist in 1977. Even as a child I could see it was a screen behind the actors when they flew. Another problem is that the film absolutely reeks of the 70's. The dialogue, the mood and the blatant fashons stand out like an embarrassing sore thumb and in places make the film look cheap and a bit tacky. In saying all this, the crew did an absolutely stunning job with what they had and it's still a great film, but it's a great film which has aged badly.If you are going to watch this film, watch the uncut version which has more scenes and a bit more action in it.

It's grittiness and over the top violence is a delight that can't be found nowadays.Following the exploits of five college students, the audience is lead into an isolated cabin in the woods, where something evil lies in wait. What is this great evil, you ask? Well, it's a book. But not just any book, 'the Book of the Dead', inked in blood and bound in human flesh! Using a book as the source of evil was an ingenious decision. It takes a familiar image, one usually associated with wisdom and knowledge, and completely turns it around, creating an item of evil and torture. We find it hard to believe that such a simple, inanimate object could be the source of such terror, leaving the audience wide open for when the real baddies show.The film gives birth to one of Bruce Campbell's most famous movie roles, 'Ashley J. Williams', a fan favourite and icon of the horror movie genre. Campbell brought this character to life, walking the line between fearless hero and sheer incompetence. Our protagonist is a man scared out of his wits, whose only talent seems to be dismembering the bodies of his possessed friends. Raimi and Campbell would later take the character in a completely different direction for the sequels, making him goofier and even less reliant.Raimi's creative use of the camera has become a staple in his movies, to the great joy of the audience. One such technique is the constant use of 'point of view' shots, showing the audience what it's like to be the monster. These shots are clever, because we never see what is chasing the protagonists. This is a great horror technique because the audience has to use their imaginations to fill in the gaps. The monster can be anything that the audience can think of, which is especially frightening because people have a tendency to imagine the worst.The cabin in the woods, the central location for the film, completely isolates the characters from any kind of salvation. This does for The Evil Dead what the boat on the ocean did for Jaws (1975), a small oasis in the middle of nowhere, the monster lurking just outside. The audience is never shown any scene that takes place outside the woods, making them feel just as trapped as the characters.Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is the stop motion scene towards the end. In the early 80's, stop motion was the closest that a low budget film could get to CGI, due to the lack of technology. The scene was unexpected, disgusting and incredibly fun to watch! The Evil Dead seems to be aware that it's a very simple movie, almost parodying itself and the genre. This would be built upon in the later sequels, taking the humour to all new levels. But the first film in the trilogy is a far more traditional horror film, relying on atmosphere, suspense and tension building to get a reaction from the audience.It's cheesy at times, filled with the usual horror clichés, but this is what we love about it. It never takes itself seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to. There are many big budget horror films today that try to come close to The Evil Dead but fail miserably.This movie will forever be a horror classic.So, switch off the lights, grab a bowl of popcorn, and maybe even a change of underwear, because this is one horror movie that won't disappoint its audience!

It was a unique take on mental psyche which can delve deep but seem on the surface like a straightforward slasher film. Though, I admired its blend of thriller and satire where it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't descend to a comically inept level by maintaining a certain level of tension. 'American Psycho' gives no importance to anything else but for one man who would be satisfied with the attention Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic, patronising yuppie who is presented in a most enigmatic fashion, a man who has a high flying life yet idealises something more out of the ordinary. His character paints a picture of blatant and oftentimes comical irony. He shows how self obsession can drive you off an edge, how your mind can be the instigator of absolute insanity and emotions ranging from depression to prime aggression without the need for external influence which Christian Bale portrays starkly well. Simultaneously, he acts as quite the paradox as he acknowledges his plunge into insanity and does little to help himself. The greatest irony though is how, after all his attempts, the story comes full circle where his life is just normal, regardless of what he does. For him, his nocturnal, sociopathic tendencies are all just a game, a simple transgressive indulgence he feels he is entitled to. His motives however are a prime example of the black comedy in the film, they can probably be likened to a young kid throwing a tantrum because other kids have more than him and possessions better than his own. Except Bateman's obsessions with superiority are never too little to kill for.I've never seen a more confused and directionless character, one conflicted by so many emotions and so intricately complex. I can't imagine an author expecting more out of such an absorbingly curious character than Christian Bale brought out in this pinching satire on personal fulfilment and domination. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman his self monologue claims and it's left up to you to examine what you see and decide what it is all about, real or imaginative. Don't expect him to give you a determinate answer though. If provoking thought isn't a show of acting mastery on Bale's part and deserved of honours, I'm not sure what is.

I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book.Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work.

The film truly captures the coolness, daring and unconventional approach to art that was to define that decade forever.Given that, in France alone, the era was to see the end of the de Gaulle government, the 1968 student riots and the end of the horrific war in Algeria, the nouvelle vague was prescient in reflecting the upheaval to come and questioning the established order.Godard famously uses jump-shots throughout this film, drawing attention to the fact that the film is not a reflection of the real, that it is a contrived piece of art and that he, as director, is making editorial decisions. it also reflects the rapid, sometimes chaotic pace of life in the modern city and behind the wheel of powerful, modern automobiles.The hand-held cameras and filming in the streets lend a sense of immediacy and the references to Bogart link the film to the gangster dramas of the past. Here, the reference is half-tribute, half-parody. The Belmondo character seeks to emulate the characters Bogart plays but knows he can never be as cool as he perceives Bogart to be in his mind. Likewise, his insistence on stealing American cars instead of French vehicles suggests a worship of the new consumerist culture being imported from the United States that is all about facades - American appears cool though it is not. It is the land of consumer aspirations so Belmondo steals cars to satiate the desire it instills in the black market customers yet he cannot keep any car for long. He must continually try what is novel and new, just as consumerism drives people to acquire more and more goods.Godard himself is, of course, the infant terrible of French cinema. Here he takes all of the lessons learned during his years as a Cahier critic and systematically rejects them, creating something wholly new in the process. As with modern artists though, he is part-genius and part-fraud and the line between the two is often blurred. The film is as much about drawing attention to the director and establishing his profile as it is about a standalone work of art.This, then is the moment when the artist embraces celebrity culture, much like Warhol was to do in America.Established ideas are subverted playfully and frustratingly throughout. The notion that dialogue should have a point and either develop the themes of the story, the plot or lend insight into the characters is subverted by a pointless half-hour long conversation that goes nowhere.Seberg's character is a mixture of femme fatale and naive fool by turns, ultimately turning on her lover out of confused curiosity instead of a sense of righteousness or for gain. The notorious ending with its misheard dialogue subverts any idea of a neat conclusion and reinforces the vacuousness nature of the artificial, constructed character.The interview scene with the famous writer again reinforces the notion that this is half-fraud, half-genius. His replies to the journalists' questions are by turns profound and flippant.Ultimately, though, it is the film's energy and atmosphere that set it apart. After the static, stage-bound films of the mid-1950s, here is something that embodies the zeitgeist. The energy, grittiness, fast-pace and fluid, hand-held cameras stand in stark contrast to static, moribund efforts like the 1955 version of Nana by Christian-Jaque. The energy of the film reflects the Belmondo character's largely devil-may-care nature that makes him stay with the girl when logic tells him he should flee Paris.Ultimately, this film broke new ground in what was possible and allowed smaller, independent film-makers to dare experiment without the backing of large studios. It expanded the grammatology of film-making by introducing new techniques and applying old ones in new ways. It also ushered in the era of the auteur as stamping his or her own vision on a film irrespective of commercial pressures or studio politics and led to a revitalisation of the art form as a whole, setting France on a distinctive new path away from the purely commercial style being wholeheartedly embraced in Hollywood and England. It is part-genius, part-fraud but a unique breath of fresh air all the same.

The protagonist was a quaint college professor, who falls asleep and meets a woman next to a shop window with a painting of her. The whole point of that film was a dream that enticed with sex and freedom that proved destructive.Look at the annotation of this. The dream is pretty much the same, a meek cashier at a big firm yearns for a bohemian, exciting youth he never had, to be loved by a pretty young girl and be able to devote himself to his painting. He's also a painter on the side, in his own living-room. Of course he meets a young girl, impresses as a famous painter, and the sexual fantasy is gradually fleshed out around him. In the end, he paints her portrait and the portrait finds its way on the window, which is another way of acknowledging the dreamer of the story, asleep in the midst of images.This is all you need to know as introduction if you haven't seen it. Otherwise, read on.There are several layers nested inside of this, all about the illusion of conventional reality and conflating art, sex, and storytelling. One of the most stunning is that he rents a Village penthouse where he can escape to for love and painting, but the thing acquires life quite apart from him and he's really an outsider, always interrupting some plot or masquerade.The second perspective is from the end of the woman and her scheming boyfriend, who manipulate for money this bohemian dream he's having. This supports the outer, let's say more contrived elements of noir - deception, a femme fatale, the con.So he has gone along with the woman's notion that he's a famous painter, also pulling the strings of an image, being a storyteller, but she is discovered as a great painter in his place, in order to convince she spouts many of the same romantic notions about art he told her. He goes along with this, another story, another image being staged as the real thing. His theory is that he was never going to be recognized as himself, because appearances are everything. And this is what the dream is about; in real life, he is henpecked husband to a domineering wife, always told to do the dishes and donning a ridiculous flowery apron to do it. This is who he is, a submissive being. So he cannot help but dream up a situation where initial confidence and control is taken away, and once more he finds himself smothered by a strong woman, once more unknown as a painter, but now the woman is attractive, and his art devoted to rapturous feelings for her is valued.More fakery ahead; a dead husband returning to life, a trial where witnesses go with the fabricated version (this is stunning and deserves its own essay-long post), the protagonist repeatedly denied truth when he confesses.So this is it. Life could be simple, if we could only put a line around feelings. It isn't, so we paint, seek out sex, or fashion stories in our head about the impulses.Each of these is a only another layer of paint that obscures the real thing, which is often so banal, so unromantic, say a flower being painted inside a bathroom, that one option is to paint our way through to a world of fiction and dwell there.The result of this is shown to be more or less disastrous for everyone, this is the moral pull in the other direction. Our protagonist suffers a common noir fate; he dreams so far that he is no longer recognized as himself, a broken soul stranded in urban limbo with voices of the stories in his head.The other option would come around the time of Antonioni, the cessation of stories (regular readers will know that I identify this with Buddhism).
