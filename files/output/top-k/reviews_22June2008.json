I did not know of what it had been like when the original Star Wars films came out and what it was like to see them on the big screen. But when I was 12 I went back and watched all of the Star Wars movies. Of course I had seen all of the originals before(if you're 12 and you haven't, then your living under a serious rock)and had seen the phantom menace in theaters when it came out. And I must say, The Phantom Menace is probably the strongest of the Prequel Trilogy. I am writing this review after Episode 2 and 3 came out and to me, they were crap. The entire love interludes between Anikan and Padme were just stupid. It was not like Star Wars. Of course there had been love in Star Wars before, it had never been that much. And it was ALWAYS well done and important to the storyline. This was not. Anyway, The Phantom Menace was Star Wars dumbed down a bit. It was made for the new generation, so of course the humor was different, and some of the elements, but it was still Star Wars. There was a huge epic battle at the end including one of the best lightsaber battles in the series. Overall, it was a fun, exciting movie that all ages could enjoy, and was Definitely BETTER THEN EPISODES 2 AND 3!

To describe the basic plot it is enough to say that the main character spends the film in a sort of dream state in which he meets\/sees all manner of people who discuss ideas, theories and philosophy of life &#150; and that's more or less it.OK so by now you already know whether you will hate this or not, although you don't know if you will like it. If you're in the mood for an action film with everything spoon-fed to you then just leave this one on the shelf of course. So now we are down to who will like this film and I sort of fall into that camp but not entirely due to the film itself. The constant stream of rambling discussion and thought is rather hit and miss. At times it made me think for myself around what the characters were saying and it engaged my brain in a way that I suspect it wanted to. At other times the philosophy and thoughts are those of the pop-culture Gen X slacker and as such they are depth for those with shorter attention spans. At other times it just came over as out and out pretentious. Of these three feelings the split was reasonably even and it did damage the film that it was not as smart or as insightful as it clearly wanted to be.It did do enough to make me glad I watched it though and this feeling is partly down to the experience of watching something that stands out from everything else. What I mean by this is that watching it one never doubts that you are watching an indie film with a lot of creativity and ideas behind the writing and delivering of the film. OK so it doesn't all work and not all the ideas turn out to be good ones but as an cinematic experience it is nice to have something that is not another genre comedy or serviceable action blockbuster. This creativity expands to the animating of the life-action and again while not totally successful it is at least interesting. This technique is sometimes pointless when it is literally just animated life-action but it introduces movement to static items, visualises words and of course allows things like floating to be easily shown. I would not want to watch a film done this way every week but again seeing it not only done but done for a reason within the material is worth the experience.Waking Life is far from a good film but it is undeniably creative and interesting. As much works as doesn't about it and the material could have been stronger for a better film but it is still an experience worth having if you know what you are getting into. It is the summer season and the next massive (and disappointing) effects-driven blockbuster will be along imminently so Waking Life is worth checking out because it is the polar opposite by being experimental, creative and interesting.

But I was surprised how good it was in both story and performance. While it entirely ditches the plot of the novel, the writers did manage to keep some of the character history which gave it some legitimacy as an Ian Fleming adaptation. It also added some depth to the villain that could sometimes be lacking in the series. The film relies more on drama and light suspense than gadgets and action; it's more of a cat-and-mouse game than a race to save the world. The only drawback to the plot is the inclusion of the Solex. I suppose this was added in an attempt to reflect the current world energy crisis, but its handling of it gives a grounded, gritty action\/drama film a bit too much of a sci-fi touch. Scaramanga's Fun House set is a bit silly for the proceedings as well. Might have been a bit more interesting had the two stalked each other through the streets of Hong Kong. But the locations are beautiful, John Barry's score is better than I remember and Moore balances toughness with his trademark light touch very nicely.

I thought I had never seen this before but some scenes I did remember that I must have seen as a boy. I recalled I was hearing Peck speaking French as an English naval officer but there were no subtitles.Raoul Walsh presented Peck as the stern but wise commander actually not too far different than the character Greg played in the then recent TWELE O'CLOCK HIGH. This was also a beautifully mounted color film that was not the normal case for this time period. Great scenery and action sequences.However, there is a lack of depth in the characters. The tribal king who revolts against Spain is an one note character. Peck is cordial but barely hides his contempt for such a man. When he frees Virginia Mayo who was held captive with Spanish officers, he gives a loud clearing of his throat that becomes a running gag throughout.He has two officers who wager on his exact words which make a bit one note as well. The joke just isn't that funny enough.I'm really not spoiling anything by letting people know that he will be victorious and win Mayo's heart in the end in spite of the fact both are married to others when they first meet.Peck also has an unusual sword fight that also retained in my memory as a boy.

With the outlawing of gambling on earth and the potential for it being legalised on the moon, Nash finds his club to be hotly sought after by the local lunar mobsters. His continued refusal to sell though ultimately sees his place bombed and his life under threat. With pretty young waitress Dina and trusty old robot Bruno in tow, Nash tries to stay alive long enough to get to the man responsible for trying to kill him.Two things drew me to this film. One was Rosario Dawson, who is as good an actress as her agent is bad at making decisions on commercial roles &#150; plus she is stunning which is a big part of it. The second was that this film was slated as one of the worst ever and indeed was once on the bottom 100 on this site. Seeing it for myself I was surprised that it was not that bad but it is no doubt that it is no good at all. The plot is a bit like Total Recall but with the main difference that Total Recall was funnier, more exciting and actually very good. Pluto Nash is full of ideas but it can't do much with any of them other than churn out genre clichés. This wouldn't matter too much if it were funny because, after all, this is a film that markets itself as a sci-fi comedy. Sadly though there is not a single laugh in the whole thing and only one single moment that gave me a very slight chuckle.This leaves the plot to do most of the work and, while there is a solid sci-fi plot here mostly the film misjudges it and relies too heavily on coincidence, obvious devices and just plain ol' lapses of logic to make it move forward. The effects are pretty good and I imagine quite expensive. The actors can't do much as they are lost in a comedy without laughs and a sci-fi without a decent plot or flow. Murphy does the usual in these situations and falls back on big grin ladies man as his character, it is lazy, tired and, without laughs, tiresome. Dawson also just falls back on her looks but in this film that doesn't get her very far &#150; it is clear she is not even able to try. Quaid is stuck in a poor robot role with one or two bad gags to work with at best. Pantoliano has done better but will survive but I'm sure for all the time they got on this that Guzman, Mohr, Boyle, Grier and Cleese all wish they could have this expunged from their CV's.Pluto Nash is not as bad as everyone says &#150; it is just that critics love to slate things when they get the chance because so many films are OK or a bit sub-par. However this is not me defending it because it isn't any good either. As a sci-fi the effects are good but the plot is a mess of clichés and badly formed ideas. As a comedy it falls even harder by failing to even have one laugh in the whole damn thing &#150; not one. No wonder the cast are so at sea in this poor star vehicle.

If I could, I would go back and change my rating of The Godfather to an 11 and make this a 10. With the exception of the Lord of the Rings films (and even that series didn't win two best pictures), no sequel can say that it strengthens the original film and that's why Part II is so good.At an epic 200 minutes long yet rarely boring, Part II tells not only the story of Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) as he takes over the family, but simultaneously tells the background of Don Vito Corleone (DeNiro) who was played by Brando in the original. To the modern viewer, DeNiro feels like a gimmick, but this was his first prestigious role and he is quite convincing as a younger version of Brando's performance. Leading man Pacino is incredibly commanding yet again as Michael as this time we see the weight of being Don grow heavier and heavier on his shoulders. As usual, it's too difficult to explain the business plot of the film, which has plenty of double-crossings and twists that the pervasive feeling of paranoia that is so ingrained in the original continues quite masterfully in this film.The acting talent is across the board so good that you have to give casting team and Coppola some of that credit. This film had three best supporting actor nominees at the Oscar's for goodness sake. If the Golden Globes that year had the best ensemble category, this film would have won it hands down. My personal favorite is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I would trust him with my life too.Everything about this film is so well done (especially the set design for New York, Italy, Cuba, etc) that it's hard to notice sometimes because you're so drawn in to the plot and following it. Coppola makes you think something tragic can happen at any second and when it does, it always delivers. The ending sequence is something that directors have stolen left and right when trying to make their ending just as powerful. While The Godfather has more memorable scenes and dialogue, this film is a masterpiece in its own right despite not having as much glitz as the original.Of course, in terms of themes, The Godfather Part II continues to address the original's themes in new and meaningful ways. The themes of what family truly is and means get expanded upon and become so complex as seen through Michael's relationship with his wife and brother Fredo. The back-in-time plot arch with Vito sheds additional light on the Michael part of the film as well. All of it just makes Part II a rock-solid classic.

It is a shame that the interweaving with the Hamlet narrative doesn't work better because the original scenes have a delicious playful tone to them in regards language and the nature of minor characters; I found these specific scenes to be fun and engaging and only wished the film could have maintained this energy and approach.A big part of these scenes working is down to the delivery and both Oldman and Roth are really good not only with the fast pace of the dialogue but with the out of it attitude and sense of detached bewilderment that they need to carry for the majority.

From the very start we find ourselves in the type of pub\/club that, as an educated liberal I find incredibly intimidating. I'm not trying to be elitist (although I'm sure it will come across that way) but the characters in this film are instantly recognisable to me and very frightening. People who carry their frustrations without knowing what they are angry at and ultimately are just out and out angry at everything whether it be just a minor bump in a pub. This is the world of the film and within it we have a loose narrative about a problem within the family of Billy, who is a junkie but the main thrust is less about a specific story but rather just putting the audience in the middle of this trapped and violent family and leaving us to find our own way.This approach makes the film a little weak structurally and does produce some scenes where Oldman relies on heavy use of music to just play over silent scenes but mostly it works. The way that it does work is that the experience is so visceral and convincing that the viewer doesn't care so much that it lacks a story with star, middle and end but rather feels the scenario and characters.

Winstone has become famous off the back of characters like this and he nails not just the anger but the misplaced sense of frustration and inadequacy; he doesn't wear it like a badge but merges it really well into his character so that it is easy to just see him as an angry thug.

Burke is better known as a comedic actress but she is tremendous here &#150; really convincing and full of fear, when she says she feels so very old I really believed her. Creed-Miles feels a bit out to one side but is also strong &#150; as are Morse, Morrison and others in supporting roles.Nil By Mouth is not a fun or pleasant film and the language is extreme and endless. Nor is it a great film in regards structure, flow or narrative. However what it is very good as is an experience which is convincing and uncomfortably real. Poverty is terrible in any place and being trapped in it for generations is worse; Oldman does not pity his characters nor does he blame others for their problems but he makes them both sympathetic but also repugnant and it is the overall experience of watching that make thes film one worth seeing.

I can only agree. I watched it for the second time on Saturday afternoon after a fairly boozy Friday night with a friend who hadn't seen it. I found it pretty unbearable at times, as did the friend. Its tension relating to the verbal revelation of unspeakable acts is peculiar to this movie. The closest thing to it would be if Hitchcock had staged a group therapy session. The embarrassment, disbelief, revulsion and denial of the group is palpable to the sucked-in viewer. At times we wish the avenger Christian would just f*** off and let us enjoy the celebration! (As another reviewer said, at times the viewer feels almost intrusive, and by the same token shares the feelings of the group). Strangely, the intensity of its disturbing middle section, with the battle of wills between father and son, is only lightened once the group has been broken down and forced to accept the truth by a memorable missive from beyond the grave. Two performances I haven't seen praised here are that of the chef, a burly bloke who grew up with Christian and is on his side, who helps make the unmasking of Christian's father possible; and the weedy, neurotic-looking man who keeps trying to leave saying, I can't take it! I already suffer from depression! That might have gone for many in the audience too, if it weren't for something noble about the entire enterprise that keeps you glued to your seat.

I've now seen it three times, but I'm certain to see it again.The fictional character of Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) is based upon a real-life serial killer who stalked the streets of Dusseldorf. Fritz Lang, the director, had read an article about that killer and constructed this thrilling story that relates how Beckert is finally brought to justice.The film opens with a sequence that establishes the latest disappearance of a small girl, Elsie Beckmann (Inge Landgut), with her mother (Ellen Widmann) waiting and waiting, and finally calling anxiously for Elsie from her apartment window, set high in the lower-class tenement block. The expected hue and cry ensues at yet another ghastly murder; the citizens are again outraged that the murderer is still loose; the police are stumped for clues; and, most importantly, the well-connected criminal bosses in the city are angry &#150; because the police step up raids across the city trying to find the killer and, in that process, prevent them from continuing their criminal activities. So, they decide to find the murderer themselves and get rid of him&#133; And, to compound the dramatic irony, Lang has the police launch a massive manhunt, across the county, for all men with a history of mental illness. As a result of that search, the file on Beckert turns up, and so the police set up a stake-out at his apartment when clues there substantiate their suspicions.Hence, both sides of the law are frantically trying to find Beckert, but for very different reasons. The question is who will get to him first? The narrative then moves on to where Beckert is currying favor with his next little victim, when he is spotted by one of the city's criminal low-life, who then follows him around to make sure it's the killer he's found. Satisfied, the man cleverly marks Beckert on his overcoat, with a large, white M, and then runs off to raise the alarm and get help from the rest of the gang.Thereafter, it's a three-way race Beckert finds the mark on his back and runs to ground, to hide in a large office block, but not before the criminals see him enter the building; the criminal gangs then assemble a large force that breaks into that block after hours to find him; and the police, alerted by a tripped alarm from the office block, finally rush over to find only one criminal still there, ironically forgotten by his friends.The sequence in the office block, with Beckert trying to stay hidden, while the searchers get closer with each passing minute, is one of the most suspenseful &#150; and quasi-comedic &#150; actions ever put to film. Years later, Ray Milland appeared in The Big Clock (1948) with a very similar setting which, in turn, was remade with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in No Way Out (1987) &#150; and both of which I'm sure owe much to Lang's superior effort with M.It's a great visual story (reason enough to see it, in my opinion), but it's also Germany's first talking film. And, to say anymore about the narrative would spoil it, if you haven't seen it yet.What's equally great is Lang's filming and direction, using light\/dark; high and low angle shots; shot-reverse shot; voice-over narration that matched remote action (a first in cinema); and sequences that tell a story with no words; and all with the consummate originality and skill of a master practitioner. Little wonder that this film constantly ranks within the top 100 of all time.Special mention must also be given to Peter Lorre, an actor unknown to Hollywood at the time of release. His portrayal of a child-killer is flawless. For the first hour, he hardly says a word, his looks and actions doing more than enough to show his character. Only after he is trapped in the office block does he break his silence, and with devastating effect. Lang then does the unthinkable, almost he shows Beckert's psychology and vulnerability, with exquisite irony, to the extent that the viewer begins to feel sympathy for the worst of the worst. It's an unforgettable narrative achievement. (In contrast, who has ever felt any real sympathy for Norman Bates, the psychopath from Psycho 1960?) Interestingly, when Lorre did get to Hollywood, he appeared in a film called The Stranger on the third floor (1940), in which he again played the part of a psychopathic killer, this time of women. And, of course, who can forget his droll portrayal as Dr Herman Feinstein in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)? The rest of the cast for M is more than adequate; in fact, I understand that Lang actually used a number of real criminals during shots of the criminal gangs, and especially during the final act. I was particularly taken with the boss of the criminal gangs, Schränker (Gustaf Grundgens) and the two main policemen of this story, Inspectors Lohmann and Groeber (Otto Wernicke and Theodor Loos, respectively).Some reviewers exhibit frustration with what appears to be an ambiguous end. Considering the times, however, I think there's little doubt about the outcome. You'll have to make your own assessment, obviously.Highest recommendation for all.

Well... my most favorite and most memorable experiences out of all Hitchcock films. This may not be HITCH'S best. I mean, it's not like there's more suspense in this film than any other Hitch film, but I say this one is one of the best of the suspense\/gripping genre&#133; THAT SAID, I must note that the suspense is very fragile in this movie. It's only superior if you are willing to participate in the film. And the problem with that is, it may not be very easy for some people of this day and age. Especially young people who are not familiar with older and simpler films. They end up wondering what was this all about? Why did so many people HIGHLY recommended this film?!.But, first, let me say here why I think Rear Window is one of the best... it's because of it's structure, and how superior IT is (I'm not talking about the suspense and gripping moments, that just comes from how the structure is stacked up, but it's not the structure itself).Now people may not refer to story structure very much, or at all. Or, in fact, they may despise it. Or maybe they've never even considered or hear or read of it. But you cannot deny the fact that structure is inside every movie that you see. Even if you can't accept that fact.Though, structure can be hard to explain, but it's not hard to analyze when you watch a movie. Really what it is, is the layout of events that forms together a story. And depending on whether or not that story has a serious purpose or not and what is done with that purpose, you can then know whether or not you have a great film, a superb movie, or even just a good or decent film, or not... maybe even a bad film.Though people can argue about the difference between bad structure and just simply bad deliverance. Which can be totally different subjects and probably isn't worth arguing. Though I don't believe it's worth arguing. Everyone has their own opinions, and they can look at films however they want to look at films. There should be no argue.So, I say, if you haven't seen this film, you should. But you SHOULD NOT expect TOO MUCH. If you're not hooked (by your own will) into the film about a quarter way through it or maybe more. Or else you might have to say goodbye to that suspenseful climax near the end. Although it took me about two to three viewings before I lost the suspense. But who knows, maybe it'll come back. I don't know. But my first, I can say, was the best and the most superior because I watched it from the very beginning with hardly no expectations, rather then anticipations. I mean, I was literally dying to jump into my TV screen. But once it ended, I was tossed out of the window. That's how good it was for me, and it will NEVER be that good again. Mark my words. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend it if you are willing to participate in this film as much as I was for the first time. If you're not going to participate, DON'T! 'Cause this film, to me, is hardly anything more than a suspenseful and gripping treat. But you've got to participate! But if you've already seen it and you didn't get a good experience (rather than an impression), just simply take Hitch's advise and watch it from the very beginning and have no BIG expectations and just let the movie take you (which those are kind of my advise, though he might've gave them too).

Why did so many people HIGHLY recommended this film?!.But, first, let me say here why I think Rear Window is one of the best... it's because of it's structure, and how superior IT is (I'm not talking about the suspense and gripping moments, that just comes from how the structure is stacked up, but it's not the structure itself).Now people may not refer to story structure very much, or at all. Or, in fact, they may despise it. Or maybe they've never even considered or hear or read of it. But you cannot deny the fact that structure is inside every movie that you see. Even if you can't accept that fact.Though, structure can be hard to explain, but it's not hard to analyze when you watch a movie. Really what it is, is the layout of events that forms together a story. And depending on whether or not that story has a serious purpose or not and what is done with that purpose, you can then know whether or not you have a great film, a superb movie, or even just a good or decent film, or not... maybe even a bad film.Though people can argue about the difference between bad structure and just simply bad deliverance. Which can be totally different subjects and probably isn't worth arguing. Though I don't believe it's worth arguing. Everyone has their own opinions, and they can look at films however they want to look at films. There should be no argue.So, I say, if you haven't seen this film, you should. But you SHOULD NOT expect TOO MUCH. If you're not hooked (by your own will) into the film about a quarter way through it or maybe more. Or else you might have to say goodbye to that suspenseful climax near the end. Although it took me about two to three viewings before I lost the suspense. But who knows, maybe it'll come back. I don't know. But my first, I can say, was the best and the most superior because I watched it from the very beginning with hardly no expectations, rather then anticipations. I mean, I was literally dying to jump into my TV screen. But once it ended, I was tossed out of the window. That's how good it was for me, and it will NEVER be that good again. Mark my words. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend it if you are willing to participate in this film as much as I was for the first time. If you're not going to participate, DON'T! 'Cause this film, to me, is hardly anything more than a suspenseful and gripping treat. But you've got to participate! But if you've already seen it and you didn't get a good experience (rather than an impression), just simply take Hitch's advise and watch it from the very beginning and have no BIG expectations and just let the movie take you (which those are kind of my advise, though he might've gave them too). Let's just hope you're second viewing is better than your previous.9.0\/10 ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"22 June 2008","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As a director Mank was always at his best working from his own Original Screenplays and the ones we mostly remember - Three Wives, Eve, Contessa - we remember for their dialogue rather than visuals so notwithstanding George Apley and Five Fingers we always felt uneasy when he was involved in 'adaptations' especially when those adaptations were the works of major players, like The Honeypot - Mank out of Ben Johnson and this one in which Tom Williams adapted his own one-actor with a little help from Gore Vidal.

Also you need to be prepared as the movie is a bit confusing as there are no less then three threads woven in the story. I have read that the movie is based on two of the novels of Anne Rice, which the writers then try to work into one movie. This might explain the obvious complexity.The main thread of the movie tells us of the vampire Lestat who gets involved in awakening Akasha, a god-like vampire, who's first and only thought after rising is to destroy anything in her path. Since us mortals can have a sour mood after one night, this might reflect the hangover an immortal can have after sleeping several thousands of years(and been fed upon by Lestat somewhere along the line). Not an unreasonable sentiment I suppose. This first thread is getting more confused because for some reason Akasha has decided that Lestat will be her consort and therefore is excluded from the list of beings to exterminate. We are not told why. Maybe this is what sucking on super-vampires will do for you. The second thread of the movie is taken up by the story of the world-weary vampire Lestat in which we are told that his unlife is dull. In fact he is bored from the moment he is turned into a vampire and in the end he is so bored that he exposes himself to the public by becoming a Gothic rock-star(hint Marilyn Manson) thus invoking the wrath of the other vampires, who don't like to be exposed to the general public. Anything for a little bit of excitement I suppose. The third thread is the story of a girl named Jesse who's only mission in life seems to be to offer herself as a sacrifice to Lestat. Lestat refuses to do his duty as a vampire and serves anyone else but this girl up to the very end. Maybe not unreasonable in hindsight, as this girl chases away his boredom this way. However this idea is never brought forward in the movie. But with all this complexity you need to have a good crew to make the movie work and here is where it starts to falter. This movie has an obvious tight budget with it low budget gci graphics and inexpensive movie tricks and works with a unremarkable crew starting from the director down to the screenplay writers and cast. The director might not be bad, but in this movie he is certainly not great. The writers(Anne Rice seems to have declined the honor of participating) have difficulty to work the novels into a proper story line. Not strange since they have no track record to speak off. Unfortunately the movie for a large part is made up out of dialog and while this might sound easy to achieve, it is in fact very difficult to keep an audience captivated with dialog for more then five minutes. And in this movie more then half of the running time is made up out of dialog only. The main cast isn't inspiring. Stuart Townsend I found uninteresting. Aaliyah certainly is interesting and she was around that time a popular singer, but as an actress she had almost no experience and in this movie she moves and speaks in an awkward way as if she is partly a snake. Maybe this was on purpose, but the reason is not explained and to me it just looks likes bad acting. Perez and Moreau are decent actors, but their characters are so locked down that they can't save the movie whatever they do. What I found a bad point for the movie is the fact that it to obvious tries to attract various audiences. Aaliyah is added to attract her admirers, Townsend is a Gothic rock artist to attract the Gothic crowd(and gives away a almost ten minute performance halfway the movie for this end only) and the story itself is set to entice Anne Rice fans. None of these people will watch the movie with satisfaction I think.My entire point is that the movie could have been better if the team had concentrated on one main thread, added more action and had made more of Aaliyah's other talent performing. Personally I would have replaced Townsend by Perez. The entire 'Jesse' story was pointless and could have been left out. The look back on Lestats past seems also rather pointless so it could have been left out as well, or maybe only brought up as flashback.

The version of that DVD is the one with 75 minutes only and the picture and the sound of it is quite good. Anyway, I saw it last night, quite late but I knew since the beginning that this film could keep me awake easily and it did that. Keaton is Johnnie Gray, a train engineer and s because of his work that he wasn't accepted in the Confederate Army. Is fun how actually this is good since Gray is not accepted because his actual job is quite important but of course Johnny doesn't know that so he can't tell anything when his girlfriend (Marion Mack) believe that he is a coward, thanks to what her father and bother said, and left him. The film is set during the Civil War and is just fantastic how Johnnie wants to help the Confederates but mostly because external factors. First he wants to join the army because of his girl and later he began to chase the ones that stole his locomotive and ends hearing the Union strategy. Both chases are amazing and hilarious thanks to the cleverness and the skills of Johnnie but also his luck have an important role (Buster Keaton is brilliant making many impressive scenes and later Marion Mack joins him and both delivers terrific scenes). The end is also magnificent and actually Johnnie was the hero, a very lucky hero, and of course he doesn't get any credit but he finally can join the army and return with his girl (actually Annabelle Lee was with him since he rescue her from the Union in other great coincidence) Is funny to think in the consequences that can bring that choice since I don't think Johnnie can have the same luck in every battle but who knows.Conclusion The General is a classic of the silent film era so you should watch it at least once. As I write before I saw it last night, by myself, and today I showed it to my family and they enjoyed it a lot. I loved it and even it doesn't need more recommendations I still strongly recommend you this classic picture of Buster Keaton.

The version of that DVD is the one with 75 minutes only and the picture and the sound of it is quite good. Anyway, I saw it last night, quite late but I knew since the beginning that this film could keep me awake easily and it did that. Keaton is Johnnie Gray, a train engineer and s because of his work that he wasn't accepted in the Confederate Army. Is fun how actually this is good since Gray is not accepted because his actual job is quite important but of course Johnny doesn't know that so he can't tell anything when his girlfriend (Marion Mack) believe that he is a coward, thanks to what her father and bother said, and left him. The film is set during the Civil War and is just fantastic how Johnnie wants to help the Confederates but mostly because external factors.
