That is a doomed relationship from the start, Max being so young and all.Also Herman Blume, a wealthy industrialist stars having feelings for the teach.That makes Max and Herman the worst of enemies.Wes Anderson's Rushmore (1998) is a fascinating drama comedy.It's written by Wes and Owen Wilson, who's not doing any acting in the movie, but his brothers Luke and Andrew do.The acting is brilliant in the movie.Jason Schwartzman does a terrific job as the eccentric Max Fischer.Bill Murray gives a strong performance as the unhappy millionaire.You can see and feel the emptiness he feels inside.That's good acting.Williams is very good as the popular teacher.Seymour Cassel plays Max' barber father and his performance is perfect.So is Brian Cox as Dr. Nelson Guggenheim.Sara Tanaka gives a sweet performance as Margaret Yang, a student who likes Max but he doesn't response to her feelings.Also Dennis the Menace Mason Gamble is in the movie as Dirk Calloway, and he's great.Connie Nielsen plays his mother.I bought this DVD yesterday and I'm glad I did.It's not kind of a movie you see everyday.It's different and therefore interesting.

I liked the idea of Jason going up against a girl with special powers. Some of the scenes worked, but there were a lot of improbable scenes as well. Her ability to raise people from the dead was just a cheap way for the director to bring Jason back to life. The ending was even worse, and probably one of the reasons I give this such a low score. The ending truly did kill this movie, and some of the poor acting didn't help either.What else to say about part seven. Well it's not the worst in the series, but it's definitely not one of the better ones either. The original and part 6 are still my favorites, and even they weren't what I would call good films. Of course I never saw any one of these movies in the theater. Good old HBO made it all possible.

When Jimmy, played by Crispin Glover, is nailed to a door frame, for instance, you can't help but think producers simply ran out of ideas.

Those elements are still here, as are Jay and Silent Bob; but, there is also a terrific story of relationships and love.The film centers around Holden, a comic writer and artist who has a crush on Alyssa, another artist, who also happens to be a lesbian. Holden strikes up a friendship with Alyssa, based on shared friends and acquaintances and mutual amusement. However, friendship is not enough for Holden and he professes his love for Alyssa. Complicating things is the deteriorating relationship between Holden and his partner, Banky. Banky repeatedly tries to wake Holden up to the reality of his relationship with Alyssa, but also seems to harbor a deeper resentment. Love blooms for the unlikely couple, but is irrevocably damaged by Holden's difficulties in dealing with Alyssa's past.The script is first rate, a cut above Smith's previous efforts (skillful as they were). The relationships are far stronger and there is a real story here. The performances are outstanding, particularly Ben Affleck and Jason Lee. Smith helped show that Affleck could really act, given the right material. Joey Lauren Adams acquits herself quite well as Alyssa. The supporting characters are funny and memorable, with a new twist given to Jay and Silent Bob. The visuals are still rather static, but continue to show growth on the part of Smith.The film was critically lauded and highly successful, given it's small distribution and limited budget. It showed the depth that was lingering under the surface of Smith's previous efforts, and showed that he could handle bigger ideas. It cemented his reputation as a writer of sharp dialogue and amusing characters, while adding an understanding of relationship dynamics. It's also very funny and heartbreaking. If you only ever watch one of Kevin Smith's films, make sure it's this one.
