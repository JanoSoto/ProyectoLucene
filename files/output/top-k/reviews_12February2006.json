But, as most of you who read my comments know; I live, breathe, to criticize. And though it pains me, Fellowship of the Ring is full of things to criticize.I have earlier had little faith in Cate Blanchett as actress material for big, heavy roles. I saw her play Queen Elisabeth, and I wasn't impressed at all. So, when I heard she had been cast to play Galadriel, I thought; 'Oh no, this is gonna suck...' I'm so relieved to say that she proved me wrong. She impressed me, and I was happy. But I'm sorry to say that Marton Czokas (which I knew from Xena Warrior Princess as Borias) wasn't the best choice. He did a great job, but unfortunately, he doesn't have that charismatic presence that I expect from an elf. I could maybe say the same about Hugo Wearing, playing Elrond, but Hugo has this really great facial mimics that I just can't help but love. I have mostly seen Viggo Mortensen in roles in movies that I don't like too much (both before and after LotR), but his Aragorn was brilliant. Or rather, Peter Jackson made a brilliant decision in casting Mortensen. (I can't really put my finger on which Aragorn moment was my favorite because I never really saw a bad Aragorn moment.) Elija Wood as Frodo was absolutely a great performance, and so was Ian McKellen's Gandalf (adding humor to the character was really good, I liked that). But no one, and I mean NO ONE, came close to Sean Astin. When I read the book, I came to a conclusion Samwise was the most annoying, whiny, cowardly guy I've ever read about. And Astin portrayed him just like that! Of all the characters in the book, Samwise was undoubtedly the one who was best transfered to the screen. Big hands to Sean Astin for this.Now, the orcs... I don't really know what to say here. The orcs have their own language, so I was a bit disappointed that no one single word of their language was spoken. Wait, that's not true. One person speaks it; Gandalf. But GANDALF ISN'T AN ORC! The orcs are always portrayed physically in different ways, so I have no right to say that these creatures did not look like orcs. But Alan Lee, one of the most famous Tolkien artist was hired in to make conceptional sketches of everything, including the orcs, and as I know his artwork, I just have to ask; why didn't all the orcs resemble his art? The Uruk-Hai didn't look like those he has drawn\/painted in the past.Now, to my absolute favorite character The Balrog! I - Love - The Balrog! I've always tried to picture how the balrog would look like, and most of the time I haven't gotten a grasp of it. Then I've looked at some of the pictures and paintings that has been made of it, and I have thought; 'Hey, that looks really cool!' But then, it is due for a film adaption. How would that work out? Well, personally, I was obviously impressed! This is how I realized that. When I was at the premiere, and the balrog had fallen, my side man said 'You must close your mouth and swallow too, man.' I had just taken a drink of my coke, and now I was sitting there with my mouth open and coke was pouring down from my mouth and onto my shirt. People, I never get that impressed by films, no matter what! The balrog is the first, and so far the only, creature on film who has made me stare in awe.

These include THE ROSE, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB, RUTHLESS PEOPLE, BEACHES, and this film. It can safely be said that she is more than just a great singer and entertainer, but (when given the right material) she is one hell of an actress in comedy or drama. Although she got nominated for an Oscar for THE ROSE, and she has many fans for her performance in BEACHES, I suspect her performance in FOR THE BOYS may be her best dramatic role.She plays Dixie Leonard, a New York based singer, whose husband is in the armed forces in World War I. She lives with her son Danny in the city. Her uncle, Art Silver (George Segal), gets a notable entertainer Eddie Sparks (James Caan) to hire her for his UFO show. Dixie is a success, but from the beginning she and Sparks have one conflict or another between them. Eddie is pretty ambitious and determined to succeed, and so is Dixie, but Eddie can be more ruthless to do so - even to cutting his losses at the expense of other people. Yet Eddie can show a better side (although one that suggests opportunism again and again). During the first UFO tour he arranges Dixie to see her husband again after nearly two years. But he makes sure that the scene is photographed and filmed for propaganda and career reasons. After the death of Dixie's husband, Eddie becomes close to Dixie's son Danny. However, he teaches Danny to have contempt for school, and he puts patriotic ideas into the boy's head - leading to Danny going into the military. Danny (Christopher Rydell) is a Captain at the time of the Vietnam War. He too is killed during a war (in front of his mother, on a well televised U.F.O tour).The film actually is told in flashback by Dixie, as she is being asked to appear at a special televised ceremony where she and Eddie are being awarded medals by the U.S. Government. She is a lonely, bitter woman, and she loathes the very thought of the program. Eddie is going to get a medal too. Will she go to confront Eddie after all these years? Will Eddie finally admit how he felt about the loss of Danny.The film is quite well done, capturing the spirit of the UFO shows in wartime London (1944), wartime Korea (1952); and wartime Vietnam (1967) although one song is slightly anachronistic. It also gives us glances at the high water mark of radio programing in the late 1940s (before television began to impact upon it). Finally there is a look at the effect of the McCarthy period, as it effects Segal and Midler. The three principals give first rate performances, Middler best in the scene when her son dies, and Caan earlier, when he witnesses the death of a boy soldier in Korea (his first witnessing of such a tragedy in a war). Caan literally looks like he has suffered shell shock as a result. As for Segal, watch his bitter Santa Claus scene, where he gives out Christmas gifts while swallowing a tremendous amount of bile and anger.

Gone With The Wind is book that sounds like a book having racist elements in it. I am pretty aware that the book was published before nearly 30 years of the time activists like Martin Luther King but I can sense that M. Mitchell has a sympathy for the social strata of the South. She limns house slaves like Mammy and Pork as devoted and loving servants whom the whites treat like family. In the novel, all masters treat all slaves well. Although some admirable characters dislike slavery, Ashley and Frank among them, once the slaves are freed both the characters and the narrator describe blacks as trashy, insolent, and creatures of small intelligence. Plus we can easily feel that the writer approves the acts of Ku Klux Klan. In the movie it's not too easy to see that element but you can catch a few words like Rhet Butler's description poorly-brained darkie... Vivian Leigh as the strong,selfish,opportunistic Southern belle Scarlett has a good performance while Olivia de Havilland as the physically frail but spiritually strong and good-hearted Melanie is satisfactory enough. But let me tell you that Hattie McDaniel as the old heavy set mammy deserves the Best Actress in a Supporting Role she got as the the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar. I had admired Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins in Pygmalion but I thing his performance as the honorable but weak Ashely Wilkes is really poor. The performance of players give really something to the should of the movie but really I am a person who attaches importance to little details in a movie. It is not possible that you can see a detailed technical description of fall of Atlanta towards the end of civil war. Even f there were the necessary technology the runtime would not permit that. It's already 225 minutes. Another thing is that Scarlett has one kid from each of her three husbands but we don't really see any of her kids other than Bonnie. In the book characters use alcohol to cope with stress, but when they abuse alcohol, disaster ensues. Drinking is partly responsible for Gerald's death he rides his horse while drunk, misses a jump, and is thrown to his death he doesn't actually dies because riding crazily after Jonas Wilkerson the white trash as he is called both in the book and in the movie.He gets drunk after refusing to sign an oath stating that he was a Union sympathizer, and breaks his neck jumping his horse over a fence on the way home.Morover in the book, Suellen ends up marrying Will Benteen, a Cracker who comes to live at Tara after the war.Will Benteen is not a character in the movie&#151;and so Suellen's marriage is never mentioned. One more thing is that...that night when Frank Ashley and other decent people go to a Ku Klux Klan meeting(the movie never mentions that name openly) well when the Yankee guards come to search Melanie's house they read David Copperfield at home in the movie but actually they read Les Miserables in the book and we never see Archie-Scarlett around in the movie! In the book, Archie is an ex-convict whom Melanie allows to sleep in her basement, and who stays on out of obligation to her. In the movie, several of Archie's lines in the scene where they are waiting for news of the ill-fated Klan raid are said by Mammy. But after all this is a pretty adaptation for such a 1000 page book. The performances of the players and the technical skill of the film in spite of its time make up for that.If someone is a book-worm he\/she will definitely love the book more. The is not a flawless masterpiece but still worth-watching after all!

I am pretty aware that the book was published before nearly 30 years of the time activists like Martin Luther King but I can sense that M. Mitchell has a sympathy for the social strata of the South. She limns house slaves like Mammy and Pork as devoted and loving servants whom the whites treat like family. In the novel, all masters treat all slaves well. Although some admirable characters dislike slavery, Ashley and Frank among them, once the slaves are freed both the characters and the narrator describe blacks as trashy, insolent, and creatures of small intelligence. Plus we can easily feel that the writer approves the acts of Ku Klux Klan. In the movie it's not too easy to see that element but you can catch a few words like Rhet Butler's description poorly-brained darkie... Vivian Leigh as the strong,selfish,opportunistic Southern belle Scarlett has a good performance while Olivia de Havilland as the physically frail but spiritually strong and good-hearted Melanie is satisfactory enough. But let me tell you that Hattie McDaniel as the old heavy set mammy deserves the Best Actress in a Supporting Role she got as the the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar. I had admired Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins in Pygmalion but I thing his performance as the honorable but weak Ashely Wilkes is really poor. The performance of players give really something to the should of the movie but really I am a person who attaches importance to little details in a movie. It is not possible that you can see a detailed technical description of fall of Atlanta towards the end of civil war. Even f there were the necessary technology the runtime would not permit that. It's already 225 minutes. Another thing is that Scarlett has one kid from each of her three husbands but we don't really see any of her kids other than Bonnie. In the book characters use alcohol to cope with stress, but when they abuse alcohol, disaster ensues. Drinking is partly responsible for Gerald's death he rides his horse while drunk, misses a jump, and is thrown to his death he doesn't actually dies because riding crazily after Jonas Wilkerson the white trash as he is called both in the book and in the movie.He gets drunk after refusing to sign an oath stating that he was a Union sympathizer, and breaks his neck jumping his horse over a fence on the way home.Morover in the book, Suellen ends up marrying Will Benteen, a Cracker who comes to live at Tara after the war.Will Benteen is not a character in the movie&#151;and so Suellen's marriage is never mentioned. One more thing is that...that night when Frank Ashley and other decent people go to a Ku Klux Klan meeting(the movie never mentions that name openly) well when the Yankee guards come to search Melanie's house they read David Copperfield at home in the movie but actually they read Les Miserables in the book and we never see Archie-Scarlett around in the movie! In the book, Archie is an ex-convict whom Melanie allows to sleep in her basement, and who stays on out of obligation to her. In the movie, several of Archie's lines in the scene where they are waiting for news of the ill-fated Klan raid are said by Mammy. But after all this is a pretty adaptation for such a 1000 page book. The performances of the players and the technical skill of the film in spite of its time make up for that.If someone is a book-worm he\/she will definitely love the book more. The is not a flawless masterpiece but still worth-watching after all!

I also had forgotten how truly funny it is and it is seldom for comedies that can make me laughing after one viewing.I'll admit that I haven't seen original Frankenstein or even Bride of Frankenstein but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Young Frankenstein a lot. It is one of those rare films that everyone is at their top of game and they're able to produced masterpiece. We got Gene Wilder, whose is truly superb as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, whose kept insisting on Fronkensteen. Marty Feldman is damn hilarious as Eye-Gor. Madeleine Kahn is as funny as Wilder's fiancée. Teri Garr is so hot as assistant to Wilder. Cloris Leachman is very amusing as Wilder's grandfather's mistress Blucher, whose like to abusing the horses in her spare time. Mel Brooks' direction is great and I think 1974 really belong to him because he had Blazing Saddles come out earlier that year.The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking in Young Frankenstein because it managed to replicate original vision of Frankenstein, which is very impressive. Also, it was very smart of them using black and white photography because it only enhanced the film even more and give it timeless feeling. One can watch it over and over and still miss the sight gags because the pace is pretty fast so you have to be on your toes, which isn't something that you can say about comedies these days. You can notice that many people whose are working on Young Frankenstein really enjoy making it a lot and I heard a story that when principal photography was almost complete, which saddens many crew members so Brooks had wrote extra scenes so they can have more fun. I don't think you will see that type of stuff these days. Actors in Hollywood are only interesting in money so they just memorized the lines then film it then leave it. The results are that it won't probably turn out as good as Young Frankenstein.The set design is just plain out awesome and in fact, it is same location that they had shot original Frankenstein on, which makes it very interesting experience. Some guy whose had worked on original Frankenstein was willing to return back to fix some old sets for Young Frankenstein and even updating some of those equipments, which is really neat. It just makes you feel like that you're truly there to experience whole thing.The difference between Young Frankenstein and satires or parodies are that Young Frankenstein paid homage to films that it is based on then poke fun with them, not at. Young Frankenstein was done out of love for original Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the book that had start it all by Mary Shelley. Perhaps, that's why I really enjoy Young Frankenstein a lot because it doesn't reduced original Frankenstein to ashes like other satires or parodies does.One performance that I admired the hell a lot is Kenneth Mars, whose played Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp. Mars could have made that role as merely fiddle to solid casts but he did something very different with that role, which is very amusing. That arm of his, don't get me start on that. It's great sight gag and I always laughing at that when he has to use that arm of his to make his points or to deceiving Wilder. Also, Mars add something new to his character, which he made his character talk very funny. It resulted in really hilarious situation when mob couldn't make out what he had said and Mars had to stress on what he had say. But I also like Peter Boyle's performance as The Monster. There is so something about child about Boyle's character. I don't know what is it about that but all I know is that it always end up in hilarious situation like when he went to Gene Hackman's house and I always roared with laughter at that part.It's been awhile since I had receiving Young Frankenstein as present but I will always cherish it because it turn me bona fide film buff that I am today.

They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including Imitation of Life, All that Heaven Allows, Magnificent Obsession, and many others.Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He's so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation.

How is this possible, for a film that was nominated for 7 Oscars and won 3 - the second highest scoring film in the 1991 Oscars? There seems to have been some kind of curse placed upon Dick Tracy. Whilst it was financially successful, got several rave reviews and is generally acknowledged as one of the best looking films of all time, its' reputation seems to have decreased through the years. When telling a friend that there was news of a possible sequel, he replied a sequel to Dick Tracy? Didn't everyone hate that film? Where it's got this negative reputation from, I don't know. As far as I can see, Dick Tracy is a perfectly sound film.The acting is in all places fine, and in some places brilliant. The most often highlighted performance in Dick Tracy comes from (not-surprisingly) Al Pacino in his role as crime boss Big Boy Caprice (earning him his 6th Oscar nomination), who is obviously enjoying himself in his first real departure from complete drama. Glenne Headly makes a great addition to the cast is her role as the long-suffering girlfriend Tess Trueheart - and is highly admirable, considering this was her first blockbuster role. Whilst both Warren Beatty himself and Madonna in their respective roles might not be worthy of any awards, they certainly do not perform terribly - indeed, Warren Beatty does a good job of bringing a two dimensional cartoon character to life, considering the said character was not really treated to the same broad characterisation in his paper form as Batman, Superman, The X-Men etc. were treated to before films were made about them.The look of Dick Tracy is immense. Lighting, production-design, cinematography, costume design, make-up; all departments were near perfect. It's becoming a bit of a cliché to say that the look of Sin City is quite close to Dick Tracy, yet it is quite true; Sin City being heralded as an icon in film imagery. In particular, cinematographer Vitorio Storaro should feel aggrieved that he did not receive more recognition for his work.The music of Dick Tracy is well documented. Indeed, much effort seems to have been put into making sure the music was a success - the hiring of veteran composer Stephen Sondheim to compose the musical numbers, and an undoubtedly good singer to perform them in the form of Madonna. Yet another underrated aspect of the film is Danny Elfman's score - its Gershwinian influences immersing the audience in the 1930s. In particular, the recurring four note theme used to signify the presence of the film's amoral gangster-cum-vigilante The Blank is particularly chilling, mysterious and (to a 7 year old child, the age I first was when I saw Dick Tracy) terrifying.Perhaps the one area in which the film lacks is the writing. While I feel that the plot is suitably fun and complex, the execution of writing this plot by script-writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. is a little laboured at times. The films sub-plot, leading to the film's surprise twist at the end has major problems; the two writers seem not to sure about whether they are supposed to be making said twist a surprise or blindingly obvious for the vast majority of the film.Having said that, I have seen this film countless times and have enjoyed the experience on each occasion. How Dick Tracy has secured its' dubious reputation as a film is a mystery to me. I would recommend at least giving it one try.And for God's sake, let's have more than a token DVD release, please!

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"12 February 2006","score":"","review":" At the time of writing, the rating for this film on the IMDb is 5.7 out of 10 stars. How is this possible, for a film that was nominated for 7 Oscars and won 3 - the second highest scoring film in the 1991 Oscars? There seems to have been some kind of curse placed upon Dick Tracy. Whilst it was financially successful, got several rave reviews and is generally acknowledged as one of the best looking films of all time, its' reputation seems to have decreased through the years. When telling a friend that there was news of a possible sequel, he replied a sequel to Dick Tracy? Didn't everyone hate that film? Where it's got this negative reputation from, I don't know. As far as I can see, Dick Tracy is a perfectly sound film.The acting is in all places fine, and in some places brilliant. The most often highlighted performance in Dick Tracy comes from (not-surprisingly) Al Pacino in his role as crime boss Big Boy Caprice (earning him his 6th Oscar nomination), who is obviously enjoying himself in his first real departure from complete drama. Glenne Headly makes a great addition to the cast is her role as the long-suffering girlfriend Tess Trueheart - and is highly admirable, considering this was her first blockbuster role. Whilst both Warren Beatty himself and Madonna in their respective roles might not be worthy of any awards, they certainly do not perform terribly - indeed, Warren Beatty does a good job of bringing a two dimensional cartoon character to life, considering the said character was not really treated to the same broad characterisation in his paper form as Batman, Superman, The X-Men etc. were treated to before films were made about them.The look of Dick Tracy is immense. Lighting, production-design, cinematography, costume design, make-up; all departments were near perfect. It's becoming a bit of a cliché to say that the look of Sin City is quite close to Dick Tracy, yet it is quite true; Sin City being heralded as an icon in film imagery. In particular, cinematographer Vitorio Storaro should feel aggrieved that he did not receive more recognition for his work.The music of Dick Tracy is well documented. Indeed, much effort seems to have been put into making sure the music was a success - the hiring of veteran composer Stephen Sondheim to compose the musical numbers, and an undoubtedly good singer to perform them in the form of Madonna. Yet another underrated aspect of the film is Danny Elfman's score - its Gershwinian influences immersing the audience in the 1930s. In particular, the recurring four note theme used to signify the presence of the film's amoral gangster-cum-vigilante The Blank is particularly chilling, mysterious and (to a 7 year old child, the age I first was when I saw Dick Tracy) terrifying.Perhaps the one area in which the film lacks is the writing. While I feel that the plot is suitably fun and complex, the execution of writing this plot by script-writers Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. is a little laboured at times. The films sub-plot, leading to the film's surprise twist at the end has major problems; the two writers seem not to sure about whether they are supposed to be making said twist a surprise or blindingly obvious for the vast majority of the film.Having said that, I have seen this film countless times and have enjoyed the experience on each occasion.

That would make a great topic of discussion for this film, John Carpenter's Halloween, because the viewer should know that in watching this film, you are really watching the birth of a sub-genre- something that doesn't happen every day.True, prior to Halloween there were foray's into the depraved and violent. Films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Black Christmas also introduced us to the concept of the psychopath, and how he can function so effectively in a malevolent fashion prior to Halloween. However Halloween dons the role of father of the slasher sub-genre because it was Halloween, and not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left or Black Christmas that a myriad of filmmakers tried without success to duplicate.The genius of Halloween is the simplicity of its story, and the intensity of its madman. The story is about three girlfriends who, during a night of babysitting, are ruthlessly attacked and dispatched by a masked maniac who seems to be driven to his impulse to kill without provocation or logic.If people find modern movies like Hostel, High Tension or Wolf Creek to be tense and frightening, how then will they react to this film. One of the girls, Annie, has but to turn around whilst she's on the phone and she will come face to face with the masked monster- yet she doesn't in time to see him.Linda does come face to face with the monster, but only when he's covered over with a sheet in a crude mocking imitation of her boyfriend, who the masked killer had dispatched earlier. In the course of the next few minutes, she too is dispatched in a cold and calculating way by the monster.The monster of course is Michael Myers, however I prefer the logic of calling him The Shape because there is no emotion or urgency that surrounds him. He is like a zombie in his movements and expressions, yet violently efficient in his actions- so much so that we get the real sense of what it would feel like to be stalked, yet without the understanding of why the monster feels compelled to stalk.Ultimately in the final scene, the virtuous and shy Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a truly all-American girl next door kind of performance) squares off with the Shape, sacrificing herself so that her charges (the children she is babysitting) can escape and call for help.Along the way, the movie is full of valid indictments about our vary lives which are still true right up to this day the passive neighbors who refuse to help Laurie when she is pursued by the Shape; the expert who is ignored by the establishment that is committed to its procedures; the absolute need to scapegoat. Perhaps it is this relevance to our own lives that makes Halloween so terrifying.Either way, if you're one of the few who has not seen this film yet, might I recommend you give it a peak.

There is no singular motion picture that had left such profound impact on me as film buff and not only film buff but as a regular guy who enjoy really good cinema. I personally think it's one of the greatest epic films ever made and will not be matched because it is really product of its time and everything just fall in right time.Vivien Leigh's performance as Scarlett O'Hara is so outstanding that one has to overlook the many candidates for that role. Also, it should be interesting to see that Leigh has been always first choice, despite huge auditions process with many well known actresses like Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead. Without Leigh, Gone with the Wind would be very soapy, very dated, and somewhat dull. Also, it helped that Leigh had solid co-star, whose is Clark Gable. Gable brought his own style to his role, which is amazing because I cannot think of anyone in that role. In fact, I was surprised to learn that Gary Cooper had been offered that role but rejected it because he thought it would be huge flop in Hollywood history. Gable only accepted that role so he can get married to Carole Lombard, whose was magnificent comedian in her own rights.You know how you always watch great films but always find something new in each viewing? God, Gone with the Wind was like that for me. When I watch it for umpteenth time, there are so many parts that I had forgotten and it add a lot to the experience. I had forgotten how wonderful barbwire dialogues between Gable and Leigh and it enhanced the film very well. I would love to see it in theater someday but I'm perfectly satisfied with my copy of DVD.Gone with the Wind remains landmark because it is quintessential epic film and it has genuine sweep of any epics that I had seen. Modern filmmakers wouldn't know how to structure the film like Gone with the Wind because they don't know how to tell the story. I felt that today's epics are just bunch of b movies with huge budgets like Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Jackson's King Kong. Gone with the Wind is in class all by itself and the box office has prove that since it is the film that sold the most tickets ever. When you adjust the box office inflation, Gone with the Wind would be always number 1 because it is made for blockbuster and it shows that the audience is very appreciative.On repeated viewing, I was very surprised to see how the editing works so well in Gone with the Wind that I hadn't noticed on my previous viewings. Take the scene where Gable and Leigh are riding through Atlanta when it is about to burn. Look at the background between one of their dialogues part and you can see rear projection but when it is cut to other side, everything around them is very real, especially the house. It show how ahead Gone with the Wind is in technical sense. But it doesn't matter because the story is so gripping and very engrossing that you just develop the attachment to the characters, which I did.It is seldom to see singular piece of motion picture that just fall in right place, right time, and everything is just in sync. But that is Gone with the Wind. It isn't known for director's film but much of the film's success goes to David Selznick, a famous producer of Golden Era of Hollywood. Selznick was able to gamble everything he had on this film and he succeeds. Unfortunately, it's his huge failure as well because he cannot duplicate the success again, which would haunt him for rest of his life. Nonetheless, it remains the bona fide landmark film that would never ever be challenge.It is interesting to see 4 directors worked on this film yet only one got credit. George Cukor got fired because he didn't think it would be good. Victor Fleming replaced him and suffering from nervous breakdown and 2 directors relieved him. But like I said, it is astonishing piece of film-making craft because everything in this film is so convincing real.I don't think I would find another film that is like Gone with the Wind, if one is so inclined to remake it, which would flop for certain since the budget would be so outrageous enough for the studios not to pursue it. I don't doubt that one would be very reluctant to see this film because it is clocked at 3 hours and 50 minutes but I would like to assure that it is very engaging and move at relatively fast paced film. I've seen 2 hours films that would felt like if it last all day with no ending come in the sight but Gone with the Wind, despite its running time, move faster than any 2 hours films I saw. It proved that it is able to engage the audience and left profound impact on them.It is genuine magnificent motion picture, make no mistake about it.

Most famous quote in cinema history came after Scarlett pleading to Rhett Butler about what she should do next. There is no singular motion picture that had left such profound impact on me as film buff and not only film buff but as a regular guy who enjoy really good cinema. I personally think it's one of the greatest epic films ever made and will not be matched because it is really product of its time and everything just fall in right time.Vivien Leigh's performance as Scarlett O'Hara is so outstanding that one has to overlook the many candidates for that role. Also, it should be interesting to see that Leigh has been always first choice, despite huge auditions process with many well known actresses like Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead. Without Leigh, Gone with the Wind would be very soapy, very dated, and somewhat dull. Also, it helped that Leigh had solid co-star, whose is Clark Gable. Gable brought his own style to his role, which is amazing because I cannot think of anyone in that role. In fact, I was surprised to learn that Gary Cooper had been offered that role but rejected it because he thought it would be huge flop in Hollywood history. Gable only accepted that role so he can get married to Carole Lombard, whose was magnificent comedian in her own rights.You know how you always watch great films but always find something new in each viewing? God, Gone with the Wind was like that for me. When I watch it for umpteenth time, there are so many parts that I had forgotten and it add a lot to the experience. I had forgotten how wonderful barbwire dialogues between Gable and Leigh and it enhanced the film very well. I would love to see it in theater someday but I'm perfectly satisfied with my copy of DVD.Gone with the Wind remains landmark because it is quintessential epic film and it has genuine sweep of any epics that I had seen. Modern filmmakers wouldn't know how to structure the film like Gone with the Wind because they don't know how to tell the story. I felt that today's epics are just bunch of b movies with huge budgets like Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Jackson's King Kong. Gone with the Wind is in class all by itself and the box office has prove that since it is the film that sold the most tickets ever. When you adjust the box office inflation, Gone with the Wind would be always number 1 because it is made for blockbuster and it shows that the audience is very appreciative.On repeated viewing, I was very surprised to see how the editing works so well in Gone with the Wind that I hadn't noticed on my previous viewings. Take the scene where Gable and Leigh are riding through Atlanta when it is about to burn. Look at the background between one of their dialogues part and you can see rear projection but when it is cut to other side, everything around them is very real, especially the house. It show how ahead Gone with the Wind is in technical sense. But it doesn't matter because the story is so gripping and very engrossing that you just develop the attachment to the characters, which I did.It is seldom to see singular piece of motion picture that just fall in right place, right time, and everything is just in sync. But that is Gone with the Wind. It isn't known for director's film but much of the film's success goes to David Selznick, a famous producer of Golden Era of Hollywood. Selznick was able to gamble everything he had on this film and he succeeds. Unfortunately, it's his huge failure as well because he cannot duplicate the success again, which would haunt him for rest of his life. Nonetheless, it remains the bona fide landmark film that would never ever be challenge.It is interesting to see 4 directors worked on this film yet only one got credit.

All the characters are wonderful, and this is extremely underrated as well, plus Reese Witherspoon is simply incredible in this!. All the characters are extremely likable, and it will leave you thinking for a bit after you are done watching it, plus the ending is extremely sad but so incredibly well done. I had been searching for this movie for a while, since I'm huge Reese fan, and wanted to see some of her work as a child actress, and lucky for me it was in the rental section, and I must say I wasn't disappointed, plus it's extremely well made and written as well. I really loved the bond between the two sisters Reese (Danni) and Emily Warfield (Maureen), and Reese and Jason London(Court) made a really cute couple, and shared good chemistry, plus this should be even higher then the 7.4 rating it gets on this site!. It was unpredictable throughout, and Reese may have given the best performance from a child I have ever seen! plus the music is excellent.For a pretty much unknown cast for the most part back then, they performed extraordinarily well, and it had some really good dialog as well, plus Reese is just so adorable in this film. I especially liked the setting, and the scenes where Reese and Jason London were swimming in the pond together, were very cute and amusing, plus Sam Waterston has a lot of great scenes as the intimidating but very likable father!. This is one of Reese's most underrated movies, and there are a lot of moments that will really make you smile,plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when after Dani gets her 1st kiss, the next day she leans up beside Court, and puts a kiss expression on her face, as I thought that was really adorable, plus it had some great humorous moments as well!. I could tell from this movie that Reese was heading for super stardom eventually, as I rank this was some of her other top performances, plus while you may hate Maureen, at times, it won't last long, because you know it's not her fault, with what happened to Dani and Court.I hated it when the dad beat Reese with his belt buckle, thankfully he came to his senses, and the scenery is quite beautiful as well, plus it's a shame that this grossed over only two million at the Box office. You will really feel for the characters, and I loved how the family had such a wonderful bond, as they looked very close, plus I loved the conversation between Dani and Maureen at the end. This is a beautiful and poignant love story, that touches the heart, with a charming story and incredible performances, Reese steals the show, and if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it if you like love stories!.The Direction is outstanding!. Robert Mulligna does an outstanding job here, with excellent camera work, good angles and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is incredible!. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always and is incredible here, she is so incredibly cute, extremely likable, completely stole the show, had great chemistry with Jason London, and even thought this was her 1st movie, she looked like a true pro, that's how good she was, I also loved her perkiness and spunk as well, as this has to be one of the best debuts from an actress I have ever seen! (Reese rules!!!!!!!!!!). Jason London is excellent here as Court, he was rather goofy, but very likable, he also had great chemistry with Reese, I dug him lots. Emily Warfield is fantastic as Dani's sister, she was very pretty, and likable, and shared a good bond with Reese, I liked her lots, where is she now?. Sam Waterston is superb as the strict but caring father, he is a good character actor, I liked him. Tess Harper did what she had to do well as the Mom, I liked her too. Gail Strickland is adequate here, as Court's mom but didn't have much to do.

No doubt about it that Barbra Striesand is a great performer, but twasn't so in the beginning of her career. When I first saw her, to me, all she did was scream her songs out loud, but as time went on, something happened, and now,years later, where others loose their voice, Streisands just keeps going and going like the Energizers, and keeps getting better and better! Now, about Funny Girl The movie is not totally awful, it's just that she should have waited a few years later before attempting to make the Broadway Hit into a movie. Willie Wyler is really not the right choice for a director of a musical since he really isn't in that league. It's true that he was the first choice to direct The Sound of Music, but he gave up the assignment for another movie. He had stated that he knew that The Sound of Music would be a hit, but he never thought it would be THAT big of a hit! So, Columbia should have enlisted someone else to direct Funny Girl! Wyler was just not the right choice. Maybe Columbia thought that since he would not let Bette Davis get away with her shenanigans, the same would apply to Streisand, and Streisand was smart enough to let Wyler do the directing.For my money; the best musical that Streisand did was Hello Dolly. She really showed her talent to its fullest in Dolly and who cares if Carol Channing didn't do the film version? Channing didn't have the movie box office draw to bring everyone into the theaters; Streisand did! I just don't see any talent in Channings bugged-eyed groggling voice which sounds like her girdles too tight! So, if Streisand was going to make Funny Girl as a film, to me, she should have waited years later until she was older to do it, and with the right director, which Wyler wasn't the one, I believe you would have seen a different Fanny Brice on the screen and a more entertaining film. Don't get me wrong, the film is great and she performs the songs to perfection. I just think that there is something missing that isn't there, and it's too artsy-phartsy!

There are some scenes of gore, but they are significantly toned-down and minimized, and I think the move was a wise-one. Sometimes, gore detracts too-much from the narrative and the themes of a film, but not here. Reagan America seems pretty innocent to us nowadays, but it was rife with greed and cronyism, and even some of the disastrous military-adventurism we are seeing today (Grenada, 1983, the first-time the press was barred-from an invasion). Sadly, the militarist-culture of Reagan has continued. The seeds of present-day scandals and corruption were being planted during the 1980s.The poor were neglected (and still are), and the mentally-ill were deinstitutionalized, while military-spending blossomed, and there were financial-scandals-galore--then finally, Iran-Contra and a stock market crash. In the cities, a bull-market of speculation had exploded, and there was a materialist obsession with luxury-items, high-priced art, and ridiculous cuisine and fashion-trends that would make a Flapper blush-with-shame. 1980s-fashion is best summed-up as big-shoulders, no-compassion. Clothing was absolutely ugly, trashy and vulgar, which reflected the times, a Hobbesian-hell of winner-take-all. This, then, is the world of the character Patrick Bateman. People didn't want to know, hear, or talk-about social-problems in the 1980s, which has taken a 180-degree-turn nowadays, a crucial-difference. This--at-least--has changed. The laws of physics provided the soil.What Harron argues, finally, is that Patrick Bateman is unremarkable as a serial-killer within-the-context of the immorality he is surrounded-by. His exact-job is murky, and the firm he works-for is only referred to as Pierce & Pierce in the film. It also appears he is the benefactor of nepotism from his father, and appears to be creating nothing. What should be noted is that the director's husband produced corporate videos for Merrill-Lynch, Pierce & Pierce (which she states on both DVDs), so there is more-familiarity between Ellis's book than we would expect. Indeed, I am friendly-with people who work-at Merrill-Lynch..., who confirm that the corporate-culture depicted in the film is accurate--so accurate, when the film came-out, their colleagues opined that they could relate to Patrick Bateman. Make of that what-you-will. So, it isn't a stretch to see the similarities in how corporations devalue human-life with that of a serial-killer. There are similarities in-psychology here, such as viewing people as nothing-more than objects (which Bateman does on numerous-occasions, including watching porn) to be used as one wishes. Maybe this is the heart of horror in American Psycho, both the novel and the film.Ellis's novel came out of his being immersed in this New York-environment (Harron lived there at the time too), and he spent more time than he cared-for with people who shared the attitudes of the Bateman character. He saw murder as a short-step from the amorality and immorality of the Wall Street playboys, and Patrick Bateman can be viewed as a composite and abstraction of these types. By 1987, the stock-market crashed--it was the other Black Friday. Without New Deal controls and protections, we would likely have had another Great Depression (wait, the other-one is coming). 1987 was also the year that Iran-Contra was revealed, and the 1980s-dream which was a nightmare for many. The Reagan-80s were over. And yet, it all continues today in-spades the corruption, the murder, the lies, and the amorality of those who feed on us. It is significant that the film ends in 1987, and that Bateman has learned nothing. Horror-indeed.
