Just the premise is enough for a chuckle, but the resulting picture -- Analyze This -- is more than a high concept stretched to feature length. This is a funny and extremely satisfying comedy, the best in a while.The picture, which opens today, is not just funny in the moment. It's funny days later. Moments and lines are so perfect that they linger in the mind. In one scene, the analyst has a dream based on a scene from The Godfather He's Don Corleone, and the mobster is his son, helpless as a rival gang guns down the old man at a fruit stand. The analyst (Crystal) confides his dream to the mob boss.You mean, I was Fredo?! De Niro says. I don't think so. De Niro has figured out that his best strategy for playing comedy is to play it as he would a drama. He plays it straight and lets the situation determine whether it's funny. Audiences will be delighted and slightly shocked at the sight of De Niro, as Mafia boss Paul Vitti, weeping at a sentimental TV commercial. He's at the end of his rope. All the pain he's buried is clamoring to come into the light, and the result is a series of anxiety attacks.A nice aspect of Analyze This is that it never gives way to silliness. The setup is a good one, and director Harold Ramis keeps the movie true to it, in tone and style. As outlandish as things get, the characters' dilemmas stay real -- Who could a troubled wise guy turn to? What would an analyst do? -- and there's a dark edge. The threat of violence is ever-present, and with Chazz Palminteri as a rival boss lurking in the background, a happy ending never seems guaranteed.Easily, Analyze This is Crystal's best picture. Always at his best when bouncing off of a talented co-star, Crystal has too often found himself in romantic comedies in which he's made a wormy, unconvincing love interest.Here he gets to do great shtick -- in one scene, posing as a consigliere, he double-talks at a meeting of the Mafia commission. But he also holds up the screen opposite De Niro, as Ben, a bored therapist who blossoms into his emotional and professional adulthood over the course of a dangerous and stressful ordeal.It's dangerous because other mobsters are worried that the boss of all bosses is telling the therapist too many secrets. It's dangerous because the feds want to squeeze him for information. It's also dangerous because his patient has a bad temper and a violent streak -- and might, at any moment, turn on him.All the De Niro-Crystal scenes, and there are plenty, are a pleasure to watch. In the first, the crook shows up at the analyst's office, insisting that he's there on behalf of a friend. When the doctor tells him that he thinks the mobster is really describing his own problems, De Niro's take is priceless. He pauses, smiles in awe and says, You're good. You got a gift, my friend. From there, the doctor can't get rid of this patient, who shows up everywhere. The one-liners and banter are unexpected The mobster mentions that he has a mistress because there are things he won't do with his wife. When the doctor asks what things, he answers, Hey, that's the mouth she kisses the kids good night with. De Niro has played so many gangsters that his role here could have seemed like parody. Yet in his own way, Paul Vitti is as real as the Irish gangster De Niro played in GoodFellas.

The plot is simple, yet the execution is immaculate, with great directing, wonderful pacing and great action scenes. The film combines elements of a drama and action film very well and there's enough going for this film to make it stand out as a definitive classic of cinema. Akira Kurosawa is a master of cinema, one of the greats and he has proved that with this outstanding work. This film is not for everyone as it is nearly four hours long and it focuses more on telling a compelling story than focusing on action. With that said, Seven Samurai is a beautiful picture that some great performances and is among the best foreign films ever made. What is surprising about this film is that director Kurosawa is able to pull off such a grand film using such a simple idea. The result is outstanding. Filmed in beautiful black and white, Seven Samurai is an epic picture that would influence films for many years to come. With this picture, Akira Kurosawa created new ideas that would be seen in many future releases. The reason that this film is so good is because the film relies more on performances and storytelling to entertain the viewer and it does that in spades. If you're not into epics or hate slow-paced movies, then this is not a film for you. However if you want to watch one of the defining works in cinema history, regardless, Seven Samurai is definitely essential viewing. This for me is one of the first grand epics of the 1950's and other would soon follow such as The Ten Commandments and Ben-hur.

He seeks revenge by using an ancient scroll to send a mummy after them. Christian Slater plays Moore's brother and is an inconsistently written character. Buscemi is enjoyable though and it's nice to see an old-school mummy.The second story is Cat from Hell about an elderly millionaire (Wiliam Hickey) who hires a hit-man (Buster Poindexter) to kill a cat. This is the weakest story of the bunch. Hickey and Poindexter are fine but it's kind of obnoxiously dark and I didn't really care what happened to anybody, including the cat. The third story is Lover's Vow, about an artist (James Remar) whose life is spared by a gargoyle as long as he never reveals he saw the monster. He falls in love with a woman (Rae Dawn Chong) and after many years together the temptation to share his secret becomes too great. This story pretty much rips off the Woman of the Snow story from the superior horror anthology film Kwaidan (1964) but is still well done and probably the best story in the movie.The bookend linking story is a take-off on Hansel & Gretel, with a witch (Debbie Harry) preparing to cook a little boy (Matthew Lawrence). To stall for time, the boy tells her stories from his favorite book, which leads into the three other tales. This is an amusing and enjoyable part of the film, though nothing exceptional. Overall, it's a surprisingly enjoyable film, helped in large part by a good cast. The stories aren't particularly strong, but somehow it manages to keep you entertained.

Mr.Brooks went on to write and direct Broadcast News in 1987 and As Good As It Gets in 1997, which were two very good films.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"14 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Spoiler Terms of Endearment (1983) is a beautifully made film about a mother and daughter relationship from birth to death. The mother and widowed, Aurora (Shirley MacLaine), and daughter, Emma (Debra Winger) has an up and down relationship throughout a thirty year span the movie represents. Aurora is the overprotective, neurotic mother who doesn't always like the choices her daughter Emma makes. To escape the her mother's over protectiveness Emma gets married to Flap Horton the college teacher played by Jeff Daniels, Aurora boycotts the wedding because she says, if you marry Flap Horton tomorrow it will be a mistake of such gigantic proportions it will ruin your life&#x85;.you are not special enough to overcome a bad marriage (Brooks, 1983). Emma and Flap had three children together, but their marriage is not really a love marriage. Flap ends up having an affair with a student, and Emma has an affair with a banker (whose marriage is unhappy), played by John Lithgow. Emma stays with Flap when he receives a different job in a new state. Meanwhile, Aurora has gentlemen pursuing her one named Vernon, played by Danny Devito who thinks Aurora walks on water, but Aurora does not reciprocate his advances. However, Aurora has a neighbor, former astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who she feelings for. She goes out with Garrett and has fun and starts a relationship with. Jack Nicholson's character Garrett brings fun and laughter to the serious uptight Aurora, which Shirley MacLaine plays so well. Garrett calls off seeing Aurora because he started to have feelings for her; he has always been a self proclaimed bachelor and ladies man. Toward the end of the film Emma loses her fight with cancer, is the blow that sent me (and possibly millions of other viewers) into tears. Watch Aurora's face; watch Emma's, and you'll know exactly what they're saying without them even saying a word. Simply devastating!

Chock full of those freshly scrubbed, wholesome family values that Hollywood used to love to propagate (if not necessarily emulate), the picture is a warm, endearing fantasy with just enough realism to keep it out of the treacle jar. Opening in the summer of 1904, it starts innocently enough with Esther Smith (Judy Garland) mooning over boy next door John Truitt (Tom Drake), older sister Rose (Lucille Bremer) pining for Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully) with everyone happily laughing and singing about the impending world's fair coming to St. Louis next spring. So far, so predictably good. But then the plot gets seriously leavened as we are introduced to Tootie Smith (Margaret O'Brien), the youngest sister of the clan whose girlish pranks and blood-curdling prose mix a little comedy with some genuinely mean-spirited Halloween behavior that take us to the darker side of human nature, adding some much needed sinister malevolence when it is most needed. But there's more as the plot thickens still further when patriarch Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames) imperiously (albeit with the best of intentions) informs everyone, the day following Halloween, that the family is leaving St. Louis for New York. Initially laughed off, this unexpected announcement turns out to be one post-Halloween trick that is no treat as nobody, wife Anna (Mary Astor) included, is much amused. I don't believe it! It's true I'm to start the first of the year. We'll leave right after Christmas. With noteworthy attention to period detail, the film is brilliantly directed by Vincent Minnelli, trumpets some excellent acting from its ensemble cast, and includes an engaging Ralph Blane\/Hugh Martin score that, for the first time in motion picture history integrates the songs directly into the plot, something pioneered for the stage a year earlier by Rodgers and Hammerstein when Oklahoma premiered on Broadway. Better yet, Meet Me In St. Louis also deftly combines Christmas candy and homespun virtue with the contemporary reality of the danger of making the business agenda, the bottom line, the sole arbitrator of what really counts, even if that wasn't the film's original purpose. Indeed, with the Smith's standing in for all of us, the movie is not just an enjoyable, warm\/fuzzies romp through a bygone era. It is also a timely reminder that even the best of well intentioned actions can elicit unforeseen responses, that people, not impersonal automatons, are the final repository of all human actions, noble, imperious or mean-spirited.

Initially, Lethal Weapon looked like just another cop buddy partner epic, but the charismatic coupling of the haywire Riggs and the down-to-earth Murtaugh gave the movie a flavor that tasted good. Riggs is the cop that nobody wants to work with; he is the cop who has gone beyond the pale. In a way, he is a shorter version of Dirty Harry with many of Harry's problems, including the death of his wife. The villains are hard as nails and the action is ultra-cool thanks to Donner's first-class helming. The opening scene with the girl who dives off the apartment building balcony is cool. Meantime, Riggs is just off the rails enough to turn any shoot-out into a massacre. Lethal Weapon and its kick-ass sequels is mandatory watching for anybody that loves cop movies.

The sort of thing Kipling did so well a decade later in Captains Courageous - turned into another first-rate movie, if a less faithful one, with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew. This is something of the same thing, except that, rather than riding the high seas, the duo wander through the dangers of the Scottish Highlands.It would have benefited from a better score, but still, I strongly recommend it. It is infinitely better than the sad travesty produced for no discernible reason by Masterpiece Theater.

I was REALLY amazed that they were able to squeeze out this kind of picture quality from a film like this, especially when other, higher cost films from the same era do not look any where near this good.Now, about the film. I don't know... Just being honest, I truly do not see quite what makes this film such a TOTAL classic like people say. There is one reviewer here who states that this is one of the TOP 5 Comedy films of all time. Really...? I mean, don't get me wrong, there are a number of set pieces that are indeed pretty funny. The scene where Bill Murray and Chevy Chase are together is pretty good; and for the most part, I thought Chevy's delivery was the funniest with his low-key chic, goofy style. BUT... and it is a frigg'n HUGE BUT like Mariah Carey's... for the most part, I really thought that the humour and performances were just silly and I truly felt that if the writing had been a LOT better, THEN, MAYBE this could have been closer to a classic. But, for example, I LOVE Rodney Dangerfield, and he was his usual lovable self in his performance and bearing. BUT... again... I felt quite honestly that his lines were simply ATROCIOUS! That same reviewer who I mentioned before also said that Rodney's lines, for example like right after he farted and said, 'Who stepped on a duck', were just rolling in the aisles hilarious. Uh, okay... I mean, come on... his lines like when all the old people are dancing at the club, 'Hey, the cemetery is just around the corner' and 'I've never seen dead people smoking'... Uh... does that sound like the height of hilarity to you...?I truly do NOT mean to diss this EXTREMELY well loved film, I don't; and, all in all I enjoyed it I think mainly because it was sort of tied together with some funny parts. But like ALL of Ted Knight's lines and delivery were completely forced, plastic and stupid sounding (rest his soul...) and other things similar to this in my unworthy opinion really took away from the funniness of the film. BUT... there were some good bits and funny situations; and the gopher addition was pretty funny in a simple kind of way.In trying to understand this, I think of films that I MYSELF find far, FAR funnier, I mean, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE funnier, and I just don't understand it. Okay, pretty much here we are talking about simple, low-brow, but not overly crude humour. To me, ALL of the 'NAKED GUN' films and Geez, MOST of Mel brooks' and the MARX Brothers' films are frigg'n LIGHT YEARS funnier than this. These films that I mention here are REALLY silly too, but in my lowly estimation the silliness is usually quite clever or the situations and characters come across a LOT funnier. Here with this film, I never really felt that ANYTHING was particularly 'clever' at all... And, to me, none of the characters, with the exception of Chevy Chase, and to SOME extent, Bill Murray, were all that likable or engaging (I DID think though that Bill Murray's ad-libbed scene about getting all horny and worked up over the old lady golfers was hilarious!) Again, an excellent example of one of the many ISOLATED bits that were indeed very funny in this film.I don't know; maybe I'm just over-thinking it and I should just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. But, to me anyway, I THINK it was just basically the writing and dialog that drastically diminished the quality of the comedy overall. Like I mentioned, IF for example, Rodney's lines had been the USUAL GREAT Rodney lines, then fine. I mean, he was bloody AWESOME in 'BACK TO SCHOOL'. But the writing and intelligence behind that film to me were of HUGELY better quality.Anyway, I just thought I would drop my honest thoughts here amongst the raving reviews. I KNOW that Comedy, like Horror, and many other art forms is HIGHLY subjective and apparently MANY people DO find this film one of the funniest ever. So, I would say that if you like your Comedy rather simple, but fun and silly, then you probably will like it.

The majority of said development takes place during Steve's wedding and a hunting expedition. A major part of the development of their characters is used to point out their character flaws. Steve's flaw is the most obvious and can be seen during the wedding sequence. Steve marries a pregnant woman and admits to his friends that the child is not his. While it may not appear like much, in the context of The Deer Hunter, Steve's naiveté will prove to be a weakness during war. Nick's also exhibits his character flaw during the wedding when he proposes to his girlfriend. By showing the audience Nick's compassion, it is implied that he will have other things on his mind which could get him killed. Mike appears to be the only character without a major flaw. He is independent, which can be seen in his interactions with his friends during the deer hunt. He appears to hold enough responsibility which foreshadows his success in Vietnam. Due to their traits one can assume that Steve and Nick will suffer from some sort of physical or emotional pain during the movie. Unfortunately, this foreshadowing proves to be true. Steve suffers from a crippling injury which leaves him restricted to a wheelchair. Nick suffers from a psychological injury which is a result of playing Russian roulette in a POW camp. It is clear that it troubles Mike to see his best friends suffer and the director does a good job of making the audience feel the same way.

That night it begins to rain hard and she decides to stay the night at a motel along an old highway&#x97;the Bates Motel. From that point on things begin to happen in a most dramatic fashion. Now, rather than reveal the details I will just say that this is one of the best horror movies ever filmed. It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as Norman Bates). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her performance. In short, while this movie is definitely a bit old it is still worth watching for all fans of horror or suspense.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"14 December 2013","score":"","review":" Since the beginning of civilizations or even before, people were putting monetary value on everything they could. After a while, people began to realize a concept that everything was for sale for a certain amount depending on the individual. In a nut shell, what is your price for something you cherish deeply? In the early nineties, the blockbuster film Indecent Proposal challenged the aged-old question. David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana Murphy (Demi Moore) was a happy and regular middle class couple. The only problem they had was a relatively big one. The recession had left them both financially strapped. They were facing foreclosure on their current home and the home of their dreams they were building (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In an effort to pay off their debts, they decide to go to Las Vegas to get quick money (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In the casino, they meet John Gage (Robert Redford) a billionaire, playboy. After a short game of pool, he makes an offer of 1 million dollars to spend a night with Diana (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). The money was more than enough to pay off their debts and live well, but they would have to sell a piece of their soul for it. Thus a deal with the devil. In the film, there are various themes throughout. For one, the love and happiness of David & Diana Murphy is universal, and it can be understood by pretty much everyone (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In addition, the heartbreak of the Murphy couple is universal as well. Likewise, the theme of human dignity is a major element in this film, because the characters are challenged figuratively to stand erect and morally, too (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). As the characters Diana, David and John try to move forward after the one-night deal, it is clear that conflict between two forces are going be an obstacle, and only one of the guys is going to walk away as the winner. Eventually the situation comes to a confrontation at a charity event (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). Desperate to win back Diana, David out bids John Gage's 50 thousand dollar offer on a Rhino by bidding a cool 1 million (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In this scene, the character David Murphy was challenged to stand up and be a man, and he definitely did. In front of Diana and John, David gives the money back from the one-night deal to charity in an effort to win back her heart, because the money never meant anything like she did to him (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). The cinematographer captured David looking proud and bold by shooting an upward looking angle at him. The result was David finally looked like he stood up to his fierce competitor John Gage. Throughout the film, the dilemma of money and love was a repeating pattern, and it was really a motif to the film (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). Likewise, the movie Money Can't Buy Me Love and Indecent Proposal have really similar themes. In both, the characters are blinded by money, and at the same time, they are in search of love. Ironically, the love is in front of their faces the whole time. After viewing the film, it is still clear that everything has a price, but that price is more than a monetary number. For instance, the character David Murphy realized that having 1 million dollars without Diana was not worth it. Thus, he was happier before the decision. However, one would never know for sure. In all, love and money are universal concepts that people have been try to balance. Likewise, if you do not have love in your life, money is worth nearly as much.
