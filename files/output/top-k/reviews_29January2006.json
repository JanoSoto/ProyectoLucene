In this film, Grant's character falls in love with an Italian woman, whose parents are in the Mafia. Little does Hugh's character know that her parents will want him to be a part of the Mafia family, if he does choose to marry her. Unfortunately, this film has little substance to it other than to show Mr. Hugh Grant in yet another romantic comedy role. This one is very bland, like fish 'n' chips, so do not expect to include it anywhere near the top of the list of the best romantic comedy films ever made. Hugh Grant is kind of cute, but there is nothing to this film.

I must admit that this is an interesting movie psychologically, but I don't think any five penny analysts could do anything to these sick people. Everybody is sick in this movie. It has the overall feeling of some really cheap low-life bar The feeling of disappointment and failure in life. I would say it's the overall feeling of death; This movie feels like you would have just heard, that you have an incurable cancer. It's an interesting fact that Charles Bronson is, or at least has been, some kind of popular action hero He looks like a disappointed- and tired-to-everything alcoholic. An interesting world-view and feeling. There is NO humor, joy or hope in this film; Not even before the bad guys come and ruin it all. The bad guys names tell all Nirvana, Stomper, Cutter, Punkcut, Jiver. They are the bad guys, and nothing else. They even smoke the herb and become psychotic and aggressive killer-madmen after that! I didn't know that that stuff makes that, but it's always good to learn. The bad guys first dance, chill out and have fun, and all of the sudden start to rape and kill people. (After that they forget about it.) It seems that the main character (Bronson) is a real psychopath, at least he fits perfectly of the description of one. I have to correct what I said before Not everybody is totally sick in this movie; Just the ones that are involved in THE WAR. There is some (very few) good-looking pictures in this film; for example when the antihero walks in the streets at night. It's funny how he judges people that are unknown to him For example when he sees somebody drinking alcohol, he looks at him with an expression of total repulsion on his face. Some police story also goes in the background, but it doesn't have much to do with the movie.But after all, this film manages to represent some peoples (the filmmakers) very strong feelings, and evidently also the feelings of many viewers, and isn't that one of the main purposes of any piece of art or self-expression? Can you judge people for how they feel? If you want to see a really good movie of this genre (revenge-moral-story), I strongly recommend Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004)(with Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning). Peace.
