Likewise, it is not as good as the The Truman Show but it does it's job well.We see Ed living a normal life the way he normally does, but we also see how television twists that life, and removes total privacy from Ed and his family's life. Early on in the film, Ray (played well by Woody Harrelson) cheats on his girlfriend. Ordinarily, no one other than Ed would've known, but as a consequence of television, this act of unfaithfulness is broadcast direct to her within seconds.Ed tv works well at showing that television does remove privacy, but it does fall into it's own trap of setting events up to make it more interesting (a la Liz Hurley's character, Jill). All in all, it works well, and the ending is a treat.
