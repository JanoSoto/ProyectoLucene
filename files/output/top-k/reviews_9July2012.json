The last one had some Tim Burton style going for it but this time it's really really distinct. Danny Elfman did a fine job of composing the Batman theme song and can easily get stuck with that tune in the audiences head. So when I think of Batman this theme song comes to mind since it just stands out. The previous movie shows the villain's origin and this one is no exception, except there are two this time. And it shows how certain character got to where they are. This movie might not tie in with the comics but Tim Burton's vision isn't too bad for this movie. Style and vibe of it is similar to the first one but it has a bit of dark Gothic feel to it. However some areas are just not developed enough to the point it can get sort of difficult to just go with it sometimes. When it comes to the penguins goons and some other stuff, it just seems a bit too far-fetched even for a Batman movie. It might work if it's a cartoon or goes in a really silly direction like the live action TV show. But that just isn't the case here. Also the characters actions and reactions are just not all that believable. Selina Kyle might not seem like a sophisticated cat burglar in this. And her origin might sorta suck in this. But she gives off this crazy and yet tenacious vibe. Michelle Pfieffer was a good choice for Catwoman, she isn't sophisticated like I said but she fits the role of a cat burglar for the most part and her voice is cute but acts crazy and rebellious when it comes to her action. She plays the role of a attractive and yet dangerous Catwoman really well. Well after she turns into Catwoman that is. Now the acting in this flick isn't necessarily good but the villains in this really get into there roles. Especially when it comes to Danny DeVito who played the Penguin in this, he was almost perfect for this role. Well at least for a Tim Burton version, despite him looking like a giant egg man sometimes. He may not be as intimidating as the Joker but he can be more comedical, intentional or not. Kinda felt bad for his character, but only slightly. Both villains are suppose to be a bit more sophisticated but these versions are passable although a bit too insane. Sometimes it feels like too much time is on the villains though than Batman. Which is probably one of the reason this sequel didn't do as well at box office. Cause youngsters go to superhero movies to watch the superhero. Commissioner Gordon is yet again wasted in this. When he plays crucial roles a lot in the comics. Lastly Christopher Walkens is always good and he plays a very very corrupt businessman There is few moments that make this movie stand out though, like the part where the Penguin and Catwoman taunts each other. This isn't necessarily a good vs. evil movie like the first one but has other elements crafted in, which might not be entirely a good thing but it works. This flick has it's flaws and not good as the first one although this has more character development. But it's still worth a watch, especially if you like Batman.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This sequel is more dark gritty and has more character development than the first one.

In fact I wouldn't be shocked if both these directors are not even fans of comic books or don't read comic books. But they both know how to direct and at least try, and for the most part they tried and succeeded. It's not cheesy as the past Batman TV shows or the really old movies with the pow and the blam when something gets hit. However it still pretty darn cheesy, especially the acting which is comical and yet gives off this Dick Tracy vibe. But some audiences might dig this comical noir style. Tim Burton is known for his dark Gothic style with some over the top elements and that style is brought to this film. This movie is sure outdated now but I can see why some audiences might have really got a kick out of this movie in the past. It has almost all the right elements for a lasting childhood memory even if the style of it is dark. Michael Keaton is good as Batman, but didn't really buy him as Bruce Wayne. Although some might disagree. But Jack Nicholson did a amazing job as the Joker. I mean Heath Ledger version is still my favorite and I consider him the best villain in a movie so far. But I can really understand why audiences put these two Jokers together. Cause Jack Nicholson's Joker also leaves a mark, different from Heath's version. But he is still ominous and you just don't know when he will snap or strike. Or at least how he will execute his actions. His performance was spot on and his delivery was excellent. This one also gives the origin of the Joker, may not stick close to the comics but it's passable I guess. Doesn't come off as anything special though. Also some parts has plot-holes or just plain doesn't make any sense. Also Commissioner Gordon is in this but you hardly notice him, in fact if they took him out of this movie it wouldn't have made a difference. So basically his character was a complete waste. Also Batman is known as the world's greatest detective but there is hardly any detective work in this from him. Or at least it's not much hands on.
