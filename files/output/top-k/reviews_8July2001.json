It's pretty long ago when I laughed that much in a theatre like I did on friday during Shrek. Great dialogues, great animation, great voices, great black humor. I just can say Watch this Movie, it's a MUST. I really can't wait for the Return of the lovely green Ogre names Shrek. I voted 9 of 10 !

Well, we liked Battlefield Earth better. John Travolta's villain was far superior to the ones in this movie. There was a plot in BF Earth... Tomb Raider, well... we are still trying to figure if the writers had planned a plot.Tomb Raider, by far, was one of the worst movies we have ever seen. The action scenes lacked coherent action, the story line lacked a story, and the high point of the movie was when my wife and I figured out that the butler was Rimmer from Red Dwarf.More then likely, scenes vital to the plotline were left on the cutting room floor in order to make room for the two shower scenes, which were completely pointless.  The ending was quite anticlimatic, my cat's litterbox is more interesting then all of the character's combined, and we left the theater wondering if the writers were actually third graders coming up with a movie screen play for their favorite video game.By the way, we thought that Battlefield Earth was a bad movie as well. It's just that we'd rather see BFEarth twenty times in a row before we saw Tomb Raider again. If there is a hell, it is a theater with chains on the chair and Tomb Raider being the only movie shown.
