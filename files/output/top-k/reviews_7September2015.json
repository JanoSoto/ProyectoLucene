[{"date":"7 September 2015","score":"","review":" Wrongfully Accused is what you expect out of a parody. The best way to describe it is average. You get a few good laughs but that's it. It references a lot of other famous films however these references are stretched, making the flow of the film choppy. The humour is also stretched, low and at times, a bit strained. It seems as if the writer was trying to make the script as funny as possible, but tried too hard. The result is a film that relies too much on sexual double entendres and visual gags. You'll get a few laughs out of it but don't expect much else. Go in with the right attitude and you will enjoy it.
