[{"date":"22 January 1999","score":"","review":"  Rushmore is hands-down the funniest movie of 1998.  It is an amazingly original and smart piece of filmmaking, and there is not doub in my mind that it will be with us for years to come.  Director Wes Anderson has more than fulfilled the potential that he displayed in his debut film Bottle Rocket. Everything about Rushmore is totally first rate.  The script (co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, who played Dignan in Bottle Rocket) is as sharp as they come and defies any sort of genre classification.  The performances are top-notch.  Jason Shwartzman gives the most memorable debut performances I've seen in a long long time and Billy Murry totally shines in a role that he was born to play. Rushmore stretches beyond being a simple high school movie and moves way past those sappy coming of age dramas where the only emotions seem to be laughter and tears.  People are going to be watching this one for some time to come.  If there is any justice in this world Bill Murray will be given an Oscar nod for this film. I can't wait to seen what Wes Anderson (who is well on his way to becoming one of the best filmmakers of his generation) does next.
