Unfortunately if you are one of the few who haven't seen it yet, don't expect a lot.  Like most of the other critics I was excited to see this film come out and like few of the other critics I was very disappointed.  `Lord of the Rings' is a film about a hobbit named Froto who inherits a ring from an older hobbit.  Little does Froto know, this is no ordinary ring. This ring is an extremely evil ring created by an evil emperor that is trying to take over the world.  The emperor was killed but his spirit lives on in the ring and takes over who ever holds it.  Froto and his posse, featuring the best of every creature in the land, go on a journey to destroy the ring in the volcano in which it was created.  They are stalked by an evil wizard and his army of evil creatures that have come back to life.\tThe problem with this film is that it never sets any limits.  A wizard can make lightning strike a mountain the group is walking on, but he can't strike the group?  A bird can save a wizard when he is trapped on a tower, but he can't be saved when he falls into a pit of fire.  This same wizard can block the whip of a huge fire monster at one point, but a second later it wraps around his leg and pulls him into a pit of fire.  As this movie goes along it gets downright ridiculous.  The only reason I didn't give this film a zero is because of the fighting scenes and the wonderful sets.  The scenery in this film is great and the makeup and costumes are outstanding.  The fight scenes are the only things that kept this film moving along and in the middle when there are none, you find yourself having a conversation with the person next to you.  The fairy scenes are pointless and are not worth watching. The plot in this film is the controlling factor of everything.  When a character is saved it is only because they are needed later in the film.  A different character dies only to create an intense scene in this boring, predictable quest of a hobbit and a ring.  Another reason this film is a flop is because when you make a book into a movie, you can't use ever piece of dialogue or every scene in the 500-page book.  You have to cut it down into only the important things and this film neglected to do this.  This film could have easily been cut to an hour and a half instead of almost 3 hours long.  If you haven't seen this film yet and still want to, let me give you a little bit of advice.  Watch the first half-hour take a nap for 2 hours and wake up just in time to see the final fight scene, trust me you won't miss anything important.

The basic plot for Another 48 Hours is that Detective Jack Cates(Nolte)has for years been attempting to track down a underground criminal only known as the iceman. Then when Cates finds out the iceman wants his old buddy Reggie Hammond(Murphy)     dead, he enlists his help to bring the iceman down (because apparently Hammond is the only person ever to have seen the Iceman). A few notes, at the end of the original film, Hammond only had 6 months left to go on his sentence. However since then his sentence has been changed to 6 years because he apparently robbed the prision payrole(hey i'm not making this stuff up). Ganz's(the main bad guy, from the original 48 hours) brother is one of the bad guys who has been hired by the iceman to kill Hammond and Cates. The sequel is more comic-like than the original,and truth be known some parts of it's storyline are flawed (we never really know the real story behind Hamond being detained for another 6 years)and the Jack Cates character is more lukewarm then the original.

I seriously don't think the executives at New Line knew what they were doing when they approved the script.  They get rid on Heather Langenkamp after one film! One film!  I think the only battle worth watching during the entire series is Nancy Thompson vs Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), but New Line didn't think so.  They introduce a new heroine, this time, in the shape of a male. Jesse Walsh, played by Mark Patton, moves into Nancy's house and starts having the typical Elm Street nightmares.  This time, however, Freddy wants to use the hero's body to murder instead of attacking the kids during their dreams.The story is lame, and the characters are just pathetic.  I don't care about Jesse, his girlfriend Lisa, played by Kim Myers, or any of their friends.  I wish they all died.  Aside from a weak story and poor character development, there is no Wes Craven behind the camera. That was the first sign that there was something wrong.I'd also like to point out a certain scene in the film.  I think it is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.  Jesse leaves home at night, walks the streets, goes to a bar, orders a drink, is approached by his Physical Education teacher, who is draped in leather, is taken to the high school gym by the teacher and forced to run laps around the basketball court, and then forced to shower by the teacher.  That's not all.  The teacher is then attacked by sporting goods, which leads to him being dragged into the shower by a couple of jump ropes.  From there, he is tied to the shower wall and stripped naked.  Towels proceed to smack him on his bare @$$, and he is finally slashed to death by Freddy.  Jesse then walks the streets again, this time naked.  He is eventually brought home by a couple of police officers.  Like I said, it is one of the most stupid things I have ever seen.One of the only bright spots is that the film features a young Christie Clark, who was on the daytime soap Days of Our Lives and in one of the stupid Children of the Corn films.  She was also rumored at one point to be in the third Scream film, but of course, that never happened.  She would have played either actress Sarah Darling or Cotton Weary's girlfriend Christine.  Christie didn't do anything in the film, though, so that proves how bad Nightmare 2 was if she was a bright spot.No Heather Langenkamp.  No Wes Craven.  A completely stupid story.  Awful characters.  Some sick homosexual side-storyline that most gays and lesbians would probably find offensive.

That's not all.  The teacher is then attacked by sporting goods, which leads to him being dragged into the shower by a couple of jump ropes.  From there, he is tied to the shower wall and stripped naked.  Towels proceed to smack him on his bare @$$, and he is finally slashed to death by Freddy.  Jesse then walks the streets again, this time naked.  He is eventually brought home by a couple of police officers.  Like I said, it is one of the most stupid things I have ever seen.One of the only bright spots is that the film features a young Christie Clark, who was on the daytime soap Days of Our Lives and in one of the stupid Children of the Corn films.  She was also rumored at one point to be in the third Scream film, but of course, that never happened.  She would have played either actress Sarah Darling or Cotton Weary's girlfriend Christine.  Christie didn't do anything in the film, though, so that proves how bad Nightmare 2 was if she was a bright spot.No Heather Langenkamp.  No Wes Craven.  A completely stupid story.  Awful characters.  Some sick homosexual side-storyline that most gays and lesbians would probably find offensive.

I seriously don't think the executives at New Line knew what they were doing when they approved the script.  They get rid on Heather Langenkamp after one film! One film!  I think the only battle worth watching during the entire series is Nancy Thompson vs Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), but New Line didn't think so.  They introduce a new heroine, this time, in the shape of a male. Jesse Walsh, played by Mark Patton, moves into Nancy's house and starts having the typical Elm Street nightmares.  This time, however, Freddy wants to use the hero's body to murder instead of attacking the kids during their dreams.The story is lame, and the characters are just pathetic.  I don't care about Jesse, his girlfriend Lisa, played by Kim Myers, or any of their friends.  I wish they all died.  Aside from a weak story and poor character development, there is no Wes Craven behind the camera.

While the film's elements of Stanley Kubrick (2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange), who work on the film for fifteen years, and Steven Spielberg clashed, so did the critics and the Joe Moviegoer. Yet the best of films, are those that cause such polarities. A.I while not a perfect film, is a flawed masterpiece that restored my faith in an increasingly mindless industry of sex, explosions and mediocrity.In the distant future, global warming has caused the polar icecaps to melt, killing millions, and destroying natural resources. Because of this, the more civilized nations enacted pregnancy restrictions, which created a need and a market for artificial intelligence. One scientist sets out to create a child mecha with real human emotion and feelings or couples who are unable to obtain a pregnancy license. Twenty months later, David (Haley Joel Osment) is created and given to a trial family (Henry and Monica Swinton), whose son is cryogenically frozen due to an incurable disease. The child comes with an imprinting code that hardwires him to love the person or couple that imprints. It is irreversible and if the couple decides they do not want to keep the mecha, they must return it to the manufacture for destruction. David is not received automatically into the family, but gradually steals Monica's needy heart. She imprints herself upon him, and the two of them form a disturbing attachment, much in the spirit of Oedipus Rex. However, the Swinton's son is miraculously cured, and returns home catalyzing a sibling rivalry for the love of Mommy. Consequently, an unfortunate situation occurs, leaving Monica to leave David in the middle of a forest. It is here that David sets out on a quest to find the Blue Fairy (from Pinocchio), who will make him into a real boy.With this surface storyline, Kubrick and Spielberg undertake the primary objective of the film. That is, to comment on human nature in all of its complexities and frailties. The irony of the picture, is that the character most human, is David, actually inhuman. Let's say that David is, at first, a clean slate to be  graced and marred by his human counterpoints. With brilliant cinematic imagery, we repeatedly see David as a reflection from mirrors, chimes, coffee lids and the like. Continuing this imagery, the usage of the moon, also suggests the reflective nature of the boy mecha. As David imitates the emotions he sees, he becomes more and more humanlike, and is able to show all extremes of human nature. The broad spectrum of human nature is encapsulated in a creation of hardwires and chips. From David's obsessive desire to be loved, to his jealous fit of murderous self-preservation (destroying another David), he is the essence of human nature a series of actions that reduce to love and hate. But these actions originated at the beginning of mankind. The first demonstration of love is God's creation of man, and the first demonstration of hate is Cain's murder of Abel. In the film, Dr. Hobby's creation of David is an act of love; bringing to life a being to share mutual happiness. In response to this, when David destroys his predecessor, he falls from grace and commits his first act of hate; murder (interestingly, David committed murder the same way as Cain did).In the same way as David and Cain, our current human state is that of mixed emotions we have both passionate love and hate. And as David was eternally searching for meaning so, too, are we. Where will we find it?Overall, the film addresses these questions with accuracy, while never pretending to have the answers.

From David's obsessive desire to be loved, to his jealous fit of murderous self-preservation (destroying another David), he is the essence of human nature a series of actions that reduce to love and hate. But these actions originated at the beginning of mankind. The first demonstration of love is God's creation of man, and the first demonstration of hate is Cain's murder of Abel. In the film, Dr. Hobby's creation of David is an act of love; bringing to life a being to share mutual happiness. In response to this, when David destroys his predecessor, he falls from grace and commits his first act of hate; murder (interestingly, David committed murder the same way as Cain did).In the same way as David and Cain, our current human state is that of mixed emotions we have both passionate love and hate. And as David was eternally searching for meaning so, too, are we. Where will we find it?Overall, the film addresses these questions with accuracy, while never pretending to have the answers. It has definitely proven to be the most thought-provoking film of the summer 2001, and its theme is probably one of the most proactive of mankind.Rating 4\/5 Stars ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 January 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  `See Spot Run'   (2001)½* out of ****Reviewed by Matt Doolittle`See Spot Run' is a lame family film that might be cute if we haven't have seen it fifty million times before.  It is about a police dog that bites a major mob guy, who vows that he will not rest until the dog is dead.  The police send the dog to a protective service kennel in Alaska but unfortuntatly the dog is sent to a complete moron named Gordon.

It was about this point where you can guess the rest of the story because it is so predictable; at least I did.This movie assumes that everything from stepping in dog poop to getting electrocuted by an electric dog collar is funny and of course they underestimate the audience by a lot.  This movie is so terribly unfunny that it is painful to watch and more painful to listen to anyone laugh at. Yes, unfortunately a few people in the audience laughed and I still have no idea why.  The jokes were lame, the kid actor was annoying and David Arquette is his own usual character, the moron.The makers of this film assume too much of the audience and that is their first mistake of millions of others.  The direction is nowhere and the effects and props are so horrible that this film must have cost five dollars to make.  I will give the film credit though; they selected the perfect cast of a bunch of no name actors who play good morons.  I recommend this film to anyone under 5 or over 80, but any one else who can't sleep in cinema chairs won't like it.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"5 January 2002","score":"","review":"  The movie is never as good as the book, as everyone knows.  While there may be a few exceptions (I might include Silence of the Lambs), Jackson's Fellowship of the Rings is not one of them.  Don't get me wrong--it's a good movie, very entertaining, and it is strikingly loyal to the book.  Jackson certainly didn't ruin the Lord of the Rings, but I still felt disappointed after viewing the film.  I don't really have a problem with subplots that Jackson dropped or even the content that he added.  But I do love Tolkien's trilogy, and over the years and the re-readings, I've found a great deal of pleasure in the details of the books, so it's little surprise that my disappointment in the movie can be traced to many equally small matters in the film.  At the risk of seeming hopelessly picky, let me list a few of the devilish details that take a little of the edge off my appreciation of the movie1. The casting is excellent except for Elrond.  Sadly, I couldn't get the Matrix villain out of my head when watching Elrond speak, and that wasn't a good thing.  2. While I'm on casting, let me mention the two elvish women, Galadriel and Arwen.  Unfortunately, these two women are supposed to be ideals of beauty, far beyond the limits of human beings, which, of course, creates casting difficulties.  I can appreciate this.  Even so, I feel like there might have been better choices than Liv Tyler for Arwen and Cate Blanchet for Galadriel.  I like Cate Blanchet quite a lot, but her face is too hard and cold to play Galadriel whose beauty tends to be described (in the book) in terms of daylight and sun.  And I don't understand why both Tyler and Blanchet are forced to deliver most of their lines in lispy, far-away, dreamy, annoying whispers.3. As with Galadriel herself, Lorien is much too dark, gray, cold, and Gothic.  It looks like stone rather than wood.  In the book, even though we see Lorien in winter, gold is the color that stands out in my mind's eye.  The Lorien sequences were too short in the movie, too.4. If I could cut one scene from the movie, it would be the wretched fight scene between Gandalf and Saruman.  It's just plain silly to see these two venerable, powerful old men squeaking across the marble floors.  And the absurdity comes to a climax when Saruman forces Gandalf to break-dance circles on the floor.  It's laughable when it should be supremely unfunny.  Certainly the scene could have been staged with more grace and gravity.5. I understand that extensive character development is difficult in a movie, especially when even the book doesn't always offer much character refinement (Merry and Pippin, for instance, seem largely interchangeable until well into The Two Towers).  Still, some points would have been easy to add, such as Gimli's changed attitude about Galadriel, a transformation which is set up by Gimli's grumbling comments about her before they meet.  This could also provide the gateway for portraying the beginnings of Gimli's friendship with Legolas, one of the more touching and redemptive strains in the Lord of the Rings.To be fair, there are countless brilliant details that make this movie enchanting.  One that stands out is Jackson's use of the work of notable Tolkien illustrators, like Alan Lee.  In several instances, movie settings seemed to bring Lee's painted illustrations to life, such as the images of Bag End, Rivendell, Orthanc, and the great halls of Moria.  The movie's settings are stunning, the fight sequences are exciting, and most of the casting (esp. Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli) is superb.  The movie is well worth seeing, but I can't help but note its flaws, even while realizing that what are flaws to me are strengths or irrelevancies to others.  See the movie, but if you like it even a little bit, be sure to read the books as well.
