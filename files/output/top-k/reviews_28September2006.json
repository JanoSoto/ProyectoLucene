Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies (which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film) are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky, so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan (henceforth TMTM) set me straight on that one. Of course, many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around Aliens, RoboCop, The Evil Dead, even Night Of The Living Dead. So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper, the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up TMTM is. Not only is the music far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible.There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. The problem is that there are just no scenes that work. The story, such as it is, revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced. He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way, including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before. The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist, and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films.Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM. Namely, the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me, but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy, not irritation. Grodin's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. He is all class. And if there is one thing TMTM could use, it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class. TMTM also feels severely time-compressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces. See if you can find them in TMTM.While TMTM does have its guest stars, they are either poorly utilised (Brooke Shields and John Landis), or totally out of their element (Liza Minelli, Dabney Coleman). To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here, after Animal's go home postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular. Which highlights another problem. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot, or the conversation going on around him. Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters, but think of Animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills, or his sowwy after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn. Give up? Then you have proved my point.Given that Labyrinth, one of the Henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets, arrived some two years later, it makes TMTM all the more puzzling. Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage. Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz, who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga. The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper, so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved here, with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them. Had the story and script been better thought-out, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete.For that reason, I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten.

I have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they're pretty light duty, so I didn't expect much from the movie. That's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. I admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit. The movie audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least, I think so. I certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen. In the 1960s, we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. It was that, another thrilling episode of Ironsides or Password.Rating this episode against usual theatre releases, the story was...well, I'm not sure I should even say because I'm not sure there was one. Drugs are bad? Whatever. The script was silly. When the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like I overheard him say so on the phone, and I think I got a plan, we really are in trouble. No wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.If I were Claire Danes, I'd be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now.

I realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall, but no one had a velvet suit? Mod only meant young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Perhaps the costume department was going for gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy.Since the movie was completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more.

I loved Robert De Niro as Tuttle, and it was a surprise to see him in this movie, since it doesn't look the kind of movie he would work in. The movie is not bad, I only expected much more from it, since it is a movie with a high rate here in IMDb, and I saw so many people saying good things about it, even my dad. But I found the movie extremely boring in the beginning, not to mention that Sam's illusions are hard to follow, since you don't know if he is dreaming or actually awake. I don't have problems with surrealism, I don't need ''happy endings'' to enjoy a movie, and usually, I like movies that are not exactly logical or linear, before anyone send me a message saying that I don't understood the plot or I like pre-chewed scripts.I liked the samurai sequence, that was based in Akira Kurosawa films, and also the song Aquarela do Brasil, played in this movie. Akira is one of my favorite directors and ''Aquarela do Brasil'' is a typical song from my country. I also think that this movie is based not only in 1984, but also on the works of Franz Kafka, as a guy said in one of the posts from the message board.The plot Sam Lowry is a lonely hard-working guy, that has his job as a bureaucrat technician while he dreams and fantasies about liberty and a beautiful blond woman that looks like an angel. In one ordinary day of work, Sam sees a woman that is identical to the one of his dreams. He stays curious about her and searches everything he can about her, until he finds out that she is being haunted by the government. Lowry then makes it his mission to save her and to prove to her that she can trust him. At the same time, he becomes friends with Mr. Tuttle, another guy that is being haunted by the government because of his illegal activities. Sam starts the movie having a pacific ordinary life, to, in the middle, only make illegal stuff to help his ''terrorists'' friends.The movie becomes less and less coherent when the end approaches,since Sam is having a lot of hallucinations with his mind becoming more ''destroyed'' then ever. The end is very pessimistic in my opinion, but also original and unexpected, with Sam escaping to a dream world because of his insanity.Ps I find the character Sam VERY annoying.

It's a very good movie, as good as an apocalyptic movie about the whole world dying can be. I give it an 8 only because it's B&W and I prefer color movies, and because the Special FX are not great, but as the movie was made in 1959, neither of those things are the movies fault, because in 59, many live action movies were still B&W, and FX in 59 were what one would expect from 1959.

From a cinematic perspective this is a really enjoyable film. The camera shots are very creative and well done. Diverse in color and imagery as well as in the kinds of characters you will see this movie is an interesting change from most coming-of-age and drug movies you will see.But let me tell you how this is a disappointing film. This actually bothers me the most. The plot seems to progress as if something pivotal is going to happen and you expect to see a resolution and a change in this man. I don't think this is portrayed well at all. With the deceiving title like Jesus' Son, this movie is very simplistic and shallow in its spiritual content. There are some references to Christianity and Jesus but thats about it. You do not see this man change or accept Jesus. There is nothing like that. What you are presented with is a very man-centered idea that its good to be a good guy and to be compassionate to people and not do drugs.But as if the lack of any substantial Christian content were not enough, I think this movie glamorizes sex and drugs instead of emphasizing their vanity. Even in the end, when you think that maybe he is changing there is no indication of any true Christian character in him. Even when you feel like the main character may be feeling compassion and love towards the wretched people he encounters he doesn't show it in any way.So, be warned, this is not a Christian movie, nor is it a good anti-drug film. Its a very cinematically pleasing noir-style indie film that simply tells you that people should be nice. It is sad that there are very few real Christian movies out there. I can only highly recommend The End of The Spear, Saint Ralph, Francis of Assisi, or Simon Birch as good Christian movies.

The performances by Penn, his wife and Travolta are all wonderful. This is actually my favorite Travolta role and this was the first time that he really dug beneath that cool and cocky exterior to show himself as a real actor, displaying a wide range of emotions. But the movie of course is carried primarily by Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn, playing two messed up lovers who are out of luck in every sense of the word. He loves her madly, while her feelings for him are difficult to understand. She seems to adore him, but then it becomes clear that she also is using him. When she is knocking at the door of the guy who abused her earlier and he starts to get nervous she asks him Aren't you a tough guy? and he replies no. That whole moment was very interesting and I think it said it all.One interesting fact that I wasn't aware of when I watched this film is that it was originally set to be made in the 80's, with the legendary John Cassavetes directing. That made me wonder what kind of beast it could have been and I believe we would get a very different kind of movie. All praise to his son Nick though, for he is also a capable director, yet there can never be another John Cassavetes again.James Gandolfini plays the nasty neighbor of Eddie and Maureen, a sort of a pre-Soprano signification of the creepiness and villain potential he is capable of, which he previously displayed in True Romance. Harry Dean Stanton is delightful as always when he appears in such cameo parts. Although the second part of the film may be a slight let down after the strong first part, this movie is a definite treat for those who are sick of standard Hollywood fare and for the fans of Sean and Robin Penn and Travolta.

The Vietnamese War actually ruined many lives of people who never were there; had I been a parent in that era, I would have gladly sent my sons to Canada to prevent them from being drafted. Some users state the term enlisted - voluntary. Maybe a few did, but the majority of the men sent there were drafted; because the story was about White Russians in Pennsylvania, there weren't many African Americans in it. How ironic that is, because that race toward the end of the conflict, when troops were getting scarce, were the predominant men (barely out of their teens) who were sent to war. I think Cimino did a disservice to them; there should have been more in the hospital scene. I saw one.Younger people may not be aware of the uproar against this war. Just as President Bush has had to be slightly untruthful about his reasons for the war on terror in Iraq, Lyndon Johnson did not tell the whole truth about many actions he ordered for Vietnam. He was so distraught when the truth was made public, he decided not to run for re-election. Richard Nixon, along with the many other despicably criminal actions he was involved in, lied about heavily bombing Cambodia (The Killing Fields), he resigned the presidency rather than face being impeached. While shouting democracy!, some of our presidents became meglamaniacs with the power that office holds. We can only wait to see how history handles Bush.......unfortunately, the world is heavily peopled with Muslims. Not all of them want to become Americans nor democratic; they know little of that. Their cultures are so much older than ours.There are a lot of films that depict the dreadful battles fought in Veitnam; The Deer Hunter mercifully showed only one major one, while concentrating on how brutality eventually causes insanity, with the total insanity of the Vietnamese to get out of Saigon. Our government turned its back on thousands of boys-hardly-yet-men, closing its eyes on their torture once they returned home. The War on Terror has produced almost as many ruined lives, plus sending troops ill-equipped to fight. Hmmmmmm.........DeNiro (Mike) actually prepared for his role by visiting steel-mills and meeting the workers and their stouthearted families. No wonder they drank so much ! Trivia also tells us the entire cast and crew slept on the floor of a warehouse for five days while those scenes were being shot. This is by far one of DeNiro's best roles; he was young and so energetic, and was given a beautiful script by Deric Washburn. Bravo! to DeNiro. Again, Bravo! to Christopher Walken (Nick) for his brilliant performance, and also John Savage (Steven) for his stellar acting in all of his scenes. Realism to the extreme. Meryl Streep (Linda) was so into her role, she actually adlibbed most of her lines; this was her audition for Sophie's Choice. Johns Cazale (Stanley) was his usually obnoxious character, giving his final, great performance. Po Pao Pee (the Russian roulette referee) was the epitome of total detachment in those harrowing scenes, showing that some folk CAN ignore their participation in brutality - the bosses of the game stoically ate their meal and raked-in the cash for the final game. Julien Grinda (Pierre Segui) was the sole character left from decades of French colonialism in Vietnam and the mess they left it in, portraying people who manage to live through situations they cannot control. Cinematography rates a 10, at least......Yes, we needed that hour at the beginning of The Deer Hunter to become acquainted with those naive men who lived their lives to the fullest, before going off to war. It was necessary to know them to compare the misery all of their lives became. Several of the actors were injured; it was a dangerous movie to film.

Made in 1992, this movie previewed around the world, and is much loved. Of Mice and Men is used for school readings, colleges, and every day life. It is set in California around the Selenas and Sacramento. Steinbeck really produced a wonderful story about how two men bonded. I read the book then watched the movie.

Here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the Arthur Freed musical unit. Hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris that the players never left the back lot at MGM. The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed blended with some background establishing shots. The idea of the film originated with Kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris. It sounded good to Arthur Freed who approached Ira Gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other Gershwin material.Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got. Not one note of non-Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me which are not real musical numbers.Another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one. All about an ex-GI played by Gene Kelly who after World War II never left France, just settled into an apartment on the Left Bank and proceeded to become a starving artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy. Two women are interested in him. Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters. But Kelly falls for a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her film debut. Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here.Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris happens to be the first film I ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip I ever took. I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport seeing Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the film however is Tra-La-La which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote where he said in the American in Paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the French impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate, and On the Town. But this one topped them all. Still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later films.In a surprise upset at the Oscars, An American In Paris was chosen best picture for 1951, beating out the heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire. I guess fantasy trumped realism that year. Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.

Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here.Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris happens to be the first film I ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip I ever took. I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport seeing Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the film however is Tra-La-La which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote where he said in the American in Paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the French impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate, and On the Town. But this one topped them all. Still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later films.In a surprise upset at the Oscars, An American In Paris was chosen best picture for 1951, beating out the heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire. I guess fantasy trumped realism that year. Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.

This is a movie for people who think they are important because they talk on cell-phones, make $100,000 a year selling snow to the Eskimos, and have nervous breakdowns on the weekends. If you like Applebees, happy hours, and live in a high priced housing development, then you'll like this movie. For me it was incomprehensible middle class mayhem. This movie seems to pander to the idea that machines are the problem instead of belief in machines. Unfortunately, in an attempt to recognize the worth of humans, this movie cuts out the humanity and leaves its target audience feeling even more isolated than before. For nonsensical science fiction psychobabble, though, it's actually a well done, entertaining piece of fluff.

It holds up amazingly well since its primary focus is not meticulous animation (like DreamWorks focus on), but story and humour. Sure, you could probably find an animated film with more heartfelt messages and substance than this (Finding Nemo), but I dare you to find a funnier one. This film remains completely unrivaled in the laugh-department.Its sequel, Ice Age The Meltdown, rode largely on this humour advantage throughout and unsurprisingly suffered a few pitfalls when it attempted to 'get serious' by adding morals and messages. Thankfully, Ice Age does not have this problem because it knows it is mostly funny and it makes no pretense about it. Make no mistake however; it was originally written as a drama and therefore still has a lot of story to fall back on &#150; the story of three outcasts turned Sub-Zero heroes (Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger) joining up to return a human baby to its herd &#150; and all the detours, diversions and conflicts that this journey entails, pinning the stunningly hilarious prehistoric rodent-squirrel Scrat somewhere in between, collecting his acorns. No words can describe how funny this character is but the special short on him on the DVD extra material should give you some idea.So if there is just this one template story and humour, without heartfelt messages á la Disney\/Pixar and meticulous fluent animation á la DreamWorks, then how does it manage to be such a great film? I don't know, but it is likely that its success stems from the fact that it lacks these very aspects of its peers. For example, it does not indulge in homages and references to the same extent as DreamWorks (except one little Star Trek joke squeezed in) and it never falls prey to predictable sappiness in the same way that Disney does. Without these things it therefore NEEDS a great backstory and fun characters to fall back on &#150; and it truly does.It is a bit more adult-humoured, too. There is a continuous gay joke with the rhinos Carl and Frank, for example. It never resorts to fart or pee jokes (ok - fine, there is a poop-joke, but so what?). There is an hilarious joke about modern architecture &#150; Manny walking past Stonehenge and remarking on how it'll never last. There is subtle use of irony in all the animals being able to express themselves eloquently while no humans talk in the film. It's insightful. The children's side of things is best tended to by John Leguizamo as Sid, who has clearly done something very cool with his character which ends up catering just as much to adults as its target audience &#150; which is probably true for the whole film.8 out 10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"28 September 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I've been having a bit of an animation treat lately with films such as Robots, Finding Nemo, Shrek II and Ice Age &#150;and while I may have had my favourite all along, this viewing cemented Ice Age as the best of the bunch.
