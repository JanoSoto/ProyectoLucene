Louis Gossett, jr. also does his best as Lundgren's former best friend. Jeroen Krabbe, in my opinion, is miscast as the big crime boss although he does his best.Secondly, the action sequences are simply good.

It cost $18 million and only grossed about 20 per cent of its budget back. In the years since its release it has become a cult film for those who can appreciate it for the blockbuster it never was. I personally discovered it on a Christmas Eve showing on BBC in the late 80s. Even then, I thought it was great despite it being a darker Christmas film than we're used to.In a snowy and sinister December at the height of the Victorian Era, Watson, as a teenager, is sent to Brompton, a private school in a fogbound London, when his old one is shut down due to lack of funding. Upon arrival, he meets a violin-playing smart-Alec who deducts his character from his mere appearance. It's the beginning of a life-long friendship.Holmes' life on campus is rather cosy. He has a pretty girlfriend Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) and her uncle, Professor Waxflatter, is a crackpot inventor of the Doc Brown variety who lives in the school attic with all of his crazy inventions. At first, Watson and Holmes have fun getting up to mischief on campus but a series of bizarre suicides soon distracts them.The local Inspector Lestrade is too lazy to do anything about it, leaving them free to investigate. Apparently the victims are all sane, happy men who seem to go suddenly mad with fear and hurl themselves to the nearest oncoming death. Things get personal when Waxflatter suffers the same fate and stabs himself in fit of madness.Why are ordinary men going crazy? Who is the mysterious black robed person hiding in the shadows? What dark secret was Waxflatter hiding? All questions to which Holmes demands answers and he drags along the nervous Watson and Elizabeth as he scours all the dodgy areas of Wapping talking to loads of cockneys and people who call you 'Govna'. What they discover is an ancient blood oath and a huge conspiracy brewing in the spooky alleyways.In the 80s, Chris Columbus penned a string of imaginative movies from Gremlins to The Goonies and later he directed the Home Alone films as well as Bicentennial Man (yes, I like it) and the first two Harry Potters. He's one of those writers who can hide a surprising amount of darkness in a kid's film and Young Sherlock is a fine example of his most sophisticated writing.With strong direction from Barry Levinson and enchanting production values from Steven Spielberg there's no denying that this movie looks absolutely great. But it's how it sounds that'll really impress you. Bruce Broughton - a tragically under-rated composer who has talent equal to John Williams - has been unfairly slumming most of his career in TV movies. Here, he delivers one of the most spellbinding and Gothic scores you have ever heard. There are dozens of themes, moments of real magic, evil menace and breathtaking action. If this film had been a hit it really would have become as famous as themes for Jaws, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter.And speaking of Harry Potter, one cannot deny that JK Rowling was inspired by this film in many ways when creating her Potter universe. I'm not crude enough to list all the similarities in this review but let me just say that while there may not be anywhere near enough to call it plagiarism there sure is more than enough to call it a coincidence. Watch the film and you'll know what I mean.Originally the critics dismissed Young Sherlock Holmes as another effects-filled Spielberg fantasy, but that's an unfair judgement. The visual effects (really quite something for its time) are essential to the story as well as being pioneering. You may not believe it but YSH was actually the first ever film to feature a fully CGI character (a stained-glass knight who comes alive), created by Pixar. Future Toy Story director John Lasseter was even one of the computer wizards who helped bring it to life. Unfortunately it lost its well-deserved Academy Award to the inferior effects of Cocoon.Even 20 years on a sequel definitely needed. Chris Columbus has stated he was upset that a sequel never got off the ground and that the series never took off. He shouldn't sell himself short. Of course it would need new actors but so many have put on the hat and coat of Sherlock Holmes that the role doesn't belong to just one man. There is still life in this spin-off franchise. All it needs is the right story and some of the magic that is missing from most kids' films these days.And when I say kids' films I should really play-down the negative connotations of such a label. As one of the first PG-13 rated films, YSH has a bit of a savage edge, a hardness unfamiliar the condescending kids' films of today.Sir Arthur would be proud. He may have felt indifferent towards his most famous creation, but if he were alive today he would have loved this film. And it well and truly deserves 10\/10. This surely one DVD you must get. The 1.781 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack sounds good considering it has been remastered from plain old stereo. The only extra is a trailer.

From here the movie follows their rampage in Las Vegas.Well, this is one of the most crazy and pointless movies i have ever experienced. To be quite honest the movie is actually very well constructed, Terry Gilian uses the camera very well in symbolizing the situation using crooked camera angles and a good amount of color impressions, however this can't save the movie from having no depth at all, all it simply does is giving a shallow description of drug abuse, it doesn't go into any deep moralizing questions about it, it doesn't bring any discussions up, it just describes and portrays, something that at first seems ok. But as the movie passes on it feels like everything is repeating itself, the same thing happens in a different way, it's pretty much the same, nothing that makes us think happens, and then it ends. The movie is simply too hollow and empty for being a great movie, all it describes it madness, pure madness, and the effect and possible feeling of drug abuse.I guess this has become a cult movie because of the madness it describes, in a very wild and obscure way, but towards that i can only say, cult movies does often divide the audience, and this time i got stuck on the negative side. Because this madness it describes so pointless just doesn't get to me, actually i found myself rather bored at times and especially towards the ending waiting for it just too end, i hated how the movie avoided all possible moral questions. Just as you thought it was gonna go in the depth with something, it turned around and walked out of it, something that for me made the movie feel very pointless and empty.What saves this movie is the great directing, and especially the amazing performances given by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. I can't even begin to imagine what kind of skill it have taken to play these two odd balls in this movie, this movie really shows how talented they REALLY are, if the acting had been awful in this movie, it would have been a completely useless movie, but somehow this does manage to squeeze in a few enjoyable scenes in a movie that pretty much makes no sense.To sum it all up, a crazy and absurd movie. However it's just too empty, the description of the state of being drugged is well done, but the movie avoids too many things and focuses only on a portrait of being drugged, it's a crazy movie, that some will like, and others will disllike, i disliked it.

If Disney can make money on the Splash Mountain ride which has these characters, than they should allow the movie that it's based on to be released.

An inspirational piece about sports teams or underdog individuals doing the impossible; and occasional a piece supporting patriots and patriotism. This was exactly the feeling behind the creation of perhaps one of the best patriotic movies ever to come out of Hollywood Frank Capra's, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. \t`Mr. Smith' came out at a time when the nation was rebuilding after the Depression and before the beginning of World War II. America needed a boost to help its people get back on the right track. And with one of the era's most infallible stars, Jimmy Stewart at the helm, this movie was just the encouragement the public needed.  \tWith such a simple title and premise, Frank Capra had created a very moving and inspirational film. A story of courage under fire and standing up for the unalienable rights of all human beings. The title character is perfectly cast and Mr. Stewart does his best to pull off the upset. His skills and charisma on-screen are best suited to portray such a `fish out of water' person like Jeff Smith.  \tThe writing and direction are exceptional and the themes are very strong throughout. I would also have to admit that this film may have renewed my faith in our governmental body. (Well&#133; maybe not.) It may inspire its audience, however. With such a tightly weaved plot, great acting and deep meanings rooted in the American spirit, it's no wonder this film has been rated so highly.

A couple points-The Freudian sexuality sequences were florid, but ultimately empty. I felt like I was reading an exceptionally well-illustrated List of Chapters from one of Freud's books. I noticed the Oedipal Complex when Pink equates his girlfriend with his mother, I noticed the Vagina Dentata in several cartoons-from-the-void. But they were lacked depth and were unconnected to the Wall. What was the point?-I am not sure what ten-year olds should be doing if not sitting behind desks at school bleeding heart liberals decided that children are not quite ready for the coal mines, to the dismay of conservatives who recognized the ability of children to squeeze into small spaces and get the really good coal. If schools are such dungeons, perhaps Waters would like to submit a paper to Pedagogy Today and suggest some improvements, such as requiring twelve credits of Poetry in order to graduate. That would be more productive that yelling TEACHER! LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE into a microphone. Somehow, I don't think educators were challenged, and replied no to the screaming idiot on the radio before returning their attention to their coffee.The kids in Waters' movie throw their books into a bonfire and dance like Germans in 1936. But 'Pink' would dress up as a neo-Nazi later on, so it works. Or not.-I am suspicious of anyone who comes across as excessively cheerful or negative. It smacks of self-indulgence and obstinacy.
