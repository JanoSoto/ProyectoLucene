And it shows in this masterpiece, which is a writer's epic love poem to the spirit of the bands who have kept him going all his life. If you were young in the 70's, you have a different vantage point about your favourite tunes than a youngster who's growing up in the 21st century. But the desire to call something yours and not see and hear mom and\/or dad enjoying it too is a lot harder than it used to be. The first rock and roll generation are grandparents now and their children's children have a much larger world of musical choices and cooler technology to store it on\/play it than in previous decades.That said, this movie is about taking a needle and getting your fix, by hearing vinyl with all it's scratches and skips and imperfections. The Who, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and so many others were recording some of their best work in this late 60's\/early 70's time period. I wish this movie was four hours long so we could really get into Crowe's cast and their character's lives even more deeply than we have already. What would Fairuza Balk's young lady listen to without the other band aids around? How would Jeff entertain himself without having an audience to perform for? How would William make out if he acted like the British guy Anna Paquin wanted him to be? What other interests does Jay Baruchel's Led Zep nut have besides following his number one band on tour?What Crowe has left us with is the best film about ending innocence on your terms and becoming an adult with some kind of value system. And no, this wouldn't have been a better movie with Stairway To Heaven in it!

Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course &#x96; just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific.Science-fiction has often tackled the notion that Mankind's technology is destined to rebel, as in '2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).' However, unlike most entries to the genre, 'T2 Judgement Day' takes the time to explore the idea. As in Kubrick's film, the fates of humans and machines become inescapably entwined Man is no longer merely the designer (a la Dr. Frankenstein) who creates an artificial son, but one who must learn from his progeny. Accordingly, John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) share a father-son relationship that twists back on itself like a Moebius strip, each half teaching the other. In one haunting sequence, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) grimly contemplates the Terminator's unwavering loyalty towards John, and his ironic suitability as a father figure. This grotesque interlacing of familial roles speaks a clear message if Judgement Day is to be averted, Man and Machine must coexist as equals, though human vanity may never allow it.Throughout the film, Cameron weaves one astonishing action set-piece after another, utilising a seamless combination CGI and optical trickery. The T-1000 Terminator at first glance seems reasonably innocuous, but Robert Patrick brings something icily sinister to the role, a cold intelligence that isn't strictly mechanical but somehow filled with imagination. An equally fascinating character, I thought, was Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, a complete reversal from the innocent Sarah Connor of the previous film. Now emotionally hardened by the prospect of nuclear holocaust, Sarah sees only ghosts where she once saw people, her apathy stemmed only by her maternal instincts towards John. In a haunting dream sequence, Sarah Connor is powerless to warn a younger version of herself (representative of society at large) of the coming dangers, her screams consumed by a nuclear blast that levels cities and engulfs her in flames. Hamilton's performance is bold and ferocious, perhaps cinema's most intense female action role (not coincidentally, James Cameron also provided us with the runner-up, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in 'Aliens (1986)).'
