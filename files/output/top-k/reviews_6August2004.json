I'd heard people talking about it when I was younger even.  And I'd always heard the word classic when they were talking about it.  Yet, I'd never seen this flick.  A travesty, I know.One day, while I was SUPER bored and doing nothing, I happened to come across The Princess Bride on the WE channel.  I figured Well, it's just starting.  So why not?.  Besides, if I didn't like it, I could just flip it, right?Five minutes into the movie, and I'm BAWLING hysterically at the thought of Buttercup losing Westley forever at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts.  And thus, I began the adventure that is The Princess Bride.This movie is a wonderfully refreshing take on the classic fairytales that everyone grew up with.  It spoofs them, but it does it so well that you don't feel cheated or offended.  And I just loved how the story was presented.  The story is introduced as just that, a story.  A grandfather comes to his sick grandson's bedside to read the book that he used to read to his own son.  The fairytale of Buttercup and Westley really IS a fairytale.  And what's better than that, really?The characters, you absolutely fall in love with.  Westley is simply the perfect man and one of the most perfect characters, in my opinion.  Just the first utterance of the infamous line, As you wish., and I was just a puddle on the couch.  Buttercup plays a princess you can relate to.  Fezzik the Giant, lovable.  And Inigo Montoya, probably one of the best characters.  His story was the one that was probably my favorite out of the movie.  Just awesome.  I totally rooted for him the entire time he was looking for The Six Fingered Man.  Plus, he's got one of the coolest quotes of the film.This movie is just good entertainment and is complete family fare.  You can watch it with everyone and be able to enjoy it.  I was laughing, I was in suspense, and I was CERTAINLY in tears more than once.  The story is just so sweet and so loving, truly classic.You will absolutely fall in love with this movie.  And TOTALLY wish you were Robin Wright.  It's full of everything that great stories and movies are made of.And, believe me, you WILL trip to watch The Princess Bride over and over.......as you wish.

It shows it's audience that things that we do to others in life that for the most part we may have long forgotten about will come back to haunt us in death. The difference in the film Flatliners is that those who died and were hunted by their past sins were given another chance to come back to life and correct or rectify them to those persons who they killed and abused. Person who were victimized by Nelson, Kifer Sutherland, who killed and David, Kevin Bacon, who abused. As well as Joe, William Baldwin,who betrayed and in the case of Rachel, Julia Roberts, drove to their death.A secret experiment was dreamed up by Nelson and his fellow medical students to see if there's really a life beyond the grave. The students put themselves under, getting clinically flat-lined, and then being brought back to life tell and record what they saw when they were Dead. Each student who was put under saw things that they did in life that they thought nothing of and long forgot about with the exception of Rachel. The dead and then revived students then spent the rest of the movie trying somehow to make amends for what they did in order not to have them go insane with guilt. Admittedly unrealistic the movie has the students get all the medical equipment and drugs that they needed for their experiment and preform it on each other. Right under the noses of the doctors nurses and attendants at the hospital they were at! The students being able to put each other under, from one to five minutes, and then revive themselves was really a bit too much to take. Still you have to give Flatliners an +A for originality. Even though the movie had trouble convincing you that the goings on on the screen could have been at all possible in even in the most modern medical facility in the world.Still Flatliners does at least try to confront one of the most profound mysteries, of science and theology, in it's own very strange and peculiar way.

Of course because of its 'R' rating I could never see it until it came out on video. I found it offered a different take on sci-fi films as it had no involvement with sinister aliens, and the only alien world explored is the Jupiter moon.***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!***'Outland' is set on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, in a mining colony. Marshal W.T. O'Niel (Connery) is assigned to the moon colony. Shortly after he arrives he discovers that several miners have been committing suicide in bizarre and ugly ways, such as walking into zero-atmosphere minus a pressure suit. When he investigates he finds that the dead men have been taking an amphetamine-like drug. According to Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen) the drug enables the miners to go for days without sleep and work at extended intervals, thereby increasing the mine's productivity. When O'Niel follows the dealers' trail he discovers that it leads to the head of the mining operation. These men have no intention of letting O'Niel stop their dirty work, and now the marshal has to watch his back at every turn, as a hit contract is put out on his head. O'Niel also finds that his own men are willing to turn on him...***END SPOILER ALERT***Like someone else mentioned, the production design does not show space as a shiny, clean environment - space is 'dirty' here. The mining colony looks like a real operation, in a similar way to the way the Nostromo appeared in 'Alien'. Jerry Goldsmith's music also sounds much like the low, sinister tones of 'Alien' which he had written only 2 years before. While it lacks most of the spectacular effects of the 'Star Wars' trilogy it gives a believable sense of the awesome size of space. The story is not unlike a western set in outer space, only that the crime the marshal is trying to stop is drug-dealing as opposed to train or stagecoach robbery.

A ridiculous emperor, The lame psycho brothers, the list goes on&#133;  About the only thing worth while was the dialog which was probably transcribed word for word from the Shakespearian play anyway.  I'm surprised this thing got a 7+ vote on IMDB.  I like art films every now and then, but this film was not art (or at least good art) IMO.  Anthony Hopkins did a good job, but his character was so lame that it didn't matter how good he did.  For me 3 out of 10, so well below average for me&#133; ","genre":"Drama, History, Thriller"},{"date":"6 August 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  spoilers.

Given the budget of his choice, he decided to follow up his masterpiece with a script that he had been hoping to produce since his humble beginnings as a Clint Eastwood protégé. Having already brought his inimitably masterful vision to the (then) fresh debate of the Vietnam War, the director chose to adapt yet another periodic American conflict the infamous battle of Johnson County. As I'm sure you're well aware, the result was perhaps the most monumental flop of cinema history, which immediately relieved the young auteur of his promising career as a master filmmaker and sunk an entire studio without a trace. This inevitably changed Hollywood forever. Gone were the days of the ambitious auteur and the daring studio executives with something to prove, and eventually the eighties opened up an extreme user friendly environment where budgets would be handed out with extreme caution and prejudice to those with artistic tendencies. Looking back over a quarter of a century later, it's surprising how well The Deer Hunter has retained its composure. It remains a touching portrayal of human companionship, emotion and loyalty that's packed with brash political overtones that raise questions even today. The merits of his magnum opus and my love of the Western genre led me to finally view Heaven's Gate and see for myself if it was in fact the turkey that its grim reputation has allowed it to be remembered as. The gratification of viewing a gun totting cowboy movie from the virtuoso imagination of The Deer Hunter's creator was indeed an allurement in itself. I strongly hoped that Cimino had suffered only because after the bloated excess of such over-budgeted over-abundances as Apocalypse Now, the media had decided to target him for career annihilation as they have with countless others in the past. On return to Casper Wyoming, Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) learns from his drunken friend Billy Irvine (John Hurt) that the association have written up a death list to rid the county of what they see as thieving and money-hungry immigrants. His hooker with a heart of gold sweetheart Ella (Isabelle Huppert) is on the list, which forces him to beg that she leaves the state to head West with him away from the animosity. However Ella is also involved in a relationship with a hired gun, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), who has accepted the task of assassinating those that the association has targeted at the price of $50 dollars a head. Although the coupling is initially professional, emotions become confused when Nate proposes that Ella marries him. As the rivalry between the rich and poor worsens, the immigrant community realize that to survive they have to adopt the policies of their aggressors, which results in a bloody battle for survival and independence.Upon viewing Heaven's Gate, one of the immediate things that you notice is how damn beautiful the movie actually is. Vilmos Zsigmond's lush cinematography is a sight to behold and frame by frame the runtime looks like a collection of stunning and realistically gritty portraits strung together artistically for audience appreciation. Cimino manages to handle scenes with a huge abundance of activity like the master craftsman that he truly is. Although many sequences, like the sprawling dance at the beginning or the bizarre roller skating 'disco' are predominantly pointless, his dedication, flare for authenticity and overall guidance remain highly textured and visually astounding throughout. Averill's locomotive arrival is (arguably) unintentionally reminiscent of Jill's mesmerising landing from C'era una volta il West. The streets bustle with activity as passers by go about their everyday business, and the director does well to control an amazing number of accurately costumed extras, without taking the emphasis away from the plot's focal points. It's interesting to see a pre-CGI outing that has such strong and realistic art direction and set locations that weren't simply created over a blue or green screen. In fact, Heaven's Gate puts Lord of the Rings and Troy to shame with its stark realism and dedication to historical accuracy. However, brief flashes of genius cannot hide the film's only too numerous flaws. Kris Kristofferson gives a lifeless lead performance and even master actors to the class of Jeff Bridges and a bizarrely miss-cast Brad Douriff seem to struggle aimlessly to find a relevant plot point to chew upon. John Hurt adds swagger to a tissue paper thin persona, but overall his appearance is as redundantly pointless as his woefully miss-judged exit. A young and almost unrecognisably handsome Christopher Walken ends up carrying the majority of the film on his shoulders, and even a pre-famed Mickey Rourke pops up briefly only to die tragically moments later. The time dedicated to the uninteresting romance between the three leads severely jeopardised the entire motivation of the story, and one is left wondering whether the whole thing could have been cut down to perhaps 15% of the runtime instead of the long winded 75. The heavy handed editing is in fact the feature's biggest downfall. With Cimino in full control, his obsession with excess is no less than devastating, and five hours and twenty two minutes is not a movie by any length of chalk; it's a bloated mini-series. All in all, Heaven's Gate is a tough title to judge. At times beautiful and compelling and in others pointless and lengthy, over the years it has gained as many fans as it has critics for its discrepancies in reviews and acclaim. The Deer Hunter may have had scenes that just acted as wallpaper without moving the plot anywhere, but it was saved by strong performances and a story that was much clearer, more coherent and easy to follow. Kris Kristofferson is no Robert Deniro and Isabelle Huppert isn't Meryl Streep either, which didn't make things any easier when Heaven's Gate finally showed up at box offices to strong anticipation. But in its favour, David Mansfield's score is unmissible and viewers will be rewarded by the over powering beauty of the cinematography. For serious cinema lovers, Heaven's Gate is worth a look, if only to see the film that sunk a studio &#150; the last of its kind. But if you're expecting a popcorn western in the vein of Tombstone, stay well away&#133;  ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  After the critical and financial success of Oscar darling The Deer Hunter, Michael Cimino had Hollywood, the majority of the media and more importantly, United Artists' executives at his feet.

Although many sequences, like the sprawling dance at the beginning or the bizarre roller skating 'disco' are predominantly pointless, his dedication, flare for authenticity and overall guidance remain highly textured and visually astounding throughout. Averill's locomotive arrival is (arguably) unintentionally reminiscent of Jill's mesmerising landing from C'era una volta il West. The streets bustle with activity as passers by go about their everyday business, and the director does well to control an amazing number of accurately costumed extras, without taking the emphasis away from the plot's focal points. It's interesting to see a pre-CGI outing that has such strong and realistic art direction and set locations that weren't simply created over a blue or green screen. In fact, Heaven's Gate puts Lord of the Rings and Troy to shame with its stark realism and dedication to historical accuracy. However, brief flashes of genius cannot hide the film's only too numerous flaws. Kris Kristofferson gives a lifeless lead performance and even master actors to the class of Jeff Bridges and a bizarrely miss-cast Brad Douriff seem to struggle aimlessly to find a relevant plot point to chew upon. John Hurt adds swagger to a tissue paper thin persona, but overall his appearance is as redundantly pointless as his woefully miss-judged exit. A young and almost unrecognisably handsome Christopher Walken ends up carrying the majority of the film on his shoulders, and even a pre-famed Mickey Rourke pops up briefly only to die tragically moments later. The time dedicated to the uninteresting romance between the three leads severely jeopardised the entire motivation of the story, and one is left wondering whether the whole thing could have been cut down to perhaps 15% of the runtime instead of the long winded 75. The heavy handed editing is in fact the feature's biggest downfall. With Cimino in full control, his obsession with excess is no less than devastating, and five hours and twenty two minutes is not a movie by any length of chalk; it's a bloated mini-series. All in all, Heaven's Gate is a tough title to judge. At times beautiful and compelling and in others pointless and lengthy, over the years it has gained as many fans as it has critics for its discrepancies in reviews and acclaim. The Deer Hunter may have had scenes that just acted as wallpaper without moving the plot anywhere, but it was saved by strong performances and a story that was much clearer, more coherent and easy to follow. Kris Kristofferson is no Robert Deniro and Isabelle Huppert isn't Meryl Streep either, which didn't make things any easier when Heaven's Gate finally showed up at box offices to strong anticipation. But in its favour, David Mansfield's score is unmissible and viewers will be rewarded by the over powering beauty of the cinematography. For serious cinema lovers, Heaven's Gate is worth a look, if only to see the film that sunk a studio &#150; the last of its kind. But if you're expecting a popcorn western in the vein of Tombstone, stay well away&#133;  ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"6 August 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  After the critical and financial success of Oscar darling The Deer Hunter, Michael Cimino had Hollywood, the majority of the media and more importantly, United Artists' executives at his feet. Given the budget of his choice, he decided to follow up his masterpiece with a script that he had been hoping to produce since his humble beginnings as a Clint Eastwood protégé. Having already brought his inimitably masterful vision to the (then) fresh debate of the Vietnam War, the director chose to adapt yet another periodic American conflict the infamous battle of Johnson County. As I'm sure you're well aware, the result was perhaps the most monumental flop of cinema history, which immediately relieved the young auteur of his promising career as a master filmmaker and sunk an entire studio without a trace. This inevitably changed Hollywood forever. Gone were the days of the ambitious auteur and the daring studio executives with something to prove, and eventually the eighties opened up an extreme user friendly environment where budgets would be handed out with extreme caution and prejudice to those with artistic tendencies. Looking back over a quarter of a century later, it's surprising how well The Deer Hunter has retained its composure. It remains a touching portrayal of human companionship, emotion and loyalty that's packed with brash political overtones that raise questions even today. The merits of his magnum opus and my love of the Western genre led me to finally view Heaven's Gate and see for myself if it was in fact the turkey that its grim reputation has allowed it to be remembered as. The gratification of viewing a gun totting cowboy movie from the virtuoso imagination of The Deer Hunter's creator was indeed an allurement in itself. I strongly hoped that Cimino had suffered only because after the bloated excess of such over-budgeted over-abundances as Apocalypse Now, the media had decided to target him for career annihilation as they have with countless others in the past. On return to Casper Wyoming, Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) learns from his drunken friend Billy Irvine (John Hurt) that the association have written up a death list to rid the county of what they see as thieving and money-hungry immigrants. His hooker with a heart of gold sweetheart Ella (Isabelle Huppert) is on the list, which forces him to beg that she leaves the state to head West with him away from the animosity. However Ella is also involved in a relationship with a hired gun, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), who has accepted the task of assassinating those that the association has targeted at the price of $50 dollars a head. Although the coupling is initially professional, emotions become confused when Nate proposes that Ella marries him. As the rivalry between the rich and poor worsens, the immigrant community realize that to survive they have to adopt the policies of their aggressors, which results in a bloody battle for survival and independence.Upon viewing Heaven's Gate, one of the immediate things that you notice is how damn beautiful the movie actually is.

This is my interpretation of the classic idea of a good story, well told.)With that in mind, I wish to state that this movie (film, whatever) really does work, at all levels. It's a good intelligent story (apparently based on fact about a very bright, very young kid who is discovered to be naturally good at chess and enters the serious national tournaments. During which time, there are raised issues of the concept of the winning ethos; and keeping (or losing) your humanity in the process.This cast is magnificent here. The central leads are played by Joe Mantegna and Max Pomerance as the father and son respectively. Both give very well-balanced performances. Sensitive, without being sappy. Max in particular is very good, especially in the dramatic climax of the film; which he handles with total dignity. It could have been so over the top and patronizing in lesser hands, but this time it isn't.They are ably supported by Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley as two different types of coaches, from opposite side of the tracks (sorry for that old cliché). It may seem formulaic, but in this case the dramatic contrasts works surprisingly well, and both come over as intelligent representatives of their particular points of view. And there are also great character moments by David Paymer QUIZ SHOW, MR Saturday NIGHT, etc and Hal Scardino THE Indian IN THE CUPBOARD as well.Over all, I would highly commend this film as the type of story that manages to tread the fine line between intelligent ideas and an entertaining story. I recommend it to everyone. Give it half a chance and it can work for you. It really is a great example of intelligently entertaining!
