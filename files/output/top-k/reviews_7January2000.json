Many have said you have to work in an office to enjoy this movie, but I don't think so. I happen to work in an office, and I understand how accurate a portrayal of life in a cubicle this movie gives, but even if I didn't, the humor is still so overwhelming you can't help but laugh. It is a true satire all the way, and it is brilliant.   Where to begin? Ron Livingston doesn't get much credit for a truly great performance, so here's one vote for him. He plays the burned out slacker role well, and you have to admire his character for putting himself first for once and doing what makes him happy. Samir is a software engineer who is increasingly frustrated with a malfunctioning fax machine and annoyed that nobody in this country can pronounce his last name, Naga...  Naga... Naganna work here anymore.  Then you have everybody's favorite character, Milton,a mumbling half-wit who tries to stand up for himself but can't mumble loud enough to get anyone to pay attention to him. Stephen Root gives an absolutely hysterical performance here, and it is impossible not to laugh at some of the threats Milton mumbles under his breath ok but that's the last straw. I'm going to light the building on fire.      As funny as all these characters are, the real star here is Michael Bolton Is that your real name? From the opening scene, where we see Michael stuck in traffic, lip-synching to a hard core rap song, only to turn the radio down in fear as a black man peddling flowers or some such item walks by his car, we know this character is going to be hilarious. We then see a large poster of Snoop Dogg taped to his cubicle, and it is impossible not to laugh. Some have said the rap soundtrack does not fit with the movie, but that is the point. Your first image of a guy like Michael is not that of a foul-mouthed gangsta, and that is what makes it so funny. And I don't know if I've ever heard anything funnier than when he calls his bosses c**kgobblers.   Nothing about this movie is lacking in the least. I can watch it over and over and still laugh. That is the sign of a great comedy. And for those who didn't like it, oh well, we all have our opinions. Hopefully Notting Hill kept you in stitches.

One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and\/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - exceptExcept that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it.

I've never seen a film look so grim and fitting for it's subject matter, except for mabye Jacob's Ladder.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror"},{"date":"7 January 2000","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  After Life demonstrates along with the awful Life Is Beautiful that all that is foreign is not automatically good. After Life takes an intriguing, even profound, idea--what do we take with us (memories and the like) when we pass over to the other side--then proceeds to develop it in an utterly shoddy fashion. This more like the rough draft for the actual film than the film itself.I mean, really--putting together a high school-play quality reproduction of the memory instead of the memory itself? And that the social workers at this hereafter way station are there because they haven't yet chosen their memories? (Maybe after having seen the cheesy way they're constructed, they don't want that to happen to them.)For those who haven't seen the film, the general idea is this. The recently deceased arrive at a facility on the way to their final destination for one week and are given a few days to decide on the one memory they can take with them to their permanent afterlife. Once they have chosen it, the way station crew re-enacts it, films it, then screens it for the afterlife travelers to take with them. Those who don't declare a memory cannot pass on and are fated to become facility workers.I'll admit that during the screening I found myself thinking about which memory I'd take with me. I'm sure many others did the same. But then I began thinking about this movie, and the memories are not pleasant.First of all, it is set at what looks like a shabby, abandoned university. (I was reminded of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when earthman Arthur Dent, upon first glance of the inside of his first alien spaceship, which happens to be the messy living quarters of the cooks and stewards, remarks, It's a bit squalid, isn't it?) The staff of this way station are essentially social workers, most of them oddly young, while their cases come in all ages. But never do we learn how most of them died, nor do we learn their attitude towards having died. The older ones we can assume expected it as natural cause, but what about the younger ones, like the teenage girl? Don't they feel cheated? If not, why not?This whole premise was better presented by Albert Brooks in Defending Your Life and much more hilariously stated by Tim Burton in Beetlejuice where Sylvia Sydney, having committed suicide, is condemned to spent eternity as a social worker.Then there's the problem of why this after life crew has to recreate the memory for each traveler. First off, they often cannot match exactly the circumstances of each memory, which alters it on a literal, material level, but even if the memory were matched exactly, isn't that really a new memory (a metamemory, if you will) that merely recalls the original?

What would you think of them? Would you hang out with them? What if the parent of the opposite sex developed a crush on you? This is the inspired premise behind a movie that will live on forever in my heart, the best film I have ever seen out of thousands of films. Back to the Future received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay and numerous technical awards. It was the biggest box office hit of 1985. None of that explains what makes the film so perfect. What makes it perfect is the way it hooks you with it's premise and then carries it out in a manner that will entertain and enlighten you. It's a film that expertly blends so many genres. It's a comedy, a drama, a rip roaring thrill ride, sci fi action adventure, and love story. No movie I've seen pulls off all these genres at the same time. The movie transports you back in time and teaches us how our lives are connected and the significance of your family roots. If you're an adult, you marvel at the recreation of the 50s and the knowing jokes, such as the disbelief of realizing that the actor Ronald Reagan was going to become president. As a child, you realize that yes, your parents were young once and they were even like you in many ways. These are just some of the issues the film deals with. You care about the characters and live through their strengths and flaws. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly but as fate would have it, he was the replacement for Eric Stoltz (a terrific actor who apparently was considered too intense for the role.)  This bold decision by the producers to scrap several weeks of filming and replace the lead actor was a risk that paid off beyond their wildest dreams. Fox dissolves into the role so easily that his acting talent sometimes gets overlooked because he makes it look so effortless. As for Christopher Lloyd, no need to replace him. This is the role he will always be remembered for. Who else could handle the rapid fire delivery and sheer energy that his Doc Brown called for? He has a lot of the best lines. Hats off to Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, who each endured makeup allowing them to play 17 and 47. Their joy in playing these characters comes through. All the roles down to the smallest were wonderfully cast. The marvelous sets, costumes, editing, music, sound effects, etc. And of course, hats off to Director Robert Zemeckis, who went on to make Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump.

Alvin's brother, Lyle, has had a stroke in Wisconsin, and Alvin decides it is his duty to travel from his home in Iowa and see him for the first time in ten years. But the problem is Alvin does not have a driving licence and his eyes are bad and so is his hip. So he decides the solution is to drive his lawnmower along with his trailer. The first attempt is doomed when the lawnmower expires and fails him. Alvin then shoots it with his gun to get some satisfaction. He then buys a 1966 green John Deere tractor which is more reliable. The journey is slow as you would expect, but is enlivened by the people Alvin meets, including a pregnant runaway girl, a lady driver who knocks down a deer, some bickering twin mechanics and a former World War Two soldier. The scene in which Alvin describes an incident to him he had in France in the war is very moving. There is another scene where Alvin is slowly moving along and is passed by a huge speeding truck which blows his hat off, as if it is a sign of the modern scramble to go faster and quicker, where as Alvin is content to travel at his own pace and still get to his destination eventually like the good old days. After a scrape descending a hill and meeting some other kind folks Alvin finally arrives in Wisconsin, and on the journey we are treated to wonderful cinematography from Freddie Francis, beautiful sound and music as always from Lynch's regular composer, Angelo Badalamenti, and a humble and delightful central performance.

I'm a huge movie fan and I watch 3-4 movies per week on average. And therein may lie the clue to its enjoyment. The average movie goer may see one flick a week at the most and provide the box office fuel for such tripe as Godzilla and Deuce Bigalow. This movie isn't for those kinds of John Doe block buster movie goers. This movie is for true fans of film as art in the style of Scorsese and Altman. It isn't your standard movie experience. If a long unconventional movie isn't your thing, avoid avoid avoid.The movie's theme is the tragic result of self centered-ness. The kind that is so prevalent in post WWII America. The theme seems to be lost on so many of the viewers I saw the film with, as well as many of the reviewers here on imdb. That we are shown at least 9 different people going through this self centered-ness is a vital element to the film. It shows the pervasiveness with which this self absorption exists in our society. In the film it occurs within the span of one day, in one city in 9 different lives. To say life isn't this bad, or that people just aren't this desperate or self absorbed in this day and age is to just have blinders in. People will blast this movie and then leave the theater to blow up at someone who cut them off on the freeway, then drop their 2 year old off at all day day care, oblivious to the failure of their own lives. The manifestations of this kind of life are shown in glorious, overblown detail drug addiction, blind careerism, selfishness, parents pushing their kids to excel, molestation, adultery. The heart is hardened in every way possible and the capacity to truly love is shut out. The results, as shown in brilliant performances by Jason Robards and Phillip Baker Hall, are agonizing regret and guilt towards the end of life. The brilliant Biblical allegory towards the end of the film (which to my utter surprise several people did not get ...what's with the frogs? I heard several people say)only goes to hammer these points home. Reprehensible lives such as these are worthy of a plague.At least to me, this film serves to drive the same point home as American Beauty did Love, compassion and beauty are the only things that matter in life, not the careers, material gains and self pleasures we surround ourselves with. There is certainly a stylistic difference between the two films. AB is thoroughly realistic, Magnolia drives its message home with parody and occasional over-acting to brilliant effect. I mean come on people, look at the Tom Cruise seminar in the hotel..the material in the package he sells. It's obvious this over dramatization is not realistic, it is meant to prove a point.I do have one minor complaint, and that is certain parts of the film where Aimee Mann's songs are used. I'm not referring to the cast sing along of Wise Up which I though was brilliant, but to the use of Momentum and One. At certain points the songs are playing top volume, at the same time the score is playing beneath, and then dialogue on top of that. I found this to be very distracting and annoying. This isn't a slight against Mann, who is a songwriter on par with Lennon or Dylan, but the effect was a little too overwhelming.So you will either revel in the overblowness of it all, and get the message, or see the film as a contrived jarring mess. Maybe some of us could open our minds to see the former.

A chance to express my utter hatred of this execrable and immoral film. I burst out laughing when it won oscars in all the film making departments in which I had found it so inept. Hackneyed dialogue, direction-by-numbers, corny music and silly performances make this one to remember. Hopkins gives a diabolical performance but not in the way you want. He was quite preposterous but, being a canny actor, he gave a cartoon turn very appropriate to the ridiculous plot. Take the money and run, eh Tony? The name 'Dr.Lecter' suggests a moriaty type evil genius which is wonderfully silly. The scene where he is wheeled along in restraints at the airport reminds me of an episode of Batman, a series noted at the time for its pantomime villains. I remember an 8 year old on tv saying this was her favourite film. We were supposed to be shocked that she'd even seen it but I thought 'how appropriate'. That seems to be the mentality it was aimed at. But the real p***er is when Starling is led into a room where lecter is sitting in this ridiculously huge cage. Roll up, folks! Roll Up! Come and see the most dangerous man in the world! Then there's that crass scene where Lecter listens to classical music while murdering his guards. Hey, Mass murderers like Hitler listened to Wagner. Getting the message? Then the corny fifties way the police draw their revolvers and look at the descending lift arrow. He's coming down! Notice the way the camera wobbles as it pans in. Bad. Then there's the naff B-movie dialogue. Jodie Foster saying the Plan 9-like line who cut off your patient's head, doctor? in that portentious southern twang never fails to give me the giggles. And what's the big psychological motivation that Sterling must divulge to Lecter which is susposed to rivet us to our seats with the great drama of it all? Aw shucks, she just wanted to save all those lambys from being slaughtered in her childhood. Blinding! Shakespeare! The way the film tries to make us laugh and side with Lecter at the end as he stalks his captor is sickening and speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of America. Hopkins described SOTL as 'that camp little picture' with a smirk. Jonathan Demmie nervously explained how many successful films were B-movies. What can you say about a film whose lead actor and director seem embarrassed by its success? I see a lot of reviewers of this film say it has inspired them to become psychology majors and 'profilers', whatever that means. Have fun, kiddies!
