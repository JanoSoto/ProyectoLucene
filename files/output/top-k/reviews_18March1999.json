Not being a huge sci-fi fan, I was SHOCKED at how brilliant and engaging Dark City was. It was simply one of the greatest film achievements of all-time. It was not just sci-fi....it was part mystery, part drama, and all heart!I first watched this film on my little 20-inch TV, and the visuals still managed to take my breath away. The biggest gripe I've seen by other viewers on this film was the confusing first 30 minutes. However, I thought this was one of the most brilliant aspects of the film. We basically lived the life of John Murdock. We know just as little as he knows and we experience things just as he experiences them. How can you possibly get more immersed into the story than that? Most people nowadays are used to mindless story telling where all the answers are revealed right away. We live in a short-attention span world. It's great to see a movie that doesn't conform to these standards.The plot and storyline of the movie were brilliant. I found it very easy to follow and instantly grabbing. I made my cousin watch it recently and she enjoyed every second of it. She too found the plot well done and easy to follow. I think in general, that people who hated the plot weren't paying too much attention in the first place and were spending most of the time in the theater thinking of how to make the moves on their date. The second category of people who didn't like the plot were just idiots who just watched The Waterboy the other day.In all, I felt this to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It was as bold as it was beautiful. The ending was great! I loved the fact that Jennifer Connolley's character became re-programmed and was basically a new person that John had to woo all over again. It really embraced the concept of everyone having a fresh start.I give it an 11 out of 10!!

However, when I walked out of  the theater, I had found that movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  I had actually enjoyed the movie and it made my 2 hours in the theater go by pretty fast.  I never really lost interest in the film.  However, there were things that worked in the movie and things that did not.  The fact that the whole story line takes place over one week, is way too little time for this movie to develop into anything.  The beginning starts off very strong, but gets weaker, when the Rachel's best friend commits suicide.  We only see Rachel and her friend speaking to each other a couple of times before this tragedy.  I also want to mention that the acting of the social worker (Amy Irving) was awful.  I just kept wanting her to go away, and I always thought she was very over-dramatic.  I did like some of the special effects and the camera movements that the director used.  I did not see the original Carrie, so I do not know how the two movies compare, but I did think that this story line was very predictable, yet it had some suspenseful parts to it.  I also want to mention that the performance by Emily Bergl (Rachel) was very good.

Half-way through the movie I had forgotten that the language was 400 years old and I had no trouble at all understanding what was happening. Not only do the actors say the words in a way that lets you understand, but also the actors are so visual and expressive that you could almost understand the movie without any words at all. (though the words are wonderful and definitely worth keeping!) Leo and Claire were both great and were totally convincing as young people in love. Leo has gotten so much backlash after his popularity as Titanic, but he CAN act. (If you don't believe that after R+J, go watch Gilbert Grape, he's the only good part of the movie) I've watched this movie 3 times, with a period of about 3 months between each time, and every time my amazement is refreshed. In between, I slowly forget how good he (not to mention the movie) is! I don't think he's the hottest guy alive or anything like that, but I admit (with a little embarrassment!) that his talent and looks combined in this movie make him very attractive. Claire Danes is awesome too, her role in this made her one of my favorite female actors. The scene when Romeo and Juliet first meet is one of the best in the movie. You can almost see the electricity between them! The other actors were all good too. John Leguizamo is very convincing, the Friar and Nurse were good and Mercutio is a fun, likable character. Oh yes, some people complain about the MTV likeness and the music. I wouldn't know about MTV, because I never watch it, but I think the music was very good. I especially loved the boy's choir song in the wedding scene. And of course the tragic end scene....That was lovely. It's the scene I dislike the most (besides the Romeo murdering Tybalt scene, that's just scary) because of what happens, but it is also very great acting. My friends (who I watched it with) and I kept telling Romeo not to drink the poison, Juliet wasn't dead, but of course he does it every time! I love all the candles around in this scene, that's was a wonderful touch. I think that's all I'll say, except I must mention that I don't think Shakespeare would be turning over in his grave. This movie introduces a new generation to Shakespeare and makes it understandable and enjoyable, creating some new fans who might have before thought that Shakespeare was hard to understand and boring.

Since, I've obtained a copy and have watched it many times since. It's definitely one of my favorates. Here are a few reasons why.First of all, The story line is much better than the TV series could ever hope to be.  It really does show the insanity of war, especially a war like the Korean war of the early 1950's. A war that isn't particularly popular compared to the other more recent wars (WW I,WW II, Vietnam et-al).The characters, Hawkeye Pierce, Major Hotlips Hullihan and Radar etc are what make this movie such a delight.One of the all time classic scenes from this movie that always gets me is when Major Hullihan goes to take a shower... We all know what happens next. I always anticipate it w\/ glee since it's so hilarious.

I think I love it so much because it contains all of the thrills that I have dreamed of pursuing. At that time I wanted to skydive in the worst way, and I also wanted to try surfing, but had never had the opportunity for either. This film was so thrilling that I felt like I had taken a two week vacation and done it all. The skydiving scenes were just stellar, as were the surfing scenes, especially the one that took place at night.The movie is all about thrills, so Bigelow succeeding in ever way in making a thrilling film. From the exciting score to the excellent foot chase through the back alleys and a few houses of a suburb, every moment of Point Break is a thrill. In the film, Patrick Swayze's character has a spiritual connection with thrill seeking adventures (surfing, robbing banks, sky diving, etc). He's trying to find the ultimate ride.

He's working as an elevator operator.Holly Hunter is a rich divorcee whose slimy cardiologist husband has deserted her for a younger model. She lives in the building where DeVito runs the elevator.They are driven together by common loneliness and one shared interest, a love for the music of a terrific local club singer who never quite hit the big time (Queen Latifah).The movie's first great strength is that it deals with them in a honest way. They interact as the characters really would in life.The second great strength is the power of their performances, especially DeVito, who is wounded and charming and completely real. You know a dozen guys like him. Also worthy of praise is Latifah, who is a completely natural actress and, man, can she sing!I guess there are a couple flaws as well. I never could have any sympathy for the Hunter character. She is completely self-centered, and after her husband left, she's left with nothing but her great looks, her brainpower (she'll go back to medical school), zillions of dollars, and her Park Avenue apartment. Oh, you poor, poor, dear!And the story mixes reality with her own interior fantasy monologue, and it is not easy to tell which is which.  I guess she couldn't have really done that dance routine, because even a professional Broadway chorine couldn't pick up that choreography instantly.  But what about the stranger who pulls her in the room and starts kissing her? I guess this one really happened, because she talks about it later.

Thankfully, he wasn't wearing a Snidely Whiplash costume or doing any pirate laughs. I guess this could be justified within the context of the movie because he is seen from her P.O.V., and at this stage in her life she's not ready to stand back objectively and concede him any depth.Oh, well, I guess it doesn't matter that much.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"18 March 1999","score":"","review":"  Two lonely people come together.Danny DeVito has suffered a recent double loss. His beautiful and beloved daughter died, and his successful wife kicked him out because he is one of life's lovable losers, and she wants to be with a winner. He's sweet-tempered and a good guy, but always in over his head with borrowing from tough guys or with ideas too big for his abilities. He's working as an elevator operator.Holly Hunter is a rich divorcee whose slimy cardiologist husband has deserted her for a younger model. She lives in the building where DeVito runs the elevator.They are driven together by common loneliness and one shared interest, a love for the music of a terrific local club singer who never quite hit the big time (Queen Latifah).The movie's first great strength is that it deals with them in a honest way. They interact as the characters really would in life.The second great strength is the power of their performances, especially DeVito, who is wounded and charming and completely real. You know a dozen guys like him. Also worthy of praise is Latifah, who is a completely natural actress and, man, can she sing!I guess there are a couple flaws as well. I never could have any sympathy for the Hunter character. She is completely self-centered, and after her husband left, she's left with nothing but her great looks, her brainpower (she'll go back to medical school), zillions of dollars, and her Park Avenue apartment. Oh, you poor, poor, dear!And the story mixes reality with her own interior fantasy monologue, and it is not easy to tell which is which.  I guess she couldn't have really done that dance routine, because even a professional Broadway chorine couldn't pick up that choreography instantly.  But what about the stranger who pulls her in the room and starts kissing her? I guess this one really happened, because she talks about it later. When she reverses the action later, with DeVito, I guess it did NOT happen, based upon other incidents in the movie. All in all, I'm not sure what did and didn't happen. Did she really go to that meeting and throw oranges at her husband, or was it another fantasy?The final weakness was the ex-husband, who was a cartoon character in an otherwise honest movie.

Some of the dialogue was spectacular 1. When Garrison is arguing against the theory that JFK was assassinated by the maffia; 2. When he battles with his wife over the importance of his work in order to make the country a better place in which his children can grow up; and 3. His presentation during the trial.

I found the film In the Name of the Father as an appropriate example, unlike JFK, of overstatement - of how pedantic shoving it down your throat style weakens rather than strengthens the film's message. The fact that one of the most respected and loved world leaders in history was assassinated and no-one knows by whom and why makes it impossible to over-state the drama.
