Multiple aspects of drugs were covered, the dealer who isn't addicted, those addicted to illegal drugs, and the less emphasized in our society, addiction to prescription drugs. The 1st act introduces the characters, establishes what's going on, and introduces the conflict. Act 2 has the characters finding temporary solutions to their problems, until things get worse. Act 3 has the characters taking drastic measures to try and overcome but end up taking huge losses. The realism of the situations and excellent performances make this movie hit close to home whether you can relate or not. Having had friends who've spiraled out of control due to drug addiction, I know what can happen when people lose control to substance abuse. Ellen Burstyn's performance was was exceptional, you can feel her loneliness and angst right through the screen. The montage near the end depicting the descent to the very rock bottom for the characters was a thing of beauty. The camera work was excellent, POV shots, frame shots, hand-held, it all worked seamlessly to bring out the emotions. Definitely not a movie for the weak at heart, but a must see for anyone who likes movies that make you think and feel.

The comedic timing of all the actors was right on and the movie, though it was kind of making fun of, for some, real high school experiences, managed to do so without condescending or, IMO, pandering (too much). What we have are 2 young women, 10 years after graduating high school, who seem to really have gone nowhere. But for them, until they learn about the reunion, that's just fine. They somehow manage to survive and are enjoying their lives and are truly happy. Of course they are just 28 so one must keep that point in mind. Still plenty of time to figure out one's life. The story then revolves around them learning about their 10-year high school reunion and they want to go, but Romy, who on the surface seems to be the smarter of the 2, wants to do so but make an impression by showing the A List group that they are now successful. Each of us has been in one of those groups, though called something different depending on your generation, but the premise is the same whether one attended high school in the 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s (even the 90s). There are always those kids who are the most popular and some of them are some of the biggest bullies on campus, making life for everyone else miserable. The geeks and nerds (who usually are the ones who head off to get graduate degrees and thus making some decent money and become very successful). The artsy group. The loners and others that just do not fit into any group, thus make their own groups, such as what Romy and Michelle did. So the 2 end up going to the reunion, and have come up with a story about how they have become successful, though in the process end up having a huge fight about it. Probably because in their hearts they know this is wrong, and after they have been exposed they realize that being a fake gets you nowhere, and as they learn, the worse thing that can ever happen is to lose one's best friend. Everyone should just be who they are, and this includes those snotty I think I am better than everyone else group. Thankfully, most of those people grow up and realize they were awful. Of course, this is Hollywood and we must have a happy ending with the villains getting their due, which happens of course, and in a quite clever way I might add, and we end the movie with our 2 ditsy blondes actually becoming successful. The moral of the story could be, What goes around comes around. Check it out for an afternoon of easy entertainment.

What is impressive is that the action and intensity never let up and the stakes just keep getting higher and higher until the ultimate climax, and even then it keeps going. Thankfully hardly any clichés get in the way to spoil it.Peterson's direction helps bring the action to life, but also the characters, and none more so than Oldman's Korshunov, who is a true joy to watch. Like Alan Rickman in Die Hard, Oldman masters the foreign accent and creates that essence of control and evil, matched well by Ford who delivers another exciting action character.Without these characters, the plot would not have been as exciting or intriguing, and is a credit to Ford and Oldman. Glenn Close (Dangerous Liaisons) also delivers a good character as the Vice President.If you find the thriller genre hard to digest in terms of realism, you can take comfort in the acting and the characters but ultimately, this is a top notch exciting thriller.

Opening the film, a closeup from within a bar of Frankie looking in through the window, already tells us to the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will grasp. Pulled in the direction of increasingly slighter spaces, the film shuts itself off, as the local gangster's long-drawn-out poker game shuts itself from the daylight, bolts itself in, as Sinatra's Frankie Machine has himself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of his harrowing struggle to overcome his habit. In delving into the shapes and faces of its jazzy urban haven, the visual traffic in The Man with the Golden Arm characterizes skewed psychological circumstances, forming an overpowering environment, as maintained by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of Frankie's eyes.The grace of this fiery drama, striking as early as the exciting opening crane shot, displays the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows. The wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place with no beginnings or ends, an indeterminate state, the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this skid row seems to before being gentrified or leveled. The flair of certain performances, particularly Robert Strauss's as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's trusty four-eyed lapdog, becomes this fiery surreal feature pleasingly. The premise of drug addiction, Sinatra's powerhouse performance, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, forceful jazz score and Saul Bass's famous, influential and controversial opening sequence centering on the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm ensured that, in its era, The Man with the Golden Arm presses forward upon the cause for realism in the still reticent Hollywood. It is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but its intent, its force and its spirit are much closer to home.What absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film. It has the illegal card games, short cons, the fights, the guns, the double-crosses, characters on the lam, a femme fatale, a stunningly sexy gun moll, the shady nightclubs and urban landscape, but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment. Really, it is the perfect environment, and genre, in which to tell this story, a crime-ridden urban borough where it's all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two, or three, or four, or drugs, a transient dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could bid.

Most are made for TV and decidedly crummy, for starters, but seeing as they are also as predictable as your average Nativity play, there is no attraction in watching it in the first place unless endless stories of how odds are overcome are your thing. You'd think, therefore, that Erin Brockovich is not what I would consider a good movie and you'd be right. But like that other great true-life movie, Alive, this is one film which has rock-solid performances from the leads and an almost documentary feel to it. But after being paid $20 million for her appearance, I'd expect nothing less from Julia Roberts.Roberts plays our erstwhile heroine who has reached the bottom of the barrel. Struggling with her three kids and no man to help her, she even fails to win suitable compensation after being involved in a car crash. Desperate but determined, she forces herself into the employ of her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but with her foul language and slutty clothes, she can't help but make the wrong impression. But after stumbling across what appears to be an administrative mistake, Erin's curiosity gets the better of her and she soon uncovers a huge hushed-up industrial accident by Pacific Gas & Electric which polluted the water supply of a nearby town to such a degree that it causes a variety of life-threatening conditions in the townsfolk. Enraged, Erin and Ed decide to take on the corporate giants with the help of the townspeople but sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always the easiest thing.There can be few who'd argue that Roberts didn't deserve her Oscar - watching the extras on the DVD, you can see what a great job she did of portraying Ms Brockovich. But the actor who impressed me the most is Finney, giving the sort of performance that has me scratching my head wondering why Hollywood isn't using him more often. He is faultless and together with Roberts, they dominate the picture with the ease of two professionals at the top of their game. By contrast, Aaron Eckhart (who's no amateur either) looks flat and almost uninterested in proceedings as Erin's biker boyfriend George. And however well publicised the story has been, you still can't quite believe that it all actually happened. It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing Erin Brockovich an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or Training Day are pretty much as good as you're going to get.

It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing Erin Brockovich an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or Training Day are pretty much as good as you're going to get.

Although it does gleam underneath its fairly average acting like the beautifully and original storyline that has probably influenced other music orientated film apart that aren't musicals. Although the acting was average Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup stole the show. Frances McDormand is amazing and well-cast as Elaine the Mom, someone so wrapped up in creating a safe, healthy environment she drives both her children far away from home. Billy Crudup & Kate Hudson create the tension filled romance that drives the story along; both did a great job & were adroitly evocative of those fast times in the rock & roll fantasy land of the 70's. Billy, as Russell Hammond, teeters on the edge of fame, not wanting to leave his long-suffering band mates behind. He carries William through the whirlwind of emotions and music along with him, showing him a world that is desperate and lonely. The dialogue is slightly memorable such as 'You are home.'

I was disappointed about the ending but at least everything was sweet and perfect the film had quite a dark side that evaporated after Russell lying to Rolling Stone about what really happened. But Lanes dream comes true 'One flight to Morocco please.' And forgetting her glasses was a great scene the framing and shot angle.

Unfortunately, it feels more like a bad parody. And while Burton's Batmans were visual masterpieces with a soundtrack to match and an uncanny intense feel to them that kept you glued to the screen, Schumacher's go at it is shallow and uninspired both visually (the city, the way it's directed, everything) and music-wise, and makes you think your time would be better spent doing something else.Also, despite numerous quite respected and popular actors, the acting just feels off. It's probably just due to the whole trying-to-be-funny- but-is-not-even-close thing that's going on. I've never been a fan of Jim Carrey, his performances are too often one-trick ponies, and that can be said of this one. Even worse, there's nothing about Jones as Two- Face that would be any better. And that's not even the end of it - I just don't feel the chemistry between Kidman and Kilmer. The romances weren't the strong part of the earlier movies either, but when nothing else works (hell, even the new Batsuit sucks), one would hope that even this one thing would've. Kilmer comes out as more of a Playbat than Batman, and more Kidman as a pushy vixen, though thankfully less so as the movie progresses.The whole dark fairy-tale kind of feel was what made Burton's Batmans as good as they were.

I like the inventive and fitting camera work that supports the messages and lends more power to the film. I also like the sound design, which especially in the beginning often has a dazzling effect, in combination with the cinematography, like, when the camera closes in on the ventilator.It's the kind of film with symbolism that doesn't get much appreciation from the art-house crowd (you know you're one of them, don't lie to yourself), since it could be dangerous to acknowledge the symbolism in a film that is easy to understand for everyone, with characters that are emotionally engaging. People could falsely believe that you like it for those reasons, which could lead them to doubt your intellectualism.In the film things are often told twice in two different ways. Usually within a few minutes, in the same scene or in two successive scenes. Like in the scene when Luke bursts out Get out there yourself. Stop feedin' off me. Get out of here. I can't breathe. Give me some air. Oh, how right Luke was when he yelled those words to his fellow inmates. A few minutes later they are literally feeding off of his plate when he has to clear his plate but apparently has no appetite, putting this line into a completely different (more positive) light.Notably, the initiator for him to yell those lines is that when they show him his picture with the two women, they don't want to believe him when he says it was staged. The movie closes with this very picture. To me this said that we, the audience, have fed off of him.

I was not disappointed. The action started almost immediately and keeps up throughout the film till the climactic light sabre battle. We are also introduced to the new interesting characters Yoda, Lando and the Emperor himself.As the film begins the rebels are on the run, hiding on the barren ice planet of Hoth and the empire is dispatching droids to search the galaxy for them. One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits, Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han, Chewie, Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda, of course it turns out that he is Yoda, after some persuasion he begins to train Luke. Meanwhile back on the Falcon things aren't going according to plan; when ambushed by imperial star destroyers they discover that the hyper-drive isn't working so must hide in a dangerous asteroid field. Flying into cave on one of the larger asteroids the attacked by strange creatures that feed on the ships power cables, when they go outside to remove them they discover that the cave itself isn't what they thought it to be so must flee once more into the path of the imperial forces. Being a crafty pilot Han manages to escape from them but is pursued by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.Needing repairs they head to Cloud City in the nearby Bespin system. Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help, despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels.

That's because I think it scores so highly due to its impact when it was released and innovation, though today the movie seems, to me, flawed but interesting.Dustin Hoffman stars in one of his earliest films as a young college graduate who is extremely insecure and adrift emotionally. Into this aimlessness comes the very seductive friend of the family, Mrs. Robinson, who does practically everything a woman can do to seduce him. Eventually, Hoffman takes the forbidden fruit and begins an affair that is based only on sex. Heck, even after they become intimate, he continues calling her Mrs. Robinson and this continues for several months.Later, when the Robinsons' daughter (played by Katharine Ross) comes home from college to visit her parents, Hoffman is encouraged by all (except, of course, Mrs. Robinson) to date Ross. Despite only going on one date, Hoffman falls hopelessly in love and naturally chaos ensues when the truth is revealed.The film is very creative in many ways, such as with its sexual imagery and creative film shots. Examples are the creative cutting of scenes as well as images of the womb and several phallic references--all done in a rather subtle manner. I really liked how Hoffman's mother was deliberately made up to look like Mrs. Robinson--what a great Freudian device. Audiences of the day were obviously very shocked yet intrigued by all this sexual innuendo and blatant disregard for traditional values. Because its very amoral message was such a huge slap in the face of traditions during the same time that society was questioning itself in the 60s, it certainly doesn't seem surprising that the film was one of the biggest hits in film history. However, some creative shots, a very unusual script and the moral questions alone don't make for a movie that deserves to be rated so highly--that is unless the rating is simply for movies that have a huge impact on the film world (which this obviously did).What bothered me was not just that the message was morally questionable (at best) but that some of the movie was actually pretty poor and deserves a re-examination. First, much of the film was filmed like a music video and was perhaps the first film to do this. So, instead of a lot of speaking, often huge portions of the movie were dialog-free and consisted of very loud Simon & Garfunkle songs as montages filled the screen. A little of this went a long way, but the film used this technique repeatedly. Second, and this is by far me biggest complaint, is that the script really has some holes (though considering the film made a bazillion dollars, no one seemed to mind). Hoffman only dates Ross one time and decides to tell about his affair with the mother. While this is hard to believe, when he then stalks Ross incessantly and she finally agrees to marry Hoffman, it just strained believability to the breaking point. After all, she already was engaged to a man she knew very well AND this particular fiancé hadn't had sex with Mrs. Robinson!! Yet we are expected to believe that somehow it all works out in the end?! Overall, a very good and innovative film that comes with a really lousy and completely unbelievable ending. On top of all that (great choice of words), the film is very offensive to many out there--not just because of the sexuality but the way religion seems to be mocked at the end of the film as well as all the swearing. For me, a real mixed bag. I wanted to like it and there was some real creativity here, but 41 years later it really hasn't aged well.

(Other contenders would be Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese). He is able to produce both brilliantly original films quite different to anything else and also brilliant work within the confines of an established genre, an ability he shares with Scorsese and the late Stanley Kubrick. (As for Allen, he has turned the Woody Allen Film into a genre in its own right). Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Truman Show are both, in their different ways, strange and haunting films, different to anything before or since, and two of my favourite films of all time. On the other hand, Dead Poets' Society, another of my favourite films, falls within the conventions of the inspirational teacher film, but is in my view the greatest example of that genre ever made. (Only The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie comes anywhere near it).Witness, his first film made outside Australia, is another example of Weir simultaneously working within an established genre and transcending it. On one level it is a traditional police thriller. While travelling with his mother a young boy named Samuel Lapp witnesses a murder in the washrooms at Philadelphia railway station. It turns out that the murdered man was an undercover police officer, and a homicide detective, John Book, is assigned to the case. Book's investigations lead him to the discovery that the murder was carried out by a narcotics officer named McFee, one of a group of corrupt officers in league with a gang of drug smugglers. Book is forced to go underground for safety, taking Samuel and his mother Rachel with him.On another level the film is a love story, as a romance develops between Book and Rachel, a beautiful young widow. Neither the crime story nor the romance element, however, would by themselves make this film anything out of the ordinary. What makes the film different is the third level, a study of cultural differences. Samuel and Rachel are members of the Amish religious sect, and it is among the Amish that they and Book take refuge while hiding from the villains.It would be easy to see the Amish, as portrayed in this film, as being quaint, even comically reactionary. They speak an archaic German dialect inaccurately known as Pennsylvania Dutch (although some of the lines in the film are in standard modern German). They follow a strict set of rules known as the Ordnung which govern every aspect of their daily lives. They may not own a television or a telephone and may not use electricity in the home. They drive horse-drawn buggies as it is forbidden to own or drive a motor vehicle. They have a strict dress code and are even forbidden to use buttons, regarded as a sign of Hochmut, or pride. Those who violate these rules can be punished by shunning. The Amish habitually refer to all non-Amish Americans, regardless of ethnic background, as the English. (News of the Declaration of Independence clearly has not yet filtered through to them).Yet, eccentric though they may seem to outsiders, Weir shows us that the Amish way of life has many virtues. They have a deep faith in God and believe in the importance of submission to His will. They have a strong sense of community. They are pacifists who are opposed to any violence or the taking of a human life; this article of their creed brings them into conflict with Book, who is required to carry a gun as part of his job and who is ready to use it, or his first, in self-defence or the defence of others. Because of the gulf between their value-systems, the love of Book and Rachel is potentially tragic; they can only be together if she is prepared to leave her world, or if he is prepared to enter it.Surprisingly, this was the film that brought Harrison Ford his only Oscar nomination to date. I say surprisingly, as he has given many other fine performances in films such as Blade Runner, The Fugitive and K-19. Witness, however, remains one of his best films; his Book is tough and uncompromising but decent, and capable of tenderness in the love scenes. Kelly McGillis, in her first major role, is luminously beautiful as Rachel; she was to give another great performance three years later in The Accused, and I have always been surprised that her subsequent career has not been quite as successful. None of her films since 1988 have aroused as much interest as Witness or The Accused, and she has not remained a household name in the same way as some of her contemporaries such as Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer or Jodie Foster.Despite the film's deeper levels of meaning, Weir does not neglect the thriller elements; there are some great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene where Samuel is hiding in the lavatories from the killer, or the final scene where Book confronts the villains who have invaded the Amish community in their search for him. In the scenes seen from Samuel's viewpoint, Weir uses low-angle shots to emphasise the boy's youth and vulnerability. The film, however, also has echoes of other genres, particularly the Western. The final scene has been compared to the climax of High Noon in which Gary Cooper also takes out his enemies one by one. (A similar climax was used in another Western, Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider, also made in 1985). The spectacular barn-raising sequence, accompanied by Maurice Jarre's memorable score, also recalls the Western. With its intelligent script, fine acting and fine direction, Witness can be regarded as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the best police thrillers of all time. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2008","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" If a poll were to be taken on who is the greatest living film director, a strong contender for my vote would be Peter Weir.

With its intelligent script, fine acting and fine direction, Witness can be regarded as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the best police thrillers of all time. 9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 October 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After they die, Adam (Baldwin) and Barbara (Davis) come back to their house as ghosts and find a family is moving in and the couple try to scare them away with help from bio-exorcist Beetlejuice.Tim Burton's reputation as the darkest and most Gothic director started here with a bizarre but wonderfully different tale of the dead and is both funny, and yet psychological scary, and brings a niche to the market in a strange and sophisticated way.The film has a terrific opening with Danny Elfman's score exquisite to the bird's eye view of the town going past and the upbeat music plays right into our hands and will gear you up ready for the horror and excitement to begin.Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) impresses as ambitious Adam and has good on screen chemistry with Geena Davis (Thelma and Louise) and the pair create many laughs and are a joy to watch, especially when playing around with the sheets.Winona Ryder (Girl, interrupted) gives a great performance as Lydia, the weird and wonderful teenager, who gives the film a more serious and realistic feel against Keaton's comic Beetlejuice.The star of the show is Keaton (Batman) who plays bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, a crazed man who is evil, eccentric and enjoyable to watch, because he is weird and different, one of Tim Burton's finest creations, right up there with Edward Scissorhands.

In the style of most propaganda, the characterization is clearcut and uncomplicated so that the audience could unmistakably tell with whom they should identify.In both the Soviet Union and abroad, the film stunned audiences not so much for its political message as for its violence, which was explicit by the standards of the age. The film's capability of having great bearing on political ideas by means of emotional reaction was observed by Joseph Goebbels, who said anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film. This remarkable influence felt and feared by tremendously powerful and influential people is something that never happens in regard to cinema today and hasn't for at least half a century now. Do you know why? Because film is a seminal part of life now. It is a part of the media, and it is easy to overlook one movie in favor of another, or film entirely for another facet of the media, like television. When this picture emerged, it was pure, ripe, brand new, almost surreal to its spectators. Eisenstein's theory of montage has been diluted and adulterated by now to the point where it is either completely ignored or thought of as kindergarten. In 1925, who would have though that a moving picture could provoke such a reaction? Who would have thought it had the capability to change someone who watched it?Now, this film is obsolete. Film-making has advanced too far for this film to have any kind of effect on the contemporary viewer.

She has a unique way of setting up a plot, frequently involving a main character with a flaw or pathology that drives the rest of the action to its inevitable conclusion.Interestingly, in this case, Rendell gives away the big ending AND the motive in the first sentence, and uses the remainder of the book to explain how they are related.

There is something elegant yet subtly sensual in the way Pocahontas moves (or doesn't move). The audience would appreciate the oddly baby-faced John Smith, whom doesn't resemble his real historical counterpart much, but I guess they had to give him a face fit for the role of a heart throb, with our current beauty standards to influence it. (But appearances is too minuet to consider it a major problem).The quality of dialog is comfortable. For the targeted audience, evidently 8-12 year-olds, it is very serious and dramatic. I'll hand it to the movie for having the characters deal with death, war, and discrimination that (while still existent) was clearly heavier during those times.The lesson of the movie is a good and clear one- that when it comes to culture and race, everyone should look past what they see (or what they think they see) and learn about the truths rather than believe the harsh myths about them. It is very important that children, as early as possible, learn that being different doesn't mean being bad. Different is what makes the world fun and interesting.

After writing an extensive report on Pocahontas back in the 5th grade, I was quite uncomfortable (I was in the 7th grade by the time it came out in theatres) The biggest and most obvious inaccuracy is the age of Pocahontas when she first met John Smith. In the movie she appears to be in her adult years, but in actuality she was only twelve. No factual documentation suggests her falling in love with John Smith, and thankfully so because the age gap between her and Smith was far too significant for such a union to be considered. The Disney film, like many others, greatly over exaggerated and romanticized actual history. At least in Pocahontas 2 they got it right when she married John Rolfe (Englishman and Virginia colonist that found success in the cultivation of tobacco.) While in England, she did indeed marry John Rolfe, but by then Ratcliffe had been dead for 3 years, thus being face to face the second time was impossible. Some viewers may be annoyed by Disney's constant need to add silly and magical characters when it comes to telling a story about real people and history to establish a balance in the film for young viewers to keep it from being too 'Scary' and\/or 'Boring', even though Pocahontas's friends (Animal companions Meeko and Flit, and the enchanted tree spirit Grandmother Willow) don't seem to be annoyingly stupid.

I swear that you can always find either this film or The American President on at least one of the basic cable channels at any given time! The film was a huge hit for all involved, and this is a fact that may be a bit troubling.The film deals with Tom Hanks who has just lost his wife moving to Seattle with his young son to start a new life. Why Seattle? Well, this film was made in the early 1990s. Seatte was the trendy place to be back then with its grunge music, coffee houses, flannel shirts and computer companies. Why Hanks & son even move into a trendy kind of hybrid house\/boat that they likely would not have been able to afford unless his wife had a nice insurance policy. At least (as far as I recall) the film spares us with the typical Seattle scene of someone throwing fish to another person at that famous outdoor market. Who knows, maybe they threw a shot of this in there. I don't know if I've ever seen this film completely from start to finish.Anyway, Hanks's son really wants a new mommy for himself and a new wife for his daddy. So he calls up one of those boring national shrink radio shows that nearly sunk AM radio back then before the conservative radio revolution saved it. The kid basically tells his plight to the whole country, and Meg Ryan hears him while driving. She is instantly touched by the kid's plea, and sets out to learn as much as she can about Hanks and the kid with the help of computers, private eyes, you name it. Of course the trouble is, Ryan is already engaged to another man. And this man (Bill Pullman) is one of many annoyingly stereotypical supporting characters. He is written as a meek, and boring individual who suffers from some very exaggerated allergy symptoms which are supposed to be funny. As one who has suffered with allergies of his own, I must inform you dear reader that there is nothing funny about these conditions. Will Meg and Tom end up together???? I wonder.The ridiculous scenes and annoying characters are many in number. The kid who plays Hanks's boy is really annoying. So is his little girlfriend. For a while, Hanks dates a woman whose only character trait of note is that she laughs like a hyena. Other than that, she really doesn't seem that bad, but of course the kid hates her. Oh, and Rosie O'Donnell is in the film. Enough said on that issue. The film isn't a complete loss. Of course most women will love it, and the acting by Hanks and Ryan is pretty good. Ryan was still a hottie back then, before some very cruel plastic surgeon turned her face into something resembling The Joker.Overall, this just isn't my kind of thing. Remember I'm the guy who recently gave 10 stars to Revenge of the Ninja! For those of you whose hearts flutter as Jimmy Durante takes you out into the credits, picture this scenario....

I couldn't care less about the story being told in flashback. This cinematic device is growing increasingly stale and unnecessary. But what makes this movie fascinating is its portrayal of Orton and Halliwell's relationship, which is so real and deep and truthful and profound that Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina, who happen to be two of my favorite actors, playing the two fated writers, might as well be right in your living room as you watch them.Orton and Halliwell's relationship is drawn from its initial stages at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Orton starts out as the inexperienced, amateurish youth to Halliwell's older scholar. As the relationship grows, Orton grows more and more doubtless of his ability while Halliwell's writing languishes. They descend into a twisted caricature of a conventional married couple, with Orton as the husband and Halliwell as the selfless and ever more overlooked and disregarded wife. This could be a state of affairs made worse by Orton's incapability or reluctance, in 1960s England, to accept having a male life partner. Maybe, maybe not.The circumstance and descent of their relationship is heartbreaking, but what impresses me the most is the portrayal in and of itself, in the writing, in the acting. Joe Orton is an insatiable, fun-loving bottom boy with an artistic streak and from the start, he is most concerned with self-preservation, pleasure, materiality and substance. Without any self- doubt or feeling, Orton is inclined to exploit whoever would give him a leg up to a life of notoriety and privilege. When quiet, intellectual Halliwell endeavors to cultivate him, Orton takes advantage and Halliwell grows more compliant and eager to be immersed in the depths of his growing love for him.Halliwell alludes to childhood, which he gives the impression of being less pivotal than it really was for him, having been disregarded by his father and coddled dearly by his mother. His mother's death when he was a young boy was surely an immensely damaging turning point in his life, as when his father committed suicide, he came downstairs and put the kettle on, got dressed and called an ambulance, in that order. He gives to the deficit of his mother in the natural way he lives his life, seldom enforcing his will save for his impressively rare breaking points, but operating by going with the flow of his innate emotions. He is inclined to travel the wave of his feelings for Orton, unable to help his protective, nurturing nature from integrating itself into Orton's life, even if it provides Orton with a convenient safety net and Halliwell himself with never-ending jealousy, disdain and longing for affection of any kind.Prick Up Your Ears was to be the title of one of Orton's plays. The name was suggested by Halliwell who had provided much of Orton's titles all through the successful portion of his career. The cruelty of Orton's aloofness is infuriating, and the effect it had on the outsized emotional state of Halliwell is widely known, and demonstrated at the very beginning of the movie. Orton seemed only ever concerned with the quality of his own existence and seemed to an almost surreal extent to lack feeling.There is no true way of knowing how Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina interpreted these roles, how different they are from my interpretation and how similar they, or Alan Bennett's astute screenplay, are to the real people. Nevertheless, they deliver profound performances.
