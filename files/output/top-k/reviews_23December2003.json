Carrey truly portrays the funny but ultimately tragic figure with a sensitivity to the audience which makes you both hate him & love him. This seems to be true of Kaufmans real friends also. Formans direction is wonderful something we must come to exoect from the genius who brought us  One who flew over... It was also nice to see the old TAXI characters and cast return for an on screen reunion. REM's soundtrack add flavour to the score not only with the magnificent MAN on The Moon but the Great Beyond track are fantastic. Well done all round.

I'm a great fan of him; his facial expressions are very good. And what did they do to him in this film, they covered up his face, they wasted the best bit.There were a few jokes in the film, but don't expect too much; it's really a film for young children. Don't watch it as a Jim Carrey fan because you will be disappointed.5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 December 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The only thing I knew about the film was that Jim Carrey is in it.
