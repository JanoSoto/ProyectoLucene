And the middle part of the story, where the film turns into a wacky buddy movie about a Guy and his kid cruising the countryside robbing banks, really drains the emotion from the film even more.On its own it was a good movie.

I believe that Minority Report,is  why, because of the plot. Blade Runner focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about Blade Runner is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. Minority Report is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to Metropolis(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.Blade Runner, Dark City, and The Fifth Element would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's Metropolis.THE PLOTIn The Year 2054, a so-called pre-crime division is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time  that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future  murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****The film examines the political and ethical  dilemma of arresting a person before the  crime is committed.  The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If  the people vote it in as law  the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.When John's son was murdered he joined the precog division and worked tirelessly to catch and imprison all murderers. One day, his name arrives in the perpetrator chute. The precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. John flees the division, his own colleagues after him, to solve this situation as his trust in the system diminishes rapidly.  John follows a very small clue  that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called minority report,  which is a documentation of one of the rare events when on of the  precogs sees something different than the other two.THE DIRECTINGThere's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray  a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the Taxi Driver shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.THE ACTORSSamantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown. Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in Vanilla Sky, shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for Magnolia and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, Born on The Forth of July, Jerry Maguire and Magnolia. Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.There is a mental love story portrayed  between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.FAVORITE SCENEMy favorite scene is when Agatha helps John get away from the cops in the mall. This scene is like a puzzle coming together right before your eyes. She tells him to pick up an umbrella, then they pass a woman who recognizes him from police alerts and Agatha tells him that a man is carrying a briefcase  that has a magazine in it about him.Finally she tell him to stop and wait for the man who is selling balloons in the mall and when he does, the balloons block them both from being seen by the police. When they exit the mall the reason she asked for an umbrella becomes clear. It is raining and when they raise their umbrella they are indistinguishable in a crowd of hundreds of people with umbrellas.BEST ACTION SEQUENCEThe best action sequence is when John takes the police on a rollercoaster ride of evasion in the neighborhood.SCENE WITH A MESSAGE The scene where John almost lost his eyes is a message that he is blind to his emotions and does not see the big picture. The scene is really funny and sick but it does convey this message.In the end I find that Spielberg is still in his Kubrick stage. Spielberg ends the film with a happy ending, but the film is still very dark. I quote Steven from an interview  I have to tap into my dark side to truly create a dark film. Believe me he has. I love this movie. Ridley Scott eat your heart out.I haven't found any mistakes in this film and  I definitely recommend this film to movie goers everywhere.

IMHO that title is reserved for Mike Myers. That being said, the latest Austin Powers offering is not the sterling example of comic hilarity that the first two were. I absolutely adored Austin Powers 1 and 2, but 3, while having some funny moments, lacked any of the big belly laughs and ultra hilarious moments that the first two had. Why is this? The answer is obvious. Myers was actually TRYING to make a film that tied up the first two and made it a trilogy, and sacrificed a lot of spontanaiety in the creative process. His fourth character in the series, Goldmember, is entirely unfunny and serves no purpose. That thing about him eating his own skin was pointless and grosser than any fat bastard floater joke. Speaking of FB, he's one of my favorite characters from the second film, but here it's obvious he's being added just to tie things up. He serves no purpose whatsoever, though he still gave me a few good chuckles.Meanwhile, Austin Powers himself has moved back to take a supporting character status in the last two films. The first one was about Austin's being a fish out of water in a new era, but after that, the real star of the films has always been Dr. Evil. The formerly hilarious supporting cast of Robert Wagner and Mindi Sterling are incidental in the film, and Scott Evil gets to develop, but loses the original intent behind his character. Beyonce Knowles is unfunny and untalented, and Fred Savage has never been funny. There have been comment made that this film seems completely disjointed, just randomness thrown together, and I echo that statement completely. The film wanders all over the place in an attempt to tie up all the loose ends in the films. What is forgotten is that there really isn't a need for such a thing in this kind of comedy. In Star Wars, maybe, but not Austin Powers.Still, there are funny moments in the film, ranging from Dr. Evil's revelation about his true connection to Austin (I'm Dougie!) to Mini-Me's scene stealing as a double agent and becoming mini-Austin to Dr. Evil's It's A Hard Knock Life performance, to Fat Bastard's scenes, there is humour evident. Funnily enough, the superstar cameos at the beginning did little for me, other than the Speilberg moments with Austin (check out Speilberg's double hand springing away from his seat as the opening music hits, that was the funniest part for me). Tom Cruise and Paltrow left me cold, while Kevin Spacey and Devito were funny, it was so short it didn't really entertain me. Britney Spears was entirely unfunny and unentertaining in her short appearance. Like everything else about the pop diva, her appearance was cold, calculated, and entirely manufactured to do one thing maintain her cool factor and not entertain. Actually, the funniest cameo IMHO was by Nathan Lane, who never says an actual word.All in all, it has it's moments, but compared to the hilarity offered by the first two films, it pales in comparison. I'm not worried, though, Myers has loads of untapped talent and I'm sure he has yet another batch of characters ready to amuse us with. Sadly, the Austin Powers era seems to be over.

IMHO that title is reserved for Mike Myers. That being said, the latest Austin Powers offering is not the sterling example of comic hilarity that the first two were. I absolutely adored Austin Powers 1 and 2, but 3, while having some funny moments, lacked any of the big belly laughs and ultra hilarious moments that the first two had. Why is this? The answer is obvious. Myers was actually TRYING to make a film that tied up the first two and made it a trilogy, and sacrificed a lot of spontanaiety in the creative process. His fourth character in the series, Goldmember, is entirely unfunny and serves no purpose. That thing about him eating his own skin was pointless and grosser than any fat bastard floater joke. Speaking of FB, he's one of my favorite characters from the second film, but here it's obvious he's being added just to tie things up. He serves no purpose whatsoever, though he still gave me a few good chuckles.Meanwhile, Austin Powers himself has moved back to take a supporting character status in the last two films. The first one was about Austin's being a fish out of water in a new era, but after that, the real star of the films has always been Dr. Evil. The formerly hilarious supporting cast of Robert Wagner and Mindi Sterling are incidental in the film, and Scott Evil gets to develop, but loses the original intent behind his character. Beyonce Knowles is unfunny and untalented, and Fred Savage has never been funny. There have been comment made that this film seems completely disjointed, just randomness thrown together, and I echo that statement completely. The film wanders all over the place in an attempt to tie up all the loose ends in the films. What is forgotten is that there really isn't a need for such a thing in this kind of comedy. In Star Wars, maybe, but not Austin Powers.Still, there are funny moments in the film, ranging from Dr. Evil's revelation about his true connection to Austin (I'm Dougie!) to Mini-Me's scene stealing as a double agent and becoming mini-Austin to Dr. Evil's It's A Hard Knock Life performance, to Fat Bastard's scenes, there is humour evident. Funnily enough, the superstar cameos at the beginning did little for me, other than the Speilberg moments with Austin (check out Speilberg's double hand springing away from his seat as the opening music hits, that was the funniest part for me). Tom Cruise and Paltrow left me cold, while Kevin Spacey and Devito were funny, it was so short it didn't really entertain me. Britney Spears was entirely unfunny and unentertaining in her short appearance. Like everything else about the pop diva, her appearance was cold, calculated, and entirely manufactured to do one thing maintain her cool factor and not entertain. Actually, the funniest cameo IMHO was by Nathan Lane, who never says an actual word.All in all, it has it's moments, but compared to the hilarity offered by the first two films, it pales in comparison. I'm not worried, though, Myers has loads of untapped talent and I'm sure he has yet another batch of characters ready to amuse us with. Sadly, the Austin Powers era seems to be over. ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"6 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Last night I went and saw Minority Report. Usually in Steven Speilberg films, Nazi storm troopers are the villains and are practically stick figures. Minority Report was a relief from Speilbergs tendency to over glamorize WWII. I find it unbelievable that I rank Minority Report equal to Truman Story and the In the Company of Men. Two of which are the greatest flicks out of America in the 1990's. Minority Report reminded me of the Restoration of Touch of Evil and a film noir update of The Fugitive. Minority Report harkens back to Hitchcock and even Tom Sellecks 1980's futuresque flick Run. When Tom Cruise was communicating with his late son via new technology, I saw fabric of Charlten Heston's Omega Man. Seeing technology become ubiquitious and human kind become subservient gives us a peek into Brave New World. If Minority Report was book written 50 years ago, it would rank as a classic.  I cringe everytime I see Hollywood promoting a WWII movie. What we need to do now is see more movies where new technology is the avenue for multinationals bringing in a dictatorship. We need to warn this generation that if you forget your past, you repeat it. Literature is a visual. Movies like Minority Report are the visual that will act as an admonishment against complacency and narcism that ensconses the western world. We need more movies like Minority Report to galvanize us and make us aware what politicians and multinationals are doing now. Good job, Steven!
