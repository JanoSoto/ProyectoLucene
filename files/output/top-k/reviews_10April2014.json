Even in his latest big budget film, Noah, his unique and creative voice shined through. Just like his characters, Aronofsky seems obsessed with discovering what drives them. His films are a psychological character study in which he delves deep into their minds in order to try to discover what leads them to their self destructive behavior. In the surface, Pi may sound like a boring film dealing with math and numbers, but Aronofsky sucks you in from the beginning with his very unique style of film making including some crazy chase scenes shown in fast motion and a strange soundtrack. The cinematography in dirty black and white sets the tone of the film as well, although I didn't find it quite engaging. It's amazing what Aronofsky did with such a low budget and it won him special recognition. He won for best director in Sundance in 1998 and an Independent Spirit Award for his first screenplay. He also proved Pi was no one hit wonder as his following films were all received with warm praise by the critics. Aronfofsky's unique personal vision is reflected in each one of his films and if you go back to Pi you will find several similarities and trademarks that were already established from the beginning. If Pi were my first film from Aronofsky I might have enjoyed it even more, but I think he has perfected his craft in films like Black Swan and The Wrestler.The screenplay written by Darren Aronofsky and Sean Gullette centers on a mathematical genius named Max (Sean Gullette). He's a number theorist who believes that nature can be explained through numbers and that there are patterns that can emerge from it. He is working on discovering these pattern through the stock market and considering all the variables involved. He works in his home through a homemade computer he has developed. He locks himself in his small apartment and becomes obsessed with discovering these patterns while also worrying that people are spying on him. He suffers from terrible headaches that sometimes lead him to delusions so he is currently on medication and at times its hard to decipher if he is really seeing things or imagining them. One of the few people Max interacts with is Sol (Mark Margolis) who is his former math mentor. He worries about Max's obsession and asks him to take a break, but Max is determined to discover the pattern that could unlock the mysteries of nature. The other person who Max interacts with is Lenny (Ben Shenkman), a Jew who is currently working on the numbers from the Torah. As Max becomes more and more obsessed with unlocking these numbers the crazier things get for him.I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that I knew where it was heading. Although his characters are very different in every film the resolution is very similar and the ending is always open ended for the audience to interpret. Pi marked the beginning of Aronofsky's love affair with Mark Margolis who has been in every one of his film as a secondary character. He was the only face I recognized in this film as I was unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. Sean Gullette gives a very convincing lead performance but the rest of the cast aren't as great. You could tell Aronofsky had a very limited budget to work with, but he did marvels with it. Pi is a clever film with some memorable scenes. I never thought a film about math and numbers could be so thrilling, but it is because Aronofsky manages to put the character in the center and turns it into a psychological character study.

I don't consider this movie to be the atrocity that many say it is, but it certainly is a major disappointment in every way. They had the potential to give Freddy a major send-off that people would never forget. I've never understood why they didn't bring back Alice (Lisa Wilcox) from parts 4\/5. She had a son named Jacob in the fifth movie, why not continue that storyline? This could have been the send-off Freddy fans deserved, but Rachel Talalay made sure that didn't happen. She is a big part of the problem. She has a lack of experience and it shows. Like the 4th and 5th sequel, this movie fails to find the proper medium between comedy and horror. This series was beginning to wear out its welcome at this juncture and a proper follow-up would have been ideal. This was not only an insult to Freddy's legacy, but the fans as well. How could you show so much contempt from such a die-hard fan base? As much as I love Robert Englund, he started getting bigger than the movie themselves in the 3rd movie. As a result, the quality went down and the character development was nowhere near as strong. They got into the bad habit of having a penchant to make money with little effort as possible. You want an example? There is a dream scene with Spencer (Breckin Meyer) , where Freddy plays video games (What do you know? Beat my high score! I have to admit I love that line) The point is that this sort of thing doesn't belong in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The storyline of Who is Freddy's kid had all the potential in the world to be something special, but it was done in a half-assed way. They try to be clever by pulling a stunt from Psycho with the lead male character, but it wound up hurting the movie more than anything else. The gore is average. we get self-lacerations, a cut off ear, but the highlights are an impaling on spikes and a body exploding in half. We get the same desecrated house that started in Nightmare on Elm Street III Dream Warriors, but you're telling me you couldn't get the original house back? This was supposed to be the final chapter, laziness is not acceptable. I can't forget the lame 3D at the end either. Trust me. The 3D glasses don't make much of a difference. The acting ranges from solid to mediocre. Lisa Zane is somewhat wooden as the heroine. She goes from an afterthought to the main character in the second half and I didn't buy it. It was shoddily written. Another dimension to her character would have been nice. She had too many off moments for my liking. Believe it or not, her storyline had potential as well. It all ended very anti-climatically and half-baked. Robert Englund is fun as usual, but far too comedic at times. His one-liners are awful in this one. ('I'll get you my pretty and your little soul, too!) (Nice hearing from you Carlos!) I love Freddy when he's funny, but not completely funny. A balance of both is essential. He is human in this film at times as well. That's another storyline they failed to capitalize on. Shon Greenblat is decent as John Doe, but we don't know enough about him. It would have been nice to know where he came from and who he was. Lezlie Deane is one of the most annoying horror characters I have ever seen. It's not her fault, just the way she is written. Her abrasive character does her no favors, nor does her Karate shtick either. How the hell did she get to survive? Her phony tough act grated my nerves a LOT. Breckin Meyer is fun as a stoner, while Rickey Dean Logan is solid as Carlos. Yaphett Kotto's role is completely out-of-place in this movie. He felt painfully awkward as the Doc. We get some horrible cameos from Alice Cooper, Rosanne & Tom Arnold. I did enjoy Johnny Depp's cameo though. It's a sad day when Freddy is defeated by Ninja stars and other lame weapons. I don't hate this movie, but it angers me at the same time. When it comes to final chapters you should do everything possible to reward your loyal fans. They failed to do that in this movie. There were a few story lines that had the ability to be riveting, but it failed in all of them. This sequel can be brainless entertainment if you turn your brain off, but it's not a good movie. After all the trouble of promoting this as Freddy's last hurrah, Freddy got the send off he deserved with New Nightmare As much as I enjoy it, I don't count Freddy Vs Jason. 5.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2014","score":"","review":" I own this movie because I love this series..

As a result, the quality went down and the character development was nowhere near as strong. They got into the bad habit of having a penchant to make money with little effort as possible. You want an example? There is a dream scene with Spencer (Breckin Meyer) , where Freddy plays video games (What do you know? Beat my high score! I have to admit I love that line) The point is that this sort of thing doesn't belong in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The storyline of Who is Freddy's kid had all the potential in the world to be something special, but it was done in a half-assed way. They try to be clever by pulling a stunt from Psycho with the lead male character, but it wound up hurting the movie more than anything else. The gore is average. we get self-lacerations, a cut off ear, but the highlights are an impaling on spikes and a body exploding in half. We get the same desecrated house that started in Nightmare on Elm Street III Dream Warriors, but you're telling me you couldn't get the original house back? This was supposed to be the final chapter, laziness is not acceptable. I can't forget the lame 3D at the end either. Trust me. The 3D glasses don't make much of a difference. The acting ranges from solid to mediocre. Lisa Zane is somewhat wooden as the heroine. She goes from an afterthought to the main character in the second half and I didn't buy it. It was shoddily written. Another dimension to her character would have been nice. She had too many off moments for my liking. Believe it or not, her storyline had potential as well. It all ended very anti-climatically and half-baked. Robert Englund is fun as usual, but far too comedic at times. His one-liners are awful in this one. ('I'll get you my pretty and your little soul, too!) (Nice hearing from you Carlos!) I love Freddy when he's funny, but not completely funny. A balance of both is essential. He is human in this film at times as well. That's another storyline they failed to capitalize on. Shon Greenblat is decent as John Doe, but we don't know enough about him. It would have been nice to know where he came from and who he was. Lezlie Deane is one of the most annoying horror characters I have ever seen. It's not her fault, just the way she is written. Her abrasive character does her no favors, nor does her Karate shtick either. How the hell did she get to survive? Her phony tough act grated my nerves a LOT. Breckin Meyer is fun as a stoner, while Rickey Dean Logan is solid as Carlos. Yaphett Kotto's role is completely out-of-place in this movie. He felt painfully awkward as the Doc. We get some horrible cameos from Alice Cooper, Rosanne & Tom Arnold. I did enjoy Johnny Depp's cameo though. It's a sad day when Freddy is defeated by Ninja stars and other lame weapons. I don't hate this movie, but it angers me at the same time. When it comes to final chapters you should do everything possible to reward your loyal fans. They failed to do that in this movie. There were a few story lines that had the ability to be riveting, but it failed in all of them. This sequel can be brainless entertainment if you turn your brain off, but it's not a good movie.

Mediocre or not, I've seen all of them countless times, this one included. I don't consider this movie to be the atrocity that many say it is, but it certainly is a major disappointment in every way. They had the potential to give Freddy a major send-off that people would never forget. I've never understood why they didn't bring back Alice (Lisa Wilcox) from parts 4\/5. She had a son named Jacob in the fifth movie, why not continue that storyline? This could have been the send-off Freddy fans deserved, but Rachel Talalay made sure that didn't happen. She is a big part of the problem. She has a lack of experience and it shows. Like the 4th and 5th sequel, this movie fails to find the proper medium between comedy and horror.

When his crew is moved up from Apollo 14 to 13, his wife asks, Why does it have to be 13? Because it follows 12, he replies. Lovell is funny, smart and a good leader. He was a step ahead of mission control and always had his crew working ahead of mission director's requests.

Bringing the sexy and sexually unfulfilled wife, (Unger) into the group, could be an answer to their dry spell of a sex time. Wild card actor, Koteas, one of my favourite thespians, is flawlessly cast as, Vaughn, an adrenaline junkie driver, one of the very scarred, while also working as a doctor, who lives in his car. His wild rage exit at the end is smashingly great. One scene has him picking up a woman at the airport. He has sex with her, a sort of menais de trois, with out the third, a stiff driving Spader. A funny scene, has crippled Arguette, another of the group, trying out this new car, or more correctly, trying to see if she can find a perfectly designed car, fit for a perfectly designed body, while tearing up the upholstery, where Spader in the background, is trying to suppress his amusement. The best bit of Crash, of course, is the re-enactment of the James Dean car crash, truly authentic, these supposed stunt guys not mucking around, Vaughn, of course sitting in the drivers seat of the late great film star, while observers of the group watch from a stadium.

While there are many points throughout the movie where Porter comes across quite mean and almost heartless, you can't help but end up cheering for him by the end of the movie. Porter even comes across as quite caring at points...in a violent, tough way though of course! All the actors in this do a pretty decent job with their roles. Gregg Henry comes across quite scummy as a selfish, sadistic member of the Outfit, and Maria Bello is quite intriguing and attractive as the almost classy prostitute. Ultimately though Mel Gibson steals the show in this movie with his cool narrative, and his unflinching resolve to take down the bad guys.If you're a fan of movies like The Crow, Man on Fire, Taken, or Die Hard; or you like Film Noir or old Gangster movies; or if you just want to see Mel Gibson own a bunch of people...this is the movie for you!

It continues off and on until college. The only problem is that both are in a relationship and they have contrasting personalities. Jennifer is funny, perceptive, wise, and beautiful. Ryan is an uptight mess that doesn't like to be out of his comfort zone. After a while, they become great friends. Things get a bit complicated when they develop feelings for each other. I saw this when it first came out years ago, strangely enough, I remember digging it. That is far from the case this time around. I was never bored, but it's one of the disingenuous romantic comedies I've seen in some time. Nothing in this movie felt genuine at all, despite the potential to be so. Right off the bat, we get conversations about orgasms and periods. When a romantic comedy pulls out all the stops in the beginning to try to get cheap laughs, you know you're in trouble. It tries to be clever and perceptive about the pratfalls of relationships to no avail. Despite the lame start, this movie did have potential to be a decent romantic comedy. It doesn't have the cast or the script to pull it off. It's also filled with unfunny slapstick that produces more groans than anything else. The only scene I laughed at is when Jason Biggs fakes being a priest and has a pool ball incident at a bar. That almost had me in stitches. The main problem is that I had trouble empathizing with any of the characters. All of them are rather obnoxious except for Biggs. Freddie Prinze Jr is a good guy in real life, but acting should have never been in his calling. His wooden style is painfully obvious. He lacks chemistry with Forlani and really brought the film down. Claire Forlani fares better and has the charm to spare. She's also gorgeous, but I felt her character was quite pretentious.
