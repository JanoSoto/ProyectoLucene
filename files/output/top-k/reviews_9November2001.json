Hey growing up in that era we always watched movies with Andrew McCarthy,James Spader and the sexy Jami Gertz. Although I would say this has to be Gertz' worst acting, although I think she is portraying an airheaded rich kid here. Lost Boys and Renegades were her best. Seems after Twister her star just sort of vanished. Under rated actress by far.Anyhow McCarthy actually is good in this, finally he gets a main character in a film instead of a role shadowed from those other brat packers he always seemed to be following from movie to movie. He plays a preppie rich kid without the attitude and is the friend who cares about his long time friends. James Spader, unlike others, I have always liked. Seems he just never got that big break ever but he is under rated in my view. He play the rich drug dealer prick and like in Pretty In Pink, plays it well. And then there's Robert Downey Jr. He plays, no pun intended here, a drug addicted rich spoiled brat who owes big cash to Spader for the drugs. His family won't bother giving him handouts anymore and so he ends up doing, well watch it for his character. Seems Downey Jr plays this role PERFECT. Sad to see him end up as one in real life. Basically if you like the 80's brat pack flicks that all of us in our late 20's to 30's grew up watching, rent it for sure. I'm sure it will make you remember all those party days in your high school\/college years and this flick is definitely not boring. The end is quite sad and it will show you that no matter what friends go through, the true ones will always be there in the end. A 7\/10 from me. 3 for Jami Gertz automatically, I am a Jami Gertz mark. Wonder when it will finally come out on DVD.

The problem is that there are simply to many characters in this work. Besides the three Earp brothers Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan there are the three wives of the brothers, Doc Holliday and his Hungarian Kate, the tempting Josephine and her colleague Mr. Fabian, Billy Breckenridge, a good role from Jason Priestley, and a hole bunch of bad guys.  It just isn't possible to put all of these persons lives and problems in 130 minutes of film. The headaches that Wyatt Earp's wife has, for instance, don't get enough attention to get involved in her situation. The same goes for the whole Morgan Earp-character, played unenthusiastic by Bill Paxton. He hasn't got enough screentime to get you interested in why he does what he does. He seems to be in this movie for the reason that it's impossible to make a movie about the legendary Wyatt Earp without mentioning his two brothers Virgil and Morgan.The second thing not making the movie a very good one is that you don't know who the main character is Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday. In the beginning it's obvious that Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp is the most important person in the film, but slow but sure the Doc Holliday-part gets bigger and so much more interesting than Earp. This is because Val Kilmer is playing Doc Holliday with his whole heart and because you feel more for Holliday that for Earp. Wyatt Earp (in this motion picture) is a man who just wants to get a lot of money with doing as little as possible and Doc Holliday is the kind of person who wants to be there for Earp whenever he needs him, ill or not, Earp can always count on Doc Holliday. Writer Kevin Jarre and director George P. Cosmatos should have made a choice between Earp and Holliday and they didn't. That's a shame and it makes 130 minutes a heck of a long time. Luckily, like I mentioned before, Val Kilmer is a pleasure to watch and Jason Priestley and Billy Zane are acting very good as well. The scenery's are very impressing and Joseph Porro's customs are nearly perfect. All of this keeps the movie watchable, but not much more that that I'm afraid.

If you're looking for some cool action scenes featuring dinos chasing and chewing into people, some tense moments, and a B-movie feel, you might enjoy the summer aspect of this popcorn flick. This film doesn't come close to its previous incarnations in terms of story, laughs and interesting characters, but it does provide for some loud, good times every 10 or 15 minutes (think slasher but with dinosaurs!). The movie is also very short, so you aren't really all that bored between the action sequences. Of course, if you're already sick of seeing dinosaurs crunch into people, and don't really find mindless action summer movies all that entertaining, I would personally suggest that you never see this movie and live a fuller life. For those who do intend on seeing the film, be prepared for some uninteresting characters, yet another boy genius-type kid and Sam Neill weighing the whole thing down with his uber-serious moments, cliched dialogue and idiotic moments of talking to himself (read explaining the plot to the audience - I think they're talking to each other - uuuhhm and who are you talking to, Sam?).You're also not gonna give half a crap about the bogus mom\/dad\/son reunion that they decided to slap into this chomp-fest and will certainly roll your eyes after you see how one cellular phone could survive being thrown off a plane, eaten by a dinosaur, digested by the same, c*****d out, searched and found by certain humans, rained upon and then used to make a long-distance phone call.

I'm also not sure why they even brought Laura Dern's character back for one scene and I personally would have liked to have seen more killings and more hardcore dino-stuff, but alas, maybe the next time around. Overall, the film succeeds in providing for some thrills, some chills, and entertaining moments here and there but fails in providing us with a plot that maintains interest, characters who we should care about and much originality (other than those crazy flying thingamajigs).

My mind needs more...The graphics were great but any horror film made in the 21st century is supposed to have great graphics. You don't get credit for that. My mind needs more...Some have said that when a film is truly good you leave the film thinking about the film, perhaps even chilling with friends and discussing the more thought provoking elements of the film. There are definitely aspects of this film I can't get off my mind Did I really need to see Pam Grier in an afro wig pretending to be 20 something but looking more like Jimmy Bones' mother? Did I really need to see the severed heads arguing amongst themselves? Was that supposed to be the comedy relief? If so, why wasn't it funny? Was Snoop Dogg wearing a weave? If so, it blended very well. A lot of us would look much better with his hair dresser. I can think of 10 or 20 off the top of my head. Did this Ernest Dickerson fellow learn how to make bad films from Spike Lee or is this a talent he already had? Do you think if I write a really polite letter to the CEO of New Line Cinema that I can get my money back? Did I remember to pick up my black dress from the drycleaners?I'm afraid I have to give this film a C-. I'm being generous because I adore Snoop and Pam. Although, they both should be scolded for selecting such a sappy, crappy film. Yick!

To spare everyone the cost of a rental, let me spoil the joke  a comedy is in desperate trouble when a cameo by Shaquille O'Neal is its sole highlight.

Kenneth Branagh's version of the timeless William Shakespeare classic is a great rendition of the film, making it accessible to everyone, even those who do not like Shakespeare.Let me first say that I am a great fan of Shakespeare's works.  In college I was an English literature major, with a minor in theater, and so Shakespeare is found in both.  Theater people state that Shakespeare was never literature at all, which in the purpose of the plays is true, however because of the prose that he wrote in is a poetic form, he is literature as well.  Whatever you do, never get in between two people arguing this point, your head might blow up!Reading the comments on this page, the basic attack on this movie is that Branagh cuts lines and shaved parts.  Yes, of course he did.  Nothing is sacred, not even the works of Shakespeare, people.  I myself was in a Shakespeare play, and over half the script was cut from it.  With a Shakespeare play, the question is what to cut.  If this play had been presented in it's entirety, it would have been close to five hours long. And today's movie audience just does not have that kind of patience.  Titanic was stretching it a little, in terms of time.  Shakespeare's original audience would have had no problem, because they made a day of it.So when Branagh did this play, he had to shave off a great deal of the script, and he had to decide what to focus on.  He had to focus on the main characters, being Beatrice and Benedict and their romance, and of course the drama concerning Hero and Claudio, but also keep other characters incorporated as well.  For those attacking the whittling down of the script, why didn't anyone bring up the point that Benedict is supposed to have shaved his beard while in attempt to woo Beatrice.  Why?  Because it really isn't a major plot point that is needed at all.  So Branagh made great choices in his direction of the film, and in the end he made sure that everything tied together logically, and that there were no loose ends.The performances by the actors were great as well.  There was nothing wrong with casting Denzel Washington as the prince, though people seem to have a beef with it.  He pulled it off very well.  And Keanu Reeves did a great job as well.  It was a treat to see him as a villain.  I happen to be a fan of Reeves, and I do see him as great casting, though why people also have a problem with him I'll never know.  Branagh was going for acting ability, not just names.  Reeves has the goods, and he can speak Shakespeare very well, it's his character that's supposed to be moody.  And Keaton was a wonderful choice for the Constable, making me laugh whenever he was on the screen.  And the other actors all did very well in their roles.If you're a lover of Shakespeare or not, this film is a great treat, and it appeals to all audiences who love the classic masterpiece.

I am slightly worried by the current need for fast paced films, and have heard many complaints about both this and The Score on that count. Although there were flaws within this film the pace of it I did not see as one of them. Enigma dealt very well with the subject matter, and was true to life in the facts about how the code was broken. Admittedly the characters were not the real people who cracked the code, but it was a movie and not a documentary so can be forgiven for this. The setting was beautiful and the acting of Winslet in particular was impressive. Jeremy Northam was very good if a little stereotypical in his portrayal of the MI5 agent. I was also impressed by Dougray Scott's performance as the tortured genius, and although I felt little empathy with his character I did not view this as a problem as a `hero' in the Hollywood sense of the word would not have fit this film.Now to the flaws I mentioned before. The biggest problem with this film was the ease with which Scott and Winslet overcame their obstacles. (*Minor Spoilers*) I am not referring to the breaking of the code, but the fact that everything seemed to fall just a little to neatly into their lap the enigma machine not being found in the barn, the ease with which Winslet was able to steal highly confidential information, when Scott was seen emerging from the copies room in the interception building no-one said anything to stop him.I also felt the film as a whole could have been greatly improved by two very minor changes. (*MAJOR SPOILERS*) Firstly, the idea that a German U-boat would stray that far into enemy territory to rescue their spy after they had obtained all the information they required from him seemed completely unbelievable. Secondly, the final seen where Scott sees Burrows but does not talk to her and then is joined by a pregnant Winslet was an unnecessary addition that added nothing to the film - except perhaps made it more distributor friendly as it now had the current ubiquitous trend of overly happy endings. I would have been far happier if the film had finished with Scott and Northam surveying the lake, both knowing it is empty. If you enjoy your films fast paced or full of action then this is not for you. Slow paced, but well developed, an enjoyable 7 out of 10.

On the one hand, it is undeniably bad. The movie tries to tell two types of stories, first it wants bo be a movie about war journalists, like Olliver Stone's Salvador. Then, it becomes a rescue movie when the main journalist tries to evacuate a nine year old girl from the war zone.One problem is that these two stories don't hang well together at all. The journalist is totally uncharismatic. Then, there are cameos (don't let the cover fool you) of Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomei. Very charming actors, but they don't get enough screen time.What I think happened is that the director became overraught by the fact that they were _actually_ filming in Sarajevo itself, wanted to put too many things in, and in the end forgot what his job was - namely, to tell  a story.What I would have done, was focus much more on the little girl, her perspective of the war, which is much more interesting than watching some jaded journalists being jaded. Also, in the end, the war in Bosnia was about the people of Bosnia, not some parachuted in gonzos. It is in fact demeaning in itself that the people who suffered the most, are delegated to playing extras in some kind of movie that can't make up it's mind what story it wants to tell. At the same time, after focusing on the girl, I would have focused more on the Woody Harrelson character. He has a lot more going for him than the scrawny, balding lead, who's character, by the way, also isn't developed (why does he have a family back home?;What does his wife think  of him flying off to the latest war zone?;Why does she accept that he does this dangerous job and in the process shacks up with Kerry Fox and Emily Lloyd?; Questions, questions...). The movie falls into the trap of, instead of telling a coherent, progressive story, wanting to mention every atrocity visited on the city of Sarajevo.However, what it has going for it, are those rare moments. At times, the movie is effective in illustrating _how_ those people came to be dead, especially with the middle aged woman who was shot dead during the wedding party\/procession. The images of the concentration camps are of course harrowing, and the scenes of the market place that was mortared are gruesome. There is an effective blending of news footage and movie, to the point where at _some_ point (not immediately) you don't know what is real and what is fiction. Ok. However, this does not make for a movie. Movies have to have characters you can root for - they don't _have_ to be Western journalists. I would have rooted for the little girl. Or her mom.

They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.Here's why.  Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another.  Jurassic Park is nothing more than a retelling of Frankenstein when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version.  The Jurassic Park example can work again for this point.  No one sees it as another retelling of Frankenstein at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue.  Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage.  The whole thing involves what is called intertextuality, a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of Jurassic Park.Okay, stop yawning.Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ).  I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on.  But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as The Cave.  In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other.  Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows.  You leave them in this cave for 20 years.  The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall.  They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world.  Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile.  He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc.  If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did.  He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave.  But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.WHEW!!That's the basic story in the Matrix.  Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave.

It has cute actors (Keanu Reeves...) it has a MAJOR bad guy (Dracula) and also it has a soppy, but (somehow) believeable love story stacked in the middle! This movie fortutantly, relys on the old method of doing effects, there is some CGI filming technolgy here, but it is alot of old fashioned techniques used as well, and in my opinion this is what makes the movie the more freaky!I love the scenes at the castle and also the characters add to the movie as well, you can't have a movie as creepy as this and then have some crappy characters who don't know how to act! This is why i thought the film and the characters were well thought out and extremely well made.I like the fact that in this movie they FINALLY use Ol' Vlads powers as they were meant to be i.e. He CAN sustain direct sunlight, but it bloody weakens him unlike the myth which says he can't. So i was glad to see that go in. Also i liked the love story behind it and how God forgives all in the end, it made me wanna cry... NOT! But it was a well crafted story line and it did have its moments, i wish i could tell you what they were.. but if you're looking for a movie in which you don't have to worry about how much the director has put into special effects, this movie does have special effects, but they don't domainate it like other movies *COUGH PHANTOM MENANCE COUGH!*Go see this movie, have a few chills at the scary movies and then go home with your b\/f or g\/f and wonder if you could really last over 600 years (or so) in waiting for your true love, it makes you think don't it?

This movie fortutantly, relys on the old method of doing effects, there is some CGI filming technolgy here, but it is alot of old fashioned techniques used as well, and in my opinion this is what makes the movie the more freaky!I love the scenes at the castle and also the characters add to the movie as well, you can't have a movie as creepy as this and then have some crappy characters who don't know how to act!

It was a great movie well written,directed and the acting was outstanding. John T. played his part with ease and greatness that he is capable of doing. The rest of the cast did super job as well. I have to admit i rented this movie not excpecting much but man was i wrong. I love films that have L.a. sunsets and landscapes it reminds me of Michael Manns films which are great too. Im going out to buy this film. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2001","score":"","review":"  this film didnt do good at the box office.
