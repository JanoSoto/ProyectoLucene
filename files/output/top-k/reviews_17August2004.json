I should've acted on it and gone back to the video store.There are some good, tense action sequences, but overall, Reign of Fire is only so-so. I'll have to admit, though, that it takes a bit of talent to start with a fairly original idea and drown it in clichés and predictability - all in 102 minutes. *Warning Don't read before watching, major spoilers ahead*There are a lot of problems with this movie, the most obvious being the great many things that just simply don't hang together. A kid allowed to go unsupervised into a London Underground construction site? Really? Dragons buried underground for most of history? So what do they eat? And later on, they're starving? Why don't they just go hibernate again? Oh, and the first kid to see a dragon ends up being one of the very last people left alive on earth? What are the odds of that? Given the high-maintenance nature of helicopters, I wondered just how the heck they managed to keep that one in the air. Alex must be one heck of a helicopter mechanic. Not to mention that the relatively slow-moving helicopter is entirely a sitting duck for the far more nimble dragons. Fuel? I guess this model doesn't need it. Wish I could get in on that technological breakthrough. How about an entire species that depends for its survival on one single individual? Huh? I can guaran-darn-tee such a species wouldn't be around for long. And in the entire 20-year history of the destruction of close to 6 billion people, nobody on the entire planet noticed the dragons' weakness until now? Oh... and the dragons are NOT defeatable using all the modern high-tech weaponry the world's nations have to offer, but if you've got a bow and arrow with a few ounces of C4, you can take one of those bad boys down?By the way, why didn't a LOT of people simply dig in underground and wait for these creatures to starve? So much for the basic premises. Plot-wise, maybe I didn't need the spoiler warning, you can see what's coming anyway.

I'll give RoF about a 3 or 4 out of 10, largely based on the effects and action. Slightly below average, but there's an awful lot of awful stuff being produced.

Let me put my ten cents in with every comment I have read here immediately and state categorically that this film is a JOY. Okay, you know going in that a major character is handicapped so you figure that at some point the movie is going to manipulate your emotions and you're ready for that but, like most things, it's all in the wrist, and this one has an extra metatarsal. It is, of course, the salesman who spends his life lecturing on how to manipulate the buyer who is himself manipulated by Georges - nice touch naming him after the 'normal' one of the two buddies in 'Of Mice And Men', where the retarded Lenny is looked after by George - the irritating, exasperating, impossible lovable guy who walks into his life after Harry nearly ran into his. Okay, to make this work you need to create a character who is the complete opposite of Georges, a guy literally too busy making money and being successful to stop and smell the roses. A guy who misses his daughters dreadfully since his estranged wife - it's not clear if they are divorced or just separated - took them away yet is so busy that he completely forgets to pick them up and leaves them waiting alone at the train station; who opts to attend a conference on his daughter's birthday, you get the picture. Georges misses someone, too. His mother, who is dead. Time and again in his loneliness and hurt he conjures her up and we see the great love they shared. This then, is the back story and the scene is set for what Hollywood used to call a 'meet-cute'. Here, Auteuil, in despair, his mind in a turmoil, driving through the rain runs over something large which he failed to see. Turns out to be the dog that had attached itself to Georges who has lit out from his residential home after watching all the other residents being picked up by relatives. Now all that is left is for Georges to 'change' Harry, to humanise him if you will and this he does in spades. This is a film chock full of laughter and tears and the fact that a leading French actress Miou-Miou agreed to play what is little more than a cameo as Harry's estranged wife speaks volumes for the quality of the writing.

Malcolm McDowell gives a performance of a lifetime, portraying an Emperor whose dedication to exposing the senate for what they are, a corrupt bunch of spineless bastards, ultimately leads to his descend into madness. Helen Mirren gives an interesting performance as Caligula's seductive wife, Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy is great as the cute and sweet Drusilla, the only voice of reason in the time of madness. The supporting cast is also top notch. Sire John Gielgud gives an awesome portrayal a stoic Roman aristocrat Nerva and Peter O'Toole is a true jaw dropper as Tiberius, the old emperor, a completely mad sex addict, plagued with syphilitic lesions. The rest of the supporting cast are unknown Italian actors, except for the B-movie god John Steiner, who plays the two faced Longinus, Caligula's treasurer.The much talked about sex in the film was never meant to be in any way arousing. If one looks closely, he can see that most of the nudity and sex is handled in a very clinical, unappealing fashion. Tinto Brass did an awesome job showing how the Ancient Rome was so used to perversity, that a few people romping in a corner was just not a big deal in those days. Same can be said about the gore and violence in the film. From the small hints remaining in the film, Caligula was well on its way to become a moody piece of paranoia, corruption and deep character study. There are some truly chilling and atmospheric moments. For example, when Caligula puts on the royal ring, you can actually see him losing soul, thanks to Malcolm McDowell's awesome facial expressions. Also, there is a haunting scene of Caligula asking the dying Nerva, who lies in a bath tub filled with blood, about the afterlife. And the humorous scenes of Caligula judging a land dispute between two whiny senators and one where a Senator says he would give up his life to cure Caligula's to fever, only to realize that Caligula has excepted his proposition.But sadly, none of the points I made can be seen to a naked eye. When Tinto Brass got fired, the film's producer, Bob Guccione (yes, *that* Bob Guccione), tried to splice the film together himself, although he had no idea what he was doing. What ended up was a pathetic mishmash of truncated and misplaced scenes, out takes, rehearsal footage and some dull extra sex inserts with the Penthouse Pets, shot by Bob himself after the filming has wrapped, designed simply to promote the magazine. All the important subplots and story lines were deleted, making the film lose most of its plot and meaning, the pace is ruined due to endless pauses and there are maddening zooms that are obviously just raw footage of camera operators adjusting the lens. The movie is simply unwatchable because it is mostly cut together from the blurry, shaky outtakes. In other words, Bob Guccione stole a masterpiece and turned it into his own little wet dream.Everyone who dealt with this film disowned it after seeing the finished result and rightfully so.So, next time you watch the film and notice how bad it is, don't blame the actors, Tinto Brass or Gore Vidal.

If you don't understand, then just admit it and move on. Critiques should be reserved for anyone who actually made the effort to make sense of what was offered, not for those that felt a pang of discomfort and decided to benchmark it for the rest of the movie.For those not playing with a full deck, the movie is a sarcastic representation of how everyone interprets religion. Opinions vary on the subject and obviously on the movie as well. The fact that the plot centers around faith can cause the viewer to believe that religion is being offended, but remove all religious references and the movie is still offensive. This is dark humor, cynicism and satire at its peak. I daresay that the true villain of the movie is the dogmatic policy that allows the religious elite the right to translate their biblical interpretations into religious law. Aside from Jesus, noone else has ever been given the right of divinity in the Catholic \/ Christian faith. Moses delivered the commandments, but he did not create or 'write' them. The biggest clue provided is the inability of 'god' to speak to anyone other than an angel without some bloody consequence. We are all supposedly created equal and by that account, if I am unfit to interpret the divine word of 'god', how is anyone else fit for that job? Religion on a whole is its own worst enemy due to its lack of understanding between two individuals or more. 'Dogma' reinforces the idea that it is OK to feel stupid when you don't understand religion, just don't BS if you don't want other people that are just as stupid as you to know that. It doesn't help you and it doesn't help religion since misinterpretation is only one step closer to confusion. After that, frustration and alienation are not far behind. 'Dogma' is neither a critique nor a confirmation of the need for faith and religion. It is show of how extreme behavior can be regarded as harmless until the opposite extreme appears as a balance. Conflict ensues and all can come close to being lost.Consequently, I loved this movie. I am a big fan of dark humor and anything that satirizes religion (some people take it too literal and serious when there really is more to life). Not a masterpiece, but certainly not rubbish. I'm neither a religious fanatic nor a 'gotta have violence and vulgarity' type of person. The movie made its point and was uncompromising about it.

And it long preceeded the popularity of many of those nauseating comic book based movies which seem to crowd the theaters these days (mainstream American filmmakers will you try nothing new?)! And this one is, in my opinion, one the greatest comic book based movies of all time (although, I haven't seen the Superman movies since I was a little kid and can't remember much of them). Unfortunately, once Tim Burton dropped out of directing the third and fourth and (they just keep making them why?) on and on and Joel Shumacher took over, it was all over. I think the first two Batman movies directed by Burton and starring Michael Keaton (Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) are the only ones worth watching.Burton was perfect to direct this one. Ironically, he couldn't get the okay on this film by the studio until the success of his previous movie, Beetlejuice shined at the box office. His gloomy atmospheres that we saw in Edward Scissorhands (the scenes in and around the mansion) and Beetlejuice were perfect to create a live version of Gotham City (including using his regular composer, Danny Elfman, to create the great orchestral soundtrack), where our hero, the hermit Batman (Michael Keaton) lives. But, Gotham City is in trouble when a bunch of deranged gangsters, headed up by The Joker (the best comic book villain ever, played wonderfully by the typically slick Jack Nicholson), who wants to put Batman out of commission by making him look like a regular villain and The Joker like the city's saviour. The only person who may be able to help Bruce Wayne\/Batman is a timid Gotham Globe reporter, Vicki Vale (Kim Bassinger). Batman was the first major commercial blockbuster movie that I remember (I was only seven at the time, so give me a break), with numerous product endorsement commercials (especially for Coca Cola) every time you turned on the television. It was a pretty incredible feature, with great action, a slamming good cast (Keaton is damned good in nearly everything I've seen him in, anways, even the garbage movies he mostly appears in recently years; Nicholson; Basinger; Billy Dee Williams as the D.A.; Jack Palance; and etc).I don't know how well die hard fans of the comic enjoyed this movie (or how they may compare this movie to the Batman sequels that follow), but I certainly enjoyed this movie a lot. If you read the IMDB trivia, you will notice that Tim Curry was considered to play The Joker. I'll bet that would've been interesting and with Tim Burton as director, Curry would have been used just right in this movie (bummers!). The trivia also indicates that Charlie Sheen and Bill Murray were considered for the role of Batman. I don't think that would've worked good at all (Charlie Sheen always appears so deadpan and I can never take Bill Murray seriously, so maybe they wanted Batman The Comedy? in which case, Bill Murray would've been great).

Larry Ditmeyer, the invariably scheming neighbor (played by Laverne and Shirley co-star, Michael McKean), hopes that he can prevent the Brady's from getting hold of the money too soon, because he wants to buy up the property (the last on the block after convincing everyone else to sell) and make his boss happy.The better parts of the movie however, are not from the main plot (and in spoofs, the main plot is hardly the funniest part of the movie because it is almost always character rather than situation driven). First, the absolutely nerdy Greg Brady (Christopher Daniel Barnes) has plans to become hip rock star (in a Seattle grunge dominated music decade), Johnny Bravo.Marcia (Christine Taylor) has two dilemmas first, she accepts two guys invitation to the dance (it seems only sitcom safe Marcia could worry about monogomy in the 90s), scrawny Charlie (R.D. Robb who was the I double dog dare ya kid in the holiday cult classic, A Christmas Story), and arrogant jock and big man on campus, Doug Simpson (Shane Conrad). Her other earth shaking problem is getting Davey Jones (yes, the real Monkees) to come to the school dance. Equally geek pre-pubescent Paul Sutera is Peter Brady, a guy with a serious hormone imbalance who falls for Holly (played by Marissa Ribisi), girlfriend of Peter's hostile Ditmeyer neighbor, Eric (James Noseworthy).Although Marica's character is so achingly bubbly and conceited (making her perfectly funny as disaster happens around her to which she is oblivious to), I liked her secretly lesbian friend, Noreen (played by former Beakman's World assistant, Alanna Ubach), who likes Marcia, and even helps her out of a jam with that idiot Doug Simpson. She's really funny.Jennifer Elise Cox does the best job in the whole movie as the greatest character spoof, playing the ridiculously self-conscious and low self esteem teen Jan Brady. She spends the movie trying very hard to get herself recognized and break out of her middle child syndrome (why doesn't Peter have this problem?). Her guidance counselor is Mrs. Cummings, played by RuPaul. (And girl, you better work it!). In fact, her invisibility to everyone causes some very hilarious moments of delusional schizophrenia. (Says the evil Jan in one scene Look at me, I'm the new Jan Brady. Let's go knock over a 7-11!). Shelly Long and Gary Cole are fantastic (and amazing replicas) of the out-of-touch mother and father of the family, Carol and Mike Brady. Mike, the architect, hopes he can design an acceptable commercial building (all looking like his house, of course, since it's the only design he's ever made reference to making) in order to get a pay advance and cover the taxes on the house before foreclosure. I love how the mother always does this you're father's right business to everything Mike Brady says, even though no one knows what he's talking about or when he has stated the obvious. That's about the time when the kids easily submit with, gee...I never thought of it that way.If you think the Brady Bunch were ahopelessly corny and terribly safe moralistic sitcom family (especially given that they were on television in the 1970, the same time as shows like 'All in the Family' and 'Maude'), then this is a film recommended for you. They really stick out like a sore thumb. (Holly says to the guys after they're checking out Marcia Brady, I think Peter's a babe...in a Gilligan sort of way. Eric responds, what are you? braindead!). Look for cameos from former the Brady Bunch cast as well as those of other 1970s sitcoms (Barry Williams, who was the original Greg Brady, shows up as a music producer and actually rejects the spoofed Greg Brady's request for an audition; Christopher Knight has a blink-and-you-miss him part as a school coach who tells Ditmeyer to stop picking on Peter Brady; Anne B. Davis who was the original Alice the maid shows up as a truck driver who gives Jan a lift; and Florence Henderson plays Grandma Brady). This movie promises a lot of laughs, and everything the Bradys do is so stupid, that's why it is so funny. (Don't miss Jean Smart as Ditmeyer's alcoholic wife Mrs. Brady sure is lucky to have a big strong, virile man around the house.)If you love spoofs, don't miss this one!

Davis who was the original Alice the maid shows up as a truck driver who gives Jan a lift; and Florence Henderson plays Grandma Brady).

Larry Ditmeyer, the invariably scheming neighbor (played by Laverne and Shirley co-star, Michael McKean), hopes that he can prevent the Brady's from getting hold of the money too soon, because he wants to buy up the property (the last on the block after convincing everyone else to sell) and make his boss happy.The better parts of the movie however, are not from the main plot (and in spoofs, the main plot is hardly the funniest part of the movie because it is almost always character rather than situation driven). First, the absolutely nerdy Greg Brady (Christopher Daniel Barnes) has plans to become hip rock star (in a Seattle grunge dominated music decade), Johnny Bravo.Marcia (Christine Taylor) has two dilemmas first, she accepts two guys invitation to the dance (it seems only sitcom safe Marcia could worry about monogomy in the 90s), scrawny Charlie (R.D. Robb who was the I double dog dare ya kid in the holiday cult classic, A Christmas Story), and arrogant jock and big man on campus, Doug Simpson (Shane Conrad).

It's a very specific sub genre of comedy that is extremely hard to do well as films like Very Bad Things frequently signify. Too many of Hollywood's more recent offerings feature truly tasteless gags that poke fun at subjects that should simply be left well enough alone. Well I have to say that Hollywood could learn a thing or two from its own past in this department. I recently rediscovered a childhood favourite of mine, The Burbs, and I have to admit that age has not in the least bit dulled the film's razor sharp wit and acid tongued dialogueTom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, an overstressed suburbanite who's decided to spend his vacation lounging around the house in a vain effort to relax. Of course he finds his efforts hindered by the constant presence of his somewhat excitable neighbors Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) and Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) who suspect the new family in the neighbourhood, the Klopeks, of being mass murderers. Together these three decide to look into the suspicious nature of their new neighbors and just what exactly it is they get up to at night, the time when the otherwise reclusive Klopeks seem to be at their most active. The premise is basically the set up for another of Joe Dante's (who directed both Gremlins and its remake in all but name, Small Soldiers) bedlam filled romps through suburbs in which he casts a sideways glance at all things American dream.Quite frankly, my nostalgia for this movie makes it hard to find fault with it. Hanks is as funny as ever, playing it relatively straight compared to his other performances of the period and bringing a lovely shade of deep seated unease to an otherwise grounded character. Bruce Dern fills his role wonderfully, as the military obsessed Rumsfield, a character surprisingly reminiscent of survivalist Burt Gummer from the Tremors movies in both his nature and ability to steal scenes. The only weak link in the leading trio is Ducommun, which is a shame as it is really Art that drives the story more than any other character in the movie. Sure, Art has to be slightly obnoxious and a little irritating but Ducommun overplays these aspects so much that I began to find it painful to watch him as the end of the movie approached. It's hardly a surprise when Hanks tries to kill him. I can't help but feel that perhaps the late John Candy would have fit the role slightly better, bringing some more human and likable qualities to the character. At times however, The Burbs can feel a little uneasy in its pacing and sense of humour. Scenes like the screaming at the bone, although funny, seem out of place in what is otherwise a movie with a very dry sense of humour. Meanwhile the Klopeks are unveiled as characters perhaps a little too late in the story for the audience to truly develop any kind of opinions about them.Despite some small problems however, The Burbs remains an extremely funny movie with some terrific dialogue and almost universally good performances from its cast. I defy anyone not to laugh at Rumsfield's fall from the roof of his house or every man Ray's furious rant at the movie's close.

It's as clear and straightforward as that. So it baffles me why there's so many people criticising this movie for distorting the true story of William Hayes. It's a movie, and whoever believes it word for word isn't sane. That said, no movie should be criticised for not respecting reality. Any adaptation of real-life events must be fictionalised for the sake of drama... otherwise, it's boring. And quite simply, William Hayes' faithful account of his imprisonment in Turkey was boring and hardly the material for drama. A good dramatist will change facts to achieve maximum dramatic effect. Shakespeare did it every chance he get. Go through his 'historical' plays with a good history book and try not fall into the giant historical holes. And yet no one complains about Shakespeare. Well, I'm not going to complain about Parker\/Stone's amazing movie because it's one of the most dramatically powerful movies I've ever seen in my life! Each movie creates its own reality and logic within the story itself, and in the Midnight Express the Turks were pure evil, Hayes was brutally treated, he killed a man for vengeance, and made a fantastic escape back into the USA. And there's nothing wrong with that... at least within the movie's logic, which is what one should pay attention to.Midnight Express is the straightforward story of one man lost in a cruel world that wants to destroy him physically, but especially mentally, who triumphs against great adversities and overwhelming circumstances and odds. Basically, it's your typical uplifting, feel-goody movie.The first ten minutes of the movie are excellent in themselves... it's practically silent as we're shown everything visually from Hayes hiding the hash in his body at the beginning, to him 'hiding' himself under his shades, chewing lots of gum and sweating a lot to shows he's pretty nervous. In fact this weakness immediately tells us he's not going to succeed in getting inside that plane. And for all accounts, we should hate Hayes because he's a drug dealer. And yet he has a girlfriend - Susan - more importantly he has a girlfriend whom he tells to get into the airplane and leave him behind for her sake. He cares for her... and this behaviour is repeated again with his cellmates - especially with Max. We can't hate Hayes he just put his girlfriend into safety. He's the good guy in the movie. The first ten minutes shows us that we're supposed to be rooting for him for the rest of the movie, and I do. More importantly, we must root for him because he's one man against a whole corrupt, backwards legal system that has no feelings. Do I think Turkey is portrayed accurately in this movie? Absolutely not! But this isn't Turkey; this is an abstract, Kafkaesque antagonist that's set out to create conflict in the movie, as rules of drama demand it - and throughout the movie this antagonist is personified by the chief guard prison guard, Hamidou. And the conflict is so overwhelming it makes Hayes struggle even more interesting to follow. As the legal system manipulates his sentence Hayes goes from a peaceful man to a resourceful, desperate man willing to do anything to escape Turkey.In prison he meets interesting characters his cellmates Max, the junky, Jimmy, angst-ridden guy, and Eric, a Swedish inmate who first helps Hayes setting in. Hayes shows the same commitment to them as he showed to Susan, and yet one by one he sees them all disappear first Eric; then Jimmy, arrested after a foiled escape plan; and finally Max, brilliantly played by John Hurt he's backstabbed by Rifki, the local snitch who turns Max to Hamidou on the fake grounds of selling hash. Rifki is the sort of character in fiction one just loves hating... there are actually two moments in the movie where one feels victorious over him the first when Hayes and Max destroy his money, the only thing he cares for and for which he'd sell out on inmates like Jimmy. But the second instance is just about one of the most righteous, semi-cathartic scene in any movie wherein the viewer feels rewarded for waiting so long just to get sweet revenge as Hayes loses his last friend, Max, after Rifki turns him to Hamidou, Hayes goes crazy and brutally attacks Rifki like a real madman, culminating in the infamous scene where Hayes bites Rifki's throat off.It just feels so good!But the heartbreaking moment in the movie comes at the end, when Hayes finally escapes. It's ironic that after so many mad schemes to escape prison, including through catacombs, Hayes just manages to escape through the front door. As we see him walking away from the prison to the sound of Giorgio Moroder's beautiful score, one can't hope to feel emotional. There's a sense of righteousness in seeing Hayes make it; after all, he wasn't bad enough to deserve a whole life in a Turkish prison. The Midnight Express is a fantastic movie that explores Man's best qualities perseverance, self-determination and love. The point of fiction is tell stories like this, as distorted as they may be, and I give this movie 8\/10 for showing me raw human nature triumphing over impossible odds. And it's great to see Billy triumph especially because the odds are impossible... that's what makes the whole movie great.

And the conflict is so overwhelming it makes Hayes struggle even more interesting to follow. As the legal system manipulates his sentence Hayes goes from a peaceful man to a resourceful, desperate man willing to do anything to escape Turkey.In prison he meets interesting characters his cellmates Max, the junky, Jimmy, angst-ridden guy, and Eric, a Swedish inmate who first helps Hayes setting in. Hayes shows the same commitment to them as he showed to Susan, and yet one by one he sees them all disappear first Eric; then Jimmy, arrested after a foiled escape plan; and finally Max, brilliantly played by John Hurt he's backstabbed by Rifki, the local snitch who turns Max to Hamidou on the fake grounds of selling hash. Rifki is the sort of character in fiction one just loves hating... there are actually two moments in the movie where one feels victorious over him the first when Hayes and Max destroy his money, the only thing he cares for and for which he'd sell out on inmates like Jimmy. But the second instance is just about one of the most righteous, semi-cathartic scene in any movie wherein the viewer feels rewarded for waiting so long just to get sweet revenge as Hayes loses his last friend, Max, after Rifki turns him to Hamidou, Hayes goes crazy and brutally attacks Rifki like a real madman, culminating in the infamous scene where Hayes bites Rifki's throat off.It just feels so good!But the heartbreaking moment in the movie comes at the end, when Hayes finally escapes. It's ironic that after so many mad schemes to escape prison, including through catacombs, Hayes just manages to escape through the front door. As we see him walking away from the prison to the sound of Giorgio Moroder's beautiful score, one can't hope to feel emotional. There's a sense of righteousness in seeing Hayes make it; after all, he wasn't bad enough to deserve a whole life in a Turkish prison. The Midnight Express is a fantastic movie that explores Man's best qualities perseverance, self-determination and love. The point of fiction is tell stories like this, as distorted as they may be, and I give this movie 8\/10 for showing me raw human nature triumphing over impossible odds. And it's great to see Billy triumph especially because the odds are impossible... that's what makes the whole movie great.

And it really pays off in this intelligently scripted and played out film.One never quite knows where the centre of the show is intended to be. Nichols would have us pursue Adrian Lester's administrative cog Burton, as he quickly falls into not only the unusual (bedding colleague Tiernay after his relationship disintegrates, great directional understatement) but also the morally questionable. In case you're worried that this sounds a bit boring played out by the worthy Lester, don't worry Kathy Bates appears and suddenly there are four premium principals (Emma Thompson squaring the circle with another well-judged, competent but unassuming performance).For me, Travolta is the star though. For me he is considerably better at this affable, yet grand-high-priest-of-cool role (Get Shorty) than as a tough guy (Broken Arrow, Swordfish etc.). Nichols has set out to make a film about people and their relationships and how this translates into a political vernacular, and the ensemble, led by Travolta has got the message. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Remarkable depth of casting, given that a considerable proportion of the budget will have gone on post-Tarantinoed Travolta.

I found it intriguing and thought provoking. So much so that the following couple of days I spent pondering the plot and trying to make sense of it all! I came across this site ...fantastic!Here are some revelations I would like to share that might be of interest to those as captivated by the film as I am.Bills journey started when he got that late night call from Marion who was grieving over her deceased father. I found it interesting that we learned immediately of Marion's overwhelming feelings for Bill. This was significant because it was mirroring Alice's overwhelming desire for the naval officer that sparked this ensuing obsessive reaction in Bill. Marion, like Alice, was willing to throw her ENTIRE life (with Carl) away for a chance at Bill. This stresses the reason behind his journey - his quest that began as he walked and walked.....What was the relevance of Domino contracting HIV??? I think this reflected Bill's FIRST lucky escape - it would have cost him his life if Alice didn't call him when she did. Like his dogged determination to turn up to the forbidden event (orgy) - also could have cost him his life. HE ALSO WAS WILLING TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE FOR THESE FLEETING SEXUAL EXPERIENCES. He was trying to experience an overwhelming desire to revenge Alice - (he kept imagining her with the sailor).How did the masked Mandy at the orgy recognise an intruder when no-one had spoken to her about the receipt found in Bill's coat pocket or the taxi? She was involved with the ceremony so she couldn't have known those things. I think its because his 'cloak' gave him away - perhaps he should have worn an ermine-lined cloak. This may be showing us a connection between Milich, his daughter at RAINBOW costumes and the orgy. Remember they were acting strangely when Bill returned the costume - were they involved in the orgy? In costuming the members? Or perhaps the daughter had more to do with it than that! Bill would have had sex with the 2 girls at the Xmas party with the significant line we'll take you to the end of the RAINBOW. And what stopped him?? He was pulled away from that encounter by the NEAR DEATH OF MANDY- I believe this was his first warning!!! The next time he refused to be pulled away from an erotic situation resulted in MANDY'S death.It is a very clever movie. I welcome any comments on my comments.
