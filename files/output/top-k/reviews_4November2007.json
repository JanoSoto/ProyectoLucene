I mean, some of them were paid millions of dollars to do nothing but talk - you can't recognize them and their faces don't move - yet their voices are muffled and their pronunciation is inhibited. It gets worse - they each move in a different style, as if none of them went to the same monkey school. Thirty years after the first realistic monkeyman prosthetics were developed for A SPACE ODYSSEY comes this incredible failure, featuring makeup as bad as that in the original PLANET and its weak TV-budget sequels, and movement training that so far from helped the actors, they seem neither monkey nor man, but simply fake.And that's just the monkeys. Every set looks like a set. Every costume looks like a costume. Every line of dialog screams, Written for a summer picture! The lapses in logic, and the errors of taste and judgment, are among the most egregious in film history. And yet this is about as much money as you can spend on a movie. I mean, they really tried. Tim Burton, a bunch of good actors, top of the line fx, expensive writers... and it is really about as bad as movies get.

I usually don't cry for sad movies, but The Green Mile made me drop so much tears. Even though it's unbelievable for some scenes, but the point of movie is shown very clearly like the sunshine. I had watched sad movies that everyone told me that they cried for them, but I didn't. I just did it for The Green Mile. I really love Duncan's acting. He's really gorgeous!! He could act out of his character very well done. This movie shows me that they are some unfairness in this world. For example, the racism to the colored people. I was despised when I was in the U.S. by some people who thought that they were the greatest kind of people in the world. However, they were many people who helped me a lot and were nice to me. I really want this movie to be shown in everywhere which still has racism. God gave the same shadow to the rich and poor. To the white and colored, to everyone with love. Although I am not Christian, but I really understand this feeling. I hope this movie can teach us in some ways. I proudly voted this movie at 10. Really Love it!!!!
