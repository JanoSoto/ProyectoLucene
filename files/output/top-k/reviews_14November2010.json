I wonder if I could have seen the badness on paper, in the script, before the bulk of the $73 million budget was spent. Before looking at the shortcomings of the script and how to fix it, lets look at the other problems that make a bad script into a worse film. Have you seen the fabulous low-budget blaxploitation spoof I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka? One of the characters dies from Over-Gold, wearing so many gold chains it chokes him dead. This film suffers from Over-Drama. Everyone is trying way too hard. Its like the Prince in Shrek who was overcompensating. Maybe everybody knew how lame this was and just took a handful of Pacino pills and started foaming at the mouth and chewing the carpet. The actors are all over-projecting and it just makes them sound fake. A good sound person could have helped in post-production, but if the actors were instructed to talk like the were around the office water cooler maybe things would not sound so cheezy. Slow motion. Stop. Stop the slow motion. Please. It is not dramatic. It is lame and fake. It blends seamlessly with the fake dialog and just makes the whole movie crappier. This is a story about a slave society revolt. It should look very ordinary and boring and pedestrian. Until the revolt. Then it should get dramatic. Since everything is dramatic, nothing is dramatic. I saw the TV version so it was probably cut down and that can only be an improvement.I think it was City of Angels where the IMDb reviewer said It's as if Ed Wood had 50 million dollars. I love when the actors go uuhg uuhg uugh. It is both stupid an incongruous. The American people are a wonderful and sophisticated species. There are no common men. Each of us is remarkable for a host of reasons. All of us have a unique and interesting life. I think you could wait outside of any theater in America where this movie has played and ask any American what they thought. The response would be Really dumb. That is what the movie is, and that goes right to the script. That might go right to book, but that does not mean the producers and money-men could not have saved it. Fortunately, the movie is not trying to make an overt religious statement vis-a-vis Scientology. So hopefully John Travolta won't walk off the set when the rewrite hits the desk. The first realization for the producers is that they're making a B-movie and the budget should be 40 million and not 73. That will take out a lot of pretentiousness and Over-Drama. The re-write team needs to study real slave societies and real slave rebellions to at least get some plausibility. There is a structural problem in that you have a really boring slave society followed by a really dramatic revolt, and a movie goer needs a big shot of drama in first ten minutes. So you have to fold the time line, which I hate with a passion, but beggars can't be choosers. Put some dramatic conflict up front. The leader having to choose between saving the pretty girl or helping his friends with the revolution. Get to the brink and then fold back to the beginning and do the boring exposition of the boring slave society. Since the budget has been slashed, all the high-dollar alien costumes and makeup are out. So have the aliens all look like handsome TV newscasters in Armani suits. And get some girl aliens in there, gheeze, just 'cause the book was pre-adolescent boy stuff does not mean we have to be misogynous. The rebels definitely need more gender equality. The woman lead that is imperiled in the beginning has to be hot and competent. Every office in America has at least one hot competent woman, so I think we can work one into our little dystopian epic, OK? For the plot everything needs to be more plausible and then the dialog needs to be the same. A superior alien race is not going to do high-drama things like demand all the gold in 7 days. This is not American Chopper. So they will have reasonable expectations, not the feeling like the script was written by a 12-year-old trying to convey how unreasonable mom is expecting his room to be cleaned in 7 hours.We set the movie up with having the hero have to choose the girl or the rebel friends right in the first ten minutes. That pretty much lays out the whole movie. Now you have simple choices. 1) Hollywood ending He saves the girl and he saves all his rebel pals. 1a) Hollywood with Oscar He save the girl, since she is hot and competent she saves the pals and rebellion. 2) London He saves the girl but all his rebel pals die. The revolution fails. 3) Berlin He lets the girl die and saves his pals and the revolution. 4) Cannes The girl dies, the pals die, the revolution fails, and he kills himself.So; a simple $400k B-movie rewrite, take away all the costumes and sets, get the actors to stop shouting every single line, and epoxy the speed setting on the cameras to normal to eliminate all that slo-mo. This was made in 2000, but the swell allegory these days would be to make all the space aliens like our masters at Goldman Sachs looting the economy and the rebels be some combination of far right and far left extremists that systemically hunt down those privileged Yale pricks and exterminate them. One by one. 85 million domestic gross. Guaranteed.Worst line What kind of crap-lousy game are you playing? Best effect I really liked the light stream into his eyes when he was in the alien learning machine.
