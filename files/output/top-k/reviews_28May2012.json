Then I read the novel, and later I saw this movie on TV on a Saturday afternoon, and I loved it. Years later, I bought a VHS copy, and only two years ago I got the restored DVD edition, which comes with a lot of material some of which is interesting and the rest is a load of nonsense they added up just to have an excuse to produce a two-disc set. The restored movie runs for 174 minutes against the 160 or so of the old VHS. The newly added sequences are the intermission and exit music segments and some action shots previously edited that have been put back. I have to say that I find the restored film quite slow at times, with some sequences like the Melies' Journey to the Moon, the balloon voyage, the Spanish episode and the attack of the Sioux unnecessarily overlong and quite boring. Still, I also have to say that the film shines as to production values and its faithfulness to Verne's novel except for the balloon sequence and the Spanish adventure. And some members of the cast are just right for their roles. I can not imagine anyone else but David Niven as Phileas Fogg, and Bobby Newton is likable as Inspector Fix. But then Cantinflas, with all his natural skills for mimicry and his ability to talk like a gun-machine without saying anything solid is a bit out of place here, since he talks Spanish at times instead of French, which is the nationality his character is supposed to be. And Shirley MacLaine,fresh from The Trouble with Harry, seems to have been passing by when Mike Todd spotted her and immediately pulled out his chequebook and signed her in on the spot. But then, as a consolation, some of the cameos are a real delight Coward, Gielgud, Boyer, Dietrich, Hardwick, Gingold, Lorre, Mills... But it is John Carradine the one who stills the movie as the cigar smoker, vulgarian Yank. Anyway, despite its flaws this film still is one of my favourite adventure epics of all time.

The method actors - Monroe, Clift and Wallach and classical stalwart Clark Gable assume the roles of Roslyn, Perce, Guido and Gay respectively, with Thelma Ritter acting in the supporting part of Isabelle. The movie is directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller; by the end of the filming, the strained relation between Marilyn and Miller came to an end and the actress succumbed to a nervous breakdown, which is also documented in her biography Life in Pictures, while the alcoholism of Montgomery Clift and director Huston became added setbacks. Watching The Misfits,  I constantly pitied Monroe and Clift, especially the lady, because I somehow realized that they were becoming as hopeless as their characters, maybe even worse. I remember thoroughly enjoying 1945s The Lost Weekend, where Ray Milland played a bibulous writer sinking into madness due to his addiction; what made Milland's performance award-worthy was his well calculated and researched act - he knew exactly how to create his character and draw it out throughout the film. Did we ever fell that Milland himself was an raging alcoholic? No, and that precisely why he was showered with bounteous praise. When we watch films, not including documentaries, we want to see actors immersing themselves into their characters, feeding, nurturing and developing them in the course of the movie. Documentaries, on the other hand, depict real lives and true emotions which make some hard to watch. The Misfits seems to swing between a film and a documentary, and we don't  get a stable film As a result. Clark Gable himself was glad when shooting completed - he was perhaps one of the few persons who wasn't at the edge of their lives. His death, however, is extremely ironic. The plot does not seem to do enough justice to its characters; what I could surmise was that Roslyn's divorce due to incompatibility and lack of understanding and care on the part of her husband leads to her character searching for a man who could defeat his virile ego and respect her altruistic ideology. But Roslyn seems too much of a basket case herself with Marilyn playing her- the soft focus doesn't help since it makes her all the most inaccessible. I wouldn't have married such a woman, despite her beauty and fulsome assets, because appears so disturbed. Guido is unnecessarily antagonized towards the end but more than that, I found the intense focus on capturing Mustangs slightly digressive. The angle did lead to several implications, however it remains unsatisfying. The film is one of Marilyn Monroe's lesser known ones, and the banality and dismalness can make the pacing tedious at times. However, there are well-acted moments and meaningful dialogs and some worthy content as well. If only the movie could let itself loose...My Rating 5.8 out of 10.

The 2003 Korean Oldboy movie is radically different from it's original material too, but it's still a wonderful movie!So, since I didn't see any review here talking about the differences between medias, I decided to do one myself.One of the first things we can point is the organization itself.In the movie, it's a NY organization that monitors extraterrestrial occurrences and protects Earth from unwelcome guests.In the comic, it's an organization from Tennesee that monitors all kinds of paranormal activities, since ETs to monsters, creatures from hell, mystic occurrences, etc. It's not only about ETs. And the MIB organization from the comic, looks not for the welfare of mankind, but to control it, by leaving people ignorant.And how do they leave people ignorant?In the movie, they use the neuralizer to erase people's minds, so they can make up a story to cover all up.In the comic, either they kill people or they use the neuralizer (that looks like a flashlight), but different from the movie, this neuralizer hypnotizes people so the organization can take information from the subjects and then lead them to believe in whatever the MIB agent chooses to.In the movie, J is a black man that used to work in the NYPD.In the comic, Jay is a blonde white caucasian that was a government agent involved in suppress and infiltrate some drug dealers that ends up being captured by K and becoming part of the MIB staff, not by freewill, but by pressure.In the movie, K is a veteran MIB agent who works to protect people. He has good intentions.In the comic, Kay is a selfish, full of himself and obnoxious character which only thinks on himself and is capable of doing anything to complete his assignment. Even to kill people. He is portrayed like someone you probably wouldn't like to be around.As for Zed, in the movie he is portrayed like a real person, the boss of MIB, a well intentioned old man who looks to protect Earth.In the comics, Zed is mentioned by Kay like a real person, but he never appears. He is there just to give mission instructions and to monitor agents only.And notably, in the movies we refer to the title characters as Men in Black, while in the comics, it's THE Men in Black.Characters like the worms, Frank and Jeebes from the movie are also not in the comics, they were created specially for the movie. And as for Edgar, the man from the movie that was turned into an ET, well, he was completely altered, in the comics, his name is Horace, he is not eaten nor killed by the alien, and Jay just deals with the alien presence and settles the situation. Also, the humor in the movie doesn't exist in the comics, which uses a more serious and cynic tone. The movie basically uses mostly elements from the story titled Encounter which is Part 2 from MIB Vol. 1.Again, I'm just pointing out the differences between the two medias. I mean no disrespect to any of them, not the movie, nor the comic, they are both works that I appreciate and respect.

The 2003 Korean Oldboy movie is radically different from it's original material too, but it's still a wonderful movie!So, since I didn't see any review here talking about the differences between medias, I decided to do one myself.One of the first things we can point is the organization itself.In the movie, it's a NY organization that monitors extraterrestrial occurrences and protects Earth from unwelcome guests.In the comic, it's an organization from Tennesee that monitors all kinds of paranormal activities, since ETs to monsters, creatures from hell, mystic occurrences, etc. It's not only about ETs. And the MIB organization from the comic, looks not for the welfare of mankind, but to control it, by leaving people ignorant.And how do they leave people ignorant?In the movie, they use the neuralizer to erase people's minds, so they can make up a story to cover all up.In the comic, either they kill people or they use the neuralizer (that looks like a flashlight), but different from the movie, this neuralizer hypnotizes people so the organization can take information from the subjects and then lead them to believe in whatever the MIB agent chooses to.In the movie, J is a black man that used to work in the NYPD.In the comic, Jay is a blonde white caucasian that was a government agent involved in suppress and infiltrate some drug dealers that ends up being captured by K and becoming part of the MIB staff, not by freewill, but by pressure.In the movie, K is a veteran MIB agent who works to protect people. He has good intentions.In the comic, Kay is a selfish, full of himself and obnoxious character which only thinks on himself and is capable of doing anything to complete his assignment. Even to kill people. He is portrayed like someone you probably wouldn't like to be around.As for Zed, in the movie he is portrayed like a real person, the boss of MIB, a well intentioned old man who looks to protect Earth.In the comics, Zed is mentioned by Kay like a real person, but he never appears. He is there just to give mission instructions and to monitor agents only.And notably, in the movies we refer to the title characters as Men in Black, while in the comics, it's THE Men in Black.Characters like the worms, Frank and Jeebes from the movie are also not in the comics, they were created specially for the movie. And as for Edgar, the man from the movie that was turned into an ET, well, he was completely altered, in the comics, his name is Horace, he is not eaten nor killed by the alien, and Jay just deals with the alien presence and settles the situation. Also, the humor in the movie doesn't exist in the comics, which uses a more serious and cynic tone. The movie basically uses mostly elements from the story titled Encounter which is Part 2 from MIB Vol. 1.Again, I'm just pointing out the differences between the two medias. I mean no disrespect to any of them, not the movie, nor the comic, they are both works that I appreciate and respect.

When I first tried out the prequel around age 11 or 12 I found it just too ponderously slow-paced and straight-faced to really dive into (and the sex and violence put me off). However, come puberty and patience a few years later, everything changed as I developed an appreciation for slower, simpler, solid originals as opposed to faster-moving albeit sloppier sequels (like to a less extreme example ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2). Most importantly, I was of an age where I was finally able to appreciate the sophistication of the creative vision behind the scenes the locations, the costumes, the performances, and best of all the music! Basil Poledouris never really got his day in court later in his career quite like he did with this film. It's one of the richest, most melodic, and consistently riveting and appropriate scores ever produced. At the time, it must have been a revelation. Every scene and every performance in the film (aside from Sydow, who has no music to his well-acted but somewhat sluggish talk scene) benefits from the musical score immeasurably.I don't think audiences today can quite see how ahead of its time this film was, or how much of an anomaly it stands as. It's the first serious-toned and realistically violent fantasy movie that was ever made, and maybe the only one to have such a depth in philosophical reasoning behind it and an adequate budget to realize most of what the filmmakers intended.Therefore it really is *the* fantasy movie of our time, something harder-edged and with more of the focus on the loner fighting his way to the top than something like the LORD OF THE RINGS movies which focus on a larger conflict with a team effort.In retrospect I'm bittersweetly happy to have had this film as a friend growing up as it did a lot to promote an interest and appreciation of cinema. It's actually quite key to why I work in the business today. Unfortunately though I've come to realize that the magic of films like this is largely gone from the movie industry today and we may never see films again so personally crafted in an age of economically-driven blockbusters.

The movie is beautifully crowded with many small chuckles here and there, like the man who says wisely Home is where you think it is while the lead mishears it, thinking it a totally another thing! However, it has one big laugh, and I mean the lead's dream of exploding a nuclear bomb for mere playing. That was genuinely hilarious ! This is a swift fun, with dirt. I love swift fun, but not dirt; especially when it's shown as fun !

The entire success of this movie, where it's laurels rest, is upon those sets. Besides from that it is nothing more than another sci fi movie. I am stating this as my impression after watching it at least twenty times at home, if I had seen this movie in the theater at it's seventy-nine premier I would give it a different review.Despite the realness of the alien world I am unable to suspend my disbelief and earnestly follow the action... I mean everything looks good but there is something awry with the story in which I find ridiculousness and redundancy. In the directors commentary Ridley Scott says something interesting about the cryogenic freezers that open up at the beginning of the film, he says that if you think too hard about it then it does not make sense. I say that if you think at all such a thing will be a hindrance to reason. And since the bulk of the movie is just pushed along by a continuance of sci-fi clichés such as those cryogenic freezer-inos it leaves me wondering what does this movie mean to do? I mean every movie has a purpose, film is not a reflection of life but an attempt to create a new vision for audiences that will change the course of the world. And in Alien the goal is emasculation. As a genetically born male I find a problem with the feminist orientation of the thing. The film culminates with a strong female character ejecting a phallically headed creature off into the oblivion of space. The entire film equates male sexuality to a monstrosity. There is an apparent gender opposition even in the antagonism of mother the computer. Humans are trapped between a primal and bodily nature in the alien and on the other-side face the apathetic machinery of progress in the form of mother and the company. Now why are the destructive forces of progress written as female while the space of regression is shown as male? Even the android Ash is feminized by being an android which is an assuredly impotent thing, indeed he must consume a drink that looks like semen discharge because he cannot produce his own. But I am not writing with the intention of deflecting love from the finer sex. I just think that there are human natures that never change and that portraying a woman in a man's role is not going to improve the world. Maybe men make more money than women in general and that is unfair but what is all the money in the world to a woman if she does not have a man to protect her. Going off of that and returning to Alien I say that it is not a film that gives respect to women. I think that Sigourney Weaver appears in it scantly clad and bra-less. Enough said.Leaving the arena of philosophy there are other details I have left unscathed that need to be addressed when discussing Alien. Firstly the opening shot that pans the spaceship is directly stolen from Star Wars. Next when Cain is attacked by the parasite it melts through his thick visor wall but leaves his face uninjured. When the monster kills Dallas it just is crouching there with it's arms outstretched, in fact never in the movie did I see the monster in the fluid motions of an attack. And finally, although I'm sure I could find more errors, there is the issue of the self-destructing spaceship. Why am I supposed to believe that a spaceship would just conveniently have a self-destruct mechanism, of all the vehicles man has forged thus far from the space shuttle to aircraft carriers how many of them do you know to have mechanisms designed to readily blow them to kingdom come.

At the time, Tom Mix was a genuine movie legend, and he lived a lavish lifestyle that the picture barely touches on. The story references Mix as having made his last silent film, and he's about to appear in a picture about the Gunfight at the OK Corral, on which Wyatt Earp has been called in to be a technical adviser. In real life, Earp did become friends with Tom Mix and another veteran silent film star, William S. Hart.The setting for the film is 1929 with the very first year of the Academy Awards serving as a backdrop to the murder mystery at the center of the story. The event was held on May 16th, and Earp was already deceased for four months. It's unlikely an eighty year old Earp would have been running around Los Angeles getting involved with crooked cops and hookers, though I wouldn't put it past Mix. Even so, Mix would have been fifty himself, and it was getting harder with each passing year to get up on a horse.As cowboy star Tom Mix, Bruce Willis gets to wear some outrageously colorful outfits and drive some of the best looking vintage vehicles I've ever seen. Mix had a free spending lifestyle, and Willis's reference in the picture to owning sixteen cars was probably pretty close to the mark. Content with portraying Mix as a rather hip and fashionable playboy, no mention is made that he was married five times in real life. Just as well, it wouldn't have worked for the story at all.For his part, James Garner does a competent job as former marshal Wyatt Earp, now a private citizen and working as a consultant in Hollywood. I like Garner, and if you're going for a buddy team-up, the chemistry between himself and Willis is enjoyable. However the script calls for an affable Earp, and from what I've read about the real life lawman, Garner's portrayal seems out of character here. Which is OK, just not very believable. But we already established that.The main villain of the piece is portrayed by Malcolm McDowell in a thinly based caricature of Charlie Chaplin. A number of reviewers on this board opine on why director Edwards would have tarnished Chaplin's reputation with such an obvious parody (Happy Hobo\/Little Tramp). It may simply have been a way to include another Academy 'first' in the proceedings. Chaplin was honored that year with a special award for his all around contribution to producing The Circus.Another reviewer puzzles over the title of the movie. Personally, having seen hundreds of TV and movie Westerns, it's probably a convenient way to memorialize just about every B oater in which the cowboy star gets the girl at the end of the picture and rides off into the proverbial sunset. But then again, in researching the first Academy gathering in 1929, one learns that the Best Picture winner for 'Unique and Artistic Production' went to Fox Studio's Sunrise. So if this was another overt accolade to the original Oscars, it was cleverly done.I guess I'd like to close out by mentioning one more bit of trivia regarding Tom Mix and Wyatt Earp.

This is Disney after all. But it is one of their lesser known films, which is due to it being a worse film than other Disney films. It's not bad, by any means. It's another solid Disney film, I just can't call it a masterpiece.This is basically an adaption of Robin Hood, but with animals portraying the characters. Robin Hood steals from the rich, gives to the poor (with the help of not-so Little John), while King John and his henchmen attempt to arrest and execute him.There are three things that Disney is known for in their animated films Good songs, memorable characters, and romance. Unfortunately, Robin Hood doesn't completely deliver.The songs are a major disappointment compared to Disney's previous work. One or two are decent, but most are forgettable, and unoriginal. The songs are partially saved, however, by a fantastic score, courtesy of George Bruns who previously scored The Jungle Book.The characters are often stereotypes. The King John is cowardly, Robin Hood is cunning and cocky, the sheriff is generically evil, etc. We've seen many of these characters before, and Little John is just WAY too similar to Baloo for comfort (it doesn't help that Phil Harris voices both).But is there romance? Well, yes, but it's not very good. Like the characters, it's very stereotypical, but it still helps to move the story along.So, you're probably asking yourself, right about now, what IS good about Robin Hood? Well, I'm glad you asked.While the characters are stereotypes, the voice acting is superb. Characters are often funny. The action is decent for an animated film.

It's not complex; Robin Hood and Little John rob Prince John. That's all there is to it. But it's funny, and extremely entertaining. In the end, nothing else in the film tops the first act.The animation, is obviously cut-rate. We see repeated character animations, and it's all just very lazy looking.

It's another solid Disney film, I just can't call it a masterpiece.This is basically an adaption of Robin Hood, but with animals portraying the characters. Robin Hood steals from the rich, gives to the poor (with the help of not-so Little John), while King John and his henchmen attempt to arrest and execute him.There are three things that Disney is known for in their animated films Good songs, memorable characters, and romance. Unfortunately, Robin Hood doesn't completely deliver.The songs are a major disappointment compared to Disney's previous work. One or two are decent, but most are forgettable, and unoriginal. The songs are partially saved, however, by a fantastic score, courtesy of George Bruns who previously scored The Jungle Book.The characters are often stereotypes. The King John is cowardly, Robin Hood is cunning and cocky, the sheriff is generically evil, etc. We've seen many of these characters before, and Little John is just WAY too similar to Baloo for comfort (it doesn't help that Phil Harris voices both).But is there romance? Well, yes, but it's not very good.

After last year's mega-successful re-entering into 3D multiplexes, clearly it becomes more urgent for me to cancel it from my unfinished masterpiece list (there are more horrifying ones on my list which I wish I could show it here). THE LION KING is a timeless artwork, it's technical index could not remain its cutting-edge 2D advances in 1994, the story nevertheless is in perfect pitch for audience from every degree of ages, the HAMLET-inspired plot could feasibly find more evocation with adult groups while the colorful appealing is irresistible for youngsters. It's an archetypal win-win Disney Animation. The narrative is tightly intriguing, the O.S.T. is top-notch although I can hardly admit Elton John's voice is agelessly stunning but the tune of CIRCLE OF LIFE nostalgically strikes a chord to me (which serves as my initial introduction to the western pop music region). Another great merit originates from Jeremy Irons' hypnotically appealing British accent, which has transferred so much vigor to his villainous character. Apart from the theatrical outline, the bona fide comedic parts are also generous, the highlight without question belongs to hakuna matata, which has been elevated as a motto of life. By far I could only give the film an 8 out 10, in the future maybe I can procure a second chance with at least a HD version (3D should be spared notwithstanding), THE LION KING is Disney's apex of its 2D journey, and its longevity will testify that animation is an inseparable part of the family tree of film history, and it will always stun us commercially, technically and artistically.

Apparently the film is in the public domain and lots of lousy copies are out there--including the streaming version from Netflix. My advice is to see if the copy from MGM\/Turner Entertainment is better--it should be.As for the film, the casting is quite odd. There is a 30 years difference in the age of Fred Astaire and his on-screen 'sister' Jane Powell. Because of this, the chemistry seems a bit odd and you can't help but being taken out of the moment. Too bad they couldn't have gotten Eleanor Powell out of retirement, as she was as close to Astaire's talents as any woman alive and she was much closer in age to him. Seeing these two amazing dancers together would have been a treat, as she was a match for his athleticism and ability to tap.The film is a re-written account of the life of Astaire and his real life sister, Adele. They were a huge act in the 20s and 30s and much of the film is taken from their lives--including her romance with a British Lord. Of course, being a Hollywood film, it's also stuffed with lots of polish and subplots--and the real story is only a starting point! But considering most folks watch films like this only to watch Fred dance, who cares?! As for the dancing, the film has some very nice numbers. My favorite is the very famous scene where he dances up the walls and on the ceiling in his hotel room--quite the stunt. He also had a nice dance with a hat tree! While the dancing isn't as spectacular, I also enjoyed How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Love You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life. This song and dance number with Powell had amazingly funny lyrics and is the complete antithesis of what you'd expect from the classy and polished Astaire. While it sure ain't subtle, it is entertaining. As for the rest of the songs and Powell's dancing, they are pleasant but unremarkable. Clearly, the focus is on Fred's dancing in this film.As for my summary, I certainly wouldn't consider this to be among Fred Astaire's best. This doesn't mean it's bad--but considering how amazingly perfect his films of the 30s were (such as Top Hot and The Gay Divorcée), this doesn't mean Royal Wedding is a bad film--it's quite enjoyable and has some great moments. Just don't watch it off Netflix or on a horrible public domain copy.By the way, this film has one of the creepiest lines in movie history when, near the end of the film, Fred and Jane tell their handler (Keenan Wynn) that We wanna get married.
