The answer may be painfully clear now that Eps I, II, and III are out - George Lucas never COULD make films. Now, stick with me on this - he didn't have complete control over IV, V, and VI.

It has become evident that, when George is given an unlimited budget and full writing duties, he stops writing and just plays with the computers all day long. Seriously, the movie just Bataan-Death-Marches from one long, pointless CGI sequence to the next, occasionally interspersed with truly stultifying political sequences. Fun, huh? The love story sequences, such as they are, could not be more stilted and awkward. Whatever pleasant, magical nostalgia Lucas didn't ruin in The Phantom Menace, he ruins in this movie.

This movie fails on that count alone - we can't even perform the basic act of choosing sides.

You could say that this is basically like one big marketing video for The Beatles. It shows the four Beatles, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon as themselves, having lots of fun with partying and girls and doing lots of other very immature stuff. And yes, occasionally they of course also perform some of their songs. It probably sounds like something negative but no, I actually like this movie very much. It's simply so much fun to watch throughout!It's a real comedy, that shows The Beatles from their funny sides and the movie does actually feature some fun dialog and good silly comical situations. It stars The Beatles as themselves but please don't think they are not acting and they really lived like that. It's no documentary by any means and it allows The Beatles to show themselves from their funny and artistic side.It's a movie that dates back from the early Beatle years and got made at the verge of their big breakthrough. In that regard this already is a special and musically significant movie to watch. All of The Beatles were still in their early 20's and the movie showed them as rebellious young boys, all doing their own thing and already having their unique sound and style. Even almost 50 years later the songs are still catchy and you don't necessarily have to be a familiar or a big fan to enjoy listening to their songs in this movie. But it's a movie from the early days of The Beatles, so don't expect to hear all of your favorite Beatle songs in this movie. It features some well known songs but most of them just aren't that well known, which is not saying that it are horrible songs though.It by no means is a great done movie though. I mean, stuff is happening really very random in this movie and it obviously was a cheap one to make as well. The movie really thrives on its charismatic 4 leading men and their chemistry together.Not that any of The Beatles were great or natural born actors though. Their acting performances really aren't great but what saves them is that they basically are simply playing themselves, which did not require an awful lot of acting skills obviously.Great fun promotion for The Beatles, from their early days.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"20 April 2011","score":"","review":" This is a rather special and unusual but fun nevertheless, movie.It's really not a typical movie and it doesn't necessarily follow a plot or anything.

It certainly holds the viewers interest, even if it strays into cliché at times.At the beginning of the movie we see an idyllic scene as Josey (Eastwood) and his young son work in the Missouri fields. However tragedy strikes as a militia attached to the Union army attacks their homestead. Wales is knocked unconscious but survives. He awakes to find his home destroyed and his family slaughtered. He resolves to avenge their death and joins a Confederate guerrilla group, seeing this as the best way to find leader of the gang that killed his family. He has become an excellent soldier and is soon one of the senior members of the group.However the war is nearly over and the Josey's group are offered surrender terms. They all accept except for Josey, who is determined to find the men he is looking for or die in the attempt. His comrades are betrayed however and only one survives to escape with Josey. Now they are on the run, with the man he has vowed to kill leading the chase.The rest of them movie is an entertaining chase as Wales meets up with and loses companions along the way. He appears to be able to kill any number of bad guys simultaneously, without getting hurt himself. Perhaps Eastwood lets his ego get the better of him by bestowing the character he plays with almost superhuman powers. Directors licence I suppose you'd call it! The ending is fairly predictable but still satisfying.The cast is very good. Eastwood, as usual, seems to be playing himself. There are some excellent supporting performances, especially from Chief Dan George as a civilised Native American. Bill McKinney plays the bad guy with appropriate relish.
