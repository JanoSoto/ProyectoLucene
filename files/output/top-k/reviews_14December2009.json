[{"date":"14 December 2009","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The big takeaway on Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is how well they danced together. My big takeaway from Shall We Dance is how well they acted.It's one thing to give a good performance in a musical like Carousel or Singing In The Rain, and quite another to deliver amid the creaky jokes, plummy patter, and contrived plot twists that make up Shall We Dance. But they do, and thanks to them, the show turns out not only okay but rather fine.Astaire is a faux-Russian ballet dancer, Petrov, who dreams of pairing up with celebrated tap dancer Linda Keene (Rogers) both on-stage and off. Linda just wants to retire, but Petrov's earnestness begins to win her over - until she is led to believe he is using her. She leaves him just as word spreads that the two are married (and really spreads, in the form of front-page news stories and radio flashes), forcing them to face a surreal prospect.We're the only people in the world who don't think we're married! Linda exclaims.People watching Shall We Dance for the first time need patience. Astaire and Rogers don't dance for an hour, their one musical moment all that time involving walking a dog around a ship in time to a musical theme (provided by one George Gershwin, who did the score with his lyricist brother Ira). Matters are too often dominated by Edward Everett Horton's over-the-top eye rolls and leaden asides as Petrov's snooty, disapproving manager. Later on William Brisbane arrives as Linda's rich-guy suitor, adding more overbaked ham to the menu.But Astaire keeps his end up, dancing to a skipping record or later overplaying a mock Russian accent in his first face-to-face with Linda. You don't want to dance with the great Petrov, he declares, playing up a Slavic superiority trip. Don't be a silly horse. The way he elongates that last o is positively indecent.Some reviewers here say Rogers seems bored in this film. She's playing a withdrawn character, though, and does give off passion when called upon. A big musical moment between her and Astaire, when he declares They Can't Take That Away From Me, is a remarkable duet despite the fact she doesn't sing a note, just looks off with tear-filled eyes. Yet she gets the song's one close-up, and rightly so. When they have their first performance in front of an audience and he dances up a storm by way of an introduction, the look on her face is priceless. What am I supposed to do? she deadpans.Give director Mark Sandrich credit for keeping things light. Too light at times, like when Linda's manager somehow gets a photo of the couple in bed together by using a manikin of her he just happens to have in his closet (better I guess we don't know why he does). Sandrich does make the good scenes better with doses of gentle humor, like the capper to a roller-skating dance that is the movie's best moment. There are some nice dissolves from scene to scene, like a flip-book view of Linda dancing that melts into the real thing.Watching this the first time, the minutes stretched like rubber. The second time things flew much faster, because I knew what I wanted to see and could look forward to its arrival. I guess audiences of the 1930s had that expectation built in, one reason perhaps why these movies were so popular and no one cared when they were a bit inane.

I loved it in college, and thought Woody was a genius. The dialogue and story are still great, the cinematography is beautiful, and New York City shines as a majestic, romantic city. Woody's depiction of the neurotic intellectual elite crowd in Manhattan is entertaining and hilarious.But today I see something sinister here that I didn't twenty years ago. Maybe it has to do with the whole twisted Soon Yi-Mia business that happened in the subsequent years. Maybe it's because now that I'm the age of Ike Davis, I realize how screwed up it is for a guy in his forties to be dating a high school student. Maybe now that I have daughters of my own, I know I'd never want them to get involved with a 42 year-old guy when they were still wearing braces.Strip away the learned banter about Kafka and Bergman, the great black and white shots of the city, the wry, pithy remarks from Ike, and this movie essentially glorifies and presents as healthy what is legally considered statutory rape. If you want to be really blunt about it, you might say that this movie is a pedophile's fantasy. Ike Davis's manipulation and mistreatment of Tracy is ultimately treated as not such a bad thing. Tracy, the pure, sweet, yet sexually wild nymphet (talk about the pedophile's fantasy!) accepts it all, and remains loyal to her 42 year-old man. Ike's constant complaints to his friends about how he realizes Tracy is too young and how he has to get out of the relationship are supposed to show that he's not some predatory sicko but a normal guy who shares the audience's moral perspective.Yet he ultimately discards any concerns he has about the propriety of his relationship with Tracy. He concludes that his relationship with Tracy is the best one he's ever had with a woman and wants her to cancel her 6-month trip to London so she can get back together with him. She tells Ike that had he come to her a week earlier, she might have considered it. But not to worry, says Tracy What's six months if we both love each other?. Despite Ike having cheated on her, dumped her, and repeatedly told her that he's unwilling to commit to her, Tracy still regards him as her true love. So again, it's the pedophile's fantasy this isn't an abusive, inappropriate relationship--it's true love! Ike's mistreatment of Tracy and taking advantage of her childlike naïveté is not morally wrong--see, she still loves him and wants more! The best partner for a 42 year-old accomplished intellectual man is not an accomplished intellectual woman the same age like Diane Keaton's character--no, it's a girl in high school! I read an article in the NY Times recently about how, given the increased awareness of sexual abuse of children that has emerged since 1979, a movie like Manhattan could never get made today. That's probably not such a bad thing. Back in the 80s, I read a glowing review of Manhattan that talked about Ike Davis's smile in the final scene when Tracy tells him he has to have a little more faith in people. That smile was so profound, said the reviewer, the perfect expression of the complex emotions in the lives of these elite intellectual New Yorkers. I agreed with the reviewer 20 years ago. But when I re-watched the movie the other day, all I could think was that if it was my daughter this guy was preying on, if I saw that smile I'd want to punch him in the face.

I cannot see why so many think this is a great movie of sorts. It seems like a major waste of time. Mr. Altman appears to be a director who doesn't like to direct. He give his actors free reign and they are just actors. I wish I could jump on the band wagon and say this is a masterpiece but I cannot. It seems like a bowl of salad chosen from the salad bar at Ruby Tuesdays. I wish he took more time to make this work. I also was not impressed with the terrible lyrics of of some of the songs. I'm Easy was a hit song I remember in the 70's and I think it's a great tune. the rest of them are parodies of the country music genre. It don't worry me has a great hook to it but the sentiment is wistful and contradictory. The last scene was so predictable with the guy carrying the violin case everywhere. Elliot Gould's appearance is just a signature of anything goes and all are welcome in the non plotted movie. Altman almost seems to be writing television for a 1\/2 hour drama and he just reaches beyond sense. M*A*S*H was the same formula that worked because of subject matter and better improvisational actors. I would pass on this movie as a milestone in American cinema. I'm not even sure if Jeff Golblum was just another guest he threw in for nothing. I must say that the real actors did what they do best. They made omelets out of a rotten egg. Tomlin, Caradine, Beatty, Gibson, and a few more tried to hold our attention but it seemed like an ironic car wreck where we try to make some sense out of it. As usual, Altman has an actress disrobe for no reason but to draw an adult rating and win those of us who need to see breasts at least once in a movie. It's amazing how Hollywood can praise it's own view of the real world and think everyone should come along for the condescending rhetoric.

Tomlin, Caradine, Beatty, Gibson, and a few more tried to hold our attention but it seemed like an ironic car wreck where we try to make some sense out of it. As usual, Altman has an actress disrobe for no reason but to draw an adult rating and win those of us who need to see breasts at least once in a movie. It's amazing how Hollywood can praise it's own view of the real world and think everyone should come along for the condescending rhetoric.

Things get complicated which could thwart their plans to raise the needed cash, but The Blues Brothers will find away because they're on a mission for God. One thing's for certain, a LOT of property and vehicles will be damaged\/destroyed along the way, particularly in the climax as Joliet and Elwood must outrun the law enforcement, an angered country music band on tour in their Winnebago, and a group of disgruntled Illinois Nazis! Yep, Chicago and the outskirts of the city will lend itself to quite a few vehicle skirmishes as the Blues leave much destruction in their wake, with no mall, street corner, or highway safe. Director John Landis proves here he can sure develop impressive musical set pieces and has some talented performers(..like James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles just to name a few)to work with. You could say that The Blues Brothers was a precursor of sorts to Landis' masterpiece, Michael Jackson's Thriller.But, the movie seems to live and breathe on the Blues Brothers evading those out to get them with cars of all kinds driving through buildings and windows, as if you were watching some sort of implausible live-action loony toons cartoon with adults instead of artistically rendered animals. I've never seen so many police cars stockpiling on top of each other. Between this and Smokey and the Bandit, I can just imagine the millions spent on vehicles purchased just for wildly orchestrated stunts where they are used primarily as bumper cars. And, the inclusion of the foxy Carrie Fisher as a vengeful young woman out to kill Joliet for reasons we discover towards the end, including one dynamic sequence where she detonates Elwood's minuscule apartment with walls and ceiling caving in yet the Blues escape unscathed! And, how could one not forget the attempts of The Blues Brother Band to win over a raucous bar full of hicks gathered to hear country music(..the only song they can come up with to appease the crowd is Rawhide!). Under the suit, tie, hats, and dark shades, Belushi and Aykroid, are understated as can possibly be considering the hi-jinx that result from their choices, and it's because of this clash between their behavior and the madness around them that really makes the movie work. The Pinto scene where Henry Gibson and one of his Nazi followers fall from a high distance in the sky is a riot(..particularly the landing!)as is the sequence where the Blues finally arrive at the bank in the hopes of paying for the orphanage, regarding the fate of their long-suffering car. Marvelous musical number for Cab Calloway as he and the band members await for the Blues arrival from numerous hardships that kept them from getting to the theater on time for the concert. I definitely recommend, that is if you are like the one person who hasn't seen this as of yet, preparing to suspend disbelief because this movie is beyond the realm of realism.

Now, despite the bland characterization of the Prince-not to mention his stiff drawn movements which caused the animators to reduce his role-and the female title character only marginally better personality-wise, this is still a very entertaining initial attempt at an animated feature from the Disney studio. That's largely due to the way each of the Seven Dwarfs become charmingly charismatic in their personalities due to both movements and voices. I mean, Dopey is the perfect Harpo-like character with the way he communicates without saying a word (though we do hear him express shock and sadness when those moments appear, courtesy of Eddie Collins). Also perfect are the characterizations of Sneezy-with Laurel & Hardy player Billy Gilbert doing his iconic sneeze-and Grumpy-with Goofy creator Pinto Colvig giving his grouch a touch of likability that makes one identify with him. And Lucille La Verne is just suitably atmospheric voicing both the mean Queen stepmother of White and that Queen's later change to the Witch. While Ms. White is not a vibrant personality, she still has some naive charm that makes it understandable why the Dwarfs, even eventually Grumpy, fall for her. That's all due to her voice of Adriana Caselotti when she's both singing and speaking. It's too bad Mr. Disney didn't allow her to do any further outside work (though it's nice to know her voice can be heard in both 1939's The Wizard of Oz-as part of the Tin Man's thought-and my favorite film of It's a Wonderful Life-as a singer in the Martini's Bar sequence). Many classic sequences include the Heigh Ho number, Grumpy's bath, the Queen's transformation, and the chase sequence involving the Dwarfs, the forest animals, and the Witch Queen's attempted escape. So on that note, while I don't think this movie is one of the best animated features-Disney or otherwise-ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is still pretty compelling as such things go. P.S.

The first is that it both honored the genre of the crime drama and simultaneously took every one of its time-honored conventions and gleefully ripped them to pieces. The second is that this multi-faceted character-driven action picture, which is so tight and so seamless (while still managing to be jaw-droppingly original in its execution) could be the work of a (for all intents and purposes) a debut director.People accuse Tarantino of writing scripts full of sensationalized dialog (it sounds cool but people would never really talk that way).

We want to know what drives these guys, and after seeing the movie, we do. We may not like what we see, but we never look away whether in boredom or disbelief. These are not cardboard action figures.How Tarantino plays this rich cast of rogues against each other and the constant switches in narrative time-line is strategic and fascinating. Yes, it's been done before, in other films, but rarely to this great of effect.And that may be the most impressive thing about this movie it does what all truly great indies do best...they economize toward the betterment of the picture. Every frame here adds something...even the blank frames where all you hear is Steven Wright's wonderfully adenoidal mumble as he exhorts you to attend the next Monster Truck Extravaganza. That undoubtedly lowbrow event fits the seamy world the picture revolves in perfectly.This film is just as unmissable, and once you see it, assure yourself it will be only for the first time.

But oh, what a glorious heave.There are two things right off that make RD so astounding. The first is that it both honored the genre of the crime drama and simultaneously took every one of its time-honored conventions and gleefully ripped them to pieces. The second is that this multi-faceted character-driven action picture, which is so tight and so seamless (while still managing to be jaw-droppingly original in its execution) could be the work of a (for all intents and purposes) a debut director.People accuse Tarantino of writing scripts full of sensationalized dialog (it sounds cool but people would never really talk that way).

In the case for what I thought was the granddaddy of all Submarine movies, The Hunt For Red October, it's been many years. Like 15.I saw The Hunt For Red October when it first came out, and a couple of years following. To this day, Baldwin remains my favorite of all the Jack Ryans. And I loved Sean Connery and the grandness of the movie. But for some reason, this viewing, many years later in 2009, just didn't hold up to memory.Sure, it's a great film. Connery and Baldwin, and the rest of the cast are at their best. The dialogue, cinematography and the intrigue is still wonderful. But it's the mission that drives me batty.We have CIA analyst Ryan (Baldwin) who's absolutely convinced, and just on a hunch, that submarine Captain Extraordinaire, Ramius is attempting to defect via the Red October he stole. The whole Russian naval fleet is after him and the Americans are getting involved. Ryan will stop at nothing to prove he's right, not for ego, but to save Ramius and more lives.There. I pretty much summed up the entire movie in 62 words. Honestly, it's more complex than that, and I would highly, make that strongly, recommend this movie to all. If there is just one Clancy\/Jack Ryan movie you see, you must absolutely see this one. Though Clear & Present Danger is also very good, this is the top notch one.Some of the best qualities the acting, score, dialogue, cinematography, suspense, realism, Connery's always one step ahead of the game and Baldwin shows true range. On a personal note, instead of pesky subtitles, they simply transfer from Russian to English in a quick zoom-in. I loved that.Some of the bad the graphics were not top notch, and even on Bluray; it's funny looking to watch some of the torpedoes. You're supposed to side with Ramius, however (no spoiler since it happens in the first 15, of many, minutes) he down-right murders (in cold blood) a man who might and I stress MIGHT disagree with him. Since that happens right away, it's hard to really warm up to this lost soul who you're supposed to root for. Also, Ramius's secret agenda seems really elaborate until the end. So, yeah, they redeemed themselves in the closing, but it was like someone wanting to prove a roller coaster was defective so you get twenty people aboard and hope for the best. There are better ways to defect or prove as point.That all said, again, I would recommend it. Director McTiernan is known for more action movies, I.E. Die Hard and Predator. This one is hardly any action at all &#x96; you'd see more battles in a Lifetime movie. But, for good intrigue, great performances and some real good cinematography, you should see this movie.

The plot certainly didn't provide anything we haven't seen a hundred times already. It had a gritty, dirty feel to it so if the director was trying to get that across then he succeeded in this point.The script was rather corny at times, perhaps because that was the way movies were made in this period but perhaps also because it was trying to show mountain people. If I was a member of that community I would have been embarrassed to have been portrayed this way but perhaps that is just my ignorance as a foreigner.One of the worthwhile reasons for seeing this movie is to catch a glimpse of some very well known actors before they hit mainstream popularity. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play rather wooden characters which sadly doesn't allow a hint of their talents to shine through. Neeson is excellent and quite believable as a scruffy looking mountain guy. The most out of place actor would be Ben Stiller. Knowing him as we do today it is just hard to take him seriously so in retrospect he is very miscast.The action is pretty dull by today's standards which might have been okay if the plot was complex and the characters well developed. Unfortunately, it makes for a somewhat boring experience. I found the tiny hints of life in the Appalachian Mountains very interesting. If this movie was remade with more emphasis on their culture and the problems they face then it could be an extremely interesting movie, perhaps showing the community in a way similar to how Witness gave a glimpse at Amish life.As it stands, though, it is really just a late night TV movie or for fans of Swayze.

It had a gritty, dirty feel to it so if the director was trying to get that across then he succeeded in this point.The script was rather corny at times, perhaps because that was the way movies were made in this period but perhaps also because it was trying to show mountain people. If I was a member of that community I would have been embarrassed to have been portrayed this way but perhaps that is just my ignorance as a foreigner.One of the worthwhile reasons for seeing this movie is to catch a glimpse of some very well known actors before they hit mainstream popularity. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play rather wooden characters which sadly doesn't allow a hint of their talents to shine through. Neeson is excellent and quite believable as a scruffy looking mountain guy. The most out of place actor would be Ben Stiller. Knowing him as we do today it is just hard to take him seriously so in retrospect he is very miscast.The action is pretty dull by today's standards which might have been okay if the plot was complex and the characters well developed. Unfortunately, it makes for a somewhat boring experience. I found the tiny hints of life in the Appalachian Mountains very interesting. If this movie was remade with more emphasis on their culture and the problems they face then it could be an extremely interesting movie, perhaps showing the community in a way similar to how Witness gave a glimpse at Amish life.As it stands, though, it is really just a late night TV movie or for fans of Swayze.

An attempt by Spielberg to emulate Frank Capra, the film's also heavily influenced by Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death and, to a lesser extent, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire.Always was bashed by critics upon release, many stating that the film's elaborate action sequences detracted from its central romance. But the truth is probably also the opposite Always needs a lot more noise and special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point. His second feature-length foray into the world of comedy, Always is mostly unfunny. Spielberg's idea of humour is 1950s screwballs and early Looney Tunes cartoons, a style for which he personally has no gift. The film's surprisingly heavy-handed, every emotion overplayed, every joke over designed, every sequence filled with unnecessary business. And as he's unable to handle human beings, and certainly not intimacy, the film's central romance is awkward. Holly and Dreyfuss come across as brother and sister rather than lovers, she a wisecracking tomboy, he a wisecracking old-man. Spielberg's repeatedly stated that he considers himself different from the other brat pack directors of the 1970s, in that he is an optimist and humanist. But he's probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their supposed intentions, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. The failure of Spielberg to connect with any of the characters in Always, and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, bullets, genocide, rocks etc...this is what Spielberg delights in. The moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. A film like Amistad failed with audiences, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.In many ways, Spielberg's box-office flops are more illuminating than his more successful films. They reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when its not working, revealing the vacuum beneath the machinery. Indeed, it was flops like Always and Hook which taught Spielberg how to con audiences. After a series of colourful, gooey films, Spielberg dumped the gooey cinematography of Color Purple and Empire of the Sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of Schindler's List, Munich, Private Ryan and Minority Report. From here on, less light, dark cinematography and pops of violence became equated with serious topics. Ironically, after the financial success of each dark film, Spielberg reverts back to his rosy cinematography (and a brazenly sentimental tone), and falls flat on his face once again. These colour films (Always, Hook, War Horse etc) are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but his serious films are the same, their kitsch is just hidden by noise and desaturation.4\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.
