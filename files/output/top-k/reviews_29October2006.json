I truly enjoyed the sharp-witted and faster-on-the-trigger, agile hit-man that John proved to be in Grosse Point Blank.I like the way he is, thinking about his life and pondering what it is that he is doing now and will do in the future. He doesn't mis-focus either. Even under heavy handed pressure from the competition. Sincerely, Dr. Oatman, (Arkin) is masterfully the frustrated, out of answers for the patient, Psychiatrist that he has run out of patience with that patient, and never really wanted in the first place.

I'm 17, was born in '89, and saw this film six years ago, and loved it ever since.Being 11 when I first saw this film, I only liked the gore and cool shark scenes. Being older and a bigger appreciator of cinema, I understand the amazingness and complexity that goes into this movie. If you are anything more than the average movie-goer, you know this movie is more than a Dun-dun-duh! Shark is killing everyone! Dun-dun-duh! The movie is about the responsibilities of the town's police chief and a marine biologist. Or, more simply, it's about characters. Without the amazingly written characters, this film would probably be nothing.The characters are what drive the plot of the movie. The characters are so amazingly written that some of the most memorable scenes in the film don't involve the shark at all. The boat night scene is one of my all-time favorite scenes in movie history. In case you can't remember, it's the scene in which Hooper and Quint share the scars they've received in shark hunting, then Quint tells his story of being on the USS Indianapolis, and the men sing Show me the way to go home. The scene provides laughs, chills, and tears. Laughs at the cracks the men make while showing scars, chills when you hear Quint's terrifying story on the sinking boat, and tears when you feel the men's desolation on the boat as they sing. And you thought this was a shark movie.But I don't say that in mockery of the movie's shark scenes. The shark is what drives the movie and it provides some of the greatest horror moments in cinematic history. The shark, nicknamed Bruce, is one of my all-time favorite horror icons. But although this movie is driven by and focused on a shark, I do not think it's right to consider this a shark movie. Again, it's about characters reacting to the shark, and how they try to live their lives with this fear of the unknown in the water. Creating a story in that context, creating a movie not about the creature, but the FEAR and the COPING of the creature...that is a challenge. Steven Spielberg, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Benchley...all the writers participated, they delivered that concept in the perfect way ever done.

THAT, as much as Hearst's campaign to prohibit Citizen Kane from being distributed to theaters (he even tried to buy the original print from RKO, but it was owned outright by Welles), no doubt hampered his being able to get funding for future work.I am amazed that people consider 1941 as having been in the dark-ages of film-making......wouldn't 1921 be a more appropriate era ? There were many wonderful movies made before 1941....Gone with the Wind ?? Kane's re-release in 1950 - after ten years of rampant curiosity over the controversy about it - had as much to do with its popularity as Welles' brilliance, simply because black-and-white movies were old-hat by then. I'm sure I saw its original release, but I don't recall being smitten with anything near best picture I've ever seen. I guess I also saw it on TV; same comment. It wasn't until 2006 that I bought the VHS from eBay.........I've watched it twice since then (once last night) - and while I certainly agree it's a great movie - I truly can't say I'm flabbergasted by it. Maybe the DVD will give me a greater appreciation for it. I saw the floral Rosebud on the kid's sled and recognized all through the movie Kane was looking for the happpiness he could never buy with all his money. He was ruthlessly narcissistic.Am I mistaken that Kane's mother (Agnes Moorehead) gave him up to Thatcher (George Coulouris) after the property they owned became worth a lot of money - like gold ??? - 75 million would have made him a billionaire, today. I DID like the opera-scenes, and suffered right along with Susan Kane (Dorothy Comingore), off-pitch and all. I'm impressed that this movie was Joseph Cotten's (Jed Leland) American debut as I am with Welles. Ruth Warwick (Emily Kane) impressed me not, but was good for the role. Ray Collins' (Boss Gettys) acting was right-on, as was Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstine (?). The cinematography was great, but some camera-angles had been used in other movies.As for Welles' aging make-up, does anyone remember the fantastic make-up jobs done by Lon Chaney in his horror-films - Phantom of the Opera? I have to constantly remind myself that people who are younger than the film usually are more easily astounded than we older folk are, who have seen it all develop. I'm sure I'd have to argue with Citizen Kane being proclaimed as NUMBER ONE on any list - my enjoyment is mine, others' are respected, but it has no influence on me. The movie did not make me cry, I wasn't shocked, I wasn't frightened, I wasn't impressed with everything looking so huge and forbidding; in other words, I've enjoyed other movies more. I only mourn that artists get so wrapped-up in themselves - as Welles was - they are their own worst enemies.Declaring movies (and movie-making) as being perfect and the best film ever are different for every individual. It's my opinion a lot of that is because Welles had total control of the film - he must have done an amazing acting-job to get that privilege.

I'm sure I'd have to argue with Citizen Kane being proclaimed as NUMBER ONE on any list - my enjoyment is mine, others' are respected, but it has no influence on me. The movie did not make me cry, I wasn't shocked, I wasn't frightened, I wasn't impressed with everything looking so huge and forbidding; in other words, I've enjoyed other movies more. I only mourn that artists get so wrapped-up in themselves - as Welles was - they are their own worst enemies.Declaring movies (and movie-making) as being perfect and the best film ever are different for every individual. It's my opinion a lot of that is because Welles had total control of the film - he must have done an amazing acting-job to get that privilege. It doesn't mean that he didn't have many techs working with him. Bravo! to all, but most of that greatest obsession is uncalled for, in my opinion.

In the early going, would you have thrown the German overboard, or acted as a humanitarian? What about later, after Willy (Walter Slezak) is exposed as a scheming Nazi captain deftly maneuvering the boat to his own country's supply ship? Would you have the stomach to assist in cutting off a man's leg? The movie doesn't allow much time to think about it, but that's how life works sometimes.The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release, however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character, it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause. Fearing even further backlash, Fox studio head Darryl Zanuck withdrew the film from general release. To my mind, the issue was dealt with rather expertly in the story. Even though Willy was a cunning schemer who took control of the boat during a storm, he sealed his own fate by going too far to keep Gus (William Bendix) quiet.Hitchcock accepted a rather difficult task in taking on this assignment. Restricted to just one set, he employed what was until then the most extensive story boarding ever utilized for a movie. The entire movie was drawn out ahead of time, with a myriad of camera angles and weather related elements to convey something different in practically each scene. It works exceptionally well, as one is never left bored with static images or a fixation on any single character or situation.As for characters, the one cast member with any name recognition at the time was Tallulah Bankhead, who portrayed the journalist Constance Porter. Bankhead was extremely difficult for the other players to work with, and she lorded her celebrity status over all of them. Staffers on the film were intimidated by her name dropping, yet in Hitchcock, she found a kindred spirit, someone she could talk with endlessly on the set.For those who scour Hitch's films for his cameo appearances, Lifeboat presented a dilemma, but that was overcome with a little gimmickry. During this time, Hitchcock was trying to lose weight, succeeding in going from three hundred pounds down to two hundred. In the movie, Kovac (John Hodiak) is shown reading a newspaper, and the camera lingers on an ad for 'Reduco', a weight loss product and 'Obesity Slayer'. The director's full frame profile is used for the before and after comparison, prompting numerous viewers of the time to inquire where they could buy the product, but of course it was all made up.If ever there was a film that employs symbolism, this one is a treasure trove. It was interesting to me that the first time one gets a view of the entire open sea is right after it's revealed that Mrs. Higley's (Heather Angel) baby is dead. That effectively places the boat's survivors in touch with their own mortality in what might be a hopeless situation. What does it mean when the lone black Joe (Canada Lee) doesn't participate in the gang up on Willy? Gus changes his name from Schmidt to Smith. The prospect of life giving fresh rain is replaced by sunshine instead of a storm, but which is better? There is something meaningful and fascinating to be taken away from this film in virtually every instance.If all that weren't enough, it was an unusual coincidence of timing that had me see this film when I did.

The film revolves around Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled woman who goes to the supposedly haunted Hill House for a research experiment for the paranormal. The house has a grim and dark history of deaths and suicides, which sets an eerie tone to the entire place. While more and more time is spent in the old darkened mansion, the group of people in the experiment find themselves terrorized by a malevolent force within the house that refuses to stop until it gets what it wants.The most remarkable thing about The Haunting is what it doesn't show you. We never see any ghosts, we never see any monsters or ghouls, no violence or bloodshed whatsoever. All we see is furniture moving, doors slamming shut, and we hear odd whispers and sounds - mainly what enthusiasts of supernatural phenomena would call poltergeist activity. Yet this has no effect on the film's shock factor, because it is equally scary. It leaves the majority of the terrifying images to our imagination, which is a lot scarier than displaying to us a bunch of moaning translucent ghouls walking around darkened hallways. Rather then show us the ghosts, everything is implicated, and these implications are probably scarier than the ghosts themselves. From that standpoint alone, this film is brilliant.Complimenting that is the spooky, classic-style story, based on Shirley Jackon's equally creepy novel. The acting was all very polished, Julie Harris was excellent in the lead and played her character perfectly, and the camera-work was all very well done. The film is also in black and white, which also gives it the vintage haunted-house feel. I love old black and white films like this, there's something about the absence of color that adds a certain texture. One of my favorite scenes from this movie would have to be where the group is huddled in the bedroom, when the door begins to cave in under the pressure of the force outside. It was truly frightening, and likely one of the scariest moments in the film.Overall, The Haunting is a superior horror movie, and is definitely among the best haunted house films of all time. It's pretty amazing when a film can relentlessly scare you without hardly showing you anything at all. This and The Innocents are both the best haunted house films I've seen - I can't decide which is better, but they both have great things to offer. Recommended to fans of contemporary, old fashioned horror, because most of today's audiences will probably find it too boring. 10\/10.

I am a fan of Danny Boyle's work from Transpotting to 28 Days Later. A Life Less Ordinary has a lot of aspects that Boyle later used in his child fairy-tale Millions from inventive camera tricks to a melding of fantasy sequences with reality. The main thing taken from this viewing however is the tragedy that Ewan McGregor and Boyle may never work together again. Ewan proves here again to have done some of his best work, and the work that got him noticed, with his old friend and producing partner. It is a real shame that after their differences, stemming from Boyle's casting of Leo DiCaprio instead of McGregor on The Beach, causes their creativity to never join again. At least we have some great films to show from it while it lasted.McGregor's and Cameron Diaz's characters are fated to fall in love. God has deemed it so and the chief of police in Heaven has got his best team on the job to make sure it happens. Unfortunately for them, the hysterical Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter, if they fail at their job they must stay on Earth forever. Let's just say they think out of the box and do everything in their powers to make love strike. After a botched powertrip turns into a kidnapping, McGregor soon finds that his victim is starting to call the shots in order to make the crime successful. Comedy ensues as the two leads go on their journey to get back at Diaz's rich father and make some money in the mean time. Whether their time together results in a Cupid's arrow sort of love remains to be seen, but as the two orchestrate the crime while Heaven's police conduct the circumstances, the audience just goes along for the ride.Boyle uses an enormous cast of great actors that come and go through the proceedings. Stanley Tucci is fantastic, Tony Shaloub is great in a role that at first seemed unbelievably wasted, but, in a turn like that of Silent Bob in Chasing Amy, comes through with the poignant and funny anecdote needed to continue the plot, and Timothy Olyphant is a welcome face and humorous in a very bit part. The sheer number of cameos are too many to mention, but Maury Chaykin deserves singling out as the hick country man who's simple mind adds many laughs, including the song and dance number he introduces with McGregor and Diaz singing Beyond the Sea. While filled with clichés and homage galore, the film moves along at a fast pace utilizing each aspect to full effect creating a satire on both the kidnap and romantic comedy genres. We even get treated to a reenactment of the memorable Tim Roth\/Harvey Keitel getaway scene from Reservoir Dogs. The film gets everything right with pitch-perfect timing and tongue-in-cheek acting mixed with some real emotional performances when called upon. Every song enhances the visuals on screen, especially a nicely placed REM tune while our characters are in peril. Even the claymation ending credit sequence is a joy to watch.Boyle proves to me here that he can do it all the gritty drug lifestyle drama, the romantic comedy, the socially conscious zombie kill spree, and the family-friendly morality tale. Those are just the ones I've seen from his filmography, so it will be a pleasure to see how he continues on his string of successes without yet going to the same well. We'll see how his first foray into the science fiction genre turns out when Sunshine is released in the coming months. While he and old friend McGregor had a great run, we can always hope that one day they will reconcile and bring us that sequel to Trainspotting that has been bandied about the rumormill.

FACT. it is that type of horror film that will set the standards for any other horror films.In my opinion John Carpenter got the tension and suspense just right because in the process he has created one iconic character in the form of the malevolent and psychopathic serial killers known only as Michael Myers. This film should be in every Film lover's D.V.D or video collection because you will not find a better horror movie that features a serial killer. Throughout the film the tension is always built up. However, throughout the film there is always a brooding atmosphere that is continually built up towards the final and scariest scene. Donald Pleasance is outstanding as Dr Loomis and in my opinion is as sinister as Michael Myers even though he is there to help our heroine. However, he and Michael Myers are my favourite characters in the film because they have more of an impact on me. I like the whole Heroine in Danger routine but I just do not think that you will find a better Rivalry in Horror films compared to that of Dr Loomis and Michael Myers. The idyllic setting of this film is even the more terrifying because it looks safe and the sun is always shining and it looks like a friendly neighbourhood that in my opinion is more scary than the film always taking place at night. Jamie Leigh Curtis is the best heroine who has ever been on film. none can surpass her as the greatest scream queen(in my opinion)not even Marian Crane from Psycho Michael Myers is the best serial killer in film because he is a lot more sinister and scary than Jason Voorhees. And he is still scary in all the films he has done compared to Freddy Krueger who just became a shadow of his former self. In my opinion Michael Myers is the better character because he, unlike many serial killers is motiveless and is a lot more terrifying than any of the other serial killers in horror films. In conclusion, I believe that Halloween is the best horror film because it is scary and terrifying and it is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen and I am proud to have this film on D.V.D.

In my opinion Michael Myers is the better character because he, unlike many serial killers is motiveless and is a lot more terrifying than any of the other serial killers in horror films.

FACT. it is that type of horror film that will set the standards for any other horror films.In my opinion John Carpenter got the tension and suspense just right because in the process he has created one iconic character in the form of the malevolent and psychopathic serial killers known only as Michael Myers. This film should be in every Film lover's D.V.D or video collection because you will not find a better horror movie that features a serial killer. Throughout the film the tension is always built up. However, throughout the film there is always a brooding atmosphere that is continually built up towards the final and scariest scene. Donald Pleasance is outstanding as Dr Loomis and in my opinion is as sinister as Michael Myers even though he is there to help our heroine. However, he and Michael Myers are my favourite characters in the film because they have more of an impact on me. I like the whole Heroine in Danger routine but I just do not think that you will find a better Rivalry in Horror films compared to that of Dr Loomis and Michael Myers. The idyllic setting of this film is even the more terrifying because it looks safe and the sun is always shining and it looks like a friendly neighbourhood that in my opinion is more scary than the film always taking place at night.

Its picturesque, yellow images of Sicily during World War II, combined with its tender, true-to-life writing, paint a very lively portrait of a small town in war-torn Italy, of the Catholic, conservative, and sexually inhibited townspeople, and of their intolerance towards a beautiful, single woman, Malèna (the exquisitely alluring Monica Bellucci). It is both hilarious at times, in its dramatic portrayal of Italian family life and a young boy's sexual awakening, and sadly moving at others, in its intimate depiction of Malèna's suffering and courage a great movie for a thoughtful evening.If you have not yet seen the movie, you may wish to stop reading here.I think what makes this movie so powerful is Giuseppe Tornatore's artful adaptation of Luciano Vincenzioni's story, in which he captures on multiple levels the essential conflict of the film between conservatism and sexuality, and the physical brutality of restraint towards dissenters. On one level, a young boy is discovering the urges of sexuality, and his family is outraged by his dirtiness. They are very physical in their display of disapproval, although their melodramatic yelling and abuse is portrayed in a comical light. On another level, an unfortunate woman, who loses her husband (so she believes) and father, and is single in a culture where respectable women must be attached to men, suffers exploitation due to her poverty and vulnerability by the hands of lusty, hypocritical townsmen. The envious women of the town are also very physical in their expression of disapproval, and even more cruel than the men. In a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business, the word of the people is the word of God, and those who don't fit in with the culture are brutally punished. The third expression of this theme is shown through the Fascist politics at the time, where young boys do institutionalized calisthenics under the guidance of totalitarian propaganda, where the omni-present military dictates what is right and dissent is physically forbidden, and where the hypocrisy of the soldiers is seen through their avid use of prostitution, and exemplified by the actions of Lieutenant Cadel (Marcello Catalano), who visits Malèna with romantic intentions, then abandons her and denies their relationship when she is brought to court in shame. Such hypocrisy and harsh enforcement of uniformity can be seen in multiple instances throughout the film.The defiance of this enforced conformity is what director Giuseppe Tornatore defines as courage. Malèna, who is a pariah in her Sicilian community, is repeatedly called courageous by protagonist Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), and her courage ultimately becomes respected by members of her community. By observing Malèna's life, Renato also gains some of her courage. A key coming-of-age moment for Renato is when he knocks over the bust of Mussolini, breaking his skull, and in return, as promised, gets new pants from his father, an acknowledgment of growth. More crucially, Renato slowly overcomes his habit of passively spying on Malèna's life without coming to her aid. In the beginning of the film, he quietly witnesses all the wrongs done to her without defending her, but towards the end, he decides to take action and help her, and thus defies the popular opinion of his community, by writing to her husband of her whereabouts. At the end of the movie, he even physically helps her pick up the fruit she has dropped and musters the courage to speak to her, wishing her good luck. His change from being a passive witness of exploitation to someone who actively and anonymously defends the victimized Malèna shows a crucial growth in his character. Similarly, his love for her changes from one of horny adolescent obsession to a more mature respect and tender embrace of her whole person (not merely her very fine ass.) Monica Ballucci is only portrayed naked in an erotic manner in the earlier scenes of the movie; later her nakedness is the effect of violence not amour.My only criticism for this film lies in the limited portrayal of Malèna's character. She is shown as purely a victim of her environment. Tornatore does not develop her to the same extent as he develops Renato, and the viewer does not know much more about Malèna than what the spying Renato can show through hole-peeping and bike-stalking. We don't reach any real understanding of Malèna's private thoughts and decisions. She is the virtuous and the victimized; every wrong she commits, she commits because she is forced to, because of poverty or sexual harassment. She is not truly a dissenter against the popular opinions of her community in that she seems to have no choice but to act in the way that she does. She is the classic whore with a heart of gold, what I believe to be a somewhat simplistic prototype of a beautiful and sexually deviant woman.Overall, this movie is utterly captivating, and intensely thought-provoking. It has elicited quite a long prattle from me (I humbly submit my thoughts), and I hope it will do even more so for you.

Besides, it is maestro F.W. Murnau who adapted Goethe's marvelous FAUST to screen in 1926. Finally, it is him who, not having any serious reference to how a horror film was being made, proved unbelievable brilliant uniqueness of thrill through the still classic horror, constantly a prospect film for all scary movies, NOSFERATU. We have a number of horrors nowadays... yet, NOSFERATU is still enjoyed by viewers galore... is that not an interesting phenomenon? Of course, the period of time which has passed since the premiere of the film is huge and, as a result, there may be some people who will dislike the movie after all these years no camera movement, silent performances which tend to constitute overacting with overgesticulation (from today's perspective), undeveloped cinematography. Nevertheless, I think that because of the movie's old age, it has a stronger sense of suspicion and mystery nowadays than it used to have decades ago. I still absolutely admire this film for its constant power to thrill and shock while the awareness that the movie is more than 80 years old additionally thrills me. Modern horrors are, generally, so unoriginal and similar in their conventions that there is still no movie that could be compared to Murnau's 1922 masterpiece. How come that a movie made in the early 1920s with limited filming techniques can thrill the 21 century viewers?

If this doesn't make you hate war, it is safe to say that nothing will. I watched the remake of '79 before this, and that allows me to draw comparisons(something which the high quality of both films demands). Certain decisions were made in the case of either film being produced; creative calls. Both versions have something that the other doesn't. On the whole, I'd say that this includes more of the most important scenes, apart from two major decisions(in the field of editing and revealing of information... how much the audience is allowed to know and at what point) at the end. Also, one scene close to the end wasn't included in this one, and it proved to be powerful in the later version. The plot is great, and it evolves at an excellent speed. The pacing, in general, works much better than that of the latter film. It's dreary when that works in the context of what's going on, intense when it needs to be and you're never bored. I couldn't take my eyes off the film for a single second. The acting is for the very most part exceptional, though there is some noticeable overacting(almost certainly due to the fact that this was so soon after sound came to movies... the actors simply weren't that accustomed to speaking yet). It hurts the film a little bit, but it's easily ignored.

And yeah, they're right, the film is lightweight, and yes the production design and cinematography does take precedence over story and characterisation, but when the surface is as good as it is in this, I'm able to forgive the film's numerous shortcomings.What I enjoy most about Dick Tracy, rather obviously, is its visual sense. It really does capture the feeling of a comic, throwing dreary reality out of the window. And although the fabulous use of colour usually gets the most attention, I enjoy the photography more &#150; there are some absolutely wonderful deep focus shots in the film that frame the action perfectly like a live comic book. And I also love the cityscapes and the matte shots &#150; they never look remotely real, but that's not the point, they're just meant to look gorgeous&#133;which they do.Of course, with so much attention focused on the look of the film, it would be easy for the characters to get lost in the mix. And while the film never really provides us with any real meat to sink our teeth into, it does provide us with an enjoyably understated hero and a likable heroine. And the film, curiously enough, in its relationship between Tracy (Warren Beatty) and Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), actually has quite a bit of heart. Their scenes, far from being an annoying distraction, prove to be some of the best.Far less enjoyable are the scenes between Tracy and Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). They're meant to be sexy, but Madonna can't act, so they become rather tiresome. And it's notable that of the two female characters, the supposed Plain Jane Tess Trueheart actually comes across as sexier &#150; Madonna comes across as whining Barbie doll with a bad haircut while Headly has a bit of zip to her.I also dislike some of the songs that are used in the film. A couple are integrated in a way that doesn't annoy, but there's a particularly loathsome duet between Madonna and her piano player that grates. However, there is one rather fabulous musical scene that sees Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) leading the rehearsals in the nightclub he's taken over. He sings, he dances and he abuses the singers, and just when you think he's satisfied, he tells everyone to start over from the beginning. And then when the piano player starts moaning, he slams the lid down on his fingers. It's obvious Pacino is having a lot of fun with the role. (In the same scene he also gets to slap Madonna, which must be something that a lot of people secretly wish they could do.)And Pacino is great value throughout the whole of the film. He realises that that the film isn't one that requires understatement, so we get treated to the shouty Al Pacino, the one that's turned up to 11. And although that shouty Al Pacino, rather unfortunately, has cannibalised the more understated one in recent years, here it's a complete joy.I think my favourite Pacino moment in the film has to be after he kidnaps Tess Trueheart. He talks quite calmly and then he suddenly starts shouting. I don't know why, but it really makes me laugh. And he does this a couple of times. It's not so much that I have to hurt someone, it's just&#133;don't make me do it! And then there's the bit where he says he's having a thought and the bit where he says he loves Tess (while he's preparing to kill her). Pacino is just wonderfully dumb in the role. (Another little Pacino bit that I love is the almost imperceptible jig he makes as he's trying to escape by jumping over a bridge. And I also crack up at the schizophrenic anger that bubbles to the surface when he realises he can't escape. You'll pay for this! You're gonna pay for this!) Another fun performance is from Dustin Hoffman. All he does is mumble, but like Pacino he overacts like crazy, therefore making a tiny role memorable.In light of this, and all the other grotesques that fill the film, it would be easy for Beatty to go unnoticed, but he's actually rather good in the thankless role of straightforward hero. He never makes a simple character seem bland. Part of this is because of his excellent chemistry with Glenne Headly, but part of it is because of the scenes with Madonna; sure she can't act, but knowing what a horny bastard Beatty is in real life, you half expect him to give Tess the elbow. And Beatty also injects humour into his role and, once or twice, manages to achieve some emotion &#150; the scenes with Tess are always bittersweet, but there are also a couple of nice exchanges with the Kid.And although the film isn't exactly action packed, and although the final sequence is a typical damsel in distress type deal, Beatty's film does at least feature some heavy Tommy gun action, which is always welcome (I love the way no one has to reload their guns). And speaking of action, it is at times incredibly violent. Indeed, the final shoot-out, while bloodless, is a massacre. But this isn't a criticism. The violence is exactly as cartoony as it should be.And I really think that for all its faults, Dick Tracy is one of the best comic book films out there. Sure it's shallow, but that's the point &#150; as full of colour as the film is, the morality is black and white; complexity has been eschewed in favour of fun. And I really think the film is one hell of a good time.

When I was 14 (Antonie's age in the film I suppose), I hated everything. I hated school, I hated living with my parents, and I didn't want to be subordinate to society on the whole. To put it simply, I wanted to just get out there and live my life instead of being picked on by school teachers and essentially be an outcast amongst my peers, who were spoiled rich white males thinking with their you know whats instead of their brains. Antonie Doinel is a character who used his mind and what did he get? He was sent to reform school. He possesses the traits of every average adolescent male. He wants to expand his mind (he reads Balzac), doesn't do his work, riles up the teacher, doesn't really get along with his parents (although his father seems to have more vested interest in the boy), defaces classroom walls, and looks at and defaces pinups. Quite simply, his character is one of the most complex to ever be created.In short, The 400 Blows is about an unwanted teenaged boy who submits to the world of petty crime when the rest of the world has turned his back on him. There's an interesting line that Antoine's father says to him at the beginning of the film. The boy is running back from the grocery store with flour for his mother and he runs into his dad coming home from work. Always running son, eh? And that's what we see for the full 99 minutes of The 400 Blows. Sure, Antoine is actually running (especially at the emotional climax) but he's psychologically running away from the very people holding him back from breaking out in the world, be it his parents, the authorities, and so forth. There is so much other things that we see that cannot be fit into this review. Antoine and his friend Rene skip school one day and go around town. Antoine goes into a gravitron, which is an amusement park ride that spins around in circles. And that's what his life is doing he may enjoy the ride for the time being, but he's ending up where he started from.The film is not without humor, though. One cannot help but laugh when Antoine tells his teacher after skipping class that his mother died. Personal preference obviously, his father says in response to the mother venting about such news. Also, Antoine's letter to his parents explaining why he ran away sounds like an adult wrote it, but there is some humor to it. We'll discuss all that's happened it says. Even Antoine getting expelled from school after plagiarizing Balzac is pretty humorous and he decides not to go home and live with Rene. They end up stealing little things such as posters, clocks, and they go to the movies. However, when he pinches a typewriter from his father's office, that's the end of his little rebellion. He is sent to a correctional facility (and this is an emotional scene, as the boy is placed in a police wagon and cries as he takes a look of the streets of Paris at night). Perhaps the most emotional scenes take place in the final portion of the film. Antoine is placed under psychiatric evaluation, where he reveals he was born out of wedlock and his mother wanted an abortion (this is hinted at in the beginning when he runs in on a conversation between two old ladies talking about forceps and a Cesarean section...perhaps they were indeed talking about an abortion procedure. Antoine feels uncomfortable around this conversation and we can see it). He can't see Rene when he visits, and his mother tells him he's on his own (although I wished Antoine would've told her I hate you).After briefly listening to a young delinquent who was caught trying to escape, Antoine decides to do so and bolts during a soccer game. We just see Antoine running, and running, and running. There's no music at first until he gets to the ocean. Truffaut pulls the cameras back and we see an endless horizon, endless opportunities for our young protagonist. The musical score plays and this is where I continue to get misty eyed with every viewing. Antoine, who has never seen the ocean, runs within the current, but has nowhere to go. The film ends in the famous freeze frame with a closeup of the boy's face. Either he's been caught, doesn't know what to do, or this mimics the mugshot sequence that we saw before he went into the correctional facility. The ending leaves a lot to the imagination, but there's one thing that cannot be imagined The 400 Blows is easily the most touching film I've ever seen. I don't think I'll see another one quite like this.Everything seems to lock into place here. The acting superbly executes brilliant dialogue. Truffaut has some innovative camera movements (the darkening of the corridor while Antoine takes out the garbage and the final shot are examples of this) throughout. The musical score is beautiful. And, France isn't portrayed as this very romantic country. No, it is dark, it is gloomy. This is the dark side of this very storied nation. Here, Francois Truffaut tells his story to the viewer. When I first bought 400 Blows, I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd pick it up because 46 years after its initial release there was still a lot of critical buzz around it. I'm glad I spent the 30 dollars on this film, easily my favorite of all time next to 2001 A Space Odyssey.I only have one complaint I wish I'd have seen The 400 Blows when I was 14.

When I was 14 (Antonie's age in the film I suppose), I hated everything. I hated school, I hated living with my parents, and I didn't want to be subordinate to society on the whole. To put it simply, I wanted to just get out there and live my life instead of being picked on by school teachers and essentially be an outcast amongst my peers, who were spoiled rich white males thinking with their you know whats instead of their brains. Antonie Doinel is a character who used his mind and what did he get? He was sent to reform school. He possesses the traits of every average adolescent male. He wants to expand his mind (he reads Balzac), doesn't do his work, riles up the teacher, doesn't really get along with his parents (although his father seems to have more vested interest in the boy), defaces classroom walls, and looks at and defaces pinups. Quite simply, his character is one of the most complex to ever be created.In short, The 400 Blows is about an unwanted teenaged boy who submits to the world of petty crime when the rest of the world has turned his back on him.

Mild-mannered ubergeek Peter Parker lives with his elderly Aunt May and uncle Ben, next door to his longtime crush Mary-Jane Watson(who doesn't have any interest in him, of course). On a field trip, he's bitten by a scientifically altered spider, and finds himself endowed with special spidery powers...and a buff new physique! Naturally, being a much-downtrodden teenager, his first instinct is to use these powers to impress girls. Or, more specifically, one girl Mary-Jane. However, through a series of events, his own actions lead to his beloved uncle's death, and he realises what his late uncle said was true 'With great power comes great responsibility.' He thereafter commits himself to fighting crime with his newfound abilities. Wackiness ensues...I mean, ADVENTURE ENSUES! The story, at its roots, is pretty true to the source material, for better or worse. On the plus side, the movie maintains the childish charm of a comic book; on the minus, the movie doesn't really surpass the childish charm of a comic book. My only real beef with this movie was probably just a technical limitation of the time (only a few short years ago) when digital effects were STILL not up to bringing this particular character to the screen. While Tobey Maguire pulls some great physical acting out of his performance, it becomes all too clear when the switch is made to a computer-generated 'person' clumsily climbing the side of a building or swinging through the city.

Sam Raimi, who brought us the much-beloved 'Evil Dead' trilogy (and countless other truly crappy movies), is a good choice to helm this flick. His work in 'Army of Darkness,' 'Darkman' and others show he has both an understanding of what makes these stories appealing as well as an appreciation for faithful adaptation of the superhero ethos. The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel\/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers\/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages.

The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel\/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers\/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages.

Gregory pecks acting was great and damn always had a creepy little grin on his face that you could tell was evil. the last scene was one of the best i would say this is a must see for any horror film enthusiast. This is not your average horror film, it has to do with real life things and was a movie that wouldn't just scare you right away it would get into your head. if i had to say this would be in my top three movies I've ever seen. i have not yet seen the new movie but i doubt that it will be even comparable to what this movie accomplished.
