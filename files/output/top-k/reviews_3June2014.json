As far as their filmography goes, I'm not a huge fan of their work. Yes, I really like The Matrix and enjoyed V for Vendetta, but the rest of their work just isn't any good. But here we have a small crime thriller that features great performances, very tight script and masterful direction from the first time directors. Bound isn't as ground breaking or game changing as other 90's crime films like Pulp Fiction, however it doesn't rely on gimmicks and cheap tricks to keep you interested. It's sexy, slightly gratuitous, very intense and downright brutal when it needs to. While the whole premise about lesbians stealing money from the mob sounds like a complete schlock plot that would easily fit in a late night softcore sex film, the Wachowski's managed to make it work. They throw the fan service scenes early on and the rest of the film is a roller-coaster ride of tension and twists that will keep you at edge of the seat. It's easily as good if not better than Reservoir Dogs and other similar independent 90's crime thrillers. It's worth seeing for the acting alone, especially Joe Pantoliano, who gives probably one of his better performances of his career.

This is for good reason since they are most certainly incredible films and helped revolutionise cinema. But at the same time with a film career spanning around 53 films he has many incredible classics that seem to be forgotten overtime. This is unfortunate seeing as it leads to great films such as Frenzy being less talked about then his other films.Just like all the great Hitchcock films, Frenzy is a suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire film by creating interesting characters and placing them in dangerous situations. It's pretty similar to the other Hitchcock plots like North by Northwest in that there's one man on the run for a murder that he did not commit whilst the real killer remains at large.Though there are two differences to this formula. The first is that the film is far more brutal then his previous films creating much more detail and realism within the killings. So much that it was the first Hitchcock film to be given an 18 rating on release. Also unlike most of Hitchococks films which will maintain an element of mystery as to the killers identity for most of the film, this one shows who the killer is within the first act and maintains a lot of focus on the killer throughout the film. Whilst it is risky revealing this so early within the film it does have the benefit of allowing a far more in depth and interesting portrait in to the mind of the serial killer throughout the rest of the film. We get to witness his complete lack of sympathy or regret over what he is doing and how unnoticed he is by the rest of society. The reveal even leads to some incredible scenes that I'd place amongst Hitchcock's best. One of which is when we first witness the killer strangling his victim. Hitchcock uses a similar style to the famous shower scene in Psycho where he uses quick editing and varying close ups to add a feeling of horror and struggle that the victim is going through. There are two key differences however to the style being used in Psycho, with the first being seeing the killers excitement as he throttles the victim so we see it more from the victims perspective rather than the killers. The second being that this does not have a score and instead we hear only the muffled screams of the women as she is throttled, creating a more threatening feeling of eerie realism. Whilst not quite as iconic as the shower scene in Psycho it is still extremely intense and suspenseful and amongst Hitchcock's best scenes. Along with the killer the film also builds up the leading man who is falsely convicted of the murders called Blaney. Unlike the usual Hitchcock leading man Blaney is not an impressive person. If anything he is extremely reliant on other people throughout the film and is actually quite aggressive, to the point where you can understand why the police would be hunting him as a suspect. This not only makes the story more believable but also since we know that he won't catch the killer it keeps us curious as to how the real killer will get caught.I doubt that this will be anyone's favourite Hitchcock. But that's just because his classics just can't be beat and this remains an incredible film. It does everything that we come to expect from Hitchcock films, from maintaining his nail biting suspense to innovating his own formula by increasing the role of the killer within the film. There is never any doubt that this is a Hitchcock film and any fan of the director will be certain to enjoy the film.

I thought the action was better, and I thought the story was a little bit deeper. It's certainly not without its weaknesses, mind you - one of which has its origins early in the movie. Col. Trautman (again played by Richard Crenna) tries to recruit Rambo (of course, played by Sylvester Stallone) by telling him that he had to come full circle. For me, that set up an expectation of some sort of full circle ending, but I didn't see one. Full circle, in the context of the movies might have been Rambo back as a drifter in the US, or as a soldier, or as a (presumably) happy civilian just like before he got caught up in any of this. But the ending let me down a little bit to be honest. I saw no real closure in this; certainly no full circle experience for Rambo.This movie is set in Afghanistan, during the Soviet war in that country. Trautman wants Rambo to go in with him, but Rambo doesn't want to. He's actually established a comfortable life in Thailand, living in a monastery, apparently happy and peaceful (apart from occasional stick fighting that he engages in to make money for the monastery.) But when Trautman goes in on his own and gets captured, Rambo, of course, goes after him.Once Rambo's in Afghanistan, this becomes a pretty standard (and well done and exciting) action movie. Looked at in 2014, though, it's also a little tired. Another 80's Cold War movie with the Americans out to get the evil empire. And the Soviets were definitely evil in this one - and, yes, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was brutal. It's just that the format became a bit tired after a while in my opinion. They do use the Cold War theme to good photographic value, though.

I saw no real closure in this; certainly no full circle experience for Rambo.This movie is set in Afghanistan, during the Soviet war in that country. Trautman wants Rambo to go in with him, but Rambo doesn't want to. He's actually established a comfortable life in Thailand, living in a monastery, apparently happy and peaceful (apart from occasional stick fighting that he engages in to make money for the monastery.) But when Trautman goes in on his own and gets captured, Rambo, of course, goes after him.Once Rambo's in Afghanistan, this becomes a pretty standard (and well done and exciting) action movie. Looked at in 2014, though, it's also a little tired. Another 80's Cold War movie with the Americans out to get the evil empire.

But that is not really what Christopher Guest has ever done.I watched this to remind myself what I love about this style of film. The characters develop naturally, by shedding layers of pretense when they don't know we are watching and suddenly pulling themselves together in a vain attempt to convince the viewer that we just caught them at a bad moment. It's a brilliant way to show us the lives of people on a mission. When you allow yourself to forget that you are watching a movie, and plunge into the documentation of these people's lives, you experience the sheer joy of being in on the joke, through the eyes of the camera crew. The behind the scenes workers who toil away on big budget films, and get to see the reality behind the surreal world of personas and personalities. Guest takes us deep into the lives of the ordinary person, who is trying to live an extraordinary life. This time, they do it through the dogs they own, or show.They have dreams, and delusions, but the one thing you feel with Guest, that I appreciate now more than ever, is that he genuinely enjoys the human condition. He likes people. He cares about his audience, and he is in on the joke with us. We are not the butt of the joke, and we are never insulted for loving Dog Shows, Community Theater, or even the Rock Stars in a giant arena. Everybody loves a show, or to be a part of the show. NOT everybody gets to be a big star. To be the winner. To be noticed for what they feel is their unique gift or talent. Rather than exploit that, and mock it in a cruel and unfunny fashion, Guest reminds us that within our little circle, and in our own ways, we can all feel like stars. And it nobody has to get hurt in the process. I watched this film, in part, to recover from what I felt was an abysmal failure to make a Mockumentary style film about writers. Authors Anonymous. It fails where Guest shines. There are people acting their hearts out in old citrus warehouses, and others are packing up their RV's to head out to another dog show. These life stories, and their sometimes absurd details, make for hopeful films that salute the human spirit.

Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances.The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience!That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however.This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.' With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time.

I almost chuckle in embarrassment when I tell people I dig this movie. If you looked up the term screw loose in the dictionary, there would be an image of its hyper kinetic poster front and center. This Dirty Dozen on steroids has got well known, respected actors hamming it up to no end. Its also got snappy, thoughtful, and witty dialogue which is something not normally found in a cheesy action flick. Finally, it has Nicolas Cage, letting the world know that hey, I already won an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas (1996) and I can do whatever the heck I want. Cage plays army ranger Cameron Poe, a soon to be father who winds up in a federal prison over a bar fight. A drunk messes with his pregnant wife and Poe, using excessive force, accidentally commits murder. He is sentenced to eight years, gets out early for good behavior, and hitches a ride home on a plane full of convicts. Most of them are being transferred and are in the process of doing consecutive life sentences except for Poe. Once he gets off the plane, he is a free man. However, something happens and there is a hijacking by the criminal passengers on board, hence the title, Con Air. The unique thing about this late 90's exercise in ridiculousness is that despite its caffeinated, testosterone filled action sequences, we find serious actors (John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Steve Buscemi) striving hard to sell scenes that make you wanna take things seriously. I gotta admit though, it can be hard to embrace what's on screen. A lot of the material is less than plausible. I do however, applaud the effort. Basically this is one of those movies where you can forgive its shortcomings based on the likability of most of the characters. Let's face it, they may be nasty criminals but come on, they're a hoot. For instance, let's examine John Malkovich's character being a convicted murderer named Cyrus the Virus. He becomes the leader of the hijackers. He spouts lines like, and if you say a word about this over the radio, the next wings you'll see will belong to the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse. Ah, you gotta love a criminal mastermind who has multiple college doctorates and degrees. Then, you have Ving Rhames as Diamond Dog, a character who writes a book in prison that may be made into a movie. Federal agent Larkin (Cusack) explains this and also reminds the audience that Denzel Washington is in talks to star. Ah Huh.With Con Air, you have violent action scenes that have short set ups and even shorter payoffs. This is inter played with biting, sarcastic humor. Cage, almost mumbling his lines with a monumental five o'clock shadow, (I'm thinking he might have been paid per line) exhibits a fearless devil may care attitude because hey, he just wants to get home and embrace the daughter he has never seen before (I'm sure after seeing this flick, you'll probably wanna run out and buy this guy some razors stat).To end this review, I have a feeling that you will be entertained. Con Air's relentless zing factor will put you through the ringer and slap a big fat smile across your face. If you are looking for a ride this film is your ticket; not first class, but coach and that will do because ultimately you still get to your destination; uninhibited movie going bliss.

The film works, mostly due to an incredible and original performance, that of David Thewlis, where the other two female leads are almost as good, especially, Cartidge, as the dependent Sophie, a heroin user, who's forced into performing some sex acts by the the conniving, malicious, and lonely pig of a landlord, Jeremy (Crustwell) though we're not sure he really is one at this point, when he makes this sudden intrusion. That's the thing about this film, every character is lonely, one such character, a night security guard, guarding what high strung and reckless 90's hero Johnny, (Thewlis) comically terms as Space which honestly is what he really he is doing. The film has an explosive and dramatic start with Johnny screwing a woman, where if it's rape, it's discernible, but with Johnny taking off quick to avoid a bashing, it must be. He arrives in Manchester and takes harborage at his ex-girlfriend's, Louise (Sharp) place. She's painfully lonely, obvious as day, where you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize she envies the more outward and sex loving Sophie. Starting up a relationship, with Johnny, where really she's suffocating him, he goes out on a solo walk, into the night cold. Thus begins a journey where he meets a collection of people, first two homeless drug users, a pre Trainspotting face, and very un Spud like. Basically the others are unhappy, discontent loners, one woman even creeping Johnny out. Naked, I must warn you, is surprisingly, and bloody funny, from an A1 script, insightful and sharp, ala Mike Leigh, where Thewlis is lumbered with a lot, bringing a performance of reality that just paralyses you. Too Crustwell, who I only saw in another film was impressive as his character was a horrible being, but there we're reasons. After all, he informs us he's going to commit suicide when reaching the big 40. And he can get rough too. Near the end, we really see the characters for what they are, and that includes Crustwell lonely. Again being Mike Leigh, what we have is a situation set, through the motions movie, that probably would of had rehearsed improv, All 4 leads deliver solid performances, but none finer than Thewlis, where I had to see more of this guy. As this being the only other Leigh film, I've seen besides Meantime, which I really liked, this is that controversial, stand out from the rest of the directors flick, where we have a brave, daring and bloody film, one set apart from all of Leigh's others. At the end, as Johnny departs, the relentless loser, we're actually sad to see him go, in a film, every movie connisseur, should put down as a must see, but more so, a must see Thewlis performance, one which will have a lingering effect on the viewer, years after it's watch.
