The plot is simple and looks like it did come from a B- video game, but hey not all video game plots are complicated (like many people complained about Final Fantasy). The movie itself was not as gory as some may think (Romero wanted stuff like dogs biting through the back of a commando to rip out its heart). The reactions of the commandos when first encountering zombies was perfect since they had no idea what they were getting into. The makeup for the zombies were great especially those that could dislocate limbs for the added effect. Nice! The Red Queen keeps you guessing whether or not it is evil or good or just doing what it was programmed to do. The licker, although did not totally look like the original from RE 2 (and this is before it mutated), it still looked cool. When it mutated, oh my, makes fans ask Why wasn't it in the game? The ending which may be obvious but I won't say PERFECTLY sets up for the games to begin and it also answers some mysteries namely the Nemesis.

Minor spoilers for both this version and the live action!An interesting note I saw on my DVD that producer Saul Zaentz is listed as an executive producer on the live action LOTR. (I don't see that confirmed here on IMDB.)I am surprised by how similar the two films look. I don't think it's just the result of coming from the same source material. The hobbits hiding from the Nazgul under a tree root, the attack at Bree, the boats of Lothlorien, the monuments of the kings of Gondor and the fact that the Old Forest and Bombadil were cut out of both pictures indicates to me that someone on the live action was giving consideration to this animated rendition.You'll get plenty of opinions about what's wrong with the animated version on this comment page. Some I agree with. I'd rather like to point out the few places I think this surpasses the live action.1)I don't mind the shambling Nazgul. It doesn't make them any less scary in my mind and I think in general they're much more spirit-like and potentially scary in the animated version (the film doesn't always reach the potential, but it's there. Esp. in the Bree attack scene). The live action film's ability to make this fantastic world realistic via CGI works great for stuff like the Balrog, but less well for the more human looking Nazgul. When we're not looking at them through Frodo's eyes, they're just guys in black sheets. I like the red eyes and fading in and out spiritness in the animated version.2)The Orcs in the animated version don't suck as bad as some on this page seem to believe. I thought they were wonderfully dark and spooky. The red eyes and tongues...the sackcloth and weird teeth. They worked for me. Same problem here in the live action as with the Nazgul...it's wonderful to see Orcs rendered true to life...it's terrible to see Orcs rendered true to life. (live action low point for me is the What news from Mordor? orc...high point is the Uruk-hai Aragorn slays at the end.)3)I'm glad the animated action kept Merry and Pippin's motivation more in line with the book. Although the live action makes a successful choice to turn them into comic relief (a choice that will pay off in clarity in the next two films), I like the original characters and I'm happy the animated version tried to hold onto them a little better. Peter Jackson did get a great movie moment, however, when he changed Pippin's actions near the guard well in Moria. Thrilling!Before I sign off I will give the live action it's due. It's a far superior adaption that will get people excited about both Tolkein and filmmaking, and probably as good a job as you can do turning one medium (the books) into another (the film). Tolkein fans shouldn't be afraid of this version, however. Steel yourself against the abrupt and incomplete ending and enjoy.

I was probably only around 7 at the time, and the film was shown as one of a series of classic science-fiction films from the fifties and sixties. Even on a small black and white television set many of the images in the film burned themselves on my mind and and stayed with me throughout my childhood. Images such as the priest boldly walking towards the martian craft; the eerie pictures of empty streets in an evacuated Los Angeles; the panic of the people trying to escape &#x96;and above all the frightening images of the alien craft rising slowly from the gully, pressing forth despite the massive fire-power directed at them. Their cold stateliness and absolute impregnability terrified me, but held great fascination, and I so easily managed to feel great empathy for all the human characters who were forced to evacuate the city, or face the consequences. I yearned for the film to be shown again, but it never was. However, a number of years later, when I was in my twenties, this was one of the first films I bought on video. Though excited at the prospect of seeing once again one of the most memorable movies of my childhood, I was also somewhat worried that the film could not live up my expectations and give me the same thrill when viewed with an adult sensibility. Happily my worries were unfounded, for I found myself being affected by the film in almost exactly the same way I had as a child. And having now seen War of the Worlds about a dozen times all in all it has lost none of its fascination. True a number of its flaws become quite apparent after so many viewings, and one does wish that some of the acting had a greater depth at times, but one cannot help being eternally intrigued by the predicaments facing the characters and their despair at their weakness in the face of such adversity. Above all there is a fascination for the effects which for the most part not only stand the test of time remarkably well (does it really deter anyone's enjoyment that a wire or two is visible occasionally?), but which unlike many films of today are there to serve the story, not the other way round. And yet the effects have so many grace notes that it would be wrong not to give them well deserved attention in a review such as this. Take for example the sound- effects of the martian craft as they patrol &#x96;a disturbing, totally alien sound, with an eeriness that I believe is unmatched in film history. A lot of what frightened me as a child was the sound of this movie, which is also demonstrated by the remarkably forceful sound of the 'blasts' of the martian weapons. These sounds are 100% destructive, and matched perfectly with the streams or rays of the optical shots, which have themselves a disturbing strength.Despite what a number of people have said about the model work I think it is remarkable, and in most cases extremely convincing.(possible spoiler ahead) There is just one shot towards the end of the movie, where a martian craft crashes into a building, which is not up to the standard of the rest of the film, but otherwise I always find myself totally convinced &#x96;and if there are wires, I mostly don't see them because the film's atmosphere and narrative convince me not to!Another thing worth mentioning is the lighting. I find this extremely effective in the colouring of certain areas of the screen, which in the case of the martian nest are truly alien. The somewhat misty brightness of the green\/turquoise associated with the martian's is contrasted nicely with the warmer, often earthy colours of the scenes involving humans. A lot of the film takes place at night, yet there is always colour even in the darkness. The photography of George Barnes certainly contributes to the fascination the film holds.In other words this is a movie that continues to intrigue, and deserves multiple viewing.

But to be quite honest, many of the criticisms I've read here on IMDB have been completely unjust and blown out of all proportion. No.. it's NOT the worst motion picture in the world, and I can't quite understand why anybody would say such a thing, except to appear clever to our fellow reviewers. JPIII is a fairly decent action movie that should be seen on the big screen with a large group of friends. Not worth watching twice though. THE PROBLEMS   Apart from avoiding dinosaurs, the screenplay doesn't have any clear gut goals for Dr Grant and Co to pursue, which does makes it harder for the audience to emphasise with the main characters. The characters in this movie don't take matters into their own hand, they are not driving the movie forward to it's envitable conclusion. All they do is avoid dinosaurs - boring! If we look at the screenwriting techniques employed in Jurassic Park, it's easy to see why the original was far more exciting. For example, the characters were split into two groups; Dr Grant and the children had to find their back without being eaten, while Dern's bunch had to restore power to the island. This setups up two goals for the audience to follow, thus adding considerable interest to the story. It almost has the effect of watching two films at once, but with more cohesion. Thirdly, there is very good saying that applies here, less is more. If you cram too much action into a motion picture, particulary one without any worthwhile goals, then the audience are going to become desensitised.  By the end of the movie I was glad we didn't have one last showdown between Dr Grant and the Raptors.To the director's credit, Johnston is good at staging action sequences and the special effects shots are well thought out. I'm also glad he decided to remain with John William's brilliant score, it would have been pretty foolish to leave it out. However, Joe doesn't know how to handle suspense or horror scenes unlike his predecessor, Steven Spielberg. The legendary director knows how to use pace to create that eerily feeling of suspense, whereas Johnston is just content with giving us a rollercoaster ride. I also felt the screenwriters didn't take advantage of certainly opportunities that could have added more depth to the characters. Bringing two divorcees to the island is a good idea, but there is very little conflict between them - a chance sorely missed. If handled properly it might have made Macy's near death experience more heartfelt. And of course, there are the usual number of plot holes that plagued most blockbusters  1) In spite of being considerably larger than the T-Rex, the Spinosaurus managers to sneak up on Dr Grant when Rex can't even take a step without causing a small earthquake under it's feet. 2) There should have been soldiers guarding the island from nosy tourists or foolish poachers.  3) Can you really hear a phone ringing from inside a giant dinosaur? Probably not.  4) Dangerous Pteranodons have flown the coup and the army does nothing?Still, I would have overlooked all this if the movie had been better.

Infact it baffles me that this film was a box office flop.....and for all those who go on and on about how no one will ever compare to Erol Flynn is this reason this movie flopped. I need to say this to you ...most of the movie goers nowdays weren't even alive yet when Erol Flynn was making films-Erol Flynn had nothing to do with the failure of Cutthroat Island at the box office. In fact I am 31 years old and I cannot name a single movie of Erol Flynns that I have seen, and I'd be willing to bet that the majority of todays college age studentS have never even heard of Erol Flynn!!The truth is -I dont know why this moview failed. It has all the right elements in place.

Especially now, with the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, this movie really resonated with me.  I thought that most everything about this movie - from the acting, to the cinematography, to the direction, etc. - was uniformly excellent.  The international kudos it has received are well-earned.Now for the major flaw in this film, which makes it, in my mind, absolutely hypocritical.  I can't believe I haven't heard this most-deserved criticism yet levelled against this film - IT IS HOMOPHOBIC.  The film takes great pains to show both sides of the story and treat most of the characters fairly, based on race or ethnic origin or gender, etc. - but the whole plot starts due to the sadistic and evil action of the gay Serbian general, who SPOILERS places the body of the Bosnian soldier overtop the land mine so that it will explode.  There are a few anti-Serbian slurs levelled by the Bosnian soldier for this action - but the only other Serbian character, the soldier stuck in the trench with him, is mostly a positive character and depicted as presumably heterosexual (in movies like this, if the character is not specifically denoted as gay, let's face it, he's straight.)  I'm not saying that gay men, particularly those in the army, can't be capable of some terrible things - the problem here lies in the fact that this is a movie - and when you depict the only representative from a minority as despicably evil and sadistic, you are making a statement about the entire minority.  A second gay character not depicted as such would negate the hatred of the first portrayal.  But no such luck in this film - we are left to believe that hating others because they are different is bad, except if they're a trouble-making gay man who, thank God, already got what he deserved.  I've been thinking a lot about why the filmmakers decided to make this dead Serbian general gay - what point were they trying to make?  Were they worried that some Serbians might object to a heterosexual Serbian general doing something as terrible as placing a body over a land mine to do nothing except kill some more?  Did they think by making this general gay they would therefore eliminate any guilt felt by other Serbs, who would assume, well, he was a faggot so that's why he did this despicable thing, not because he's Serbian.  You can bet a million dollars that's why the writers WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure we knew the general was gay.  This is offensive and this film deserves to be attacked for its hypocrisy.  This one major homophobic attack in this film completely ruined what should have been a fulfilling experience for me.  Heterosexual male filmmakers have been doing this for years - whether in prison movies, or Nazi movies, or anywhere - eliminate heterosexual male guilt by making the chief antagonist gay - don't bother making the character a fully-rounded individual - just make him gay and this will be enough proof of why he's so despicable.  This tendency of using the gay villain has, thankfully, abated in North American cinema.  Unfortunately not in Bosnia.
