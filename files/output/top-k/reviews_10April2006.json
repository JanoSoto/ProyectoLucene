[{"date":"10 April 2006","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" I thought i wanted to update my little comment of this movie...!!!When George Lucas made this movies his intentions were to show a movie not deemed worthy of anything, as it came out people fastly decided to hate the movie, it was just too unrealistic and too weird, now 20 years later it is in many's minds, i guess i know why nobody liked it back then.Story 8\/10 Well you have a duck who drops down from his planet to earth and of course the story here is that a scientific problem happened and now he has to save the whole planet, the story isn't really that special, but the persons and the way it flows actually can pull you in. Of course there are many cheesy moments in the movie, but it all does well actually, i think that the reason this movie didn't get that much fame was because people don't want to see to much unrealistic things, thats why i know that kids will love this movie, scared of it at times, propraply at the end with the Dark Lord. We adults don't see the same way as kids, i think the kids who saw it back in the days loved it, and some who likes fantasies understood it in some ways also.Actors 9\/10 Actors the ones in the movie is what makes this movie tick the most, you cant not love Howard sometimes, he is witty and funny, yeah the lines are weak at points but cool at other places, Lea Thompson plays the role of Beverly very well, she is also very hot and cute no matter how you look at it, Jeffrey Jones was a great actor back in the days, he is usually most known for oldies, in Howard the duck he plays as Doctor Jennings very well also. I don't think anyone other then him good do this part better then he does, he is a great great actor. the last one is Tim Robbins if i should be sincere and i shall then i don't like new movies with him, in this movies i believed he wasn't that bad, he was great as well. It is the actor that holds this movie the most and they do it very good.Music 8\/10 Every song in the movie is catchy and it lingerers to you if you just have seen the movie, i liked all of them very much. I liked the main theme, but my favorite wasn't one they sang, only in one single moment when Lea Thompsons sings it, it is of course the song Dont Walk Away with Thomas Dolby. The small tunes in the movie is nothing to bitch about they aren't the best but the do what is supposed to do.Special Effects N\/A I wont bitch about the special effects they are really not that good for an 80es film, but then again they do make children believe in it, a little scary when you are small, but i think that is what is so good about this movie. Adults will see its wrongs at the first sight, but children will like them at the first sight. The are not bad at all, but they aren't good at all either they are in the middle.Overall 9\/10 I will give this a 9 because i believe that this movie grows on you, and later in time it will grow more even though it has long stopped to being produced. But it is a classic for many people and i thinks it grows on you in time, i will end with 2 of my favorite quotes in this movie.Cleve-Land. Perfectly weird name for this planet. And the other. BeverlyI never even had any pets, they seems like a lot of hassle you feeding them cleaning up after them, HowardIll try to be careful.
