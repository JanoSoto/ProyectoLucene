I heard so many great things about it but for some reason I never got a chance to watch this film until now. I liked this film way better than The Breakfast Club. Compared with that film, this film has more jokes, more action, more fun, and just better chemistry.This film is about a high school senior named Ferris. He skips school for a day so he can hang out with his friend and girlfriend in Chicago. But, he must be on a lookout for his suspicious sister and principal.The acting was really good here. Matthew Broderick is just perfect as Ferris. Another perfect casting choice was Jeffrey Jones as the principal. He actually had the best scenes in the movie. The rest of the cast such as Jennifer Grey and Mia Sara are great too.Overall, this is a fun teen movie that represents the daily lives of high school kids.

From the start I found it to be a visual treat. Over the first few minutes it runs as if you are sitting in a local train and which stops at different stations and you get to know the glimpses of your journey. Such is the great editing which is used in the starting.The story telling manner was completely unorthodox and has blown my mind. What is more important to note is the character of Charles Kane. The film has depicted his character in such a way that the audience is in a confused state as to what truly was his nature. I like films which make people guessing and thinking when they leave the Cinema Hall. The acting of the director himself was awesome and other characters also performed very nicely. In all, this is a film which will leave you thinking about it all the time obviously making you guess the different aspects of the story. Any cinema lover is sure to enjoy this.PROS The story of the film is brilliantly written and the character of Charles Kane has been analyzed with full depth. What is more compelling to me is that analysis of the character done in the film is from the point of the view of the director and the writer. But it also leaves space for the audience to make their own version of this character. Such great is its depiction. No doubt that the cinematography and editing are at their best. To understand how great the techniques are, you have to get out of the world of films that we are living in currently. Only than one can truly understand what is great. Orson has given the best acting in the film as the lead character. The only other one whom I would compare here would be Francois Truffaut and his acting in the film Day for Night. The progress of the story, the depth of the nature of the important characters and their part in the film are satisfying to the maximum level.CONSIn the middle however I got drifted away a little from the film but that might be because I was carrying too much of expectation from the film and was expecting it to be as compelling as The Bicycle Thief but I understand that both of them are of a different genre. And maybe we should never carry too much expectation because when we do so than our mind makes us to find faults in the act we are going to perform. But the pleasing editing again took me into the film.MESSAGE Truth is bitter. VERDICT A must watch film for all lovers of cinema.

The low-men, who are after Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins)...well, we never quite figure out who they are or why they are after him; it's left very nebulous. Are they actually bad guys, government agents, or what? Beyond that, it's a rather charming story (and not very Stephen King-ish) about a meaningful relationship between a strange man and a boy who needs a father figure in his life. But that missing information about the low-men prevents us from ever understanding exactly who Brautigan is.Anthony Hopkins is perfect here, although there are times he seems to mumble, and you may miss a bit of dialog. The boy -- Anton Yelchin -- has been fairly active in films, although I did not recognize the name. He's superb here. Hope David (the boy's mother) did okay, but I was not particularly impressed, although admittedly her role was not very sympathetic. Mika Boorem, a young actress I have not kept up with, is superb as the boy's girl friend. David Morse is very good as the boy grown up (the whole movie is a sort of flashback), and he is a busy, but in view underrated actor.Do I recommend this film? Well, yes and no. The story portrays relationships very sensitively, but that missing info about the low-men leaves a huge gap. I enjoyed watching it even a third time, but I won't be tempted to buy it for my DVD shelf. I'd give it a sold 7 if we learned who the low-men really were; instead, I'll give it a 6 -- a low rating for me.Nevertheless, I do recommend you watch this film.

Guess it serves its purpose but I did wish it covered some more new grounds and explored more of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s life and especially his personality.The thing is that this documentary won't offer anything new for the Ed Wood enthusiasts and those who aren't interested in Wood's persona or movies probably won't even watch this movie in the first place. So who does this documentary appeal to exactly and what audience did it got made for? It just isn't being clear enough for me to say but having said all of that, this is not a bad watch and it at least features a ton of Wood regulars in it, not saying anything new really but it's still interesting to hear their side of things, though it at times doesn't gives you a clear view of things since sometimes everybody is telling you are different version of things, so you still don't know what is being totally true and what's not. I was actually surprised to see the amount of people, who were once involved with Wood, they got in front of the camera to speak. Not just the obvious persons like Dolores Fuller, Vampira, Conrad Brooks and Paul Marco but also people such Norma McCarty, who he was married with for one day and reverend Lynn Lemon, who pretty much got ripped off for money by Wood. This is sort of refreshing that it's not just being a documentary in which everybody is saying good things about its main subject but there is also definitely criticism and times in which Wood's bad sides and mannerisms get emphasized. Especially Bela Lugosi Jr. makes it very clear he did not liked Wood at all and hated him for what he did to the final years of his father's career and life.It was also nice to see Lyle Talbot in this, who starred in a couple of the most infamous Wood movies and died in the same year as this documentary got released, at the age of 94, making this documentary probably the last thing he appeared in.As strange as it might sound, I'm a really big Ed Wood admirer, not because of the quality of his movies but the way he always got them made and the love and passion he put in to them. He by no means was the worst director that ever lived but it's definitely fact he was one of the absolute worst writers out there. But I still don't feel I truly understand the true person and this documentary didn't do anything to change that. I wished it delved a bit deeper into his personality and private live and not just focused on his movies and the people he was involved with so much.Of course I still learned some new stuff from this documentary and it does contain some unique footage, such as the first commercial Wood directed in the '40's. But the things I mostly learned from this documentary were mostly non-Wood related, such as Vampira being a bit of a wild thing when it came to men and especially celebrities. I never knew she was involved with Orson Welles more than once in his life. They were lovers, as Vampira is not reluctant to tell you about, even though she didn't really got asked about it and then suddenly pretends as if it's something she doesn't want to talk about too much or go into detail about it.The documentary isn't shot all that interesting. It just consists out of a bunch of Wood regulars sitting around, getting interviewed and some archive footage, from mostly Wood's own work. At times it even looks and feels as if the interviews got shot in different years and this documentary is just a compilation of already existing interviews, though I doubt this really was the case though.It perhaps was also a bit of a problem that the documentary makers obviously were Wood admirers, just happy to do this and to talk to some of the people who appeared in his movies, or that were involved with him in another way.

I knew that the motion picture of that series failed, and I was a little worried at first. But to my surprise I was blown away! I haven't seen such a bizarre idea be the main story of a film since Transformers ( however that film wasn't good). In bizarre I don't mean dumb or stupid, but more like interesting, and boy is it interesting. This opening is different to most films I've seen, it shows the cast of the actors characters acting in an interview, which is good because it is already treating itself like a movie, and unlike Truman, they all know they're being watched. In the beginning of the film you get to see lots of product placement, when Truman is saying hello to his neighbors it shows the ideal neighbor, then when Truman meets the twins, one of them pushes him in front of a poster which shows some sort of chicken dinner, later in the day he is in the garden when his lover shows him a brand new kitchen knife and showing all the features like a commercial, and also when your introduced to his best friend who is drinking a beer and says now that's a beer or something like that. One thing I noticed about this film is that it is very smart, Like when a light falls from the sky they later say that it was a part of an airplane, well since he's always being watched the director can make sure Truman doesn't suspect anything, and I should be more specific in that this director is smart. I saw that this was listed under comedy, which I didn't get at first, but if the point was to be satirical, then it did a perfect job. My last thoughts, I think this is a very unique film with its ideas and great characters, and think that anybody would be interested in this film.

The score is atmospheric, the story, cleverly expanded from Poe's work, is still fun, disturbing and shocking and the dialogue is intelligently arch. The acting is very good. John Kerr is rather wooden, but Barbara Steele is great in her brief appearances and Luana Anders and Antony Carbone are excellent in their supporting roles.

Of course, time is well known and viewing this film today you can't help but feel sad and the so-called greatness she's trying to present to the viewer. With that said, the downright beauty of the images are so strong that it's really impossible not to give the director credit. The majority of these propaganda movies barely reach the level of being good movies so to have one be this great and this great looking says quite a bit for Riefenstahl. There are so many images that just jump out at you and especially the beautifully shot aerial scenes that are looking down on the crowds of people. These shots are just so perfectly framed that you do wonder how long it took to set everything up. It's now known that not everything here is as it seems as the director edited separate things together and even re-shot some of the material.

Faye Dunaway stars in her fabulous Oscar- winning performance as Diana, a calculating TV exec who's only concern is ratings, ratings, ratings who, without any consideration, exploits a hapless news anchor suffering from a mental breakdown. The film features a variety of other stunning performances, two of which rightfully received Oscars, as a variety of excellently painted characters. While also managing to be blackly funny, this film also shows the vastly negative effects of television on the human condition, most accurately defined in one the film's many classic lines Television is not the truth! Television is a Goddamned amusement park! But the true brilliance of the film is the fact that in spite of the film being sternly rooted in the 70s era, it is still relevant today - perhaps even more so as corporation conglomerates continue to gobble up all that we know. But the thing to remember is While yes it is satire and it is far more over-the-top than real life, it carries with it a striking message. It carries with it the message that television is bad, plain and simple, a fact that now more than ever we need to be reminded of. This film very well hits the mark it aims for and while it does suffer at times from being hilariously unbelievable, this too allows it to hit it's mark. In short, this is a fine film - but be careful, it may have you screaming I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!.

The ending scene is possibly the greatest action scene ever filmed. Even though it has long periods without action, it has great fiction go along with it. I continue to be amazed that a movie so great is actually a sequel to a movie that is so terrible. Mad Max is so bad that I had to try three separate times to finish it &#x96; during my unsuccessful attempts to do so, I could only get halfway. I'm sad to say, my persistence wasn't rewarded. Mad Max doesn't get better as it goes. It's pretty bad through the end.This movie is described as post-apocalyptic. Somebody should have told that to the script writer, the cameramen, and the director. There is scarcely a hint of apocalypse in this movie, and you would never know that's what it is if you weren't told. People have morning coffee in a diner. An oil refinery is shown up and running in the background. Max wife's takes their son into a small village to buy him ice cream. The scarcity and bleakness depicted in great post-apocalyptic movies like The Road Warrior isn't shown here. False advertising abounds with this movie, since it is also usually described as a revenge tale. That description is only fitting for the last 15 minutes of the movie.The only good action in this entire movie is the car chase at the very beginning. It is in that brilliant opening that you get a hint of the techniques that would make the next movie so good great camera work, tons of speed, the loud sounds of engines, and a bunch of cars getting smashed. The rest isn't very entertaining, which is okay, I guess, because there isn't much of it. At the end, the main villain gets punked &#x96; not by Max, but by the director and the script writer. Max hardly engages anyone in this entire movie. In between the beginning and the end, there are no real showdowns between the good guys and the bad guys -- just the bad guys torturing people, burning people alive, and intimidating people.The film spends for more time on boring, sappy scenes with Max and his wife than it does with anything that advances the plot -- a plot which, by the way, essentially takes an hour off. Here's a tip if you are watching this movie for the first time &#x96; skip everything between about 10 and 70 minutes.

Soon the four people find themselves being held against their will for reasons that they really don't know. As a comedy NOTHING BUT TROUBLE is a complete disaster because there simply aren't any laughs. As entertainment NOTHING BUT TROUBLE works because it's just so downright bizarre, strange and surreal that you must say that you really haven't seen anything like it before. If THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE had been turned into an attempted comedy then it probably would have turned out something like this and it really does seem that Aykroyd's character, an elderly judge with a penis shaped nose, was fashioned after Grandpa in the classic horror film. But, where do we start with this thing? I must admit that I'm really not sure what Aykroyd was trying to do here because there's really never an attempt to make anything funny. In a comedy you expect a fresh stream of running jokes but honestly that doesn't happen here and instead it seems as if the director just wanted to be strange for the most part and every once in a while throw out an unfunny joke. The majority of the jokes either come from Chase marking a smart remark about something or the various deformities of the family are poked fun at. I already mentioned the nose that is shaped like a penis but one of the strangest bits come from a couple mutant children whose extra boobs and obese bellies are constantly bouncing. These two creatures are never funny but instead you just look at them like the characters and are just disturbed by how ugly they are. You also feel rather surreal being trapped in this environment so I guess if Aykroyd did anything right it's that he created a very strange atmosphere. The entire cast seems to be having a good time and everyone appears to be in on the joke. John Candy gets to play the town cop as well as his twin sister who of course gets a crush on Chase. NOTHING BUT TROUBLE was considered a disaster when it was first released but fans of bad movies or just flat out weird ones should at least be able to stay entertained.
