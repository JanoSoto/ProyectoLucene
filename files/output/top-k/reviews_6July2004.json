I think Momma has a point.  Sometimes failures can point the way to the future.  The 80's were a good barometer for that, and no other movie has blazed the trail of failure quite like Willard Huyck colossal miscalculation HOWARD THE DUCK. A movie that is inept and pointless, and yet so full of innovative and yes even breathtaking special effects.HOWARD THE DUCK tells the story of a duck named Howard (voiced by Chip Zein, and played by a bunch of little people in a duck suit) who lives on a planet much like earth, except Duck's are the top of the food chain.  He's a failed rock musician who's finally given up that dream and has settled into the mundane life of an advertising copywriter.  On one particular day, he's just gets home from another day of the daily grind, when he's sucked into a giant laser beam and transported to Cleveland, Ohio on our earth.  Let the comic hijinks begin&#133;well okay let the less than stellar puns begin.Howard meets Beverly (Lean Thompson) a struggling rock musician and takes up `roost' in her apartment.  After a day or so they fall in love.  There's also a young Lab Assistant named Phil (Tim Robbins in a star-making performance) and Dr. Jennings (Jefferey Jones) whom want to help Howard get home, via the giant laser beam that brought him to earth in the first place.I stop there because the second half of the movie has to do with this wild alien and I'm not quite sure I can do that part of the story any real justice.  Suffice to say there's an alien threat and Howard is here to stop it. Actually he kind of runs away from it as the alien menace and the cops try to stop him.HOWARD THE DUCK is based on a far more interesting and inventive comic book series created by Steve Gerber.  This movie and that series have absolutely nothing in common but the name.  In fact the movie ruined the comic book series that poor Steve Gerber sued Universal and George Lucas, and then killed off his Duck for a long time.  How's that for fair.Wait a second you say, go back just a minute, did you just say George Lucas?  Yes ladies and gentlemen.  George Lucas was the executive producer of this film and it shows.  His fingerprint is on everything and more importantly Industrial, Lights, and Magic have designed this film as their audition reel.  They throw everything into the pot, creature effects, stop motion, animation effects, makeup effects, an elaborate chase sequence (that I'm convinced was shot for shot re-created for the freeway chase in the MATRIX RELOADED, well not really but It's nice to speculate.) involving a small personal aircraft, and all of it is breath taking.But why?  Why did ILM and George Lucas waste all that time and energy?  The only thing I can think is that they were doing tests for Lucas's next big project WILLOW.    You're probably now asking why doesn't the film work?  The biggest problem is there is absoulty no screenplay.  The first 20 minutes of the film fly by, barely allowing the viewer to breathe.  The characters have time to meet, time to fight, time to get back together, all before the story begins to take shape.  By the time it does it shifts radically into a completely different movie involving giant space creatures.They started out with a promising idea; it's ET in the city.  How does this duck adapt to his surroundings?  That should have been the movie.  But there's no room for special effects that way.  So on comes Act 2, and so many effects shots you shake your head.I was also a little disgusted by the Human\/Duck love scene of course you see nothing, but the implied relationship makes even less sense then the rest of the movie and is really there just to make a silly joke anyway. This is the key to why this film fails.  It doesn't set its tone properly.  Every other line is some comic zinger that falls flat because the movie doesn't know whether it's a comedy, or an action picture.  There satire, and drama all thrown out there but it goes nowhere.  This effects all the acting as well.  The human characters are robbed of any humanity because the script is so disjointed.  They overreact to everything and poor Tim Robbins is forced to mug for laughs when the audience already knows that there are none.  The script by director Huyck and his writing partner Gloria Katz is so bad you forget that these are the people who hit just the right beats in their more successful film AMERICAN GRAFFITTI.The films biggest flaw is that it has no audience.  It a tad bit vulgar for little kids, and if you reach the age of 8 you'll be far smarter than this movie is.  As for adults there is nothing of substance in the movie for people to grab onto.  But I guess in the end could HOWARD THE DUCK been a good picture?  Maybe!  There were definitely moments of light in the picture.  Moments that seemed unforced.  I especially loved the early scenes involving Howard and Beverly.  An interesting story could have unfolded.  But the films exciting visuals were more important to the bottom line.  In fact the bulk of the film contains this huge chase scene involving airplanes, cars, 18-Wheelers and lots of destruction. Sure the scene is cool to look at but it's not worth the Journey.Stay away from Howard the Duck.** Out of 5    ","genre":null},{"date":"6 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Momma always said, `you learn more from your failures, than you do from your successes.'

I'll bet that puts to shame a LOT of modern movies. Of everything I've seen here, though, the plot is magnificently original. Guy loves girl, girl loves guy, guy gets killed, becomes a ghost with a bunch of others, tries to help wife, wife stops believing, etc. What's guy to do?I give this film my rating now.5 out of 5-*****  ","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"6 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spider-Man is an exceptional superhero movie that's good fun.

The violence is indulgent and over-the-top, the women all have silly '80s hair, and the main villain is the Dad from That '70s Show.  The whiskers on this movie are about a mile long.Aside from that, though, it's pretty good.  Ronny Cox is an engaging bad guy, often picking up the slack when the rest of the movie is falling down around him, and his final defeat is one of the cleverest gimmicks I've ever seen in a movie.  The social satire is entertaining, but ultimately quite predictable; don't all sci-fi movies predict that marketing will become infinitely more obnoxious in the future?  I have mixed praise for Robocop himself; he's got personality and he's easy to root for, but why is Murphy so much cooler as a cyborg than as a human?  He had to die to acquire a shred of charisma!At the end of the day, this is dated but fun - and it's nowhere near a masterpiece.

Maybe it is the combination of nostalgia, for people, places and a period of time.  Combine that with characters that are just plain folk, it just doesn't play as well as I'm sure it did in the 1950's.  Perhaps that's why despite a revival of the play on Broadway several years back, it along with other Inge plays are not revived as much as others.The storytelling or film making is of another era also.  Hard for me to describe but whenever I see a movie like Picnic, On the Waterfront, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or many others, they all have the same 1950's feel to them. I'm not well-versed in camera technique, but there is no mistaking that none of these films could have been made at any other time than the 1950's.

The TV teasers and the website - not to mention the various ancillary products (especially, The Blair Witch Project A Dossier) associated with the movie were uniformly first rate and whetted my appetite for the movie.Upon first viewing the movie, I was feeling rather foolish - I (and, apparently, millions of other had been had). What I saw was a short movie with a great premise and a few really good suspenseful\/scary scenes that had been stretched out to feature length by seemingly endless footage of the hapless principals wandering about lost in the woods and - even worse - continually whining about it. I was not a happy camper.Later, a few other members of my family saw the movie and they literally ranted and raved about how creepy it was and how a woman they saw at a local carnival was the spitting image of Mary Brown. This incident triggered a large number of conversations among their friends and family. The capper came when my wife watched it on Cable and it gave her the major willies.I began to think that maybe I had been too harsh in my judgment and that this movie deserved another viewing.Well, I have watched this movie about a half dozen times and I have good news and bad news. The good news is that it can be spooky fun for a while. The bad news is that the total quality time in this movie amounts to only about 1\/3 of the running length.I am still impressed with the concept and with the genuinely creepy look of some of the scenes but the best score I can muster is 5 points out of 10.I would really like the originators of this movie (or someone else who sees the potential for a really GOOD horror movie here) to re-imagine the project and , perhaps, include more of the back story (Rustin Parr and the Blair Witch herself).

I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure that the Hollywood remake that someone told me about, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that I am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved, or its setting changed to a different culture.A story I found worth watching, and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! Imagine that!All the characters seemed well-developed, ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. It's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something... he knows not precisely what.To the team of people in Japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it.

A tour de force, Stigmata touches the eye, the ear, the mind, and the heart.Every interaction of the movie Stigmata is a treatise towards faith, and not in a dogmatic sense, quite the contrary, in a real, physically transcendence.
