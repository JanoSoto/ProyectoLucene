It was a controversial work making a perverse assessment on the state of its times (the late 80s). Its initial publisher, Simon & Schuster, dropped the book just a month before its slated release date. The National Organization of Women threatened to file obscenity lawsuits against the novel, and boycott bookstores carrying it. Ellis's own life was threatened on several occasions. What is surprising then is that it took nearly ten years for it to become a feature film. Even more surprising, that it would eventually be adapted by two women.That said, Mary Herron, directing from a script she co-wrote with Guinevere Turner, turns in a memorably tense film. From the very first frames of the opening credits, Harron creates great tension as raspberry sauce decorates a dessert, splattering like blood on the white of the plate. Immediately, the tone is set for what's to come.Patrick Bateman (Bale) is living the American Dream. Or...he should be. He works a high-paying Wall Street job, lives in a pricey uptown apartment, is engaged to a beautiful fiancée (Witherspoon), and is banging her best friend (Samantha Mathis) on the side. The problem? His life is completely empty and soulless. I have all the characteristics of a human being, he tells us in voice-over, but not a single clear, identifiable emotion. His co-workers think him a loser, and tell him so to his face -- so forgettable is he, they don't even know they're talking to him. One such co-worker, Paul Allen (Jared Leto) leads a remarkably similar life to Bateman's. The difference is, Allen lives it better. His apartment is nicer, the cases he handles are bigger, his fake Vice President business card is glossier. Not to be outdone, Bateman, a man who strives for perfection and power, lashes out at Allen -- not with words, but with an axe to the face. Allen's sudden disappearance draws the attention of a private detective (a scene-stealing Dafoe), while Bateman's thirst for bloody mayhem becomes insatiable.The film holds secrets which I wouldn't dare spoil, and its ending leaves them very open to interpretation. It sticks with you, its ambiguity begging for mental closure. This is a movie worth seeing, for even if you don't like it, there is much left to be discussed.FINAL SCORE 8.7 = A- It seems ironic that Bale would move from Bateman to Batman -- worlds apart, they are held separate by only one letter. Still, Bateman is such an interesting character. Here is a man whose television blares porn as he goes about his business, and slasher flicks as he exercises; who pontificates on the musical strengths of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis while committing brutal murder. Such is the nature of the film shock and horror, with a side of black comedy. Bale delivers a remarkable performance, and Harron, a brutally mesmerizing masterpiece.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 March 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, they aren't really brothers and they don't really play the blues. And it's not really much as comedy, only intermittedly amusing, albeit spiced with some winning musical numbers that owe more to southern soul, gospel, and Tin Pan Alley than electric blues.But The Blues Brothers has fun and makes sure its audience does, too, goofing on its snarky cool, its demolition-derby aesthetic and setting into play a whole subgenre of film comedy, the Saturday Night Live knockoff.Joliet Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) find a higher purpose for their natural criminal bent when the orphanage that raised them is threatened with foreclosure. In order to raise the necessary funds, the Blues Brothers must reunite their old band and play a gig, while avoiding the angry attentions of an ex-girlfriend, a country-music band, Illinois Nazis, and most of the greater Chicago law enforcement community.Along with Lorne Michaels, I have a grudge with this film in that it delivered the death blow to the original and best Saturday Night Live cast by depriving it of two of its stars. Belushi and especially Aykroyd were amazingly versatile TV performers, and putting them in a movie wearing dark sunglasses and poker faces feels almost criminal.A lot of the scenes, especially those involving the Nazis and the country band, but also the excessive car chases, bog the film down, as does the coke-fueled narcissism of the two leads. But two things not only save but redeem the movie, the music and director John Landis.The musical numbers are the film's reason for being, not only because they spotlight some terrific performers and celebrate their art but for the way they electrify the film. Watching James Brown belt out a gospel number is great, but what sends it over the top is the kinetic dancing of his congregation, and the way Jake gets carried away by it. Likewise, the Blues Brothers themselves may be cruising as comedians, but they had something to prove as musicians and do so with some gut-bucket vocalizing from Belushi (listen to him sing that opening number, She Caught The Katy) and spastic hoofing from Aykroyd to the beat of Sweet Home Chicago in a raucous, blue-lit music hall.That leads to Landis, who keeps the film moving so fast you overlook the limp plot and blind alleys, and gives it a sheen that complements the aggressive score. When Ray Charles takes out a pistol and shoots at a small child, or Daley Plaza fills up with enough armed personnel to pacify Iraq, it works because Landis makes clear that we are dealing with a world only slightly connected to reality. Seeing the extended version that comes with the 25th Anniversary DVD really shows how Landis squeezed every bit of energy he could out of a script that Aykroyd wrote during his SNL downtime and could have been another Nothing But Trouble in less steady hands.Belushi has one great scene, when he's confronted by Carrie Fisher as his M-16-wielding ex-fiancée.

In order to raise the necessary funds, the Blues Brothers must reunite their old band and play a gig, while avoiding the angry attentions of an ex-girlfriend, a country-music band, Illinois Nazis, and most of the greater Chicago law enforcement community.Along with Lorne Michaels, I have a grudge with this film in that it delivered the death blow to the original and best Saturday Night Live cast by depriving it of two of its stars. Belushi and especially Aykroyd were amazingly versatile TV performers, and putting them in a movie wearing dark sunglasses and poker faces feels almost criminal.A lot of the scenes, especially those involving the Nazis and the country band, but also the excessive car chases, bog the film down, as does the coke-fueled narcissism of the two leads. But two things not only save but redeem the movie, the music and director John Landis.The musical numbers are the film's reason for being, not only because they spotlight some terrific performers and celebrate their art but for the way they electrify the film. Watching James Brown belt out a gospel number is great, but what sends it over the top is the kinetic dancing of his congregation, and the way Jake gets carried away by it. Likewise, the Blues Brothers themselves may be cruising as comedians, but they had something to prove as musicians and do so with some gut-bucket vocalizing from Belushi (listen to him sing that opening number, She Caught The Katy) and spastic hoofing from Aykroyd to the beat of Sweet Home Chicago in a raucous, blue-lit music hall.That leads to Landis, who keeps the film moving so fast you overlook the limp plot and blind alleys, and gives it a sheen that complements the aggressive score. When Ray Charles takes out a pistol and shoots at a small child, or Daley Plaza fills up with enough armed personnel to pacify Iraq, it works because Landis makes clear that we are dealing with a world only slightly connected to reality. Seeing the extended version that comes with the 25th Anniversary DVD really shows how Landis squeezed every bit of energy he could out of a script that Aykroyd wrote during his SNL downtime and could have been another Nothing But Trouble in less steady hands.Belushi has one great scene, when he's confronted by Carrie Fisher as his M-16-wielding ex-fiancée.

A man named Frank Brayker (William Sadler) is driving along a lonely highway as a demon known as the Collector (Billy Zane) closely follows, Brayker's car runs out of fuel & he continues to run from the Collector on foot. Brayker ends up at a nearby town called Wormwood where he meets a guy named Willy (Dick Miller) who takes him to an old Church now used as a Motel owned by Irene (CCH Pounder) who lets him have a room for the night. Meanwhile the Collector & the local police, Sheriff Tupper (John Schuck) & Deputy Bob (Gary Farmer) get wind of where Brayker is & want to question him about an attempted car theft. Things don't go to plan & Brayker is in fact the keeper of a key, one key out of a set of seven that if the Collector gets his hands on will be able to unleash a horde of demons across the world. It's Brayker & the few remaining residents of the Motel against the Collector & his horde of demons who will stop at nothing to obtain the key...Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson (& Gilbert Adler who directed the Crypt Keeper sequences) Demon Knight was the first big budget big screen spin-off from the popular (& great) Tales from the Crypt TV series that was meant to be part of a trilogy, a second film Bordello of Blood (1996) was made but a third never materialised because Bordello did so badly at the box office it killed the idea & series, to date anyway. The script by Ethan Reiff, Cyrus Voris & Mark Bishop moves along at a great pace, is never boring or dull & has has a nice sense of fun about it as it never seems to take itself too seriously. From the cool opening & closing Crypt Keeper scenes (I always enjoyed these bits in the TV series) with plenty of bad puns to Wally's dirty fantasy full of naked women to the flamboyant, wise cracking & cocky villain the Collector. The character's are a bit clichéd but they're all quite likable & since the film entertains as whole it didn't bother me that much. There isn't much in the way of a story & there's not much boring exposition but sometimes you just want to turn your brain off, sit down & enjoy a dumb mindless piece of horror film-making such as Demon Knight that features plenty of gore, monsters, one liners, action, nudity & doesn't go on for what seems like hours. Better than one might expect & an all round good film.Director Dickerson does a good job, some of the horror sequences seem a bit choppy but maybe this was down to censorship reasons so it could play in theatres. The film has a nice style, he keeps things moving along at a nice pace, he seems to know what his intended audience wants & he delivers. There is some cool gore here, a ripped off arm, a melting face & skull, slimy demons, the Collector punches someone in the face & puts his hand right through their head, decapitations, blood spurting, stomachs & chests ripped open, exploding demon heads & various bits of human & demon carnage all achieved with some cool over-the-top splatter effects that thankfully doesn't use any crappy CGI.I have to admit that I was extremely surprised when I found out that Demon Knight had a budget of about $12,000,000 as I simply cannot see where the money went, there are no big name stars & a very small cast of character's, the special effects are of the rubbery latex actors in suits variety, there are no big action scenes & the entire film takes place in one location. Personally I'd expect a little bit more from 12 big ones. Demon Knight just doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from loads of other horror films that had far less lavished on them. The acting is pretty good, Zane makes for a memorable villain & Jada Pinkett Smith the future Mrs Will Smith has a leading role.Demon Knight is good fun & terrific entertainment especially if your a horror fan, such as myself.

Stone over-extends the film's perspective, and it leaves the film feeling very long at times. Still, when it hits, it's incredible. The chapter-search button was built for movies like this.

Steal a loaf of bread to keep from starving and get years of hard labor in the slams. Have an accident at work and lose your job and catch tuberculosis? Become a whore until you become so sick that nobody wants to pay for a corpse. Except in this case, the poor woman is Uma Thurman. She's thoroughly deglamorized, true, and her bloody mouth is off-putting but still, whatever she's charging isn't enough. She's tall and lissome. Come to think of it, put Uma Thurman together with Mariel Hemingway and Famke Janssen and you've got a complete girl's basketball team.What a splendid adaptation of Hugo's novel, which I barely remember. It's not hard to follow the story but, as in the case of so many 19th-century novels, it's filled with subplots and implausibilities. Somehow -- whether it's in Paris or St. Petersberg -- everybody seems to know everybody else, and they keep bumping into one another under curious circumstances.I see I'm skipping much of the main plot but its basic features are already familiar. Liam Neeson, the convict, breaks his parole, establishes himself as the mayor of a French village. He turns into a good and moral man and he adopts, Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of Uma Thurman. Alas, his latent identity is found out by Geoffrey Rush as Javert, the kind of bitterly devoted police official who follows the rules abjectly, even to his own disadvantage. His is one of the most famous names in literature and for good reason. He is not the personification of evil. He's an ambiguous figure whose own father was a criminal and who wants to see punishment meted out wholesale in an attempt at his own redemption. When he changes his mind, it's a stunning moment. And Rush handles the character flawlessly.In fact, all of the performances are uniformly good and they more than make up for some of the evident weaknesses in the plot. Why, for instance, doesn't Liam Neason level with his adopted daughter and tell her the truth about his background. The daughter is played by Clare Danes, a New Yorker who sounds as if she has perfect pitch for English accents and who has the widest, most curious eyes in the business. But she has to pry Neason's story out of him. And Neasom, sheltering his secret and his adopted daughter, finds himself in the same situation as poor Humbert Humbert, becoming a jealous and demanding authoritarian father trying to control the amorous and otherwise self-indulgent impulses of a resentful adolescent girl.The location shooting was done in the Czech Republic, which has done duty for 19th-century cities like Vienna, Paris, and others. I forget them all. In Prague you can still find thoroughfares with old stately buildings and no McDonalds. The wintry rural scenes are utterly dreary, the result of continental climates that make every exurban landscape look like a vest-pocket park in Linden, New Jersey. What a climate to be poor in.Poverty was a cruel condition in Hugo's time or Dickens' time for that matter. And, as now, many ordinary, good, religious people attributed it entirely to a lack of ambition. It's much easier to think like a psychologist than like a sociologist. We can all understand what motives are because we all experience them consciously. It's much more difficult for us to sense the extraordinarily powerful social conditions that affect everyday lives. Think you have free will and can do what you want? Try wearing a toga to school. We never seem to realize how much others are impacted by systemic conditions until the results are self evident.

If you're looking for a movie to both show you a good time and give you something to think about, look no further. It is Philip K.

There are very few film-makers in the industry today who can create a film that flirts with pretentiousness so wonderfully and actually manages to leave you off not bothered by that fact one bit. Science fiction, underlying philosophy, symbolism that is so vibrant you simply cannot miss it, beautiful cinematography, sensational score, the greatest action scenes ever seen up to that day (which have been since copied mercilessly) and a wonderful cast of actors and actresses. Can it get any better? The story takes us along the journey of one Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker known in cyberspace as Neo (KEANU REEVES). Thomas leads a rather dull life anywhere outside his own computer, until the day he is heaved out of anonymity and boredom by the mysterious TRINITY (CARRIE-ANNE MOSS), subordinate to the legendary man Thomas\/Neo has been searching for years, Morpheus (LAURENCE FISHBURNE). The plot soon thickens, as Neo gets more than he bargained for and comes to discover 'just how deep the rabbit hole goes'. The male, aloof version of 'Alice' in this phenomenal film gets thrown into a 'Wonderland' that proves to be cold, alien and terrifying, but more real than anything he had so far witnessed. Or is it? I will come out and state that I am a very big fan of KEANU REEVES. Although fully aware that he is not among the best actors out there, I am prepared to give him a chance to prove himself as an actor in any of the projects he gets involved in. When I later on heard that the original choices for Neo included Will Smith and Tom Cruise, I cringed. KEANU becomes Neo in this film. There is a certain style he has adopted for many years now in his acting, and for this film, it works incredibly well. Venturing into the film alongside him, you can feel Neo's insecurities, his hesitance to become what he is allegedly destined to. A reluctant hero is all his glory, and KEANU is very effective in conveying that. He pulls off the part of the leading man wonderfully, and is framed by an equally capable cast. CARRIE-ANNE MOSS counters the slightly feminine (or rather asexual) look and softer personality of the leading man, and does so brilliantly. As Trinity, she moves with the grace of a woman and the discipline of a mercenary. It is no stretch to assume that two-thirds of the leading trio were cast as such purposefully. The third person to complete the hero triad is played by LAURENCE FISHBURNE, an actor for which, I am certain, no words are needed. Strong leader, caring 'father' to his crew, unyielding mercenary. LAURENCE slips into his part effortlessly.But surely, the greatest treat of this movie casting-wise is the awe-inspiring villain, Agent Smith, played by HUGO WEAVING. What a find! I have since then followed the man's career and was pleased to see that he does as incredibly as he did in THE MATRIX. Although fully convincing you the he is naught but a part of the machine world, HUGO breathes life into his robotic character. A machine with personality, you'll ask? I assure you that it is later on justified.THE MATRIX is well on its way of becoming a jewel of a movie for the young ones to get to know, and the older ones to fondly remember.I urge you to watch this movie again if you have already seen it and enjoyed it; you'll discover something new with every single viewing, since the amount of detail in this picture is almost insane. Kudos to the crew that worked so hard to achieve this result.

It's a movie for people who enjoy well-crafted cinema.

If you're looking for a movie to both show you a good time and give you something to think about, look no further. It is Philip K. Dick and William Gibson made cool for the masses, without ever losing even a fragment of its intelligence as a picture.What more can possibly be said about two --back then rather unknown- directors who managed to craft a film whose each and every aspect is a delight to witness on screen? There are very few film-makers in the industry today who can create a film that flirts with pretentiousness so wonderfully and actually manages to leave you off not bothered by that fact one bit. Science fiction, underlying philosophy, symbolism that is so vibrant you simply cannot miss it, beautiful cinematography, sensational score, the greatest action scenes ever seen up to that day (which have been since copied mercilessly) and a wonderful cast of actors and actresses. Can it get any better? The story takes us along the journey of one Thomas A. Anderson, a hacker known in cyberspace as Neo (KEANU REEVES). Thomas leads a rather dull life anywhere outside his own computer, until the day he is heaved out of anonymity and boredom by the mysterious TRINITY (CARRIE-ANNE MOSS), subordinate to the legendary man Thomas\/Neo has been searching for years, Morpheus (LAURENCE FISHBURNE). The plot soon thickens, as Neo gets more than he bargained for and comes to discover 'just how deep the rabbit hole goes'. The male, aloof version of 'Alice' in this phenomenal film gets thrown into a 'Wonderland' that proves to be cold, alien and terrifying, but more real than anything he had so far witnessed. Or is it? I will come out and state that I am a very big fan of KEANU REEVES. Although fully aware that he is not among the best actors out there, I am prepared to give him a chance to prove himself as an actor in any of the projects he gets involved in. When I later on heard that the original choices for Neo included Will Smith and Tom Cruise, I cringed. KEANU becomes Neo in this film. There is a certain style he has adopted for many years now in his acting, and for this film, it works incredibly well. Venturing into the film alongside him, you can feel Neo's insecurities, his hesitance to become what he is allegedly destined to. A reluctant hero is all his glory, and KEANU is very effective in conveying that. He pulls off the part of the leading man wonderfully, and is framed by an equally capable cast. CARRIE-ANNE MOSS counters the slightly feminine (or rather asexual) look and softer personality of the leading man, and does so brilliantly. As Trinity, she moves with the grace of a woman and the discipline of a mercenary. It is no stretch to assume that two-thirds of the leading trio were cast as such purposefully. The third person to complete the hero triad is played by LAURENCE FISHBURNE, an actor for which, I am certain, no words are needed. Strong leader, caring 'father' to his crew, unyielding mercenary. LAURENCE slips into his part effortlessly.But surely, the greatest treat of this movie casting-wise is the awe-inspiring villain, Agent Smith, played by HUGO WEAVING. What a find! I have since then followed the man's career and was pleased to see that he does as incredibly as he did in THE MATRIX. Although fully convincing you the he is naught but a part of the machine world, HUGO breathes life into his robotic character. A machine with personality, you'll ask? I assure you that it is later on justified.THE MATRIX is well on its way of becoming a jewel of a movie for the young ones to get to know, and the older ones to fondly remember.I urge you to watch this movie again if you have already seen it and enjoyed it; you'll discover something new with every single viewing, since the amount of detail in this picture is almost insane. Kudos to the crew that worked so hard to achieve this result. If you haven't seen it, rent it as soon as possible.This is not just a movie for people who (like me) enjoy comic books, Sci-Fi, computers and Kung Fu.

The film is your every day story of a bunch of criminals holding a bunch of people against their will. It's not very original; and it's not very good either, as while Spacey was casting the film, he seems to have forgotten to think of a point for it. Albino Alligator features a rather impressive cast list, which includes the likes of Faye Dunaway, Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Skeet Ulrich, Viggo Mortensen, William Fichtner and M. Emmet Walsh; but no Kevin Spacey himself, who spends the entire duration behind the camera. In fairness, Spacey's direction is assured enough, and he ensures that the film runs at a smooth pace all the way through. The majority of the film focuses on what is going on inside the bar that the thieves have hijacked, and this is offset by the police and media presence outside of it. However, rather than going down the road of Dog Day Afternoon, Albino Alligator keeps both of these sides of the story separate...and the result is a film that is more boring than it could have been.The acting is your typical 'heavyweight' stuff, but I can't say that it impressed me much. I was a bigger fan of Matt Damon before his role in the cheesy flick 'Crash'; but this is one of his 'miss' films. Faye Dunaway enjoys herself in her role, but doesn't impress with it. Gary Sinise and William Fichtner aren't given a lot to do, despite appearing for most of the running time. I liked Skeet Ulrich in Scream, but roles in films like this have ensured that he doesn't get noticed. Viggo Mortensen proved himself recently with an excellent performance in A History of Violence - but here he's simply in the movie and the only actor here that I like is The Simpsons' Fat Tony, M. Emmet Walsh, who is entertaining as a copper outside. He is rewarded in this respect with the film's best scene, which sees him swearing to a press reporter. It would seem that writer Christian Forte tried to fill in the gap where the point should be with an anecdote about albino alligators; but quite how this really figures in the plot is anyone's guess. The film doesn't even capitalise on the fact that it has a load of different characters stuck in a space together. On the whole; there is nothing to recommend this for.

It made me want to NOT go. But my friend wanted to see it and, heck, she was paying so why not? I spent 3\/4 of the movie with my feet up on the seat. I was never much for ocean swimming in the first place; this put the nail in the coffin (tho I have gotten over it enough to snorkel in Hawaii - nice CLEAR water there that you can SEE in).This, of course, was Spielberg's first commercial film and he and his team made the most of it. The thing is, we don't really SEE the shark very often (The shark is not working. Repeat, the shark is not working.) and, IMHO, that just makes it better. Makes the suspense almost unbearable. The stunt shark (Bruce), when cut together with the film shot by the B unit in Australia is pretty darn convincing when we DO see it. The cinematography is stunning and some of the shots are ground breaking; the zoom-push when Brody sees the shark attack the little boy for one. It's no wonder Spielberg became one of the most respected directors ever. And don't forget the brilliant editing.The cast is great, but the threesome on the boat are amazing. I absolutely adored Robert Shaw. I was heartbroken when he died a few years later. Schieder and Dreyfus were stellar. The scene recounting the Indianapolis' sinking gives me chills to this day. I read that Shaw did the bulk of it (his close-ups) all in one take. It wouldn't surprise me. I cannot understand why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this.

Watched the director's cut recently and realized that the whole movie was horrible. The acting was OK but the swordfighting scenes were so amateurish and even more so when I found out that Bob Anderson was the choreographer. Whoever came up with the little 'facts' about that ugly dragon headed 'katana' obviously did not do his or her homework. A true Japanese sword has more than 1000 layers even at its minimum, not 200 as mentioned in the movie.

But then each time I watched it after that it got better and better. it is hard to see the brilliance of this movie the first time you watch it. the brilliant thing about it is that its point is that it doesn't really have a point it is just a story about two guys and their search for the American dream strung out on every drug known to man. I wish I had read the book before watching the movie because after I read the book it made me understand the movie better and the pure genius of Hunter S. Thompson. I have also never seen two actors get so into their characters as Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. These characters go to extremes and push each other to the edge and over it and then their are times, especially when HST talks about life in the middle 60's, where he really hits on something meaningful to a lot of people. This movie is just jam packed with so much stuff that each time you watch it you discover something new.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"19 March 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There are at least ten reasons why you should watch this wonderful, macabre movie10) Justin Theroux is in the movie and he went to Bennington. So did Bret Easton Ellis, who you undoubtedly know wrote the book this movie is based on, but they didn't attend at the same time. That's okay though because I just like that a Bennington alumnus starred in a film based on a book by another alumnus. That and I think Theroux can be talented when working with a decent director, as he does here. 9) They kill Jared Leto's character. Any movie that does that gets at least an additional two stars. It can make a mediocre movie into something I would describe as a good way to spend two hours (Panic Room, I'm looking at you). 8) The book is pretty much unreadable, to me, and not because of its gore (though there's some rough stuff there); it's just boring and the pages and pages and pages about Huey Lewis really aren't that fascinating to anyone other than BEE. 7) The obligatory defusing of misogyny It was made by a woman! The Patrick Bateman character kills women (grusomely)! So it's okay! I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. Frankly, the violence against women here is appropriate because, duh, we're not supposed to like Patrick Bateman. We're supposed to see him as a product of his deluded times. We're supposed to understand that he's either become unhinged as a result of contemporary impersonality or he's a monster because of that impersonality. 6) Willem Defoe's performance as an inept version of Columbo (who was inept enough as it was) is brilliant. 5) The film is delirious, completely. It moves fast and, in a lot of ways, seems as insane as its anti-protagonist. However, it never feels that it's out of control; you know all the time that the filmmakers know how crazy, absurd, and darkly funny the material and performances are. It's almost like some gruesome, EC comic from the 1950s. That's a compliment. 4) Reese Witherspoon3) Remember how I complained about pages upon pages in the book that expound upon the virtues of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis? Here they work because their shorter and, frankly, they're visual jokes, ultimately. Who knew it was funnier to actually watch a deranged psychopath go after someone with an ax while discussing Sussudio?2) Christian Bale proves yet again that he needs more work. I'm glad he's getting more of it now, but I think those of us that saw this and Velvet Goldmine were wondering why we weren't seeing more of him. 1) It's just a very very good movie that many people will find enjoyable. Unless they dislike bloodshed, in which case they should stay away.
