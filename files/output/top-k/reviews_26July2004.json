[{"date":"26 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is a movie about Max Fischer(Jason Schwartzman) a young man who is enrolled in the prestigious prep-school bearing the movie's title.  He is far more ambitious than most.  His problem is that he spreads himself too thin.  He is the founder or president of half a dozen clubs and involved in many others as well.  He is in so many clubs and organizations, in fact, that his grades are horrible.  He's obviously smart enough to get better grades.  When the school's headmaster tells him he's about to be expelled if he fails one more test, Max thinks of ways to get around it, without ever even considering buckling down and studying. The story gets interesting when he becomes friends with a rich Rushmore alumnus named Herman(Bill Murray).  Shortly after, Max falls for a teacher at Rushmore, Ms. Cross(Olivia Williams).  From here, Max and Herman's friendship is thoroughly tested when Herman realizes he is also in love with the timorous Rosemary Cross, despite being a married man with two children. The movie certainly has its funny moments.  I especially liked Murray's speech in an early scene.  He urges the students that aren't already rich to take dead aim on the rich ones.  I also enjoyed hearing all of Max's embellishments.  He tells people his father, a barber, is a brain surgeon.When the movie gets too serious is when it looses its way a bit.   Max becomes sinister in his actions against Herman during their dispute over Ms. Cross.  A scene involving Max and Ms. Cross also is quite staid and seems like it belongs in a different film. Finally, director Wes Anderson gives us a trite ending that detracts from the overall tone of the movie.  I guess I did want everything to work out for Max, but things get hunkydory to the point of silliness.  Anderson's film is mostly offbeat and should have stayed that way for the duration.
