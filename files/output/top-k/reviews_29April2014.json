This films excellence did not surprise me when I first watched it knowing it came from the visionary Fritz Lang. Usually when we think of serial killer films we think of a cop and a killer fighting and the cop eventually finding the killer, but in M you also have other criminals and even townspeople searching for the madman. It's incredible script, cinematography and Peter Lorre's performance inspired many films of this genre but you can see that not film can match the wonderfully exiting, suspenseful and overall genius M.
