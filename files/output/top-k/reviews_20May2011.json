It is one of those movies that, even if you don't love it, you still find it hard to truly dislike. The film tells the story of two warriors in search of a legendary sword that was recently stolen. The trail leads them to a teenage warrior who is going through a difficult part of her life as she has to choose between two worlds that she has become involved in. One is with royalty, the other with a fugitive who she is madly in love with. This is a hypnotic film with a certain quiet beauty to it that is as immaculate as it is raw. The film is pure, alive, and practically flawless as far as filmmaking goes from a technical point of view.It is a film like this that comes to mind when I think epic scale production. This film is grand, glorious, and mighty. And yet it is also gentle, dainty, and beautiful. It is this contrast that so mystifies the mind as you watch it and makes this film very different from any you have ever seen before. I found myself not so much moved by this film, but rather entranced. Throughout the film I was still, focused, and attentive. The film draws you in very slowly and it plays with you as you learn more about the characters and the film itself.The story here is more complex than average and you have to work to keep up with it, especially with all the odd subtitled names. I'll admit that I got lost a few times but I didn't have much trouble catching back up and keeping up to date with everything going on. This film actually plays a fairly cruel trick on you. You think it is very straightforward and won't be difficult to follow. However, as the film goes on you begin to realize that it is much less accessible than you at first thought. You realize this after you've been lulled into this false sense of security, then you have fallen behind and you miss a lot of what has been going on. I still really liked this film, despite being fooled by it, so I definitely feel like it deserves a re-watch.Now, for whatever reason, the people in this film can fly. Yes, fly. Unless I missed it, it is never explained why they can do this, and you just have to take it for granted. But the beauty of it is that you do take this for granted and you quickly buy into the idea that these characters can fly, just because of how well this element is utilized. The martial arts fight scenes in this film are just astounding to watch. The beautiful choreography of these fights turn them more into immaculate dances than actual fight scenes. And they are shot with the utmost care and keen eye for detail. You never miss a single swipe for punch through Ang Lee's fabulous direction of these fights. At first I wanted to call the fights in this movie awesome. But then I realized I was wrong. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Star Wars is awesome. Saving Private Ryan is awesome. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is beautiful.This is a very good film. It tells an epic story that enthralls you from start to finish, throwing in incredibly well orchestrated fights that astound the mind while entertaining the eye. It takes effort to fully appreciate this films story and everything else about it, but it is an effort worth spending.

In my case, The Godfather Part III, was not the last opus of a magnificent saga, but the first film I watched from the trilogy, my first encounter with the Corleone Family, a cinematic love story that would never end.Speaking of love, I always wondered how a movie like The Godfather Part III had crystallized so much hatred and disdain. The unforgettable Never hate your enemies, because it clouds your judgment is like a self-defense cry, from a film that wanted so much to be respected like its glorious predecessors, but apparently failed to, for even the fans will always concede after they say how the movie is great &#x85; but not as great as the two others So, as a fourteen-year old kid, I loved The Godfather Part III, I couldn't complain about the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I wasn't mature enough to judge Sofia Coppola's acting abilities though I found something physically odd in her. From Michael's relationship with Kay to his haircut, Part III was my reference. And I guess I loved the movie for what it was a great story with an unforgettable climax.Till now, I can't watch the ending, even the clip, without crying, it broke my heart the first time, and it always does, even after so many viewings. It was like I felt the devastation of a man whose life's only meaning was incarnated by his children, his only inspiration in his quest of redemption. And it's ironically the very part that kind of redeems the film, even for the non fans. The others deserving to be mentioned are Michael Corleone's sadness while hearing the 'Brucia La Terra' song played by his son, and his heart-breaking confession of Fredo's murder &#x85; The film is about the redemption of a man who sinned so many times. Many would argue that his sins were necessary because they were the only ways to maintain the interests of his family, but hell is paved with many good intentions, and the way Michael ended at The Godfather Part II, a ruthless cold-blooded zombie-like figure was demanding a sequel. The last shot of him, sitting alone in the park plunged viewers in a lot of interrogations and interpretations. What was he thinking? Probably, how he got in such a situation, and how this would end. And it's like Coppola, tortured by his own demons, felt there was more to do with Michael Corleone.And the character's arc was concluded, with nothing I would reproach in Michael's portrayal, he's tired, sick as he had carried the weight of a lifelong guilt that ravaged his soul. He may be too pathetic, too different from the Michael we know,his use of profanity was quite out-of character, but who knows how killing his own brother could affect someone. Michael is still respected and feared, but is more melancholic, explaining how the movie needed to be driven by more active supporting characters. And after I finally watched the two other films, one year later &#x85; my opinions were mixed.First, I was fascinated by the sight of young War hero, Michael Corleone, in Connie's wedding, it was so contrasting with the pitiful diabetic Mike of the third opus, watching Part I was an extraordinary discovery, a refreshing experience. Besides, the gallery of new characters, Sonny, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, enriched the film and made it even more entertaining, Part II confirmed my fascination. And step by step, when I started to watch the first two a little more and while I was sharing my opinions on the Net and learning about Part III's reputation, flaws were becoming more visible Sofia, Duvall's absence and replacement by that Hamilton guy who was certainly not to Hagen what Pentangelli was to Clemenza, the helicopter scene etc. And the reading of the book made me wonder why they chose as the successor, Sonny's illegitimate son.But if the film could have been better, it also could have been worse. And when I watch it, I'm more generous, as I see the tragic ending of one of the most fascinating character's story, a man who's always been pulled back in. The movie respects the spirit of Part I, with a succession on the Corleone's throne, true historical events as back-stories, and so many unforgettable lines. In fact, we can make a parallel between the trilogy and the Corleone brothers - The Godfather is like Sonny  fierce, brutal, yet tender and good-hearted, it's entertaining and deep in the same time. And we all just love 'Sonny' ...- The Godfather Part II is Michael  deeper, darker, smoother, yes, even 'boring' sometimes, but it's more implacable and ruthless ... we can't love it with the same intensity as the first opus, but we respect the cinematic achievement, and it leaves us with an extraordinary feeling. It's not the most entertaining, but certainly the most fascinating.And of course ...- The Godfather Part III is Fredo  it tries too much, it has a good heart but it's weak and even sometimes 'stupid' but hey, it's still a blood brother of the first two films, we still feel Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's touch and it features some heartbreaking moments, like Michael's silent scream that will haunt me forever. Some magnetism was lacking from the very start, but can we really hate 'Fredo'? I'm sure those who prefer the first film also appreciate the last one and those who love the second film and think it's the best one, identify so much with Michael that they hate Part III, with the same intensity and severity Michael expressed towards Fredo. They don't forgive any mistake ... and consider the last film a disgrace for the trilogy, and symbolically disown it.

The others deserving to be mentioned are Michael Corleone's sadness while hearing the 'Brucia La Terra' song played by his son, and his heart-breaking confession of Fredo's murder &#x85; The film is about the redemption of a man who sinned so many times. Many would argue that his sins were necessary because they were the only ways to maintain the interests of his family, but hell is paved with many good intentions, and the way Michael ended at The Godfather Part II, a ruthless cold-blooded zombie-like figure was demanding a sequel. The last shot of him, sitting alone in the park plunged viewers in a lot of interrogations and interpretations. What was he thinking? Probably, how he got in such a situation, and how this would end. And it's like Coppola, tortured by his own demons, felt there was more to do with Michael Corleone.And the character's arc was concluded, with nothing I would reproach in Michael's portrayal, he's tired, sick as he had carried the weight of a lifelong guilt that ravaged his soul. He may be too pathetic, too different from the Michael we know,his use of profanity was quite out-of character, but who knows how killing his own brother could affect someone. Michael is still respected and feared, but is more melancholic, explaining how the movie needed to be driven by more active supporting characters. And after I finally watched the two other films, one year later &#x85; my opinions were mixed.First, I was fascinated by the sight of young War hero, Michael Corleone, in Connie's wedding, it was so contrasting with the pitiful diabetic Mike of the third opus, watching Part I was an extraordinary discovery, a refreshing experience. Besides, the gallery of new characters, Sonny, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, enriched the film and made it even more entertaining, Part II confirmed my fascination. And step by step, when I started to watch the first two a little more and while I was sharing my opinions on the Net and learning about Part III's reputation, flaws were becoming more visible Sofia, Duvall's absence and replacement by that Hamilton guy who was certainly not to Hagen what Pentangelli was to Clemenza, the helicopter scene etc. And the reading of the book made me wonder why they chose as the successor, Sonny's illegitimate son.But if the film could have been better, it also could have been worse. And when I watch it, I'm more generous, as I see the tragic ending of one of the most fascinating character's story, a man who's always been pulled back in. The movie respects the spirit of Part I, with a succession on the Corleone's throne, true historical events as back-stories, and so many unforgettable lines. In fact, we can make a parallel between the trilogy and the Corleone brothers - The Godfather is like Sonny  fierce, brutal, yet tender and good-hearted, it's entertaining and deep in the same time. And we all just love 'Sonny' ...- The Godfather Part II is Michael  deeper, darker, smoother, yes, even 'boring' sometimes, but it's more implacable and ruthless ... we can't love it with the same intensity as the first opus, but we respect the cinematic achievement, and it leaves us with an extraordinary feeling. It's not the most entertaining, but certainly the most fascinating.And of course ...- The Godfather Part III is Fredo  it tries too much, it has a good heart but it's weak and even sometimes 'stupid' but hey, it's still a blood brother of the first two films, we still feel Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's touch and it features some heartbreaking moments, like Michael's silent scream that will haunt me forever. Some magnetism was lacking from the very start, but can we really hate 'Fredo'? I'm sure those who prefer the first film also appreciate the last one and those who love the second film and think it's the best one, identify so much with Michael that they hate Part III, with the same intensity and severity Michael expressed towards Fredo. They don't forgive any mistake ... and consider the last film a disgrace for the trilogy, and symbolically disown it.

In my case, The Godfather Part III, was not the last opus of a magnificent saga, but the first film I watched from the trilogy, my first encounter with the Corleone Family, a cinematic love story that would never end.Speaking of love, I always wondered how a movie like The Godfather Part III had crystallized so much hatred and disdain. The unforgettable Never hate your enemies, because it clouds your judgment is like a self-defense cry, from a film that wanted so much to be respected like its glorious predecessors, but apparently failed to, for even the fans will always concede after they say how the movie is great &#x85; but not as great as the two others So, as a fourteen-year old kid, I loved The Godfather Part III, I couldn't complain about the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I wasn't mature enough to judge Sofia Coppola's acting abilities though I found something physically odd in her. From Michael's relationship with Kay to his haircut, Part III was my reference. And I guess I loved the movie for what it was a great story with an unforgettable climax.Till now, I can't watch the ending, even the clip, without crying, it broke my heart the first time, and it always does, even after so many viewings.

The film which many would argue invented noir. If this was indeed the first film noir the genre could hardly have gotten off to a better start. Powered by a thoroughly captivating performance from Humphrey Bogart the film is an undoubted triumph. And if it could be said to have invented noir it also in a way invented Bogart. This was the film which began his rise from background studio player to Hollywood legend. But for as memorable as Bogart is in the film he is by no means alone in his brilliance here. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and a delightfully fiendish Sydney Greenstreet are all outstanding as well, each a worthy foil for Bogart. Great acting combined with a great, mysterious story. That's a clear recipe for success.The story unfolds in San Francisco with Bogart playing private investigator Sam Spade. He and his partner, Miles Archer, take on a seemingly simple case. A woman, Ruth Wonderly, hires them to tail a man named Floyd Thursby. Something to do with retrieving Ruth's wayward sister who is traveling with Thursby. Simple. Then Archer and Thursby turn up dead. Less simple. Now Sam Spade's got a mess on his hands. He's got a dead partner. And he's got the police sniffing around thinking he killed Thursby to avenge that dead partner. He's going to need to go to Ruth Wonderly and have her make some sense out of all of this. Which would be much easier if Ruth Wonderly actually existed.When Sam tracks down Ruth she comes clean. Her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The story about her missing sister was a bunch of hogwash. The real story? Well, we're not going to get the real story just yet. Even when Brigid comes clean she seems to have quite a problem in forcing the truth out of her mouth. She's still hiding something. What is this all about? Well ultimately of course it is about the Maltese Falcon. The black bird. What is the Maltese Falcon? That will be revealed in time. For now all we, and Sam Spade, really need to know is that people are willing to kill for it.It's a story of twists and turns, of lies and double-crosses. And undoubted danger. Menacing figures will enter the fray. The Fat Man, for instance. Real name Kasper Gutman. Downright terrifying he would be if not for the fact that, as played by Greenstreet, he comes across as a rather jovial fellow. Greenstreet created a terrific character here, one with great, quirky personality. A fiend, but a charming fiend. A man for whom obtaining the Maltese Falcon is his life's quest. His partner in crime is Joel Cairo, as played by Lorre. Cairo's no menace, he knows the value of the Falcon and wants it desperately but if he has to resort to violence to get it he's got problems. Violence is not his forte. When violence is called for that's what the Fat Man's got Wilmer for. Elisha Cook Jr. plays this part, the henchman who would love nothing more than to empty a few slugs into Sam Spade. Overshadowed by the bigger stars Cook does very well with this smaller role. All the supporting players do well, there's not a false step anywhere. But of course the movie belongs to Sam Spade. To Bogart.Bogart's performance in this film is legendary, and rightly so. Everything swirls around him. It's a great story, full of great drama and mystery, punctuated by wonderfully memorable dialogue. If the story has any flaw at all it would probably be that Sam Spade falls for Brigid O'Shaughnessy much too quickly, especially considering what she's gotten him caught up in. Everything unfolds so quickly he really has no time to know her, much less love her. But if Sam and Brigid have real feelings for each other that will make the climax much more powerful and dramatic. So even if this whirlwind would-be romance strains credulity a bit we'll just go with it. With the way Bogart and Astor play off one another so beautifully it's hard to really complain.

The title is adapted from Ian Fleming's short story From a View to a Kill but has an original plot. It's the last film to star Roger Moore as James Bond. This is also the last Bond movie featuring Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, role she had played in all the Bond films since Dr. No.The British Secret Service discovers that someone has been manufacturing microchips that can withstand electromagnetic pulses to Russians. Bond is sent to investigate Max Zorin, the owner of Zorin Industries that most likely developed the chips. Bond follows Zorin to his estate in France pretending to be interested in horse races. Bond finds that Zorin has developed chips to help him win the races, but is discovered soon after. Zorin also has something far more sinister planned in San Francisco.Like Octopussy, A View to a Kill is a highly underrated Bond movie. The things people have problems is that the plot owns a lot to Goldfinger and that Roger Moore was too old to play the part. While I admit the plot does have many similarities to Goldfinger it still manages to be very 80's instead of 60's and not seem like a complete rip-off. The movie also has a great theme song by Duran Duran and John Barry's best score since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Moore definitely is showing his age here and it was obviously time for him to quit. Yet I have to say he still manages to carry the movie with the same charm as the previous films and his age isn't really that distracting as people complain. What I find amusing is how this is the only movie showing what a great cook Bond can be in a kitchen.The rest of the cast is an unusual mix of people. Tanya Roberts plays the good girl of the film, Stacey Sutton, and while she's not great she's okay enough to not to ruin the film. This is still the part of her career when she managed to keep her clothes on. The bad girl of the movie, May Day, is played by singer Grace Jones. Definitely an unexpected choice for the role but in all honesty, Jones does really well in the part and is more interesting than Roberts.The role of the main villain of the movie, Max Zorin, was first offered to such people as David Bowie and Sting. While Bowie would have been interesting to see as Bond villain, I can't complain that they ultimately got Christopher Walken, who had recently won an Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Walken always makes a good bad guy and out of all the Bond villains Zorin has to be the most psychotic. Just watching him laugh while he shoots people with a machine gun shows how crazy he is.A View to a Kill is not amongst the best Bond films made, but it's definitely above average and a fun movie to watch. There's a lots of action like Bond driving a fire engine through the streets of San Francisco and a climactic battle at the Golden Gate Bridge. This is a fine Bond movie and a proper way for Roger Moore to end his career as 007.

Dick Blaney is a former RAF officer down on his luck whose ex-wife is the latest victim. Can he prove his innocence and unmask the real killer ?Frenzy is the great Alfred Hitchcock's last hurrah. Although he made one more film (the enjoyable but light-hearted Family Plot), this is a great nail-biting thriller of the kind he did so well, with crafty twists galore, stunning sequences, mischievous black humour and incredible suspense throughout. It's also in many ways a return to his roots; although he became a naturalised American and made all his most famous movies there, he never lost the Britishness of his manner, sense of comedy and cinematic style. Frenzy is really his only out-and-out all-British film since the thirties, and the Covent Garden setting is literally where he grew up (his father was a grocer there, just like Rusk). His amusing cameo near the start in a city gent bowler hat is a lovely touch which epitomises this, almost as if he had come full circle from his great early films like The Lodger. It's also chock-full of his favourite themes; the crazed killer, the wrong man, the police fumbling circumstantial evidence, the contrast of humour and horror. And perhaps it's his most controversial film for the Dial M For Misogyny detractors who (wrongly) feel he hated women. But this is to misunderstand it - the scene where Rusk rapes and kills Brenda is astonishingly powerful and disturbing; it takes ten minutes, as she gradually realises what's going to happen and uses all of her intelligence to try to avoid it, unaware of the final horror of who Rusk really is. The subsequent death of Babs is perhaps even worse as we know what he is capable of and the camera discreetly retreats down the stairs and out into the busy street leaving the depravity to our imaginations. Almost every scene is filled with visual invention - the lengthy sequence on the back of the potato truck is both horrifying and hilarious in its squalor, the dinner table scenes between Chief Inspector Oxford and his wife as he deftly tries to avoid eating anything she's cooked are among the funniest Hitch ever shot, and there are oodles of clever touches, like the moment all the sound disappears just as Rusk appears behind Babs, or the scene where we can't hear what the judge at Blaney's trial is saying because the door is closed. Despite his age, Hitchcock is in full flow, employing all of his cinematic skill to extract the maximum impact from the material. It's stunningly well directed. The cast of character actors are all excellent, a real underground movie fan's dream - Finch (Roman Polanski's Macbeth) is bitter and dogmatic, Massey (Peeping Tom) and Leigh-Hunt are both terrific, McCowen is a thoughtful no-nonsense peeler with Bates (A Clockwork Orange) an amusing foil of a sergeant, and Cribbins has a great bit as a tight-fisted unctuous publican. Best of all is the hawk-like, redheaded Foster as the thoroughly loathsome Bob Rusk, the last and most vicious descendant of Norman Bates, Bruno Antony, Brandon Shaw and Uncle Charlie.

Although he made one more film (the enjoyable but light-hearted Family Plot), this is a great nail-biting thriller of the kind he did so well, with crafty twists galore, stunning sequences, mischievous black humour and incredible suspense throughout. It's also in many ways a return to his roots; although he became a naturalised American and made all his most famous movies there, he never lost the Britishness of his manner, sense of comedy and cinematic style. Frenzy is really his only out-and-out all-British film since the thirties, and the Covent Garden setting is literally where he grew up (his father was a grocer there, just like Rusk). His amusing cameo near the start in a city gent bowler hat is a lovely touch which epitomises this, almost as if he had come full circle from his great early films like The Lodger. It's also chock-full of his favourite themes; the crazed killer, the wrong man, the police fumbling circumstantial evidence, the contrast of humour and horror. And perhaps it's his most controversial film for the Dial M For Misogyny detractors who (wrongly) feel he hated women. But this is to misunderstand it - the scene where Rusk rapes and kills Brenda is astonishingly powerful and disturbing; it takes ten minutes, as she gradually realises what's going to happen and uses all of her intelligence to try to avoid it, unaware of the final horror of who Rusk really is. The subsequent death of Babs is perhaps even worse as we know what he is capable of and the camera discreetly retreats down the stairs and out into the busy street leaving the depravity to our imaginations. Almost every scene is filled with visual invention - the lengthy sequence on the back of the potato truck is both horrifying and hilarious in its squalor, the dinner table scenes between Chief Inspector Oxford and his wife as he deftly tries to avoid eating anything she's cooked are among the funniest Hitch ever shot, and there are oodles of clever touches, like the moment all the sound disappears just as Rusk appears behind Babs, or the scene where we can't hear what the judge at Blaney's trial is saying because the door is closed. Despite his age, Hitchcock is in full flow, employing all of his cinematic skill to extract the maximum impact from the material. It's stunningly well directed. The cast of character actors are all excellent, a real underground movie fan's dream - Finch (Roman Polanski's Macbeth) is bitter and dogmatic, Massey (Peeping Tom) and Leigh-Hunt are both terrific, McCowen is a thoughtful no-nonsense peeler with Bates (A Clockwork Orange) an amusing foil of a sergeant, and Cribbins has a great bit as a tight-fisted unctuous publican. Best of all is the hawk-like, redheaded Foster as the thoroughly loathsome Bob Rusk, the last and most vicious descendant of Norman Bates, Bruno Antony, Brandon Shaw and Uncle Charlie.

The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is boring. To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says Where for art thou, mother in 2011.

But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature.

It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously?

Just a bit of inquiry by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is enough to turn all of convention onto its head, and what ensues is a manifesto of the human thought process. First he is treated as the village idiot -- There's always one....., then through common reasoning and questioning he gains some momentum among the jury until he has eventually won the vote of all eleven of his peers.The characters in that room represent a microcosm of greater society you've got the righteous yet somewhat humble speaker of truth, the socially cold yet honorable logical thinker, the wise old man, the baseball-loving hedonist, the jaded self-proclaimed sadist, the cynical old man, the earnest hard-working foreigner, and the unimposing supposed leader (the foreman) who is among the quieter individuals who form the background audience to the great debate that carries the story. This portrayal of society makes Twelve Angry Men suitable for all viewers, and it may as well be mandatory for all people to watch this movie as its adventurous trek through morality has been and forever will be relevant to human relations.Twelve Angry Men is a longstanding testament to the spirit of originality and inquiry -- questioning the judgment of another rather than weakly conforming to it. This theme is again and again visited within the dialogue of the movie, as juror #8 is bashed by a couple of his fellow jurors for trusting his gut, or forming unconfirmed yet sensible hypotheses. But it's this pioneering spirit which achieves basically all the great feats that we reach -- it's how the judicial system and greater democracy was set into place in this country, for example. The gradual conversion of each juror from a guilty vote to a not guilty vote shows you the potential for the realization of truth that lies in each man in this world, as well as their varying methods of reaching it. For some it was reached by plain logic (juror #4), for others it was through direct empathy. Some men leapt aboard the bandwagon only once it had gained some might, and some only came over after having held onto their original view until the bitter end.....having been blinded from common sense by their own distorted emotions (juror #3). Regardless, every juror lands somewhere on the spectrum and is entitled to their own unique view, just as ordinary people are in society.There are almost too many unforgettable moments\/lines in Twelve Angry Men to count all of them.....from the hullabaloo that ensues when the jury first learns of the lone not guilty vote at the beginning, to the re-enactment of the old man limping down his hallway, to the convincing of juror #4 through the glasses ordeal, to the final stand and glare of the eleven jurors at juror #3. There's the final exchange of the movie, when jurors #8 and #9 exchange names and meet for the first time (telling you something about how dehumanizing and tense things got in that small room). Oh and speaking of that small jurors' room -- virtually the entire movie takes place in there! On paper that idea seems somewhat ludicrous for a movie, but the compelling nature of the plot somehow made me forget how physically stationary the story is. Cinematographer Boris Kaufman used a brilliant tactic over the duration of the film he lowered the cameras as the plot continued. At the start we're able to appreciate the size of the long room, and we look down upon the jurors, but by the end each man looms over our view, large than life, as we see him speak, and the walls appear to have closed in on us to create a very cramped and tense atmosphere. Very well done.Ultimately, this is one of my favorite films, touching the soul of humanity and leading its audience through an entire range of emotions, and all while in a very commonplace setting.

This is one of my all-time favorite movies for a reason. It had a terrific cast, it had heart, it meant something, it was entertaining, and it was also quite incredible. A movie like this deserves to be recognized as a excellent movie. Next to Titanic, Forrest Gump is my second favorite movie of all time. I enjoyed the hell out of everything, and my heart always feels special every time I watched. This is an amazing motion picture, no doubt about it. It's just a shame that nobody can respect the movie's Best Picture Oscar win objectively. Like my Mama always says, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.

That was a quote from one of the best movies of all time. Forrest Gump is the story of a man from Alabama with a low I.Q., whose personality is different from others, but ends up achieving many goals including football, Vietnam, shrimping, table tennis, etc. The story has words spoken by the beautiful writing of Eric Roth, and it was magically directed by Robert Zemeckis.

In the complete oeuvre of Hitchcock, Rear Window firmly occupies the very top shelf, together with such classics as the aforementioned Vertigo, North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960). It is a great film, not only from a critical standpoint but also from the audience's point-of-view. For a 1950s picture, it has not dated one bit, and offers an excellent introspective night's entertainment for the whole family.A groundbreaking film study on the theme of voyeurism, Rear Window has no equal. Even its contemporary remake, Disturbia (2007), isn't even a third as good and is an insult to what Hitchcock originally planned to achieve with this picture. Starring the legendary James Stewart as Jeff, a wheelchair bound photojournalist who met with an accident but is only a week from full recovery, and the elegant Grace Kelly as Lisa, Jeff's fiancée who slowly becomes involved in one of the most intriguing plots ever written, Rear Window is a brilliant concoction of drama, suspense, and dark humor.This being a Hitchcock picture, there would certainly be a crime involved, or so we thought. Jeff thinks that one of his neighbors might have murdered and cut up his invalid wife. His detective friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), however thinks that Jeff is delusional. At this juncture, we are in doubt, yet this draws us further into the film. Later, Lisa and Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeff's personal nurse, become convinced of the possibility of such a heinous crime happening when their observations point to the suspect as a murderer.Written by John Michael Hayes (To Catch a Thief, 1955; The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956), the screenplay takes its time to develop the protagonist who spends nearly the entire film immobile in a wheelchair. Jeff's immobility would become a plot device in the climax, which even by Hitchcock standards, is extremely tense. A particular phone call seemingly sucks the air out of the picture, conveying a deep sense of dread and inevitability that is to come. Moreover, the use of ambient sounds as part of the film's mise-en-scene, as well as to dictate the level of suspense is masterfully done.Supporting characters are seen through the voyeuristic eyes of Jeff, and they are developed objectively through the lens of the camera. We sympathize with Ms. Lonelyhearts who longs for a man to love her, smile at Ms. Torso who flaunts her athletic body with graceful stretching motions, and observe with some degree of comic distance the rest of the folks in their apartments doing their private business. The capturing of the ignorance of these characters towards a possible murder committed in front of their eyes marks one of the screenplay's high points. In one scene, a dead dog is found. Its owners are devastated but for the rest, life goes on without sympathy. Are we not the same?For its time, Rear Window is remarkably advanced from a technical standpoint. The cinematography by Robert Burks brilliantly captures exterior and interior shots in single takes without problems arising from differences due to the exposure of light. The transition is so smooth that it is impossible to tell when natural or artificial light is used in these shots. Burks' camera-work makes us willing participants in the spying game, drawing us into the sinister world of Hitchcockian terror. Like David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986), Rear Window explores the concealment of Man's hideous nature under the façade of seeming normalcy. It takes a keen eye to see what's wrong underneath all the pleasantries.Rear Window is not only a masterpiece of film direction and screen writing, but also an influential force that continues to inspire contemporary filmmakers to deal with the issues of privacy, intrusion, and paranoia in the modern world. One of the best examples would be Michael Haneke's Cache (2005), with its dramatic treatment of the ethics of video surveillance a cinematic offshoot of Hitchcock's work. Rear Window is one of the greatest films of all time, and with each repeated viewing, its thematic elements not only become more salient in the world we live in, but also increasingly unsettling.GRADE A+ (10\/10 or 5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.
