But I have never thought that their style of humor was ever enough to carry a feature-length movie and watching the re-release of Life of Brian only confirms that for me. Monty Python's Flying Circus worked best in the short, often hysterically funny, skit form. The TV episodes would often have a very general theme but usually careened from one topic to another without necessarily any connection. But on the big screen they have to do an entire story either about King Arthur or about Brian of Nazareth and I don't think that they ever really sustain the humor in either show. Certainly there are some inspired parts---the Roman centurions desperately trying not to laugh at a lisping Pontius Pilate. Only they then overkill that joke by having Pilate then speak to a crowd of Jews later in the movie. It was funny the first time, not funny the second time. The bits dealing with the all-talk, no-action People's Front of Judea were good as well. But the rest of the movie doesn't really work for me, or I should say they certainly don't measure up to the best parts of the TV series. I was finally able to spot George Harrison's cameo in the movie. George considered the Pythons to be the spiritual heirs of the Beatles and Python Eric Idle later helped make a very funny mockumentary of the Beatles called The Rutles which George also participated in. What would been terrific to see would've been some sort of joint effort between Monty Python and the Beatles (as it was, Ringo was the only Beatle to have a brief appearance on a Python episode). Life of Brian gets credit for being the first and only movie to satirize Christianity and I think Christians who are offended take it way too seriously. But if you want to watch truly great film satires, watch the Marx Brothers' terrific Duck Soup and Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Both are extremely funny and relevant.

In the past, there have been dreamlike films and films with dream sequences, but Mulholland Drive takes the non- linear and inter-twining dream-type narrative into a whole new dimension. Lynch acheives this with the use of rich symbolism that can never be fully interpreted because, as with a dream, each symbol has a continually evolving meaning. For example, if you write down your dreams and then go back and reread them some years later, you will see them in a way that is completely different. There might be periods in your life when you dream a lot about policemen and at the time you don't really understand it. But then when you go back and look at that era of your life you realize that you were struggling with a lot of guilt feelings. Sometimes a dream that seemed very mysterious to you when you had it, over time becomes very transparent as you come to understand yourself better and get some distance and perspective. Another characteristic of dreams is that the imagery is unique to each person. A policeman in the dream of someone who has spent time in prison will mean something quite different than it does in the dream of a woman who is married to a policeman.In my opinion, Mulholland Drive is the first film to fully explore the possibility of a film to imitate and evoke the unfathomable experience of dream time. For that reason there are no real answers to what the film really means or what really happens. Magical realism is a growing trend in film-making. Disney's The Kid, The Family Man, and Groundhog Day are just a few of the many fine films that explore the technique of magical realism. Things happen that can't possibly happen and yet for the sake of the story we accept them. Part of our acceptance comes from the truth of these events\/situations on a symbolic level.The fascinating thing about Mulholland Drive is the way that it carries you along as a believer. Even though things don't make sense, there is still an intrinsic narrative logic. The film both imitates and evokes a dream because in your dreams you don't question the strange things that happen. Except sometimes you can have an experience of lucid dreaming. This means you will realize you are dreaming even while it happens, which brings your consciousness up to a different level. Not only does Lynch create a dream-type narrative, but he also intertwines different levels of dream consiousness, waking consciousness, and lucid dreaming.This film is not an easy film and it is not for everyone, since it forces the viewer to ask questions. Sometimes we just want to be entertained or to have films explain things for us. This film raises questions without offering any set answers or explanations.Through the process of trying to find answers, we are given an opportunity to do some serious thinking. We can think about the ways that film is deeply embedded in our culture and self-perception, how our ambitions can corrupt us, how there can be many different sides to one person, how guilt and remorse can drive people crazy, how jealousy can be such an evil tyrant, how our fears can defeat us, all the different kinds of love that can exist between people, the horrors of addiction, the magic of beauty, and the hazards of a truly great passion... just to name a few. This is a film that really challenges us to understand ourselves better, and in life there are no easy answers. I think people will continue to talk about Mulholland Drive in the same way that people have continued to talk about Shakespeare's plays hundreds of years later. It is a masterpiece of dramatic literature in the same way that Shakespeare's plays are.

His Sonny is unique for the way he mixes comedy and pathos, screaming profanity one moment, quietly sympathetic and almost soulfully gentle the next. I speak what I feel, he tells a teller who asks him to watch his language, but he's obviously sensitive to what people think of him, even when he's pointing a gun at them.Dog Day Afternoon is really Pacino's baby. The film exists to serve his art. The fact he's great in it is almost incidental. Of course he's great in it, he's a great actor in a movie that puts all the focus on him. But how good is it otherwise?Pretty to very, depending on which part of the movie you are watching. The film is better at the outset and in the middle than in the end, where it gets sloppy in its emotions and reaches beyond the bank for its storyline, dulling the focus. The central premise, a holed-up duo of ne'er-do-wells taking on the city, works as underdog formula for a while, especially when Sonny faces down the police by screaming Attica and making them put their guns down. The bank employees are fleshed out nicely with the help of Sully Boyar as the bank's manager, Penny Allen as the head teller, Marcia Jean Kurtz as a gum-snapping teller, and Carol Kane as the squirrel who gets a call from her husband asking what he should do for dinner while she's a hostage.Pacino's Godfather mate John Cazale, in a velvet suit of fire engine red in case you were wondering what decade this was made in, is there as buddy Sal to provide steely backup as Sonny holds up the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. When John Cazale is the muscle man, your plot is definitely in trouble, and Sal and Sonny quickly find themselves surrounded by about four thousand members of New York's finest.The dialogue has a very improvisational feel to it, which along with the strong characterization and frequent humor gives Dog Day Afternoon much of its watchability. You really feel like you are seeing this botched robbery happen as it goes down, in real time.There's a nice use of suspense, too, the first time you watch it. Sonny's so out there that you never know what, if anything, will set him off in a homicidal rage. And you know Sal really wants to start dumping those bodies out the door. So even though you can count the number of gunshots in this movie with one hand (and have enough left over to snap your fingers with), you are nervous all the way through.It does feel like the New York Police Department are a little too much out in force; was August 22, 1972 a good day to commit a crime in one of the other four boroughs? The police and the FBI are seen as unreasonable heavies, but Vietnam veterans and homosexuals probably come off worse, not to mention former Goldwater campaign activists. As far as the gay thing goes, it comes across as a bit silly when we see a group of over-the-top drag queens show up at the police barricade to cheer on sister Sonny, but the phone conversation between Pacino and Chris Sarandon as his lover Leon is among the movie's most affecting scenes. Sarandon is really good at playing a total human mess who actually is a voice of relative reason in Sonny's world.Can't get over how young Pacino looks. He reminds me of Matthew Broderick in WarGames. Funny that one of the FBI agents here is played by Matthew's father. Matthew's father is in another classic '70s New York crime movie, The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three which has a similar feeling to Dog Day but a much heavier vibe.

You really feel like you are seeing this botched robbery happen as it goes down, in real time.There's a nice use of suspense, too, the first time you watch it. Sonny's so out there that you never know what, if anything, will set him off in a homicidal rage. And you know Sal really wants to start dumping those bodies out the door. So even though you can count the number of gunshots in this movie with one hand (and have enough left over to snap your fingers with), you are nervous all the way through.It does feel like the New York Police Department are a little too much out in force; was August 22, 1972 a good day to commit a crime in one of the other four boroughs? The police and the FBI are seen as unreasonable heavies, but Vietnam veterans and homosexuals probably come off worse, not to mention former Goldwater campaign activists. As far as the gay thing goes, it comes across as a bit silly when we see a group of over-the-top drag queens show up at the police barricade to cheer on sister Sonny, but the phone conversation between Pacino and Chris Sarandon as his lover Leon is among the movie's most affecting scenes. Sarandon is really good at playing a total human mess who actually is a voice of relative reason in Sonny's world.Can't get over how young Pacino looks. He reminds me of Matthew Broderick in WarGames. Funny that one of the FBI agents here is played by Matthew's father. Matthew's father is in another classic '70s New York crime movie, The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three which has a similar feeling to Dog Day but a much heavier vibe. No question the 1970s were a great decade for crime dramas, and Dog Day is one of the best.

I loathed him for every possible conceivable reason there could ever be for loathing another human being(almost, anyway). I hate his baby-face, his height, his charm(or, rather, lack thereof) and the fact that the three aforementioned features always gets him work in movies(not to mention, makes far too many girls go mad over him... I suspect much, but not all, of course, of the female audience that actually sat through the Rings movies did so because of Wood being in the lead... ridiculous). I thought The only possible way Elijah Wood could actually be just a tiny bit more annoying was if he was a child actor(instead of a teen\/adult actor). Then I saw Chain of Fools, where he actually is pretty good, and realized, hey, maybe I misjudged him, maybe he is actually a decent enough actor(somewhere in-between I also saw the faculty, but that didn't really affect my opinion of him, in any way, shape or form). Then I saw this movie... and my worst fears came true. He *was* even worse as a child (actor). His character in this enraged and annoyed me to the point of not being able to watch the whole thing attentively... well, I suppose that's not entirely true... the trite pace and poor execution of a pretty good idea helped a little, as well. The plot is decent enough, but the pacing is bad and the execution of the good idea is just bad. The ending made me cringe. The acting is decent, but since every major actor in the film plays exactly the same character they always play, it's not particularly impressive. The film was predictable and rarely entertaining. The characters were poorly written. The dialog had its moments, but they were few and far between. The whole thing was just too overly romantic and children's movie-like. The film takes a great premise and turns it into yet another bland romantic film. The end was surprising(slightly), yes, but it wasn't good. It was sappy, sentimental garbage. Actually, pretty much the entire film was. All in all, this film is just average at best. I recommend it only to big fans of Mel Gibson, and possibly (sigh) girls who like Elijah Wood. 5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  When I first saw Elijah Wood, I don't remember if it was in one of the trailers for The Lord of The Rings, or if it was in the awful Disney version of Oliver Twist, I almost instantly loathed him.

I found the structure a lot clearer, and could really savor the terrific performances, particularly by the three women. Most remarkable of this first-rate ensemble is Elena Anaya (Belen) who is in the same class as Audrey Hepburn. She doesn't get much dialog, and doesn't need it. She conveys every nuance of her beguiling but sinister character by glance, expression, and gesture, that all come across perfectly with or without subtitles. Ethereally beautiful, forthrightly erotic, sweetly innocent, dangerously demented -- that's Belen.

Sex and Lucia was shot on 24P HD video, which allowed free manipulation of the color palette anywhere in the movie. The problem was that Medem and his team used this new power recklessly -- and did so in every single scene. The net result was that most of the movie looks as if it had been shot on outdated Ektachrome, developed at Photomat, and then left out in the sun for a few months.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet did it even better in Amelie. Wayne Wang did it reasonably well in Center of the World (also shot on video, like Sex and Lucia). But Medem, alas, got swept up in the novelty of this technology, so that it is constantly obtrusive and distracts from his story. Medem set up two artificial color schemes for this film, one for Madrid, the other for the island. These were further varied by whether a particular scene was past or present.

Her wordless reaction to first and last is one of the most memorable such scenes in cinema, and most actors will never come close to equaling it. ** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS **There is one thing about this movie that I disliked the first time, and that I positively came to hate the second time. This was the color design. It was dreadful. Its rationale was explained in one of the DVD interviews, but its being intentional made it even worse than if it had merely been a technical glitch. Sex and Lucia was shot on 24P HD video, which allowed free manipulation of the color palette anywhere in the movie. The problem was that Medem and his team used this new power recklessly -- and did so in every single scene. The net result was that most of the movie looks as if it had been shot on outdated Ektachrome, developed at Photomat, and then left out in the sun for a few months. Hint to budding directors For emotive color manipulation to work, there must be a baseline of realistic color that one moves away from -- or it will come across as a mistake. Moreover the shift into abstract or emotion-based color must happen organically, without calling attention to itself.Peter Jackson did this masterfully in Lord of the Rings (explained in the DVD appendix to the Fellowship of the Ring). Jean-Pierre Jeunet did it even better in Amelie. Wayne Wang did it reasonably well in Center of the World (also shot on video, like Sex and Lucia). But Medem, alas, got swept up in the novelty of this technology, so that it is constantly obtrusive and distracts from his story. Medem set up two artificial color schemes for this film, one for Madrid, the other for the island. These were further varied by whether a particular scene was past or present. But the schemes did not differ sufficiently from each other to make it clear where or when a scene was unfolding, while they all differed so much from real color and light that the color grading became a barrier between the story and the audience. Overall rating 7\/10 -- with possible further revision upward.*If you like Sex & Lucia, you might also like Romance, by Catherine BreillatCenter of the World, by Wayne WangSummer Lovers, by Randall KleiserA Girl in a Swing, book by Richard Adams  ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 October 2004","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  (Fair warning even if I try to keep my comments spoiler-free, some might slip trough.

We walks in alone, unescorted and as soon as he walks in there is an unexplainable silence in the court, and to everyone's surprise the Judge, stands up in respect of the accused ! Seeing him do this the barristers and rest also stand up. This scene though may seem insignificant on paper is one without which this entire movie would have been incomplete. To know why&#133;&#133;read on ! On day of 2nd October they play this movie every year on DD National, Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. I never watched it whenever it was shown since 20 years of 2nd Octobers I had seen. The first few years because I couldn't understand and the next few because I felt that though it's a multiple Oscar winner, how could at the end of the day, a British person understand and do justice to an Indian icon ? After so many years I finally broke the ice and saw the movie in totality right from the first scene of Nathuram Godse, to Hey Ram, and I understood that Gandhi was as British, as much a part of Britain's history as he was of India's, in fact an outsider judged the person better than we ourselves could, hence without doubt this is a masterpiece, because it was always meant to be. Richard Attenborough like all directors worth their salt uses visual aid as a medium to replace conventional dialogue delivery at times. A picture is worth a thousand words and a scene without words is worth a million. Like the first scene I described and others. In one scene towards the end of the movie, Gandhiji starts a fast until death to stop the communal riots post independence and Nehru goes to meet him. A crowd had gathered near his residence and one of the person in the crowd shouted a suggestion, 'Why don't they kill Gandhi ?', Nehru furiously jumps into the crowd to search for this person and the camera moves in the crowd and for a briefest time and quite unmistakably you spot Nathuram Godse in the crowd. This made me think, 'hey this is what I call good cinema!'.So what about the outsider theory ? Well you see if Rajkumar Santoshi, Yash Chopra, Raj Kapoor or Mani Ratnam had made this movie they would have fallen under the pressure and the unbearably weight of historical facts, Richard had that advantage. Someone quite ignorant about Indian culture was telling a story of an Indian to an audience even more ignorant. What I mean is that there are things which are skewed up, characters gone wrong and famous words mouthed by someone else. For example the writer has messed the character of the Patel Siblings. Vallabhbhai Patel was never an extrovert and never as polished as shown in the movie, but someone else was and it was his more Birtish, yet less famous elder brother Vithalbhai who in fact introduced Vallabh to Indian movement. Again it is a known fact that Vallabhai continued the Dandi march after Gandhi's arrest, the fact which is ignored. Once again the characters of Kriplani, Maulana Azad etc are all skewed. But at the end of it works, why, because Richard's view is focused. I would notice these mistakes because I am an Indian aware of this, a person in England may never find out and even if he does he would consider it as trivial because this is a story of Gandhi and not the Indian freedom struggle. People say that unnecessary importance is given to foreign characters in Gandhi's life like Margret, Rev. Charlie, Walker, Miraben, but I would say it is necessary because these people did influence Gandhi and made him an international personality which he is. But before I end my take on this movie I must comment on the characterization. Starting with Ben Kinsley as Gandhi. To tell you the truth when I first saw him as Mohandas KG in the train I was shocked, he didn't look like Gandhi which I imagined, but as the movie goes ahead I changed my opinion. Ben worked because of multiple reasons. The first he is a British Gujarati, Gandhi was gujarati who did his law in England so both speak the same language, Partly British English with unmistakable Gujarati overtones. Second all other characterization of Gandhis in the history are shown as fragile creatures without clothes. Ben did carry some more body than others and which made Gandhi look more real , more alive. Also he had an infectious little smile which works because Gandhi in many was a jovial happy person who smiled a lot , a kind smile of calm which no one but Ben Kinsley brought out ! Of the other characters, Martin Sheen as Walker was impressive, so were Lord Erwin, Gen Dyer, Margrets, Nehru and Miraben's characters. Rohini Hattangidi as Kasturba does a remarkable job too, though she was shown a little more extroverted than Kasturba was , maybe. As a whole to sum it up, this is one hell of a beautiful movie experience. If you missed it this 2nd October don't forget to tune into it the next.

I think Kurosawa's greatest achievement in this film is the fact that he managed to make the viewer see the color in a black and white film. I think this film also shows that you do not need a billion dollar budget to make an amazing work of art. Akira Kurosawa can best be described as a director that has a film genre all to himself that directors can emulate, but can never duplicate. The ideas of the film were also revolutionary, the notion that a samurai can show human weakness was a new one in Japan at the time the film was made. Kurosawa not only gave the Age of Japanese Shogunate wars a human face, he also made it presentable to the Western film viewer. There is nothing in this film that any human being cannot sympathize with and I think that is the greatest gift that this film, and the entire collection of Kurosawa's films give to the world.

Kurosawa not only gave the Age of Japanese Shogunate wars a human face, he also made it presentable to the Western film viewer. There is nothing in this film that any human being cannot sympathize with and I think that is the greatest gift that this film, and the entire collection of Kurosawa's films give to the world.

It's set in the future, features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them, and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet, before long, it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is, in fact, a horror film set in space, and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece, it is a reasonably disturbing film.Event Horizon opens in the mid 21st century, where man has attempted faster-than-light travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon, and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity, a miniature black hole if you will, that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine, the ship disappeared, not to be heard from again. Seven years later, it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship, the Lewis & Clark, is dispatched to determine if there are survivors, and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis & Clark, commanded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis & Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship, but find strange happenings occurring throughout, with different members of the crew seeing strange things Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel, medical officer Peters (Kathleen Quinland) sees her crippled son, and the ships engineer, Justin (Jack Noseworthy) looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy, and it has brought something back with it.Event Horizon is not a groundbreaking entry in the horror genre, that's for sure. Many aspects on display have been utilized in countless other films. And yet, director Paul Anderson manages to give us the requisite chills and leave us on the edge of our seats. A primary element that helps the film is the Event Horizon itself. Designed with a very Gothic look in mind, the ship just looks and feels scary. It is place I can't imagine anyone ever being comfortable being in. The dark, empty hallways and rooms are menacing themselves, and that helps ratchet up the tension. Anderson also does a good job of crafting suspenseful scenes involving the character's visions. Almost every one of those sequences will leave you unsure of what you will see and that keeps the audience in a state of unease.As the film progresses, there is an increase in make-up effects grusomeness, so I would agree that it makes it a difficult film to watch as it goes on. However, most everything in the last half-hour is payoff to the setup, so while it's not always pretty to watch, it makes it all the more effective.Acting wise, Event Horizon is decent, but nobody will be well remembered for their work. Sam Neill is probably the most memorable as the slowly disintegrating Weir, tumbling to madness before our eyes. Laurence Fishbure is effective as the hard-nosed captain, and everyone else gets the job done.A lot of people gave Event Horizon flack upon it's release, and again, it's not the most original horror film made, but it is one of the more disturbing I saw in the mid to late '90s, and I would give it a recommendation, just be careful watching it by yourself.

Surprisingly, the film did not even reach the low expectations I had for it. Indeed, this movie is a textbook case of Hollywood bastardizing a good book. As usual, it was ruined a combination of by being obliged to use big name stars, trying to squeeze an epic story into a 2-hour time-frame, and adapting the story for the audience of the lowest common denominator. When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play Lestat and Brad Pitt would portray Louis, Anne Rice publicly stated that she considered the film to be an inevitable disaster. Inexplicably (and I suspect it had to do with money and publisher's contracts), she later embraced the film, and declared it perfect. Pardon me if I'm skeptical of her change of heart. There are principally three problems with this film. First, any adaptation of a book like that by Rice--with the inner lives of the characters being of paramount importance--is very difficult to translate into film without heavily relying upon voice-overs. But although the film utilizes much expository narration, that effect falls flat with Brad Pitt's monotonous delivery. Instead of sounding ancient and world-weary, he merely sounds bored and uninspired.Second (and perhaps this is nit-picking) the fake teeth--especially those fitted to Cruise--are just abominable. They make every line he speaks sound, well, like a guy talking through fake fangs. They also distort his lips so that every expression is a grimace. In fact, Cruise's false teeth are no more realistic than those worn by the vastly more charismatic Christopher Lee in the classic Hammer Dracula flicks of the '60s.Third (and most serious), the film's two leads (Pitt and Cruise) are simply inept as serious actors. They're really not actors at all, they're two-dimensional character actors, being asked here to play against type. Well, Daniel Auteuil is an actor. Michael Gambon is an actor. Gary Oldman is an actor. Tom Cruise? Brad Pitt? Neither of them have the skill, the subtlety, the expressive ability to actually act in roles such as these. Cruise's usual acting range has two modes determined, and rogueishly charming (as in every other movie he's done). Here, he fluctuates between pomposity and tantrums; mundanity and over-the-top scenery-chewing, as if a switch in his back were being flicked one way, and then the other. Every line he delivers sounds unbelievably pretentious. Pitt is little better, although he does avoid Cruise's intolerable stridency. Antonio Banderas' characterization of Armand is uncannily similar to Ricardo Montalban in one of his smarmier roles. Far better choices would have perhaps been someone like Ralph Feinnes for Lestat and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers or Jude Law for Louis. Feinnes could've humanized Lestat, and either Rhys-Meyers or Law could've brought some life to Louis. Yes, Kirsten Dunst does a decent job with her role, but most of the other actors belong doing daytime dramas.Indeed, that is essentially what director Neil Jordan has done he's remade the old vampire soap opera Dark Shadows for the Fabio fans of the '90s. As can be seen from the majority of reviews here, Interview With the Vampire was a big hit with teenage girls raised on TV. For those with higher expectations of vampire films, this one will just embarrass. Instead, watch Bram Stoker's Dracula, Nosferatu (either one), Near Dark (if you have the stomach for it) or even Nadja, if you want a truly unusual vampire film. For those who have read Anne Rice's book and have an expectation of quality from a film adaptation of it, I can only caution you go avoid this slab of Hollywood tripe at any cost.

The action scenes were well directed and quite spectacular in some cases (eg. the car chase and several shoot-outs) without going too over the top. The plot was a little hard to follow at first, but I blame this on myself, not the storyline. It's commendable that so much thought was given to the script and plot so it didn't always seem we were just waiting for an action scene. The drama added intensity and suspense well, too. For example, the tension between Chen and Wallace. The thread with Wallace and his father added good depth to his character and the story, as did the fact that he and Chen retained their partnership in fighting even when the suspected worst was revealed about Chen. It was also notable the role music played in the film. For example you always knew when the Asian punks were about to show up due to the rap music. The subtle music in dramatic dialogue scenes gave the scenes a good atmosphere.

The ventriloquist's lips are moving, and the dummies are too obviously made of wood (I mean the characters, not the animated clay figurines). In this film, Jackson's abilities at directing actors were, let us say, still latent.In Heavenly Creatures, Jackson set out to make a 'true crime' version of George Roy Hill's The World of Henry Orient. That film missed perfection because of the affected cornball performance of Peter Sellers in the title role. If this was the performance Hill wanted, shame on him. But if this wasn't bad direction but rather mis-casting, then double-shame on the director for failing to replace Sellers when he found he could not control him. When Peter Jackson found he could not control his original 'Aragorn' in making Lord of the Rings, he fired him and hired Viggo Mortenson.By contrast to the one bad casting choice in Henry Orient, in Heavenly Creatures nearly everyone seems mis-cast, with the single exception of Sarah Peirse. The rest of the performers never let you forget that they are playacting -- which is fine on the stage, but not on the silver screen. If this was intentional on Jackson's part, well 'nice try,' but it doesn't work. I suspect it was not intentional, because this same weak direction is evident in the first scenes Jackson filmed for LOTR -- the four hobbits pursued by the black riders. Luckily for Jackson, and for all of us viewers, he found the confidence to begin directing realistic performances around that time (I suspect that his veteran producers on LOTR might have taught him a thing or two about this). Besides Henry Orient, Heavenly Creatures invites comparison to two other films I have seen recently -- A Real Young Girl by Catherine Breillat, and Lost and Delirious by Lea Pool. Breillat has certainly mastered the art of getting realistic performances from her actors. But she goes much too far in that direction, forgetting that the seemingly unedited intimate reality of relentlessly ordinary people is boring to watch for an hour and a half (then again, if you like Reality TV, which I loathe, then you might also like Breillat's films).Pool's film is a lot like Heavenly Creatures, and just misses success for pretty much the same reasons it is not possible to believe in or sympathize with the characters -- the problems not being so much in the script or the production, but in the nuances of direction, the failure to make it real, to transcend stereotypes and create authentic individual characters.(For girls school movies done right, check out The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Mona Lisa Smile.)5\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2004","score":"7 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":"  The most startling thing about this movie is how much of the senior production staff of Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson had already brought together for this earlier film.
