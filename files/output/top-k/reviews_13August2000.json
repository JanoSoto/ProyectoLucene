Zemeckis' well-crafted movie was a critical and box-office success and for good reason. I cannot even begin to describe the effect this movie had on myself and all of my friends. We literally watched it every single day during the course of a summer vacation and still could not get enough. So many elements of this movie are wonderful and should be used more in other films. The script is excellent and the direction is even better. The opening with the clocks was magnificent and Christopher Lloyd's acting was superb. The DeLorean time machine was a real gas and real horror show! Michael J. Fox really hit it big with this one and his character was one many people could relate to. Hill Valley was a great imaginary little town somewhere in California and Marty's girlfriend was pretty hot, too. It was hilarious when he gets hit by the car and is forced to stay in his mom's and grandparents house for the night. Much of the content in this movie was highly ironic and coincidental, but still managed to stay far away from becoming corny. I'm surprised it did not win as much awards as it did. Everything from Biff to George McFly was great and all the sets were awesome. The final scenes were pretty heart warming and the prom scenes were cool, too. I also enjoyed the scene where Biff crashes his car into the manure truck. Can we get any funnier? I own part 2 also, but have still not been able to get myself to purchase part 3. It is missing something that the first 2 had. I really loved part 2 because it was much darker than the first. The whole Hell Valley thing was pretty scary and also with the Libyan's in the first one. Wow! This movie is amazing. I can't get enough of it. It supplies everything a person needs for a night of watching movies with some friends. So like, anyone not like this movie? I cannot imagine a person rating this film any less than a 9. I saw the sets at Universal Studios a while back and that was a great experience that I will never, ever forget. I obviously recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies and I'm sure it will pass the test of time in every sense. I wonder what people in other countries think about this. Hopefully, everyone around he world enjoys it. Stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas something, Crispin Glover and other people. Rated PG-13 (I think) for some violence and adult content. I give it a 9.5\/10 just because it got a little boring during some scenes.

Sitting in a movie theater with my cousins and brothers watching My Stepmother is an Alien, and then Kim Basinger, in all her heavenly glory, rips off her nightie. Right off! I think I may have sprang right there. I mean, probably hyperventilated and everything. Spewed popcorn rows ahead. She was WOMAN. And ever since that moment of my life, I've segued from hardcore crush on Vicki Vale to having a fondness for her, she's like the pretty girl everyone hated. Well, Kim Basinger, you know what? It's your own fault people are mean to you. Or it's your agents. Lady, you've done some good work and you have a pretty well-deserved Oscar to prove it, but usually you pick the DUMBEST movies. While you read a script, do you READ the script? Or do you just think that your Oscar got you whatever you want? You still have to earn it! Why don't you just do a USA original and stick the stake in the heart of your career. And lady, you do look good. You have aged very gracefully. Thank you for making me the horniest ten year-old in America.And, damn it! Let someone else pick your next movie. Bless the Child is so filled with hate and vengeance and every other mean emotion imaginable, not to mention so poorly written, you have to wonder if these people were hired straight from the Unsolved Mysteries re-enactions team. It's also formulaic, absent of any interest in it's own characters and frightfully dull.Bless the Child begins with your usual Christmastime glee. Maggie O'Connor (Basinger) rides the bus home from work, talks to a woman about God, angels, stars, pretty everyday stuff and then mistakes her crackhead sister Jenna (Angela Bettis) for a homeless person. That's because they haven't spoken in two years. The audience gasps with surprise. And Jenna now has a child (hence the title) who is only nine days old. And Maggie is actually surprised to find junkie paraphenilia when she goes through the backpack for diapers. Then she knocks Jenna silly. Maggie is obviously a scapper, a fighter! Duh! That's why we all know when Jenna runs out the door, leaving her new baby daughter with Maggie, stealing the money from Maggie's purse like a coward, that the child is just so much better off now, anyway. Because...that's right, the child is blessed.And this is how the whole movie plays predictably. Except for one beheading, a couple of vehicular homicides, and some computer-generated dream filled with giant, red-eyed rats, this is a run-of-the-mill good vs. evil telemovie rip-off. The most embarassing thing is, everything in this movie was out of place with such strain and effort. It was basic and they had the nerve to make it appear as though they had spent hours on each detail. Is it so basic, actually, that a child, even a non-blessed child, would perfectly understand.I bet this movie, as all movies are, was expensive to make, really. Probably $7 or 8 million for Basinger, who actually isn't that bad in her role, but I do have that fondness, $2 for Jimmy Smits to read his lines like he's pulling from a teleprompter as an FBI agent who, like Maggie, is a non-practicing Catholic.I'd further guess $1-2 million for scenery-chewing ham\/villain Rufus Sewell as Eric Stark, a former child star-cum-junkie who turns all satanist and starts a Rediscover Yourself and Flee the Needle Freak Within club or something.  At the same time in his life, Eric begins the crusade to find the child who was born so, blessed, I suppose for lack of a more predictable word. How convenient that mother of such child is a junkie! What inexplicable luck for the villain!**Note to Alanis Morrisette THAT is irony, ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife or a no smoking sign on your cigarette break is bad luck, but And isn't it bad luck, don't ya think? doesn't have that ring to it, I guess.  You could hire these screenwriters to pen your next album. They got the basics down. And I'm sure they're lookin' for work.ANYWAYS...back to the point maybe $1 mil for Christina Ricci in a role that was built to earn some budding actor her SAG card. But every other element of the movie turned it's back on reason, too, so why would the burning question of how such an accomplished young actress got her wasted self into this mess have an answer? Oh, yeah, answer is above one million dollars. Nice work if you can get it.Let's throw in another $5 for Chuck Russell, the director. Some people make him out like some great auteur for some music videos he did in the eighties, a Nightmare on Elm Street movie and Jim Carrey's The Mask. But after seeing Eraser and now Bless the Child, I think he's a wolf in sheep's cloth. He's like Eric Stark. Pretending to be a friend to those in need.

Soon, only a year after the incident, Cindy's friends are dying thanks to some phsycho killer who is just as stupid as the teens.  Alright...in the film, they say, Does Scream have a plot? Noooo...!!!  Did I Know What You Did Last Summer make any sense?  No!Well, let's put it this way  Compared to this movie...they do!My friends saw this movie before me and they took me last night to see it.  Well anyway, while they are laughing their asses off at almost every scene in the movie, I just sat there and thought to myself, Why did I even bother?!I will admitt, I've seen quite a few really boring movies this year (excluding Frequency), but this one was THE WORSE!!!!  I will say, though, that I happened to have found maybe only three parts funny, but everything else was pointless!What do you get when you watch this movie?  You get parodies of a few 90's horror films (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense), a really, really pointless plot that makes NO SENSE whatsoever (not even the ending made any sense!), and everyone knows what you get when you have a horrible plot...a horrible script!!!

Bear in mind, first of all, that even though England, Australia and the USA all allegedly speak the same language, we all have very different cultures and expectations of entertainment. Given this information, you can assume that 1) Americans will *generally* like this movie better than the English or Australians, and 2) The English will *generally* tend further towards a negative view of the movie.These comments are not intended to give offence, they are based on my experiences of living abroad for many years and having experienced different cultures.Onto the movie itself. It has been criticised as being saccharine. It is my opinion that in places this criticism is justified. I do agree that Robin Williams can tend towards overacting, however bear in mind that the lines he says were written by other people. I personally thought that the child actors playing Jack and Maggie were not given a fair chance by the scriptwriters as many of their lines were obviously written to pull at the heartstrings of the audience rather than reflect 'reality' (which is a relative term in a movie that does not deal with the real world) - by reality I refer to the reality of how a real child would react in that situation. However, if the scriptwriters' aim was to pull at the heartstrings, then they succeeded, judging by the comments of many users concerning 'Hook'.'Hook' has also been criticised as being badly cast. I personally think that when Williams is good, he is very good, and when he is bad - turn it off! I personally thought Hoffman was so good that I didn't even recognise him until the credits came on at the end. He has been criticised for hamming it up - well, this is a movie based on the concept of fantasy. Of course he is hamming it up. Most children's fantasies *are* larger than life.(WARNING Spoiler ahead) The romantic interlude has been criticised, and I would agree with the fact that it was not ideal, but for different reasons. The fact that it was short was not a problem in terms of the film's logistic flow. However I suspect that whole scene went right over the heads of the children watching, and probably most of the adults too, because it required your brain to switch from 'light entertainment' mode to 'emotional drama' mode in a split second. Here is what I think is the logic of that scene Tinkerbell is upset, because she knows that Peter will leave Neverland as soon as he has rescued his children. She wants him to stay, and seeing as he is now an adult, she tries to convince him to stay using an adult tactic - 'I've always loved you'. However her plan backfires because first of all, Peter has now remembered so much about his past in Neverland that he is no longer in 'adult' mode, but is fully the original Peter Pan again, and secondly, in explaining to him that she is upset because he will leave once his children are rescued, she reminds him of the adult world and the fact that she is not a part of his adult world. He goes off to rescue the children, back in full light-entertainment-swashbuckling mode. It is a short, subtle scene, and in my opinion does not belong in the movie.For those who hated Julia Roberts in the role, I would agree she was perhaps not the ideal choice, but to give her credit, I think she did a good job with what she had. Consider that she would have acted most of those scenes alone, against a blue backdrop, so that later on her image on film could be miniaturised and pasted on top of the scenes with Williams and the children.The sets have been criticised. One user said 'Hook's ship looks like it has never seen the sea let alone sail on it, moored as it is on one of the most unconvincing sets ever constructed.' This person obviously has not taken to heart that 1) We are in Neverland here, and the rules are different this ship does go to sea, but the important thing is that it should look like a child's fantasy pirate ship, not that it is seaworthy. and 2) This movie is aimed at children and the young-at-heart, and I suspect that if all you can do is criticise the accuracy of the set, you have missed the point.One user said 'One scene that involves the lost boys at dinner engaged in banal childish name calling should have been excised from the movie after the first screening and burnt,it is Spielberg at his most unconstrained' Hmmm, once again I think this person does not remember what it is like to be a child. Elaborate name-calling is one of the oldest rites of childhood. The important thing is not to crush the spirit of your opponent, but to come up with a more breath-taking vocab than they can!Finally, one IMDB reviewer says 'Hook is reasonably entertaining in a mindless sort of way, I suppose'. Hear! Hear! That is exactly what it aims to be, entertaining, and not taxing on the brain cells. That is what its message is - have some fun for once and stop being so serious all the time.I did not love this movie, it is not my favourite movie, far from it.

It does represent a real incident in 1839.I rate this film a very stong 9 of 10. Directed by Spielberg, with music by John Williams, and spot-on acting by everyone, it tells the story of the Amistad ship of west Africans taken illegally to the USA. During the journey they manage to sieze the ship, killing several of the crew in the process. Even though they try to go directly back to Africa, they end up in Massachusetts and are imprisoned for murder and other crimes.Problem is, no one locally can understand their language, and they cannot understand English. Learning to communicate is one of the challenges. However, the biggest challenge facing the Africans is a biased America which fears that a decision to free them would result in a civil war over the slavery issue.As we now know, the civil war did break out, but it is not entirely clear how much the Amistad incident influenced it. No matter, that's not the value of the movie.What you see in colonial America are people with some of the same attitudes their ancestors fled to originally settle America. A satisfying conclusion to the Amistad incident depends upon a realization by the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, that a man's freedom is his inalienable right, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, and that this applies to black Africans as well as it does to white settlers.To me there is no doubt that Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as former president John Quincy Adams is the most remarkable of all. He has a lenghty monologue, near the end of the film, delivered to the Supreme Court justices, and not one second of that scene is dull or boring. Every time I hear it, and bear in mind its meaning to all of us, it chokes me up. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good young actor Matthew McConaughey was as the young lawyer who represented the catives.Perhaps the most touching scene was between two of the captives, in their prison quarters.

However, he had been looking at the pictures, probably for weeks, and in their own language he basically explained, through the pictures, what he had figured out of the New Testament. In his explanation, he showed his imprisoned friend how thier plight, being imprisoned for false reasons, and now facing death, so closely paralled what had happened to Christ. To me that was a key scene to show that these Africans even surpassed most of the Americans in reasoning and depth of feeling, while they were being mistreated because they were thought to be an inferior species. That may have just been good script-writing, but to me it was a powerful revelation in the film.I always prefer a well-made film based on real life, and Amistad will go down as one of my favorites, and that 2-hour film can teach most of us more about American history than any amount of reading can do.

It does represent a real incident in 1839.I rate this film a very stong 9 of 10. Directed by Spielberg, with music by John Williams, and spot-on acting by everyone, it tells the story of the Amistad ship of west Africans taken illegally to the USA. During the journey they manage to sieze the ship, killing several of the crew in the process. Even though they try to go directly back to Africa, they end up in Massachusetts and are imprisoned for murder and other crimes.Problem is, no one locally can understand their language, and they cannot understand English. Learning to communicate is one of the challenges. However, the biggest challenge facing the Africans is a biased America which fears that a decision to free them would result in a civil war over the slavery issue.As we now know, the civil war did break out, but it is not entirely clear how much the Amistad incident influenced it. No matter, that's not the value of the movie.What you see in colonial America are people with some of the same attitudes their ancestors fled to originally settle America. A satisfying conclusion to the Amistad incident depends upon a realization by the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, that a man's freedom is his inalienable right, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, and that this applies to black Africans as well as it does to white settlers.To me there is no doubt that Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as former president John Quincy Adams is the most remarkable of all. He has a lenghty monologue, near the end of the film, delivered to the Supreme Court justices, and not one second of that scene is dull or boring. Every time I hear it, and bear in mind its meaning to all of us, it chokes me up. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good young actor Matthew McConaughey was as the young lawyer who represented the catives.Perhaps the most touching scene was between two of the captives, in their prison quarters. One of them had been given a bible by townsfolk, and of course he could not read it. However, he had been looking at the pictures, probably for weeks, and in their own language he basically explained, through the pictures, what he had figured out of the New Testament. In his explanation, he showed his imprisoned friend how thier plight, being imprisoned for false reasons, and now facing death, so closely paralled what had happened to Christ. To me that was a key scene to show that these Africans even surpassed most of the Americans in reasoning and depth of feeling, while they were being mistreated because they were thought to be an inferior species. That may have just been good script-writing, but to me it was a powerful revelation in the film.I always prefer a well-made film based on real life, and Amistad will go down as one of my favorites, and that 2-hour film can teach most of us more about American history than any amount of reading can do.

So here we are all over again- in the demented field of action flicks with nothing similar to a brain. The new bud to stay with them is Gone in 60 Seconds, a brainless, shallow, idiotic, annoying flick, produced by (guess who?) a man named Jerry Bruckenheimer (I won't even worry if I'm writing this damn name right). I don't expect depth or brilliant character development of an action flick. Let's give this work to a genius as Paul Thomas Anderson. But I can expect at least some fun, with interesting situations and thrilling moments. That's why I liked X-Men so much and I kind of enjoyed films like Deep Blue Sea or Face\/Off. But Gone in 60 Seconds is not like them, just because IT'S NOT FUN! Believe me- the car chase sequence in Go was much, much better than any action sequence here. It's tiring, repetitive, even monotonous at times. What do you think of passing two hours watching dumbs stealing cars and stealing cars and... stealing cars. Cars, cars, cars. I despise them, so you can guess how much I despised Gone in 60 Seconds. And... could someone tell me why did they sell this as a movie starred by Angelina Jolie, but she is on the screen for... what? 20 minutes???? The answer is easy, but first let's talk about the movie itself.I wonder how and why someone gives a 10 to a film like this on the IMDb. I gave it a 3 and I think I'm being the kindest person in the world for that. But before you give high marks to this c**p, think a little about it. Have you already seen situations like those anywhere? I bet you have seen 1000 times over. The good guy was a bad guy in the past, but now he is honest. However, in a blink of eyes, he is mean again just to save his stupid brother. He meets the love of his life again and they have some trouble. The police is trying to catch him, but never does that. Is it possible that the US policeman are so demented? Why aren't they dismissed? And there's the villain, simply a caricature. Compared to him, the Joker from Batman would look like a character from an art-house European film. There is the climax, obviously on a dark place full of machines and big pipes. The villain dies, falling from a very high place, but not before the hero almost falls from the same place. Of course the police guys forgive the hero, because they are very kind people and they don't want to hurt the feelings of a car robber who gives girls names to the cars. Yawn! If you liked the story, then you'll love Gone in 60 Seconds. But if you didn't, just stay away.The story is a lame and the plot holes are not very tolerable. Do you remember of a scene in Speed when the bus jumps the space between two bridges? Here Nicolas Cage does the same thing with his car, jumping above many, I mean many cars, buses, trucks etc. And the situation stays like this. But will surely be the most inverossimible movie scene of the year. Talking about Nicolas Cage, he stays with Mira Sorvino and Marisa Tomei among the people who forgot that they have an Oscar at home. After the brilliant Leaving Las Vegas, he became a star of action flicks, just stopping to do something forgettable as City of Angels. Oh, and he also became a mediocre actor. Giovanni Ribisi is terrible and the villain, Christopher Eccleston, just screams for a Razzie Award. He annoyed me! And what is Robert Duvall doing here? Oh! And don't think I forgot Angelina. She is a sub-supporting actress and is the second name to show up on the screen. These guys are smart, I just say that. I bet her photo was put on the poster after the Oscar for Girl, Interrupted. I just hope she doesn't join Cage's team.Gone in 60 Seconds is a very bad movie and there are almost no qualities. The cool soundtrack  is one of them, but it doesn't help, of course.

Magneto's men are Sabertooth, Mystique and Toad, all of them really nasty. I understood well what all the characters represent, and I thought this was a great job by the screenwriter.I got even what I didn't expect- some depth. Wolverine is the most well-developed character, but we will know more about him on the sequel. Magneto is a very interesting character, ambiguous and not just plain bad. I really liked the way the movie treated the good and the evil, but I still wanted to know a little more about the rivality between Magneto and Xavier, about Storm, Jean Grey and Cyclops. I think everything will be more explained in the sequel. This movie lets the door wide open for the sequel what is the secret of Wolverine's past? What will happen now that Mystique has turned into the Senator? What will be Magneto's plans now? What will happen to Rogue? Let's wait for the sequel- and I hope they make a good sequel, as good as the original.Overall, X-Men was a very pleasant surprise in many ways. It is a good choice if you are tired to see things as Gone in 60 Seconds. And it destroys the myth that every comic book adaptation is awful. Along with the first Batman, it is there the prove the opposite.I thought they put $75 million dollars in the right place. Gone in 60 Seconds costed $90 million, The Patriot costed $110 million, but X-Men is much better. It's fun, stylish, smart, amazing. Not perfect, but very good.8 out of 10 = EASILY RECOMMENDED ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"13 August 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I love ancient world epics.

For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing.  Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp.  This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on.

Hans Zimmer's music (think of Crimson Tide, but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.Well, not entirely.  Every so often - not VERY often, mind you - some STORY coalesces out of the cinematic debris, and some grandeur rises above the digital fog.

Two instances(1)  When Lucilla meets Maximus in his cell, the latter has suddenly become the most cynical, world-weary, why-bother person on the planet; he refuses to so much as lift a finger to help Rome despite the fact that he has nothing to lose, and despite the fact that quest Lucilla offers him neatly coincides with everything he's been dreaming of for the past year or so. Where did THAT come from?  I'm sure that one of the bullet points in Screenwriting for Dummies is make your hero a reluctant hero; although I expect they go on to add, but not reluctant to the point of selfish petulance.(2)  Commodus threatens to kill Lucius unless Lucilla betrays all the good guys.  Well and good.  But then we cut IMMEDIATELY to shots of the consequences of Lucilla's betrayal, and it becomes clear that we were meant to infer that Lucilla would, of course, turn traitor - Scott didn't think it worthwhile to show us what Lucilla's response was.  The possibility that she would make a sacrifice for the cause she knows to be right is not meant to even OCCUR to us.  (And it's not as if her character is so clearly defined that we have any idea how she, in particular, will act.  It's clearly meant to be a GENERAL LAW that nobody makes noble sacrifices.)The last point reminds me how poorly defined ALL the characters are.  Some blame the acting, or the dialogue, for this, but there's nothing wrong with either in fact, most of the lines are stirring - corny, my foot - and impeccably delivered.  The problem lies deeper.

TRADING PLACES has always been my favorite Murphy movie, with the original BEVERLY HILLS COP a close second.  He's a funny guy, and he has come further than he ever has had before with NUTTY II.  The original 1996 film was both funny and enjoyable, if having the distinction of having occasional unnecessary bathroom humor.  NUTTY II, however, is taken to extremes with the bathroom humor, everywhere from Grandma Klump giving Buddy Love oral sex in a hot tub to a hamster growing to epic proportions giving anal sex to Klump's boss, this film revels in bad taste way too much.  Is the film funny?  Sure it is, and it would have been a lot funnier if not for all the sickenening humor that we've seen dozens of times before (I don't blame Murphy particularly for this, considering the script was co-written by the guys who wrote AMERICAN PIE, and directed by Peter Segal, who has had his fair share of films with the same type of humor).  They don't make the sick humor at least clever, which is the problem.  THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and BASEKETBALL made their bathroom humor clever, but  NUTTY II doesn't.Murphy fans are sure to love this, though, because I was telling the truth before about him coming further than he ever has before.  Playing no less than 8 roles (this might be some kind of record), his main character is Sherman Klump, a charmingly overweight professor who, in the original wanted to get rid of all the weight and became a stud in Buddy Love to make a beautiful co-ed (Jada Pinkett, whose missing prescence in the sequel is annoyingly unexplained) and eventually learns in the end that you should be yourself and that personality is way more important about looks.  In the sequel, he can't shake off the DNA that Buddy has left inside of him, so he decides to attempt to get rid of it, but Buddy eventually (and predictably) regenerates himself with a new thing on his mind.  Sherman, apparantly, has discovered the fountain of youth, and now Buddy is going to stop him and take the invention to his own credit. This film, apart from the original, focuses more on Sherman's family, right down to their gluttonous eating habits to their sexual fantasies. That's basically the whole plot in a nutshell.  As I've said before, Murphy is terrific, and he's well worth watching in his eight roles, but this film will turn off a lot of viewers because all the sick humor, which I must say is more silly than funny, yet you find yourself for some reason still laughing to it (or rather, at it).  Janet Jackson, as Eddie's love interest here, is OK, but she seems to be more important to the audience (any audience, not just the African-American audience) as a male fantasy figure than an actress.  Overall, I'm looking at this film as another one to add to Murphy's list of commercial successes that is funny enough to make him a respectable comedian, but for once I want him to go more towards not grossing us out and finding a concept to appeal to anyone and everyone.

He is a man, from Scotland who would have loved to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children, but sees his dream killed of by a brutal Englishman. He then becomes enraged and focuses on bringing freedom to his country by beating the bush &#150; robbers, who call themselves English on the head and so chasing them out of his country.In this film Wallace though has not got many friends, although he is worshipped and respected by the people, the Scottish nobles are not on his side. They rather got more scraps of land from the Englishmen and see their own folk slaughtered than help. So he is betrayed by his own, called &#145;nobles' and it was then much like it is now. The rich sacrifice the poor, there is fuss amongst men who are supposed to back each other up.Now on to the film. This is a truly worthy film of a best director and best film Oscar, cause apart from Se7en and Murder in the First this is the best film of 1995 worthy of an Oscar (not counting action vehicles and sci-fi here, cause they are not going to get an Oscar for best film). The actors are all great, up front of course is Mel Gibson himself as William Wallace but there are other great actors in here. For instance (I believe it was) Tommy Flanagan as the crazy Irishman, Angus MacFayden as Robert the Bruce and of course Sophie Marceau as princess Isabelle. Here I really must compliment the casting director or whoever it was who picked these people. The best thing though about the characters is yet, that you feel for them and with them, especially Mel Gibson of course. This film, it's direction and it's music a few times really brought tears into my eyes and I'm not ashamed to say, that in the end I cried (not what you'd call crying, with sniffing and stuff, but yes, tears rolled and my nose became all runny.What makes this film such a treat for young and old, is that it contains everything that makes a film worth looking at it for three hours. It contains comedy, romance, revenge, brutal war scenes (which is the only thing you may dislike here), betrayal and a good and basically true story about a freedom fighter in  time in which his homeland was brutally ruled by the British. Ok I know most of the surrounding plot is probably made up, but that's what is so great, uniting a true story with fiction and there is nobody around today, who can tell you how it really was, so let your imagination rule and be not too rational.What I also liked is that in this film you get the sphere of being in middle age. There are for instance saga's told about Wallace that make him 7 feet tall and say that he slaughters men by the hundred's. Also this film has a great moral it tells us that freedom is one of the most important things in life and that it is not treasured enough by those who have it and don't know what it is like living without it. Also there is something that can be applied to this time also, and that is that everyone dies, but not everybody really lives. These two things ought to be bared in mind by many people on this earth.A great feature of Gibson's directing career, although it is only his second and a masterpiece that follows well in the footsteps of the good and underrated The Man without a face. I urge Mel Gibson, to again direct a film and make it at least as good as the past two. I know he will, cause he takes his time on choosing his director projects as you could see, cause Fahrenheit 451 still has not been made until today and is now I presume officially cancelled although it had been planned for about 2 or three years.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 August 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film is about a man, William Wallace (whom if you take the time and look for it, can find in an encyclopaedia, although nothing much there is mentioned).

England abandoned slavery some hundred years before USA, but that wasn´t so clear in the movie.
