What more could you want from the legendary talent of a director like Elia Kazan helming a dramatic epic with the likes of Marlon Brando and Karl Malden? On the Waterfront tells the story of Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) a washed up boxer who wants to separate himself from his mob involvement. He works for mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) who is also the corrupt head of the dockers union Terry works for. When Terry witnesses Johnny Friendly's men kill a man he finds himself getting involved with the murder through the sister of the deceased Edie Doyle, played by Eva Marie Saint in her first ever film appearance, as well as Father Barry (Karl Malden) who urges Terry to fight against the corruption he is a part of. It is a smart, moving, and powerful story that will leave you very satisfied and stricken with amazement. On the Waterfront is a true spectacle.On the Waterfront is simply just a showcase for how to make truly good films. It is so iconic to its time period and 60 years down the line it stands as a defining film of its era. It's one of those films that just makes you go, 'They don't make 'em like they used to.' And it's true. In the contemporary world of filmmaking today you wont see films with this kind of raw classic greatness to them. Movies today have a certain updated persona to them, which is fine. It makes a classic like On the Waterfront a more important place in the classic days of cinema. I love contemporary filmmaking, so this is one of those films that will never be one of my absolute favorites, but I can't deny how tremendous of a film it is. There is no denying that it is one of the greatest films of its generation that deserves its place in the movie hall of fame. I myself loved it and I don't plan on ever forgetting about this film.It is just incredible when you watch a film like this where every aspect comes together so beautifully. Starting with Budd Schulberg's gripping screenplay and working your way from there, everything about On the Waterfront is tremendous and no aspect faults the film. Elia Kazan's direction is marvelous here. He was a director far ahead of his time and he proved it with his smooth and gracious cinematography in On the Waterfront. There isn't a wasted shot in this film as Kazan experiments with all sorts of angles and motions that aesthetically bind this film into something beautiful. Then of course there is the acting. There's a reason Marlon Brando is considered one of the greatest actors of all time. And that reason is simply because well... its a fact. So few actors can accomplish the raw natural talent that Brando displays on screen. Everything about his acting seems so fluid and visceral. Not only does he delivers lines with such an intense sincerity, but everything he does between and around his lines is equally incredible. Brando encompasses his character of Terry so well and never once comes out of alignment from the character.I said it once and I'll say it again. They just don't make 'em like they used to. On the Waterfront is one of the most defining films of its time and will forever be remembered as such. Every aspect of the film is as excellent as the next. Nothing seems out of alignment in this film. It is what great filmmaking is all about. You would be a fool not to see this film.

After watching it I can see why a lot of people would think that. It is a very flawed film but I by no means hated it. In fact, I liked it more than Star Trek The Motion Picture. Star Trek V The Final Frontier opens with the crew of the Enterprise enjoying some well deserved shore leave. Kirk, Spock, and Bones enjoy their time off together by going camping in Yosemite park and this makes for some amusingly cheesy moments. Their vacation is interrupted when they must respond to a hostage situation concerning a renegade Vulcan who happens to be Spock's half brother. This Vulcan's name is Sybok and he is on a desperate search for God and the end of the universe. There are also some Klingons in pursuit of Kirk and the Enterprise, but they don't seem to serve much of a purpose in the end. The Final Frontier is all kinds of weird and doesn't have much of a structure, but I can't say I didn't have fun with this movie.Remember how The Voyage Home added this element of comedy to Star Trek? Well The Final Frontier saw that and thought to itself, 'Hey! I can do that too!' Unfortunately, it was wrong. Any and all comedy in this film is completely unnecessary and either makes you cringe or roll your eyes in embarrassment. There are moments in the film where I was left wondering, 'Why in the hell did the writers think that line was a good idea?' The movie tries way too hard with its ridiculous punchlines and awkward moments that are supposed to be hilarious. A lot of the humor comes around when the friendship between Kirk, Spock, and Bones is being developed. This was always an important aspect of Star Trek, but The Final Frontier almost makes a mockery of it. Never, under any circumstances do I need to watch Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley sit around a campfire singing Row Row Row Your Boat. But I guess these were the days when Shatner and Nimoy were building their singing careers so they thought they needed those careers to carry over into Star Trek.This movie had the potential to be incredible. Sybok's search for God could have gone much deeper and been much more intellectual than what it was. This aspect of the film had spiritual and existential overtones, but they were buried by silly nonsensical scenes that do nothing for the plot. There is a lot to strip away if you want to get down to the more intellectual meaning of this film. It is something that was so obscured by the amount of crap this film throws together that in the end it was a completely lost meaning.But if you move past that, The Final Frontier can be pretty fun. If you enjoy it for its cheese than you can have a moderately good time. Especially towards the end, the film becomes completely over-the-top and loaded with cheese. It isn't like The Motion Picture, which tried way to hard to be something it wasn't and painfully dragged on for over two hours. The Final Frontier clocks in at only an hour and 45 minutes and just stays lively and fun the whole time. It isn't high quality fun, but its fun nevertheless. This definitely is not a Star Trek film I would watch again, but its a necessary watch if you are a fan of Star Trek like me and have made it your duty to see all of the films.Star Trek The Final Frontier is not a good movie. But its not a bad movie either. It isn't one of those that I just hated by the end, but I knew for sure that what I had just seen was not a very well made film. I love Star Trek so watching Kirk, Spock, and Bones boldly go where no man has gone before, even if they go to a realm of such cringe worthy cheese as this, still puts a smile on my face.

That is when I finally decided to watch the film. I think when I saw trailers, posters, and even the arcade game as a kid it kind of freaked me out. You don't get any campier than Tron. Because the film is so heavily reliant on technology it is hard for the film to be timeless. The technology from the film seems almost silly now and yet at the same time some of the ideas underneath it all were literally revolutionary. And I have no doubt that at the time the technology and special effects in the film were cutting edge. Regardless, even now, the film is one of the most visually unique films I have ever seen. I wouldn't call it stunning but very, very unique in the way that it is filmed. The world that Disney built with Tron is fascinating. In a way I'm surprised that it didn't pick up more of a following right away given how submersed the world and the sci-fi elements are. But make no mistake Tron is campy at its core. Whether it be most of the performances, the crazy costumes and the story is geek heaven.The legendary Jeff Bridges plays free spirited and zany Kevin Flynn. On the surface Bridges' character seems a little empty, not a lot of depth but he has enough charisma and chemistry to keep you watching him regardless. For all intents and purposes he is not the focus of the film anyways but he definitely is memorable in the role. Bruce Boxleitner is Bridges' friend and partner and also the heroic program Tron. He does a good job but he brings a lot of the campiness to the film because he is downright hilariously campy in his role. Its not on purpose, you can tell Boxleitner takes this role very seriously but in the process makes it almost funny. I don't mean that to sound terrible but its true. Cindy Morgan was an 80's character actor staple in everything from The Love Boat to Caddyshack. Morgan plays the lovely and cute program Yori. Morgan has good chemistry with Bridges but somehow her performance is rather campy as well. She also shares even better chemistry with Boxleitner (maybe their campiness binds them together.) An amazing character actor, David Warner plays Ed Dillinger, nemesis to Bridge's Flynn, and the voice of the Master Control Program. He doesn't have a big impact on the film but he always is a pleasure to see on screen.Writer and director Steven Lisberger doesn't have a ton of credits to his name and this is really his biggest piece of work but I'm sure when he saw what he was dealing with as far as special effects and the story. I don't even know if anyone from Disney to the film makers knew that they could potentially have a classic on their hands or maybe it was something they wished for although it took years for it to become a cult classic that it is today. I have no doubt that Tron isn't for everyone. It takes a certain breed of geek to really follow the more technical stuff but when you watch that from 1982 and then look at what we have today its almost frightening how much they touch on despite the technology still looking so retro back then. The concept is cool and I actually think they could have delved far deeper into it. Tron was made as a family film so you don't get the kind of depth that some would like but if you're a geek or a geek at heart or just want a cool family adventure unlike any other you'll enjoy seeing Tron and the way technology used to be. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Everyone and anyone has at least heard of Tron but I imagine it got its second wind with the recent big budget release of its sequel 30 years later.

The man in question, Fenton Meiks, tells of how, at a young age he and his young brother, Adam, were roused in the middle of the night by their father. He has had a vision from God and they are to go out into the world and destroy demons put there by the devil. The boys live alone with their father after their mother died in childbirth.

Soon the day comes when their father brings their first 'demon' home&#x85; I will stop there as I don't want to give too much away.A lot of the story is told in flashback and I was impressed with the work of both Matt O'Leary as Young Fenton and Jeremy Sumpter as Young Adam. There were some nice touches in the cinematography and I was relieved that it didn't become a gore-fest, which it could so easily have done. Of the grown up actors, very powerful performances from both Bill Paxton as the father, and Powers Boothe as FBI Agent Wesley Doyle. Although more subdued, Matthew McConaughey put in a decent performance as Fenton Meiks.The film has a very slow and deliberate pace that slowly builds up the tension. I would have liked a little more background on the father, particularly about the strength of his faith before his visions. There is a bit of a double twist in the tale at the end which, at first I found a little disappointing, but then changed my mind when the second twist was revealed. Don't worry, no clues here! Over all, quite a compelling and powerful film that deals with the question of faith and how it can be misconstrued. I guess if you have very strong religious beliefs then you may not find this to your liking, but then, you never know. For me, I found it very watchable and quite compelling.

It is a wonderful, contemplative little gem that relies on imagination, good dialogue, beauty imagery, and incredibly strong performances from an entire cast rather than kinetic action or bursts of consented clichés. But more than anything else, it is about possibilities. Possibilities that maybe we are not alone in the universe, possibilities that a mentally ill person can cure themselves, possibilities about our world and about life.The movie is not really about whether Prot, a mental institution patient played magnificently by Kevin Spacey, is really an extra terrestrial from a planet called K-PAX. It's about the possibility that he might be. It's not about the fact that he shapes the lives of people around him, most importantly his doctor played by Jeff Bridges; it's about the possibility that we ourselves can do these things. And so when Mr. Bridges becomes attached to Mr. Spacey and becomes determined to unlock the secrets about him, and perhaps himself, we find ourselves drawn into the story as well. And as Mr. Bridges ponders, we ponder.K-PAX is an incredibly involving movie and I think that's what I admired the most about it and why I feel it's one of the best movies that I've seen in a long, long time. There is nothing wrong - absolutely nothing wrong - with a movie simply being a mystery, or an action picture, or just a science-fiction spectacle. There is no artistic or aesthetic crime in that at all. But when a movie and its makers take an extra step and make it about something, then it's very special. Now many would assume that a science-fiction movie is about nothing more than the imagination and oftentimes they are right. But Mr. Softley's film is proof that this genre can be just that. Even science-fiction (or seemingly science-fiction) can tell you something about life, about people, about our world at the same time that it makes you wonder.There are also the wonderfully fascinating dynamics not only between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Bridges, but with both of them and the other patients in the ward. Reminding you of that great 1975 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the picture evokes fascinating relationships between the characters so that we come to know a little bit about them. But at the same time, it reminds itself that it is not a hospital character study and does not dawdle on such supporting angles to the point where it becomes tedious.The imagination of this wonderful little gem is evident all over. In more places than just its story and the way it encourages thoughtfulness. Director Softley and cinematographer John Mathieson paint the screen with images that are breath-taking, making special uses of light using strobes and beams combined with wonderful camera movements and fantastic misc en scene. A combination with these and some clever, but balanced, uses of shadows makes for an incredibly beguiling movie to look at.Performances all around are excellent. As the mysterious patient, Mr. Spacey is concentrated, professional, appropriately restrained, and in complete control of himself. There's a tendency to play a seemingly one-note role like this with hokum, but he never strikes a false note. Neither does Mr. Bridges, who is completely convincing and relatable as the doctor who goes from searching for the truth to contemplating the possibilities of life and the world. These are two superb, underrated performances from two superb, underrated actors. In regards to the supporting roles Mary McCormack is pretty but more than scenic as Mr. Bridges' wife and brings a lot of heart into her performance, Alfre Woodard is in control of her part as the skeptical ward chief. Bit parts of patients in the ward are played with enthusiasm and conviction by David Patrick Kelly, Saul Williams, Peter Gerety, Melanee Murray, and others.This is a wonderful movie, one of a type that I wish filmmakers would dare to try more often. It is well-acted and beautiful to look at and admire on a technical level, but is also beautiful, contemplative storytelling at its finest and I cannot deny that I was completely absorbed by it. I don't see many movies like K-PAX these days, but when I do, I am instantly reminded why I love the movies.

It amazed me the first time I saw it; it amazed me even more the second and wait eagerly for my third encounter with this dazzling little wonder of a movie. Apart from being wonderful entertainment, it is also a first-class example of Hollywood's greatest special effects done with purposeful and pleasing imagination. It's also a movie that you will find yourself going back to many times not merely because it is so endlessly entertaining, but to try and answer a question you find yourself asking over and over again as you watch it how did they do it?The movie is (very) loosely based on a book by Gary Wolf called Who Censored Roger Rabbit. For the film version, directed by Robert Zemeckis, the setting is changed to Hollywood, 1947, in an imaginary alternative where humans and animated cartoon characters exist together in the movie business. Bob Hoskins stars as an alcoholic gumshoe with a grudge against toons who is hired to investigate the activities of a cartoon star named Roger Rabbit. When the owner of the town where the toons live is found murdered and Roger Rabbit is framed, the gumshoe finds himself reluctantly teeming up with him to try and solve the case, which becomes much more complex than one might expect from a movie blending live action with animation.The first impression I got was that this movie would be directed at kids, but it is actually more fun for adults. Partially because of some dark undertones, but mostly because adults can really appreciate the craftsmanship and will wonder the most on how the filmmakers could have done it. Of course, this was not the first time animation was combined with live action, but this was the first time it had been done so effectively. For example, when a cartoon character steps on a floorboard, the (live-action) floorboard squeaks. When a toon touches a coat, the (live-action) coat moves. When they pick up a gun, the (live-action) gun moves. The camera is constantly in motion; the shadows are ever-present. And no matter how hard you look, you can't spot any wires or strings or operators and you find yourself wondering if that was even how it was done.That's the magic of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Not merely because the special effects are good, but because they are done with the intent of amazing and befuddling the audience. You can guess how about half of the special effects were done. You'll probably be right about half the time there. And as for the other half, you can't even guess. And at the same time, you don't want to know because it's more fun to wonder.However, there is much more here to give people reason to see the movie. Mr. Zemeckis was reportedly given more than 40 scripts to choose from and chose one that is complex, whimsical, funny, imaginative, and nostalgic. The plot is much darker and more complex that you'd expect, the jokes are not the typical below-the-belt humor we usually get, the writing is witty and sharp, and every gag delivers a laugh. Furthermore, the casting choice as far as the humans go is solid. The great Bob Hoskins plays his role like a straight man and not a comical figure trying to upstage his animated costars. There are many other great choices as well, but most entertaining is that the movie has one of the most fun villains in cinema history. Christopher Lloyd gives one of his performances as a sardonic, gargoyle-like judge who is both fearsome and yet strangely entertaining at the same time.Some of the animated characters are new, but many come from our childhood memories. Different characters from different studios make their way into the film. Some of which haven't been seen on the screen in years, such as Betty Boop, who was last seen in 1939. A personal favorite scene of mine is where Donald and Daffy Duck have a little piano square-off. Not only is the combination of animated characters and live-action pianos seamless, but it is handly exremely well and the nostalgia that was bubbling through my conscience was intoxicating.Perfectly matched to Director Zemeckis and produced by passionate souls such as Steven Spielberg, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a first-class example of entertainment.

Not sure if I can say that it's the actual story that is being bad but I think it's more the way it all gets told in this movie. First of all, a young boy starts to befriend an elderly guy and they really have a bond together, basically from the start on already but quite frankly I really can't see why these two like each other so much. Secondly, the movie presents itself as a mystery movie, without ever featuring any mystery. I mean, it's pretty clear from the beginning on that the elderly guy has some sort of clairvoyant powers and the movie doesn't go anywhere with its story that makes this movie a mysterious one. As a matter of fact, the story in the end still leaves more questions than answers, which has nothing to do with the mystery but simply because the movie doesn't bother to explain- or tie up everything.The movie has a bunch of different story lines thrown together, which make it apparent that this is a movie that got based on a novel. You would think this all would give the movie and its characters some more depth but the movie remains shockingly on the shallow side. Even when the movie gets more dramatic it fails to call out any emotion. This might all be also very well due to the fact that the movie doesn't really feature a 'problem' that needs to get resolved. Basically the main element in its story is that the FBI is chasing ans searching for the elderly character but this just never hit me as anything threatening. The FBI were supposed to be the bad guys but quite frankly I don't see how they are supposed to be 'evil' in this movie. Apparently the elderly guy escaped from the government\/FBI because his clairvoyant powers were being used in the fight against communism (the movie its main story is being set in the '60's) but it's not like it ever becomes apparent as if they were threatening him bad, like torturing him or holding him in a special build cell, or anything like that. Seems that he is just really needed in the 'fight' against communism and how can this be a bad thing? It's not like he had a family at home to take care off or anything better to do with his life because all he does in this movie is sitting on the porch and having a smoke.Perhaps the movie was more supposed to be a coming of age type of movie, told from the eyes of the young boy but to me the overall movie instead came merely across as a look into the life of a boys most exciting and eventful weeks. But I don't feel like the movie movie its story made the boy go through any transition, like a coming of age movie would normally do. Just because he gets his first kiss doesn't make this a coming of age movie.Thing that still kept this movie somewhat going was its acting. I really liked Anthony Hopkins and the child actors were also quite good, as far as child acting goes. Anton Yelchin didn't do a very good job with the emotional scenes but other than that he was simply good, as was Mika Boorem, who I have always liked as a young actress.It's also a quite good looking movie, that does a good job at capturing the look and feel of 1960's, America's Everytown. This is all also really thanks to the nice looking cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski.So it really is not like this movie is the most horrible thing you'll ever sit through but in the end the movie leaves you puzzled at what it was supposed to be. It doesn't pick one clear approach to its story and it does a bit of everything, with as a result that nothing works out as good or powerful as it was supposed to be and potentially also could had been. It's the reason why this movie is a very forgettable one and even one that by the end just leaves a very redundant impression.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie left me really unimpressed.

The scenery and cinematography were very good too, but not as good as that in the original, lacking its polish.What really brought the film down was the script and story. The script is just terrible, when it tries to be funny it is actually unfunny and predictable while there is too much mugging on Jeff Goldblum's part. The story is pretty redundant, not the idea but in the way it was executed. There is too much filler that could have been trimmed or excised, as some of is superfluous to the story and just bogs it down significantly. The rest of the story is predictable, is filled with plot holes and lacks any thrills, focusing less on suspense and more on action. The film is also overlong, drags due to those aforementioned fillers primarily and feels rather anti-climatic. Spielberg's direction is disappointingly lethargic, almost as if he wasn't interested, while the film is devoid of a single likable or sympathetic character, apart from one and he was killed off early.

The acting is poor, Goldblum is a great actor with good material, but seeing as his material is actually awful he tries his best but it is all wasted effort by the end.

The acting is poor, Goldblum is a great actor with good material, but seeing as his material is actually awful he tries his best but it is all wasted effort by the end. The rest of the cast including Julianne Moore and the late Pete Postlethwaite try too but the script and how badly written their characters are undermine them to the point they struggle too.All in all, a huge disappointment and just didn't work. I can understand the disappointment of fans of the original, and I have heard valid criticisms of this film which I agree with. I also agree if you compare this in any way to the original, this movie is doomed, but any comparison is inevitable. As a sequel, it is not the worst, it isn't quite as awful as Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3, Secret of NIMH 2, Son of the Mask and JawsThe Revenge(SuperbabiesBaby Geniuses 2 is also terrible but unlike the above its predecessor is bad as well), but to me The Lost World is one of the more disappointing ones. 1\/10 for the score and the dinosaurs.

Wes Craven really has no idea how much he stuck fear in the public subconscious with this character.You all know the story at this point, so I'm guessing there's no point in summarizing it, but with a small cast and limited locations\/budget, Craven proves just how much you can do with a good script and lots of determination. If only all horror wannabes realized this before saturating their movies with ugly CGI.Depp had the most successful career of all the actors, but special mention must be made of Robert Englund, who played the character of Freddy for 21 years after this movie. He's probably one of the most iconic horror villains of all time, and make-up or not, it's ALL Robert Englund.The mythology of Freddy certainly does lend itself well to numerous sequels. ANOES sets up so much potential that I have never really found the series and spin-offs to be stale or repetitive. The film itself hasn't really dated that much either, which is a common flaw of older horror movies.I'm not really sure why I put off watching it until now, I feel like I'm a 'little bit' late to the party. It may be kind of tame by today's standards, but it's a great low-budget horror with plenty of imagination.

If only all horror wannabes realized this before saturating their movies with ugly CGI.Depp had the most successful career of all the actors, but special mention must be made of Robert Englund, who played the character of Freddy for 21 years after this movie. He's probably one of the most iconic horror villains of all time, and make-up or not, it's ALL Robert Englund.The mythology of Freddy certainly does lend itself well to numerous sequels. ANOES sets up so much potential that I have never really found the series and spin-offs to be stale or repetitive. The film itself hasn't really dated that much either, which is a common flaw of older horror movies.I'm not really sure why I put off watching it until now, I feel like I'm a 'little bit' late to the party. It may be kind of tame by today's standards, but it's a great low-budget horror with plenty of imagination.
