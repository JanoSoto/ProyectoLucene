This movie has it all, great special effects, excellent actors, fantastic set design, good story line.  When I heard about this movie I knew the movie makers tried to basically create a haunted space ship.  So I had my doubts.  But when I saw the movie I was very impressed.  They definitely succeeded!  The Event Horizon is scary, but very convincing as an actual space vehicle.  I liked the originality of this film.  A lot of people were turned off by the premise of a genuine horror movie.  I think people went to the movie expecting to see some kind of alien incarnation, and when they didn't see that, they felt short changed.  But to me, this is a strong point.  The whole idea of a blood thirsty alien stowing away onboard a space ship and eating the crew one by one, has been done a million times.  So I really felt like this movie successfully broke new ground.  Its very original and very scary.  However there were some bad points in the movie, too.  The part where the character of Justin floats out in to space was not very realistic.  He actually exits the air lock without a space suit on, and is exposed to the icy vacuum of space...but he survives!  Impossible.  Scientifically speaking, his lungs would have been instantly collapsed and the nitrogen in his blood would fizz up, like a can of soda that has been shaken too much and suddenly opened.  The next part of the movie that is really weak is the part where Cooper gets blown out in to space and then surfs back to the Event Horizon by blowing his air tanks.  If you have seen John Carpenter's DARK STAR this part will remind you of the end of DARK STAR when the astronaught surfs in to the planet's atmosphere.Other than those two weak points, EVENT HORIZON is a very good movie.  A scare fest full of originality and some refreshingly gory scenes.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies, you need to see this movie. The ships are great, the set design is fascinating, the ideas about space travel are new and even thought provoking, the scares keep you on the edge of your seat, and its really spooky.By the way, does anybody else see the similarities between Lawrence Fishburn's role in this movie and his role in THE MATRIX?

In this moment enters Beaman (Foxx), the always substitute, and he doesn't miss the unexpected chance awarded by the coach. By his style of play, spectacular, but not caring about the tactics and the schemes, he wins the heart of the fans, but enters in the disgrace of the coach.The world of football is an eternal source of  stories or problems that can be used in a movie. After he showed us wars, from many points of view, the murder of JFK, the agitated history of The Doors, or the satire against the media in Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone enters on an unused territory so far. And he does it in style, with an exceptional movie.One thing must be clear this is not a movie only for football fans, but for everybody. Because it's not a movie necessarily about football, but about team spirit, about friendships, joys or troubles, a film with strong characters played by really special actors. A film that will keep your interest at high levels, despite its long runtime, by the fabulous style of Stone, but also by the story, full of events dictated by interests or the rush for money, that many times dims freindships or any bit of morality.During the movie, you are taken through the backstage of american football. You will discover a dirty world, full of interests and passions, far of the beauty observed from outside. Al Pacino is a character caught between the desire of winning  every match no matter what and the friendship that ties him with old Rooney, who injures himself at the beginning. Beaman is a young football player, selfish, insensitive, but with an extraordinary talent. Many times, the sudden pass from anonymity in the spotlights can bring with it major changes in the character's personality, changes that can only be bad. That's what happends to Beaman. The selfishness, the interest only for himself, bring major misunderstandings between him and his teammates or his coach. Al Pacino has the tough mission of bringing the team to the desired levels, calming down the spirits and also making the difficult decision concerning the quarterback Beaman or Rooney. New or old. Talent or team player.Although the script is very good, the film wouldn't have had the same value without Oliver Stone on board. He shows us again, one more time, his great talent. By his awesome way of filming, that reminds us of NBK, the fast paced, incredibly real dialogues, or last, but not least, the full of significance inserts with what he feasted our eyes and mind also in NBK, you actually feel that you are a part of this world, that you are really inside it. You can't even blink without being sorry. Again, the camera moves very quickly, this agressive style, of fast filming, short editing, strange angles or permenent camera movement, being a characteristic of many Stone movies. And the inserts have a special meaning again, especially in the scene of the dialogue between Foxx and Pacino, maybe the best and most significant of the whole movie.All in all, another success for Oliver Stone.

No sorry, it was worse. Apart from a somewhat talented cast given absolutely nothing to do or anything interesting to say (the rock with Made by God bit was as deep and philosophical as it got) , effects that have been seen done better on numerous occasions, a plot that was utterly plot less, what really got on my nerves was the utter IMPLAUSIBILITY of it all.Now I love my sci fi, but if you are going to base a story in our universe, please respect a few basic facts about it.I fell out of my seat laughing when the solar flare hit them. It was just so CONVENIENT, so as to pathetically turn it into some sort of disaster movie. It also looked like a wave of molten lava or something, when a real solar flare would be as invisible as the wind, albeit a lot more devastating to your cell tissue. And since Carrie Anne Moss bravely stood her ground in the control room, shouldn't she have been suffering from massive radiation sickness a few minutes later? I won't even mention the fact that they didn't get any warning.Well they nicely got over the gravity problem in the whole ship (top bottom, centre, etc.) by just spinning a few rings of it around.Then we come to the robot. Another stunningly convenient piece of drivel. Costs a zillion dollars, gets a bang on the head and starts to kill everyone. Waaaa (sound of a projectile vomit).Then a Mars that can increase its atmospheric pressure from under a hundred millibars to presumably something around a thousand in a few decades just because a few insects are farting oxygen? This is a planet for christsake, not a thermos flask.And why wasn't the change in oxygen levels detected during their journey? And why do they burn the only remaining raw materials left to them (what was left of the habitat) instead of attempting to make a shelter. And how was a little circuit board the size of a palm pilot with no discernable power supply whacking out enough zip to be detected on Earth? And why were they taking it out of Sojourner instead of Pathfinder, where the high gain antenna was really located ?(this is nit picking, I know, but it is just one example of the million times they just weren't bothered with reality) And why did the Cosmos launcher work now, when it didn't 30 years earlier? And why does it have such a stupid looking interface with a teddybear?

The suspense is top notch, the characters are actually sympathetic (albeit poor decision makers) for once, and unlike most latter day stalk and slash films, Halloween does a great job building atmosphere and mood which climbs from an lowly, unexpected beginning to a hair-raising, adrenaline rushing climax. Halloween is the film that started to all This horror flick that paved the wave for hundreds, perhaps thousands of weak@$$ slasher films that foolishly tried to capitalize on the success of this precedented (much imitated) thriller. However, instead, these lame slasher movies inveigh into a whirlpool of obscurity... ~p~ You probably already know the notorious story but here goes... On Halloween Night in 1963, Michael Myers, (not the Saturday Night Live's Michael Myers) than 6 years old brutally murders his older sister with a kitchen knife. The pain is agonizing as Myers stabs his sister multiple times with a knife, until you collapses, lying in her own pool of blood... Myers is then taken to a mental hospital where he has been confined there for 15 years...but not for long... ~p~ On Halloween Night, 1978, Myers manages to break free from his incarceration and once again...he begins his unfinished killing spree eactly where he left off...at Haddonfield, Ohio... His particularly targeting a young, naive babysitter... ~p~ Dr. Loomis (the late British actor Donald Pleasance), Myers' psychiatrist is currently stalking Myers himself while the serial killer hunts down more victims, young and old...for his collection... Meanwhile, young, nubile Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), is the main heroine for this horror pic. She senses intimations of trouble when a stranger wearing a white mask begins to follow her every move... By Halloween Night, Strode gradually forgets about this taciturn man, but she tragically learns that it's a neccessity to remain precarious... ~p~ P.J. Soles (Rock and Roll High School Forever) is Strode's best friend in this movie. She's trustworthy...but rather dim-witted and has a couple of brief nudity scenes. Nancy Loomis (Assault on Precinct 13) is also an acquaintance of Strode.

It is highly influential in its genre, and surprisingly, director John Carpenter does a great job fabricating a wonderfully fiendish masterpiece without having to resort to a high body count or gratuitous violence and gore.

Halloween is a persuasive horror film because it actually has a logical plot, semi-coherence, important dialogue, fine acting, and decent character angles. Also, director John Carpenter also takes care of the fact that the audience in this film is constantly feeling tense. Like the main character(s) in this film, Halloween, the viewer watching this movie feels consistently in danger to. This person wants to warn the character in this film to watch out...and whether he\/she does follow the advice is to be determined... ~p~ Halloween, like a first-rate thriller, allows the viewer to vicariously feel the nerve-wrecking tension of many of the characters involved in this project. Halloween may not have a lot of action, but the continuous feel of jeopardy in this motion picture prevents Halloween from becoming a bore. Halloween is (shockingly) innocuous, tasteful, enjoyable, moderately horrifying, and providing plenty of goosebumps that will accompany u for restless, sleepless nights. Halloween is a film that most people will enjoy. You don't have to have a titanium stomach (unlike most gore drenched movies) to actually have the pleasure of delightfully being scared out of your wits for this horror film. Even 20 years later after Halloween was made, it is still a powerful and highly popular and rented horror video. Halloween scares the daylights out of the audience with **** out of ****.
