Larch has taken Homer under his wing after he was returned twice by different foster parents.  Homer grows up and learns to be a doctor under the tutoring of Dr Larch however a visit to the orphanage from an airforce pilot and his girlfriend to have an abortion opens Homer's eyes to the wider world.  For the first time as an adult he decides to leave the orphanage and goes with Candy Kendall to work her families orchard with the hired gangs.  Once there he learns just what Larch had been trying to teach him for years.I didn't know what this film was about when I sat to watch it.  Even when Michael Caine was winning his Oscar I was still none the wiser and only saw it yesterday.  Seeing how strong the pro-abortion argument is in the film made me surprised that the very liberal voters in the academy weren't turned against it.  However thick the message is laid in, it is made via a good story that stops short of ramming it down our throat.  As a melodrama it works very well, as an argument it is a little easy but works just as well.Director Hallström controls the film very well.  A lesser director could easily have made this a really mushy sentimental TVM or gone the other way and been too cold and distant. Hallström manages to walk the line between both, the film is emotional, but only because of the subject matter and not because he overdoes the story or uses cheap music.  At times the story appears a bit aimless and wandering, although given the sprawling nature of the source material this is perhaps to be expected.  Generally though it is very involving &#150; the couple of years journey of Homer, his odyssey if you will!Maguire is perfectly cast.  His understated performance allows us to see the story past him easily, but he brings enough so that the role is not a blank.  Caine is good but I can only assume that the field around him for the Oscar must have been weak or that he was an emotional choice (ageing actor needing a win etc).  Personally I felt his performance in Quiet American was miles better than this, but that's Oscar for you!  Having said that I think he is good but has little to do really.  Theron is good looking and happily makes Candy a more complex character than the romantic subplot occasionally makes you think she is.  For the most part her scenes with Homer drag a bit but she comes good towards the end.  The real lift for the film once it leaves the orphanage is two great performances on the farm.  Delroy Lindo is superb as the leader of the gang and Badu, in her first film, is really good.  Damn &#150; even Heavy D plays well!Overall this is a message film but it is balanced well and isn't just that.  The wandering story of Homer is involving by itself and the fact that it asks difficult questions and shows us the lessons of Homer just make it better.  It isn't perfect but it is a very touching, bittersweet tale.

Ever since he stalked a whole gaggle of camp counselors in Friday the 13th Part 2 I have felt an affinity for Jason Voorhees. He's big, he's stupid, he uses a machete and whatever tools he can find. What's not to love about this big lug? Oh that's right, his last four movies sucked!!!!When I heard they were putting Jason in space I was upset but the director said in an article that the fans should enjoy it.

It's not so bad.This film takes place five hundred years after the last one. A group of scientists were cryogenically freezing Jason and in the imminent melee that follows whenever a group of scientist attempt to do something stupid, Jason and one of his detractors are frozen together. Five hundred years later they are thawed out and more destruction by Jason ensues.I must say, the special effects that follow are top notch and some of the performances are quite good (although not good enough to get a mention here). But, while everything seemed solid the film as a whole still seemed to be a sanitized version of the same old thing. Yes, they do find a way for Jason to just open up his own special form of savagery on a number of people but for what?After sitting through this I realized that my Jason was gone. Any interesting idea (3-D, raising him from the grave) are now gone to the way of modernized crap. It's better looking crap, wrapped in a prettier package, but no matter what you do with it, it's still crap. A poor idea should be left alone. The director must have felt he was better than he really is if he thought he could make something useful out of this mess.It's not a good time, it's not a hoot, and it's certainly not thought provoking.

He started appearing in wacky comedies (Analyze this, Meet the parents, Showtime) and even though it's pretty easy to admit that many of his serious dramatic roles had slight comedic elements in them as well, it was still quite a surprise to see him taking this road.Of course he has never taken the role of a complete clown. Even when he takes part in a total one hundred per cent comedy he's still the same old supercool, tough and extravagantly stylish Bobby as always. He has definitely the best comedy role of his career in Meet the parents as Jack Byrnes, the provoking father-in-law straight from your most horrifying nightmares.So far Meet the parents is probably the funniest comedy of the 21th century and the dialogue is so side-burstingly hilarious that this movie has to be the finest comedic screenplay for years. The whole film doesn't have a single empty moment or a bad joke. Acting is superb all the way, for example the splendid James Rebhorn made an amusing little role as Doctor Larry Banks although he really wasn't so much on view.Owen Wilson is most likely at his best when he just appears in small supporting roles and plays the most irritating, vexatious and self-conceited characters you can think of like the one in The Cable guy. Wilson is once again marvelous in Meet the parents as Pam's old boyfriend Kevin. The guy is so self-satisfied and full of himself that he truly represents the type of a bloke everybody would like to punch. And in this film, everyone just happens to love him and hate Greg. It's a cruel world.Ben Stiller's performance as the unnaturally unlucky Greg Focker is so funny it's almost moving. He tries so hard to be the good guy and win the approval of Robert De Niro's wicked Jack Byrnes but everything around him just happens to go wrong. It's almost too easy to step into his shoes and think of what kind of a hell he's going through.Almost every guy can probably say that his girlfriend's parents have given him more or less troubles but this is the kind of a massively overdone Elm Street version of it all it makes our own personal experiences so very idle and trivial. Good comedies are starting out to be such a rare art form that I feel it's great once in a while someone still makes a masterpiece like Meet the parents.

I finally saw it and thought it was okay.  Ben Kingsley, as Logan, turned in a superb performance, and I thought the movie took off every time he was on screen.  He is electrifying to watch, and his delivery of dialogue is riveting.The rest of the characters are pretty boring and run-of-the-mill.  The performances are all great, but I've seen it all before.  Basically, it's a late entry in the post-PULP FICTION trend of flashy, snappy gangster movies.  The thief who is forced out of retirement one last time, the darkly dressed, perpetually calm and cool ringleader, the big heist (complete with flashy camerawork and rapid editing).  It's been done before, and it's no different now.The movie is pretty dull until Kingsley shows up, then things pick up.  Once he's out of the picture, things slow down again.  The last ten minutes are really well-done, although no suspense was generated for me because I had figured out what was going to happen early on.  ***SPOILERS COMING UP!***  I thought the single most interesting moment was when Teddy (Ian McShane) shoots James Fox without even bothering to find out how he felt about the fact that he successfully broke into his heist-proof vault.  It added a huge amount of depth to what could have remained a totally one-note character.  He's not a petty guy, and would have gotten no satisfaction from Fox's reaction.  He's above that.  It's business.  Which is why he basically lets Gal (Ray Winstone) off the hook at the end, for no other reason than Gal getting Logan out of the way saved Teddy from having to worry about it.  Those last few touches made the movie.  Unfortunately, it was too little, too late for me.I also did not see the need for the monster that stalked Gal in his dreams; it was a poorly thought out--and poorly executed--distraction that added nothing to the story.I really wanted to like this movie.  But it was a long 89 minutes for me.  I think Ben Kingsley deserved the Academy Award nod he received for his performance, and I think the performances overall are what won this movie such acclaim.  But the story, the screenplay, the characters, the flashy camera work, the self-consciously eccentric direction--I'm getting tired of seeing it in movie after movie.  PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS, THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH, OCEANS 11--enough already.  Do something original.

I finally saw it and thought it was okay.  Ben Kingsley, as Logan, turned in a superb performance, and I thought the movie took off every time he was on screen.  He is electrifying to watch, and his delivery of dialogue is riveting.The rest of the characters are pretty boring and run-of-the-mill.  The performances are all great, but I've seen it all before.  Basically, it's a late entry in the post-PULP FICTION trend of flashy, snappy gangster movies.  The thief who is forced out of retirement one last time, the darkly dressed, perpetually calm and cool ringleader, the big heist (complete with flashy camerawork and rapid editing).  It's been done before, and it's no different now.The movie is pretty dull until Kingsley shows up, then things pick up.  Once he's out of the picture, things slow down again.  The last ten minutes are really well-done, although no suspense was generated for me because I had figured out what was going to happen early on.  ***SPOILERS COMING UP!***  I thought the single most interesting moment was when Teddy (Ian McShane) shoots James Fox without even bothering to find out how he felt about the fact that he successfully broke into his heist-proof vault.  It added a huge amount of depth to what could have remained a totally one-note character.  He's not a petty guy, and would have gotten no satisfaction from Fox's reaction.  He's above that.  It's business.  Which is why he basically lets Gal (Ray Winstone) off the hook at the end, for no other reason than Gal getting Logan out of the way saved Teddy from having to worry about it.

As they were heading up, they see a group of protesters at a landfill. The protesters were Native Americans protesting Jack Harding for dumping garbage and hazardous chemicals on their land. Jack Harding was a cruel man and ignored the land owner's protests and continued his dumping. His men kidnapped Charlie who had evidence of Harding's illegal dumpings! Later, Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum go to the pizza parlor while Grandpa does some shopping. Charlie's daughter, Jo, was in there questioning some rednecks who work for Harding. The leader, J.J., began giving her a hard time. Colt and Tum Tum come to her rescue and so begins a Ninjitsu action battle. Soon the bad guys give up but when Grandpa finds out what has been going on, he is most displeased. Back at the cabin, he taught them the correct ways of the Ninja which involved listening to the flowers bloom. The next day, the boys help clean up the pizza parlor and meet up with Jo who tells them what happened with her father and they agree to help.       Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum tail J.J. and the men to Harding's sanitation department and find Charlie all tied up. They fight some guards on the way out and make a plan to go back and rescue Charlie that night. So while Grandpa sleeps, Rocky, Colt, Tum Tum and Jo go to rescue Charlie and they are successful. He still has the evidence with him a computer disk that has the read outs of the chemicals on it. Harding's men tried to stop them, but the boys Ninja-kicked the daylights out of them. At the Indian village, the boys were commended for their efforts. But soon Harding and his men arrived to cause trouble but the boys managed to give them a work out. Grandpa was there too! Harding and J.J. retreated, vowing revenge. Soon came the day of Charlie's hearing. Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum go along. All the while, Colt was feelings for Jo which he tries not to show. En route to the courthouse, a biker gang on Harding's payroll causes trouble. They gas Jo's mother so Rocky takes the wheel but the only driving experience he's is at the video arcade so they drive off road and on but with luck they ditch the bikers into a ghost town and give the martial arts battle of their lives to some bumbling bikers and thugs.         Harding's men had kidnapped Jo and Harding blackmailed Charlie in court so he couldn't show them the disk. Luckily, Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum had rescued Jo. They beat up the bad guys, jump in the car and bounce to the courthouse. They play the disk and Harding's foul play is at an end. The landfill was permanently shut down and Harding was sent to jail so all was well. What's more, Rocky finally learned what it meant to listen to the flowers. They don't want to show off their beauty, they just are beautiful.        Not a bad addition to the 3 Ninjas saga. This is actually Part 2 even though it was released as Part 3. There must be some story behind that because in 3 Ninjas Kick Back the kids look older where as in this movie they're the same ages as in the original. Victor Wong, who sadly is no longer with us, returns as Grandpa; This 3 Ninjas movie has alot more action and violence which is probably why it's rated PG-13. There was a fourth 3 Ninjas movie 3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain. That film was awful!! Terrible! It was so bad I won't even do a review for it.

The print and sound featured on the 2003-issued Director's Edition DVD are wonderful, and the many insights into the production prove to be icing on the cake. Extras include commentary by director Nicholas Meyer; text commentary by Michael Okuda (co-author of `The Star Trek Encyclopedia'); `The Captain's Log' featuring new cast & crew interviews with Meyer, Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban and writer Harve Bennett; trailer; original interviews with Deforrest Kelley, Shatner, Nimoy and Montalban; storyboard archives; `Designing Khan' featurette; and much more.

I saw the film, truthfully to see Demi naked, (sue me, I'm a guy) and would have been happy had I gotten that. I'm sorry though 11 seconds of nipple is not worth 20 mil, even if you are married to Burce Willis. the flick is also not funny. If you need to see Miss Moore naked, rent GI Jane.
