But there were still enough old-fashioned (and to be honest, far more savvy) bods around to know that stars plus spectacles equalled bums on seats and fat receipts.Nevertheless Hollywood was by now a very different place, and the previously unusual move was made of leaving much of the production of Cleopatra in the hands of one man &#x96; writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Now Mankiewicz was certainly proficient at his job, but his focus was always very intimate, with humungous epics conspicuously absent from his CV . It appears he was shoved on board as a level-headed professional who could bring some order to proceedings. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it just means he crafted a vision of an epic that was somewhat different to that of the studio heads. This is not a sword-and-sandal spectacular, nor is it even a sweeping character study like Lawrence of Arabia. Rather it is an intense romantic melodrama, in the line of the A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, concerning human interaction above all other things.Mankiewicz eschewed action scenes &#x96; not because he was a pacifist, but I think more because he felt them a distraction from the nobility of drama. Of course, the crowds of extras and the stupendous sets are all there, but they are quite literally backdrops. Not that Mankiewicz's sharp eye ignores them. His style was in fact all about backgrounds, in particular using background movement (or lack of it) to highlight what was going on in the foreground. In the opening scene we have hundreds of soldiers milling round, while others stand imperiously still. Which of the two Mankiewicz allows us to see at any given point helps define the importance of the moment or the character, and this is how the hordes of extras are used in all the big outdoor scenes. On other occasions he uses the cavernous halls and magnificent frescoes to evoke tones of mystery, emptiness, austerity and so forth. It's rare that he shows any of this splendour for its own sake. Forget Citizen Kane &#x96; this is probably the most outrageous example of a director's personal indulgence at a studio's expense.It is so like Mankiewicz to turn every asset he has to focus us upon the actors and their performances, and yet it is the acting itself in Cleopatra that has most often been singled out for critical drubbing. Elizabeth Taylor does not make a bad Queen of Egypt. She does however appear a little worse the wear, probably from her recent illness and the rigours of such a massive production of which she is in almost every scene. As a result she seems a little flat and lacking in conviction. Rex Harrison on the other hand breezes effortlessly through his part, and wins us over with his honest charm, even managing to bring out a touching tenderness when instructing his young son in the ways of despotism. The virile and stocky Richard Burton certainly has the perfect physique for Mark Anthony, and while he does a decent bit of grand theatricality, he is actually far better in meek and sensitive roles such as those in Becket and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The most applause should really go to Roddy McDowell, who relishes playing the only really manic character, and yet does so without making an extravagant mess of it.At the end of the day though this was still an old style epic production with a very professional big picture production crew, and it is their work which looms largest. The colossal reconstructions of ancient Egypt and Rome seem utterly real and boundless in their sprawl.

His actions are never remotely appropriate for a person of his position, so much so that it's quite hard to believe that his superiors allow him to keep his job. Ferrara and crew aren't concerned with plot holes, however, for they have a loftier goal here the film is about redemption of a specifically religious type.To be even more specific, the film is about redemption in the Catholic faith. Early in the film the title character scoffs at Catholics, greatly angering some of his fellow officers. Nevertheless, it's this officer who is charged with investigating the rape and brutalization of a nun, a crime that took place in the church sanctuary itself. Eventually he comes to realize that the nun is fully aware of the identity of the men who victimized her but is unwilling to aid his investigation because she has forgiven them. This in turn leads him to wonder if he himself deserves forgiveness.This is a very didactic film and the lesson it seeks to teach is this even the lowest, most despicable sinner can redeem himself through faith in God and forgiving those who have wronged him. The majority of the film exists only to establish that our bad lieutenant is indeed among the lowest of the low. In the end, he finds that he has a chance to forgive someone else and in so doing give another person a chance to learn the same lesson he has before it's too late.The problem with Bad Lieutenant is that it requires the viewer to accept some basic tenets of Catholicism as divine truth. Outside of the context of the religion's ideas of forgiveness, the lieutenant's salvation is just another example of shoddy police work. I don't think it's at all presumptuous to say that most viewers are going to have a problem with forgiving violent criminals who are more likely than not to continue committing crimes; in fact, even a last minute change of heart like the lieutenant has hardly seems to make up for an unknown but undoubtedly lengthy period of immoral behavior.On the bright side, the film is acceptable on a technical level. Ferrara knows how to frame a scene and he's quite adept at incorporating his religious imagery in an effective way. Another virtue of the film is the better than average performance from the always impressive Harvey Keitel. Still, even these qualities aren't enough to save a film that skews more toward sleazy than entertaining and puts entirely too much focus on sending a religious message.

After all, the first 80% of it is very good--with nice acting and a very compelling story. Then, oddly, the last portion of the movie seems to fall apart and is a bit of a confusing and saccharine-like mess.The film begins with Van Johnson meeting and falling in love with Elizabeth Taylor. Considering how incredibly beautiful and sweet she was, it was easy to see why he dumped Donna Reed to pursue Taylor. Johnson's ambition it to publish a novel, but in the meantime he has married Taylor, has a lovely little girl and a well-paying job in Paris. What more could he want? Sure, his book has been rejected by some publishers, but considering everything he is still clearly a lucky man. But Johnson is NOT happy and is a self=indulgent idiot (to put it mildly). All he can do is feel sorry for himself for not being published. To bruise his shallow ego, he begins taking Taylor for granted and spends way too much time with his new friend--sultry Eva Gabor. Gabor is NOT the 'just friends' type, as she's been married multiple times. How any sane man could chose her over the sweet wife is beyond me and you really, really hate Johnson's character--a big switch for the guy who usually played such likable guys.All of this drama was compelling and I really got into the film--and wondered why the film had a mediocre score on IMDb. But then, late in the film, I saw exactly what the problem was. The film began to make no sense at all and decided to use clichés instead of decent writing. Out of the blue, Johnson locks Taylor out of the house and it's raining. In the real world, she'd get mad but that's all. Here in this Bizarro World, instead she gets sick and dies!!!! Folks, in real life standing in the rain does NOT cause death! And how she died with him rushing to her and having her die in his arms was dreadfully schmaltzy and stupid. And, what happened next was worse. Not one minute of the last portion of the film rang true or made sense. Considering that Johnson was cheating on his wife and locked the wife out in the rain, you'd THINK Taylor's father (Walter Pidgeon) would be at least a tiny bit angry--but he wasn't!! And, when Johnson CONTINUES to feel sorry for himself and neglects his daughter (necessitating her being cared for by others), you think this guy is a total bum--and yet they have them reunite at the end of the film and there's a 100% phony Hollywood ending!!! The first portion of the film I give a 9--it's that good. The last, I'd give a 2 or a 3--at best.

When she befriends JD, a student recently transferred to her school played by Christian Slater, she has no idea just how much it will change her life and that of her fellow students. After a visit to a college party with Heather Chandler goes horribly wrong and her reputation at school is threatened she tells JD that she wishes her friend was dead... She may not have been serious but he thinks it is a great idea and in the morning gives her a wake up drink that leaves her dead. Not wanting to go to gaol JD and Veronica write a suicide note. Veronica briefly hopes that the death of the lead Heather will have a positive effect on the school but nothing changes. After being persuaded to go on a double date with another Heather and two of the school football team Veronica finds herself victim of a rumour, spread by the boys, that she had performed sexual acts on them. The next morning she invites them to meet her in the woods to do it for real... by the time school starts two more students are dead in what looks like a suicide pact caused by their inability to admit their homosexuality to the world. Till this point Veronica goes along with JD but when she learns he plans to destroy the school along with everybody in it she decides it is time to stop him.This is a great example of the high school film; it is very funny and very dark. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater to well in the two lead roles and are supported by a great cast including Shannen Doherty as Heather Duke and Glenn Shadix who is memorable despite his limited screen time as Father Ripper, the priest who performs some very different funeral services. The idea of a comedy about school children killing each other might not sound very funny but here it is handled in a way that works. There are of course some minor flaws, for example the coroner seemed very quick to accept that the deaths were suicide and nobody who knew the victims doubted it either, this is easy to over look though as the story stayed interesting and a degree of unbelievability is better than getting bogged down in explaining every detail of how they could have got away with murder. If you've enjoyed other '80s high school films and are looking for another which is both funny and dark then this is the film for you.

It's about an ordinary husband and wife who try to get through an extraordinary trial the way they handle everything else in their lives, by putting their heads down and just keep going.Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a lineman for the phone company. He lives in a rented house in a blue collar neighborhood with his nurse wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and young son Jake (Zachary David Cope). They've all got a pretty good life but Tom's still vexed by the dreams of his youth that his life was going to be more than pretty good. He thought he was going to be something special and he doesn't quite appreciate how special it is to have a good son and a good woman who loves you. Then one night at a party, Maggie's sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes Tom. But instead of making him cluck like a chicken or stop smoking, Lisa accidentally opens a door in Tom's head. He begins to see terrible visions of violence, strange images that he can't understand and a sad, gray girl staring at him on the couch. It turns out the girl is the ghost of a young woman who disappeared in the neighborhood months ago. It also turns out that young Jake has been seeing and talking to the ghost all along. The spectral girl needs Tom to do something and he becomes obsessed with finding out what that is, even at risk to his job, his family and his own life.This is an entertaining little movie that unfortunately proves that timing really is everything. There's a lot here to like but I think it was largely overlooked and has been forgotten because in 1999 it followed and dealt with the same subject matter as M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, The Sixth Sense. Stir of Echoes isn't that good. It's definitely worth watching, though, something more people would have appreciated if it had come out a year earlier.Much like The Sixth Sense, this film dispenses with a lot of the standard ghost story clichés and finds its own way. It does that by placing ghosts alongside things like debt, alcoholism, adultery and other challenges that families face and have to overcome. Though he's initially freaked out by them, Tom eventually latches onto his otherworldly visions as the special thing in his life he's been waiting for. Instead of buying a sports car or banging a hot blonde, Tom's mid-life crisis is seeing ghosts and he throws himself into it with all the selfish disregard any man has in that situation. Maggie is a proud, strong woman fighting to keep her family together and overcome this supernatural thing that is cutting her off from her husband and son. It's this family dynamic that gives the story its power, not special effects or scary moments. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe both play their roles very well and manage to keep their characters grounded even when faced with the mysterious unknown.Writer\/director David Koepp also manages to generate tension and suspense without having to fall back on too many of the standard scary movie tricks. He tells a story that you might hear from a friend or a neighbor about someone they once knew and it's just spooky enough that you can almost believe it really happened. Koepp does completely blow it in one scene, however. It's in the later stages of the movie where the ghost is getting agitated with Tom and his family and there's a moment when Maggie is getting into the bathtub and the audience can see the ghost sitting on the edge of the tub. It's supposed to be a big, unnerving image. The problem is that Maggie is naked and she's the only thing you can focus on in the scene. We're meant to focus on how vulnerable she is to the ghost's machinations, but all you can notice is how sexy Kathryn Erbe is. It totally discombobulates the tenor and tone of the moment, though any scene where Erbe is unclothed can never be all that bad.The whole thing about Jake being able to see ghosts never develops into anything either. It services the Almighty Plot Hammer at a few different points but it never quite synchs up with what Tom and Maggie are going through or has any point on its own. This screenplay was also adapted from a book and there are a few points where things are briefly touched on or referenced that were probably much better developed in print. That's never too distracting, though.If you'd like to watch a ghost story that could happen in your neighborhood to your neighbors or maybe even to you&#x85;go rent Stir of Echoes. The naked Kathryn Erbe stuff is a little bonus. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 June 2010","score":"","review":" This is a ghost story with working class appeal.

Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, The Sixth Sense. Stir of Echoes isn't that good. It's definitely worth watching, though, something more people would have appreciated if it had come out a year earlier.Much like The Sixth Sense, this film dispenses with a lot of the standard ghost story clichés and finds its own way. It does that by placing ghosts alongside things like debt, alcoholism, adultery and other challenges that families face and have to overcome. Though he's initially freaked out by them, Tom eventually latches onto his otherworldly visions as the special thing in his life he's been waiting for. Instead of buying a sports car or banging a hot blonde, Tom's mid-life crisis is seeing ghosts and he throws himself into it with all the selfish disregard any man has in that situation. Maggie is a proud, strong woman fighting to keep her family together and overcome this supernatural thing that is cutting her off from her husband and son. It's this family dynamic that gives the story its power, not special effects or scary moments. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe both play their roles very well and manage to keep their characters grounded even when faced with the mysterious unknown.Writer\/director David Koepp also manages to generate tension and suspense without having to fall back on too many of the standard scary movie tricks. He tells a story that you might hear from a friend or a neighbor about someone they once knew and it's just spooky enough that you can almost believe it really happened. Koepp does completely blow it in one scene, however. It's in the later stages of the movie where the ghost is getting agitated with Tom and his family and there's a moment when Maggie is getting into the bathtub and the audience can see the ghost sitting on the edge of the tub. It's supposed to be a big, unnerving image. The problem is that Maggie is naked and she's the only thing you can focus on in the scene. We're meant to focus on how vulnerable she is to the ghost's machinations, but all you can notice is how sexy Kathryn Erbe is. It totally discombobulates the tenor and tone of the moment, though any scene where Erbe is unclothed can never be all that bad.The whole thing about Jake being able to see ghosts never develops into anything either. It services the Almighty Plot Hammer at a few different points but it never quite synchs up with what Tom and Maggie are going through or has any point on its own. This screenplay was also adapted from a book and there are a few points where things are briefly touched on or referenced that were probably much better developed in print. That's never too distracting, though.If you'd like to watch a ghost story that could happen in your neighborhood to your neighbors or maybe even to you&#x85;go rent Stir of Echoes. The naked Kathryn Erbe stuff is a little bonus. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"17 June 2010","score":"","review":" First of all Maribel Verdu is red hot in this movie. And I mean SMOKIN! That is enough reason to see it alone! If this isn't enough to entice you there is also a cleverly written, well directed, funny sexy and ultimately shocking story for you as well. Two best friends from rather different backgrounds see their girlfriends off to Italy for the summer and are basically lazing around, aimless, direction less and un motivated. Maribel Verdu's plays Luisa (the older woman) whose husband has just confessed to cheating on her so she takes the boys up on a whimsy offer of seeing a beautiful idyllic beach called 'heavens mouth' that really doesn't exist as they were simply chatting her up. However after directions from a stoner friend they set off for some lovely coastline and find out a lot about each other on the way both mentally and physically. Luisa sleeps with both boys and they each find out they cheated with each others girlfriends and both events cause a serious rift in their friendship. The trip ends with a threesome and a bit of embarrassment for the boys the next morning with both making swift exits. Luisa stays behind as she has finally found herself after a pretty dull life with her husband (or so we think!) What makes this movie stand out are the performances from the three leads. Maribel Verdu as I have said is stunning. She gives Luisa such dimension from being vulnerable, sad and reflective and to then be seductive and sexy as hell. Wow what a woman. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are best friends in real life I believe and it shows in their performance which is true and honest. The final scene for me was a real kick in the teeth. It is set a year later as the boys have drifted apart and bump into each other and decide to go for coffee. It turns out Luisa died of cancer just a month after the trip and knew all along she was ill. Tenoch (Luna) leaves and the narrator tells us they never meet again. It ends as Gael Garcia Bernals character sits and thinks for a while (about Luisa?) looks like he is going to cry then comes around and asks for the cheque. I've got to admit it was a sucker punch. The movie is littered with moments that upon finishing watching become important, the sense of death all around (the accident on the road at the beginning & the story of the deaths on the road 10 years before) of life fading away of history and how we all fit into our small time on earth. Luisa at the doctors taking the survey on if she thinks in terms of the present rather than the past or the future. Luisa telling her husband on the phone she met a 98 year old woman who remembered her whole life still and the stories she could tell, her non reply when a Mexican lady says she is natural with children and that she should have her own. This is one great movie.

It's like Clint himself saw the writing on the wall for the western, and composed a cinematic opus that would stand on its own, and which incorporated a number of themes and elements that would not have been allowed on screen during the heyday of the spaghetti westerns. Morgan Freeman's presence breaks ground in the movie, as he is not playing a cook or a servant or some other stereotypical role. Clintwood casts him as an equal, and as a past partner in crime, and the chemistry between the two is part of what makes the film work so well. Gene Hackman is sufficiently oily as Little Bill, the sadistic sheriff, and the late Richard Harris as English Bob gives us plenty of the foreign perspective on the goings-on in the wild west. I have wondered what might have happened if Clint had decided to cast Harris as Little Bill. It seemed plausible to me...but second guessing Eastwood at this point serves no useful purpose...the film went on to critical acclaim and commercial success...and it's one of the films that I would not just want to watch, but would also want as part of my collection. Two old style gunslingers go out on a final fling to collect reward money if and when they catch up to a bunch of yahoo cow-pokes who cut up a whore in a brothel.

The money he stands to make is a temptation he cannot afford to pass up, and he wants to give his kids a fresh start at something other than sod-farming. He changes his mind, recruits Morgan Freeman ( as Ned, his old running buddy from the gun-slinging days), and the situations and people they encounter on the journey are what fills the screen in this very engaging drama of the old west as it was fading.

This movie was his first attempt at the noir genre. In fact this seemed to be the template for 'The last seduction' as the theme is very similar. His inspiration is clearly evident in the plot itself. There is a feeling of 50s noir cinema in the movie. Every element from the detective to the cheating femme fa tale is present. Dahl writes and directs his own movies. He is obviously talented in the in the writing field, so this is what he should have continued doing. However in terms of direction the certain edge is lacking. As it became frequent to direct in television style, maybe his movie making career did not sustain. Though many scenes have clever camera angles and close up shots that enhance intrigue factor and suspense. But this becomes irrelevant as the movie progresses with a interesting moment to a next.As I stated the movie contains all the ingredients of the typical noir movie. The disloyal characters, double crosses and money are at the core of the plot. John Dahl has incorporated all these elements intelligently. Everybody who is a fan of noir cinema will immediately find this theme very familiar. It has been a routine concept in the 50s. The deceiving woman requiring assistance from the innocent man, however is later betrayed is noticeable territory. For many this movie will bring back memories of 'Body Heat' and 'Double Indemnity' to mind instantly. The plot is highly similar. The main character is the female character. Everything that happens revolves around her. Therefore this does not complicate the movie at any level. Those searching for a simple and short movie will be happy with this feature. One element which is devoid however is adultery. The theme is not existent at any point. But this does not mean that there would be no scope for intimate scenes.SPOILERS AHEAD The plot begins with the conning pair of Madsen and Whalley Kilmer who steal $875000 from the mob in the Nevada state. However Whalley Kilmer does not intended to keep acquaintance with Madsen for much longer and leaves for Vegas after leaving him unconscious in a restroom. She is aware that he will attempt to trace her down for the money so she has a plan. We are then introduced to Jack (Val Kilmer) who is a private detective who happens to be in dept to some bad guys and has a troubled past. Whalley Kilmer approaches him with a faking a death plan. He agrees in return for a good payment. They set the scenario up at a motel room. Upon leaving the scene Whalley Kilmer intentionally leaves a piece of paper with Jacks name on it. Later he is questioned by the authorities and given a cautionary warning. Meanwhile Madsen notices news of Whalley Kilmer's murder in the press and goes to Jacks office to find a lead. Jake later discovers that Whalley Kilmer has left him and headed to Reno. He locates her though the mob too are searching for the stolen cash and notice it at a casino. The pair hitch up again and flee from the hotel room after killing some of the mob's men. Madsen is hot on their tails after Jake's friend gives information on Jacks whereabouts. Who gets possession of the money forms most of the part of the climax. END OF SPOILERSThe unique point of the movie is obviously the plot. Dahl has written the script with maturity. It is totally flawless. However to this date I have never seen a movie with not one but two men attempting to hitching back on to a woman after being betrayed. This was one element in the movie that I was scratching my head over. Many moments in the movie seemed like a Jim Thompson novel. But what sets this movie apart the the typical noir ending is that the innocent man escapes. The movie contains many double crosses. This is actually the highlight of the plot and will raise eyebrows constantly. Secondly Micheal Madsen's performance. Unfortunately he does not get much scope. But when he appears on screen he steals the scene. Every scene is integral to the movie and there are no side tracks. Plot wise the movie is very reminiscent of 'Pink Cadillac' and 'The Getaway'. In fact one could say that this is a clever combination of both movies. Madsen played the same role in 'The Getaway' too. However Dahl has avoided plagiarism and has managed to think of his own ideas. Background music appears very old fashioned. But is suitable to the tone of the movie. It has been implemented at a minimum level, however only at important moments when required. Initially many viewers will misinterpret this for a Cohen brothers movie. The look and atmosphere is highly reminiscent of 'Blood Simple'. Maybe Dahl's career with noir movies would have continued but they were overshadowed by the Coen Brothers. Performance wise Jaoanne Whalley Kilmer gives a reasonable effort. Her facial expressions are on the mark. Val Kilmer disappoints with a look of uninterested.

The characters seemed a little flat, and most of the dialogue went over my head.I re-watched this movie (as the 2 disc Platinum edition) nearly 18 years later and my opinion has completely changed. The animation, sound and colours have been restored to their former glory to when it was first shown in 1959. The previous editions on VHS and re-issues in the cinema were of the aged, dirty film with a deteriorating soundtrack. I felt short-changed; my opinion of the film was affected by watching the less than pristine version.I think Sleeping Beauty as a whole appeals more to adults than children. The animation is top-notch and specifically styled to look like a medieval tapestry, and the dialogue is sophisticated and fluent. The plot a little more subtle than I remembered. Maleficent's soliloquy is bone-chillingly perfect. Her plan diabolical; she intends not to kill the Prince but to imprison him so after 100 years he will awaken his princess who has not aged (!) I can't imagine a crueler fate than to know that precious time afforded by love will be stolen from you. All too often Disney villains are painted with broad comical brush strokes and it is difficult to fear them. Here, Maleficent is truly evil; intent on destroying peoples' lives on just a whim; being snubbed at a party.This also the first time Disney gave the Prince a name. He is given subtleties never before afforded to his predecessors; warmth, humour, flirtatious and witty; Now, Father, this is the fourteenth century... There are dark segments to this film that may not be appropriate for the very young, the thrilling final battle with the dragon may be too scary. In my opinion, it is one of the best sequences of good vs evil that has never been topped for sheer adrenaline (except maybe the end of The Little Mermaid).True, there are problems with the film. The titular character has very little to do and little screen time. The cute animals don't sit well with the sharp, angular patterns of the backgrounds. The fairies dominate the story and perhaps more time should have been given to the interaction between Aurora and Philip.The use of Tchaikovsky's score gives the movie a timeless quality but also a more subdued feel than the rousing scores of other Disney movies e.g. Aladdin, that certainly didn't appeal to me as a child.So if you didn't like this movie initially, I urge you to watch it again in its restored format.

It was a cult classic that withstood the test of time and spoke to past and future generations about troubled youth. I also remember how James Dean was such an icon in pop culture, and I loved Blackboard Jungle, which came out about the same time, so I was hoping for a similar classic in Rebel Without a Cause. I prepared myself to be blown away.Unfortunately, all I saw was a slightly above average movie that was not so much about rebellion but a failure between teens and parents to communicate. In Rebel Without a Case, each of the main protagonists has pain in his\/her own family life, ranging from an abusive father,(the parent of Natalie Wood) a young teen (Sal Mineo) with no parents being raised by a housekeeper, and another teen who lives with an over-protective mother, and a hen-pecked apathetic father. (James Dean's parents.) The story involves Jim Stark (Dean) trying to fit in at school. A very difficult task as his family has constantly been moving from state to state because Jim can't seem to stay out of trouble. He quickly (almost too quickly) befriends several students at the school and also makes several enemies, all in a very short period of time.Jim quickly becomes provoked into a knife fight by another group leader while on a class field trip to a planetarium. He retains his cool for the most part, but is goaded into another dare by some bad apples to participate in a car race known as the Chickie Run. Each member of the group dares to risk death by speeding his car up to a cliff, stopping as close to the cliff as possible by jumping out. Whoever jumps last is Chicken. The rival member Buzz gets his jacket caught in the car door and can not jump out as the car topples over the cliff and Buzz is killed. The rest of the movie involves Jim and his friends debating if they should go to the police, as well as the fears and repercussions faced by Buzz's friends who are out looking for Jim because they believe he is responsible for Buzz's death.No one can talk to the parents so the group hides in an old abandoned mansion. Jim befriends, Plato, in an excellent performance by Sal Mineo who has a troubled past of his own. He was picked up by the police shooting puppies. (Thankfully not shown.) However, there is a certain empathy and sensitivity about Plato that makes him more empathetic as the movie goes on. Each of Jim's friends see the seriousness, lack of communication, and disconnection that their friends have with each one of their parents.There are some good moments of suspense, but Jim's parents especially Mr. Stark, payed by Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III from Gilligan's Island) display no solid acting qualities at all. It's almost like they were picked off the street, given a script to read for a week and just go through the motions. James Dean had the macho and charisma of a leading man actor who died in a horrible car accident before this movie was released. However, I think his Hollywood looks at the time were better than his acting. The talented Natalie Wood, as Dean's love interest has no time to develop because she jumps into his arms for support too fast. This quick timing renders their relationship to be unrealistic. Sal Mineo does the best acting job of the trio who shows the most believable actions and reactions to the movie's events and how they affect both his friends and him.The problem is that Rebel Without a Cause has an interesting premise, but a muddied superficial story that needs better character development for the viewer to empathize with these troubled teens. Instead of being blown away by what this movie was supposed to represent, I got, at best, a strong breeze.Rebel Without a Cause is a good movie for a one-time viewing. But for all-time classic repeated viewing status, it's just not there. Blackboard Jungle blows this movie away.
