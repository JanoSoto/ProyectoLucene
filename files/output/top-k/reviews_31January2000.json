Now let me stress the Usually in that sentence.  I went to see this film on opening night, it was a toss up between this and Down To You, i voted this because I like Ashley Judd a heck of a lot more then Freddie Prinze Jr, and it looked more interesting.  However let me tell you i wish that i had stuck with Down To You.  The performances in this film were not so hot, the story line was not nearly developed enough. (I am warning you now, this is revealed to you within the first few minutes of the film, but just for those of you who do not want to know, skip my next few sentences.)  For instance we(the viewers) had no clue as to why Ashley Judd had a fetish for killing people, all we were told was that she was abandoned as a child, on Christmas Day none the less.  But that did not explain why she felt the urge to harm others.  Then when Ewan McGregor's character shows up he has no past except for a wife and daughter who have gone AWOL.  However the daughter does show up at times(sort of).  It was not so clear as to why this Eye (McGregor) was even following Judd in the first place.  The only reason that i did not go back to the box office during the film and ask for my money back was in hopes that the film would somehow redeem itself and get better, however it did not. As i said before, thank God for the shoes, they along with Judd's ever-changing wardrobe were the only good things about this film, i loved her shoes. I also feel the need to tell whoever may happen to read this review that Jason Priestley (yup, the 90210 guy) was indeed in this film, and his parts were the only ones that provided me with any sort of amusement that i needed. So please, i beg of you to read this review and take my advice, go and see something else, perhaps The Cider House Rules, that was so much better then this.

It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?, I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The pointless conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The pointless dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.

However, this movie made my brief list of flicks I had to rewind before finishing because I was suffering too much.Narration is a dubious device in any movie; if the story can't be told by what you're seeing, write a book instead. The fact that the voice is Eleanor's (Julie Harris) only adds to the annoyance. This is one of the most unpleasant, whining, neurotic characters I've seen on film (Harris seems to excel in this sort of part). I found no interesting psychological quirks of character in her part to justify her sheer unpleasantness. Russ Tamblyn is miscast.The movie uses every haunted house cliche in the book; I found nothing remotely frightening about it. The plot device of Dr. Markham gathering these folks for a weekend in the house smacks of Hey kids! I know what! Let's make a movie about a haunted house!

It was very good and broke away from all the mediocre horror sequal that were the only exposure to the not-quite-as-serious genre of Horror to a new breed of teenagers.  Scream 2 was exactly what was right about the first, but exelled in a completely different direction.  *Spoiler* While I admit that the killers were strongly underdeveloped and just did not work very well.  Fortunately, Laurie Metcalf is such a skilled comedical actress that she was able to pull off a scene that Timothy Olyphant destroyed, although you can hardly blame Timothy for his lack of scenes.  Other than that, the movie was perfect.  Every scene was full of action, and each scene became increasingly better as the movie moved on.  The movie did not seem at any time too long.  After seeing the movie for the first time, I loved it.  I was not at all disappointed.  I was only worried that the new would wear off of Scream 2 and upon second viewing it would not live up to its first viewing.  It never did.  What I loved best about the movie was Gale's extended role, which fills in what Sidney's role takes away.  I thought the killing off of an original character was a brilliant move, and really shocked me upon first viewing.  What more, they made sure to do it near the begining of the movie, so that for the rest of the movie your were left to wonder if they'd kill one original character, would the kill another?  I thought this wonder was most evident during the scene in which Gale is trapped in the sound room, when any movie-goer was wondering if she would survive.  I, also, loved the scene when Sidney was trapped in the police car.  Several people have deconstructed the movie way too much.  It was definately more entertaining than the first.

The scenery is very beautiful, i must say, this i really enjoyed, nothing beats the 'sun and sea atmosphere'.It all comes down to plot.  Maybe because it's a real story based movie, maybe just a bad script write job, it's hard to say.  But my main complaint here, is that i knew what would happen after first 15 minutes of watching it.  Maybe not the exact detail, but the outline of the plot is perfectly clear.  It is done in the classic American tradition, setting - drama - resolution.

The two hours passed in a flash and I will watch it again and queue to buy the DVD when it's released. So it's a great film. But not flawless. I gave it 9 out of 10.I'm not sure if a young audience could relate to this movie since it deals with mature themes (relationships, happiness etc.). But as a middle aged man who works out and has recently taken up smoking, I certainly could. Just as well I never look at my daughter's friends when they visit. ;-) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 January 2000","score":"","review":"  American Beauty is not about one person (Lester Burnham) - it's about everyone. We're all represented in one of the main characters - Lester represents midlife, his wife (Carolyn) represents ambition, his daughter (Jane) represents youth and his neighbours (Ricky and Colonel Fitts) represent wisdom and repression respectively. It's typical of this film that the wise character is a teenage boy (Ricky) rather than a wise old man. It's certainly *not* about a mid-life crisis - that's simply a vehicle to get a few laughs.  Lester's condition is terminal - and not some short-term crisis.The acting is uniformly superb but it's the direction and cinematography that really shine. This film is visually stunning. If there's a weakness it's the storyline.
