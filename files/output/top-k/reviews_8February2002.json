It's artistically brilliant, it's beautifully acted and it's one of the most compelling films I've ever seen!  Todd Field really did an extraordinary job.  I wasn't even aware that he was a director.  I've seen him in movies like Twister and Eyes Wide Shut, but I don't ever recall him directing. Well, now I can applaud him for his talent in front of and behind the camera.The first act sets the tone.  We get a taste of this quiet, peaceful, straitlaced New England family.  We learn about the son's (Nick Stahl) relationship with older woman (Marisa Tomei).  And we learn about her ex-husband who continually returns to the house to see his kids and basically start trouble.  I won't give anything away from this point on.What made this film significant in my mind is the way it used silence as a tool in creating emotion.  There are long scenes that go without a word of dialogue, and I found them to be more effective because of the silence. I'm always been a firm believer that words mean virtually nothing, and you must read between the lines.  When you watch the scenes in which Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek don't say a word to each other, you feel the emotional tension.  Music is another tool that's been overused in contemporary films, and Field tries not to use music too much either to set the tone.  This is the kind of film that really allows the viewer to do some hard thinking, because it's very subtle in its delivery.As far as the acting goes  Oscars should go to the whole cast!  Tom Wilkinson is the best of the lot, and gives the best performance of his career.  He absolutely perfects the American accent.  I'm sure many people who've never seen him in any previous films probably believe he is an American actor.  Sissy Spacek is great in a quiet but intense role that no actress can pull off better.  Marisa Tomei deserves another Oscar statue to add to her collection.  And, I forgot his name, but the guy who played the ex-husband also deserves an Oscar.  He delivers such a creepy performance, and you get terrified at his presence.The film is long, but only occasionally drags.  In simple terms, In the Bedroom is an emotional powerhouse that any compassionate moviegoer should not miss!  Trust me, you will be blown away!My score  9 (out of 10)  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  In the Bedroom is nothing like many of the crap films I've seen in 2001.

The Extra Terrestrial is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone from anywhere. It is in fact not only a movie but a cultural phenomenon, a bigger than life even. This film is a remarkable triumph because not only is the story moving and entertaining throughout but the images crafted to move and tell the story are so artistically powerful and universally appealing. The movie is not so much a story about friendship and love between a boy and a homesick alien but a film about the boundary breaking human spirit of mankind. It's about Communication and doing what is right. The mind altering experience and life changing power of finally knowing of and interacting with life of a different kind. The movie goes WAY deeper for me as an individual. I don't feel that Spielberg should be blamed for anything. I think that any movie about a boy who develops a friendship with an alien lifeform stranded on Earth and bringing him into his home and sharing experience with that being would undoubtedly be a mega blockbuster the world around. Who wouldn't have thought that this movie would sure enough become gold.The film is very dark at times and has this somber mood the whole way through. Just looking at it sometimes puts a frown on my face because every scene is very expressive and moving in that way. The forrest is often a setting and very dark perhaps suggestive of nightmarish feelings that can be expected being away from ones home.

My father, now nearly 84, loves coming here, expresses his joy at being alive, having come through unspeakable horrors, and sees each year he stays fit and healthy as a gesture of defiance to those who were so eager to snuff out his existence more than six decades ago.In watching Josef wheel the pram in that final sequence past the ruins of his war-devastated home town, I could see his great joy to be alive, to have come through the horror which ultimately had one of his own countryman put a pistol to his head and tense his finger on the trigger. All the sacrifices he made, having to put at incredible risk the lives of himself and his wife, withstand the grossness of the Nazi toady Horst (Würst), submit to associating with the loathsome German occupying forces, and ultimately insist on his wife having sex with David, have yielded their great reward. He has his son, biologically David's son, but in all reality his. He has his marriage, and they all have a future which they will now carve out of the ruins. It is an incredibly hopeful ending.Reading some of the other comments on imdb, I feel a few missed the point, especially the Californian guy who thought it was German language film (it's Czech, mate!) and those who were troubled by the camera shakes. I could clearly feel that these were expressions of Josef's moments of utter panic, when time for him seemed to distort into flicker-frame slow-motion and he was clearly struggling hard just to retain control of speech and movement. At one point he says that he had shat himself. I think I'd have done the same, and my mental camera would certainly have shaken.Ten out of ten. If you haven't yet seen it, do!

When Bond jumped in the Q boat and pursued the killer at the beginning the action was just astonishing. There was also some good scenes when Bond was skiing with Elektra and the scene where Elektra had Bond in a torture machine reminded me of Goldfinger where Connery was strapped to a machine with a laser heading for his groin.The other good thing was the role of M once again played by Judi Dench. In this movie she didn't just give Bond his orders-she actually took part in the action and I commend the writers for including her in the action.However, this isn't what you'd call a spectacular Bond film. I like most of the Bond films but this is rather an average adventure much like On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Diamonds are Forever.One minor criticism I do have is the fact that the ending took place on a submarine. Both The Spy Who Loved Me and Tomorrow Never Dies took place on a submarine and it was a bit tiresome to watch it again.

Arnold Schwarzenneger's latest action vehicle, &#145;Collateral Damage' is a complete debacle and from its' conception should have been annulled. Arnold returns in what will prove not to be a comeback, but what proves to be one of his worst films. He plays a fireman who when sees trouble, easily glides into the situation. In typical fashion, he will always attempt at resolving it. He wants to be regarded as a nice guy, but will only be viewed as an underdeveloped character in a film plagued with flaws.  Whether it's men picking on women, children fighting, or a fire victim, he always manages to resolve the issue - even if it means biting someone's ear off. Yet after this film, he will have to worry about resolving his failing movie career after a string of bad films. This is his worst film yet and supersedes 'Last Action Hero' as the most mundane and wretched piece of film on his resume.      After this critical introduction, allow me to provide a brief overview of what is perhaps one of the most atrocious pieces of film ever. Slated to be released last September, the film was delayed due to the tragic events of 9\/11. Centered on the emotional subject of international terrorism, it bears uncanny resemblance to the events currently encompassing us in the world today. Cliff Curtis who has made a name for himself in such character roles in films as &#145;Three Kings' and &#145;The Majestic' demotes himself in this stereotypical character. As the leader of a terrorist group operating within Columbia, Claudio &#145;The Wolf' Perini plots to bomb important L.A. and Washington Government buildings; that is of course unless Arnold can stop him. Both of the United States' Government units cannot find this man, yet our unreluctant hero treads waters to Columbia to seek vengeance after &#145;The Wolf's' bomb kills off his family.      Arnold plays an all American fireman who loses his wife and son to the first of two plots to bomb the United States. The film opens up with the compulsory subject in action sequence where our subject (Gordon Brewer, played by Arnold Schwarzenneger) the great fireman; displays his skills in a useless and irrelevant scene. The film then cuts to Arnie spending time with his family before seeing them killed right in front of him. Unsatisfied with the progress the C.I.A. and F.B.I. are currently at, he does what no one deemed could be done. He crosses over to Columbia to track the killer down in a near impossible and all too-convenient scenario to track one of America's most wanted criminals. While the film may contain a shred of emotionalism due to current events surrounding us; Arnold quickly vanquishes those with flat &#145;one-liners', ridiculously over the top sequences and a poorly filmed adventure piece that will leave even the most faithful Arnold fan disappointed.      Andrew Davis directs the film and Warner Bros. makes no secret of plastering this all over the ads for the film. Yet the director that brought us &#145;The Fugitive', &#145;Under Siege' and who is currently working on &#145;Under Siege 3' does not capture the excitement contained within any one of those films. The film is a poor attempt at a comeback and relies on a formulaic approach in an attempt to win audiences over which in fact turns us away.     The first example is the comic relief in the film; we as the audience do not have the pleasure of seeing one useless character, but two characters. John Turturro is miscast as a raunchy Canadian who enjoys cheap sex and John Leguizamo is a drug dealer with aspirations of becoming a rap star. Does all this seem irrelevant? That is because it is. These characters appear and then disappear like a bad David Copperfield trick.      The film wants to be taken seriously but fails on every level. It just isn't fresh seeing Schwarnegger pitted against villains who we know he will prevail against. Even Arnie seems tired at replicating the same character only in different circumstances film after film. You can actually see the boredom on this man's face.       The film sets itself primarily in an uninteresting setting such as Columbia where Director Davis makes every effort not to show the beauty of the land but the violence and war that plagues it. The film seems to get itself moving at about the 1-hour and 15 mark when the film migrates to Washington where the second and final bomb is being planned to detonate. Yet, even with the films' &#145;I-see-it-coming-a-mile-away' twist at the end; it cannot redeem itself from a truly unsatisfying cinematic waste of celluloid.        How can it be taken as an action film when it contains no elaborate action set pieces, a horrible climax and absolutely no cohesiveness?  Arnold is made out to be a &#145;one-liner spewing' comic antagonist that cannot be taken seriously. Even though he does most of the damage manually, and does not carry a gun and goes off on a firing rampage, the film cannot mask that it wants to make Arnie seem intellectual in his doings, but unfortunately nothing about this film seems intellectual. This film will do more damage to Arnie's recovery as a veritable action hero than it will at the box office.

Anybody who considers Lord of the Rings to be a disappointing, or bad movie.Reasons to go see LOTR1. Unlike movies where you've only been waiting for the doomed character to just die already, such as Titanic, or Autumn in New York, you'll find yourself with tears in your eyes as Boromir gallantly keeps fighting until the third arrow finally strikes him. You'll share the tear that Aragorn shamelessly allows to fall down his face. Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen perform with real emotion, just like the rest of the characters in the duration of the entire film.2. Terror that will leave your adrenalin pumping more than in any horror movie you've ever seen. The chilling ring wraiths conjure up fear in every deadly whisper, ominous footstep, and terrifying shriek. My face still tingles everytime I watch the ring wraiths' chases and fight sequences, even though I already know the outcome.3. Breathtaking visual effects and graphics that would've made Tolkien proud. Rivendell is a flawless, perfect paradise of flowing waterfalls and awe inspiring mountain views. The battle of the orcs and the meeting of the Balrog will fool your senses, making everything seem real as the person sitting beside you in the theater.4. Brilliantly adapted screenplay, based on the masterpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien, who outclasses and definitely is a far better writer than J.K. Rowling anyday. Diehard Tolkien fans will definitely be pleased with the movie, as well as others who haven't been associated with Middle Earth.5. Talented acting from every character. Gandalf's performance is definitely Oscar worthy, as Sir Ian McKellen disappears as he performs on the big screen and comes out as Gandalf the Grey. (Gandalf can kick Dumbledore's ass anyday) Viggo Mortensen gives a powerful interpretation of Aragorn or Stryder, a sword fighting true Lord of Gondor. Sean Bean plays a true hero to cheer for. Elijah Woods as Frodo (the better alternative to Harry Potter), Ian Holms as Bilbo, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Sean Astin as Samwise, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Billy Boyd as Saruman, and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, all deserve standing ovations for their heartfelt, noteworthy performances. Orlando Bloom especially, does a terrific portrayal of my favorite character, Legolas Greenleaf, and is a talented actor that will make his impact on Hollywood.6. Edge-of-the-seat plot and action, the three hours seems far too short as movie takes you straight into Tolkien's world. This movie will never get boring, no matter how many times you watch it.7. Howard Shore's score delivers fullness, richness, sorrow, and excitement on top of an already outstanding movie. You'll be buying the soundtrack before you know it.8.

No longer was Bond working for the British government, he was operating on his own on a mission of personal vengeance. The villains were refreshing and realistic and the action scenes were truly great.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) This Bond film had the perfect ingredients. I thought it was really interesting the way Bond had his licence revoked and became a wild card operating on his own. This was a brave move by the writers. Also, Carey Lowell made a great Bond girl. She was beautiful and intelligent and equal to 007 in my opinion. The other great thing about this movie was the extended appearance of Q (God rest Desmond Llewelyns soul) who didn't simply give 007 a load of fancy gadgets but actually helped him out on the mission.Robert Davi (a fine actor) made a good villain. He was interesting and so different-he wasn't interested in world domination or anything like that. He was a drug dealer who stepped on anyone who crossed him.(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) The ending scenes were the best ever done in a Bond film. I was flabbergasted when 007 did a wheelie in the truck and turned a huge lorry over onto it's side. The special effects department deserve huge credit for this.Some people criticize this film saying Bond would never disobey orders from M to pursue personal vendettas. I believe he would in this film. Felix Leiter was one of his best friends and his wife was killed on his wedding day (like Bonds wife was on his wedding day). This would have sent Bond over the edge particularly when the American authorities refused to do anything about itThis truly is an underrated classic and it is so sad to think that Timothy Dalton only did two Bond movies.I do have two very minor criticisms about this movie (SPOILERS AHEAD). Firstly, at the end Felix Leiter seems too happy considering his wifes been killed and his leg is gone. I find it astonishing when he discusses going fishing with Bond when he comes out of hospital. Wouldn't he rather spend the time mourning the loss of his wife? Secondly, it's amazing that Bond gets his job and licence back considering he broke every rule in the book. But I'm not complaining too much-if he hadn't have got his job back we wouldn't be watching his adventures now would we.That's all I've got to say except that it would be really nice if Timothy Dalton came back as Bond one more time (like Sean Connery did in 1983 with Never say Never Again).

Why write a review only to say I don't understand it. Therefore don't waste your time seeing it. These people are completely uninformed and apparently unable to absorb what they see, having never read or seen tragedy (or good filmmaking).There are bad movies and stupid, pointless movies - oh, such as the teen genre - all of it - which has destroyed young peoples' ability to know good story telling by focusing on taboos and cheap laughs or gratuitous violence - but this is not one of those movies. Why is it considered a failure then? Because you have to watch it and pay attention to the story unfolding. Those who wrote that there was no story, I suppose they went out to buy popcorn and missed some key scenes. The whole story is there and it is clear. It is an ugly story, child murder, but the focus is on the retired cop, Jack Nicholson, who is determined to find the killer. It is good versus evil, the oldest plot in the world, one which is never boring. There is evil in the world; there are people who do evil and then people who try to find justice.First of all anything Jack Nicholson is in is worth your while as he is one of the greatest actors on the screen. He becomes the character. So those comments about what a stupid movie this is are way off base; even if it was pure trash, he would have made it worth while. But the movie is clearly not trash. I would totally compare it to The Swimmer with Burt Lancaster, in mood. But in this case the character is not living in his own dream world - he is right and everyone else is wrong - it is about bureaucracies and assumptions - which we are all faced with sometimes - knowing you are right but the authorities are too blind and dimwitted to admit it. A man who knows he is right and goes down to defeat and yet good still triumphs in spite of the personal tragedy to him. This is the classic storyline of all time and therefore quite like Hitchcock, but why was this movie rejected? I absolutely cringe when true trash becomes big box office and gems like this are brushed aside.And for all those who didn't understand what was happening, the writer from Germany gave the entire explanation in his post. I could not believe someone could see the movie and not be mesmerized by the horror of the story unfolding. This man dedicated himself to finding the killer, who clearly existed, but no one else believed him. We the audience are shown that he is right, but the movie does not show the killer until the end, and we are left knowing that the retired cop was right and everyone else was wrong, his life is destroyed, and yet it doesn't change that justice was indeed done even if it was by the Grim Reaper and even if no one else knew.This is chilling and this is important. I really wish ignorant viewers would not bother posting I don't understand this movie. Next time why not watch it again before jumping on line and typing in some drivel - or read several other reviews and make an attempt to pay more attention when watching cinema.

The Way of the gun is a basic action movie, bit more intelligent than some of them but that's just about it. Still, if you're a fan of Benicio Del Toro this is definitely a movie for you.
