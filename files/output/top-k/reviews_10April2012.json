Of course, that wasn't the case but marketing it this way lured people to go see it, including me. Never have I seen such a film so original, that engaged me, and made me believe that what I was seeing was true since Cannibal Holocaust. It is set in 1994 when a group of three student filmmakers were filming a documentary on a legendary witch known as Blair in Burkittsville, Maryland. As they go deeper into the woods they get lost and every night they hear strange sounds coming from the woods but they can't make what it is or where it comes from. As the days go by, they succumb in desperation as they can't find a way out of the dense woods. But even more horrifying is that someone or something is hunting them.After leaving the theater back in 1999, this movie would just not leave my mind for days. The acting was unbelievable, even more coming from unknown threesome of actors. It was shot in a first person point of view with the actors being the ones holding the camera giving it a new sense of realism, now this wasn't absolutely new style of filming. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed the same way but it hasn't been done in a long time. Also you never see what is hunting them; the movie forces the viewers to use their imagination and to fill in the gabs. Nowadays many movies try to copy the filming style of The Blair Witch but fall short. But what was even more amazing is that this little independent film, with a budget of nearly $30,000, earned over 240 million dollars at the box office. That is something you don't see every day.This film don't have the eye candy and gore other horror films have or elaborate setting or big names, it is simple, creative and extremely effective and I would dare say it is up there with films such as The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. This film is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema and I strongly recommended it.

That has been done many times over by many others. Instead, I am going to review what it's like watching this film in the year 2012. Over 30 years after it's initial release. I'm doing so because my memory of originally watching was greatly altered with time, and yours may be too.At the time of it's release I thought it was pretty good, if slow. I thought the new Enterprise looked fantastic, and the effects with the Cloud the team is investigating were beautiful and stunning. The story was average, devoid of much suspense or conflict. In this aspect it was blown away by Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan. But it was an okay movie.Watching TMP again, in the year 2012, on a nice HD television, reveals many flaws. First, the effects are nothing special, at times the cloud is interesting, but much of the time only because the design of it is somewhat innovative. Instead the effects look somewhat soft, even bland. The scenes of it, and the Enterprise go on forever. I'm sure when they made the film, and I first saw it, this was hypnotic to watch, to see something so new and special. But it's shine has long ago worn off with time. Some of the effects shots are almost laughable. They look very old. I tried my best to keep in context when the film was made, but even with that in mind it was at times hard to watch. There are other flaws as well, such as the tactical display of the cloud looks nothing like what they show you in space. It creates confusion. There are also other scenes that seem like interludes to show you effects and they drag. All of these things made the film difficult to watch.However, if you are a ST fan, and can accept that and somehow get past it, how is the film? I still believe quite average. A lot of ST fans dislike this film and Star Trek V, but others think people missed the point. Having recently seen ST5 I now get that one, and think it's message is reflective of many episodes from the original series. It too is flawed, but I like it's idea, and it has a classic ST antagonist. But TMP doesn't have this. It's mostly just about re-discovering the characters, which was too subtle and took too long, and investigating the cloud.

The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant X gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a Brotherhood of Mutants with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - X-Men (2000), X2 X-Men United (2003) and X-Men The Last Stand (2006).X-Men naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brother\/little sister type relationship.

I was 11 years old when the movie first released and I still remember the first time I went to watch it. I barely had any knowledge about movies back then, but the sheer grandeur and brilliance of this movie made me watch it a billion times over and over!! (Twice in the last five days in 3D!!)After working on action classics like The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and True Lies, James Cameron comes up with one of the best romantic, epic movies of all times. The way he adds fiction to the true story is absolutely brilliant. The script is too long, dialogues a little cheesy, screenplay a tad slow, but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie. Bottom line, I'm no one to talk about this man.Twenty-two year old Kate Winslet looks gorgeous as Rose DeWitt Bukate, and plays her role to perfection. Her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that I have goosebumps even now thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as Jack Dawson is one of his best works to date. The chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see on-screen. The rest of the cast, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and every other actor, is excellent.

She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a problem, as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed. So, any day, any time, any season, seek this one out for you and all those you love.

The only version currently available is the bare bones of said film, which is comprised of jumps from narrative sequence to narrative sequence, allowing little time for the audience to take stock of what is going on and with no respect for Thornton's artistic vision.I saw one reviewer said that this film 'takes us nowhere'. Obviously this is not strictly true, but I can understand what he is trying to get at. The fact that half the running time has been brutally slashed means that we can no longer be immersed in the wonders or brutal realities of the environments that our characters find themselves - such aspects being key to the novels of Cormac McCarthy, on whose fantastic work this film is based.Having read the book, I was thus still able to enjoy the film as I knew the characters and knew what was going on. It would be interesting to watch it again without knowledge of the novel. Yes, Damon and Cruz's relationship lacked a certain spark, but surely their chemistry would have been allowed more time to build up in Thornton's original cut? I still found their relationship to be just fine, although I wasn't exactly struck down with emotion in the moments when perhaps I should be. But the actors seem to have taken a lot of stick for these performances, which is incredibly harsh, on Damon especially.Damon does the little things so well, adjusting his eyes and body language or flashing a tiny smile at the perfect moments. Why some viewers are so intent on bashing him is beyond me... his performance here is realistic and down to earth, just like the character that he inhabits.In terms of filmmaking the cinematography is beautiful in parts, yet the inclusion of stunning vistas seems obligatory and rushed. We are allowed no time to dwell on these environments and, interspersed with the narrative sequences, the film runs like a checklist (even more noticeable if you have read the book). All the right boxes are ticked, but this movie could be so much more enjoyable if taken out of the hands of studio Nazis and allowed its freedom.

You can't imagine the effect this beautiful melody has on me &#x85; making me wish to go 'back' to 1967, 15 years before I was even born. 1967 If one actor ever exemplifies the groundbreaking aspect of this year, it certainly is Sidney Poitier, by starring in three films that paved the way for a new depiction of African- American people Guess Who's Coming for Dinner, Best Picture nominee and In the Heat of the Night, Best Picture Winner; and if not in the same vein, To Sir, With Love conveys the same kind of inspirational message through the struggle of a man facing alone a hostile group and ultimately defeating intolerance and prejudices. I will never say that Sidney Poitier plays the 'same character' as a reproach but as a tribute to his talent and his brilliance for never having fallen in the trap of stereotypes, to play elegant, distinguished and soft-spoken middle-aged men. He might not be the most versatile actor in the world, but like such stars as Humphrey Bogart or James Stewart, he's perfect within his personal range. So, after playing a doctor and a police officer, two noble professions to say the least, it's almost natural that Poitier embodies the noblest and most idealistic of all the vocations in To Sir, With Love as Mark Thackeray, a teacher and engineer-trainee affected in a high school located in the slums of London's East End, facing a classroom of white students whose racism can be forgiven in the name of ignorance and because it's obviously a wall that can be broken with some efforts. It's up to Thackeray to educate them before their entrance in the adult world. As I said, Thackeray reminds so much of the characters Poitier played in 1967 that the film can be regarded as the third of an unofficial trilogy, whose only theme would be the eye- opening experience of a black man, victim of prejudices, and the ultimate triumph of tolerance and human spirit. I'm not a fan of 'big words' but put in their context, these films were not only significant but necessary to educate some viewers, and it's quite fitting that Poitier incarnates here, a teacher.Before To Sir, With Love, only two movies impacted the spirits about the value of an exceptional teacher, Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Blackboard Jungle, starring Poitier too as a good-hearted hoodlum, there where other films of course but To Sir, With Love can still be regarded as a pioneer on the subject even more interesting because it was made in 1967, a year where the baby-boom generation stood up against the establishment and the system, holding the red, the green or the rainbow flag. But what struck me in To Sir, With Love is that the film avoids these clichés and portrays a group of kid who're too practical to be just rebels without a cause. Ultimately, they are not kids learning about discipline, but about life, sex, marriage, employment, being a man and being a woman. Thackeray can appear as old- fashioned but he addresses a youth that can respond to his lessons, especially because he reflects the very attitudes and behavior he 'preaches' to his students. There's no room for clichés in To Sir, With Love, it's not the chronicles about rebellion as a sickness that can be cured by education, only the journey of a teacher who'll reconcile a bunch of misfits with society. Of course, Thackeray's struggles will earn him the hostility of some elements, but inculcating trust, understanding and communication is a process that demand patience, and a moral strength to overcome the most difficult obstacles with calm and empathy. The key is respect, politeness, a capability for admitting faults or reacting in extreme situations. Three pivotal moments will punctuate Thackeray's journey, the culminating incident where he'll finally understand what matters the most for these kids is less theory and more practicality, a visit in the museum, and the ultimate confrontation with one of them. From all these situations, Thackeray will turn out to be one hell of a teacher, too perfect to be believable if Sidney Poitier didn't play him. Despite some obvious subplots, like the cute girl having a crush on him or some clumsy displays of racism by a colleague, the film keeps a certain complexity in Poitier's character, who disorients his own students. You're like us, and not like us, says one of them, which is probably the greatest compliment a teacher could receive, above the students enough to teach them but not too much, so he also can understand them. And through his experience, even Thackeray learns one thing or two about teaching, and about his very purpose in life. And I wouldn't be surprised to know that To Sir, With Love encouraged many vocations. Now, the film is not perfect, some details like the students wearing the same clothes every day betray its low budget, but I was in fact touched by the film's modesty and I guess the film was counting on the emotional pay-off of the ending that redeemed all these little things that didn't work, and I reckon the sight of Poitier almost bursting to tears after hearing one of the most beautiful cinematic farewell songs cut straight to my heart.Indeed, To Sir, With Love is also this beautiful melody that carries all the positive aspects of the film, and I will never believe how this never got nominated to the Oscar for Best Original Song (Talk like an Animal? Give me a break), another mystery like Poitier not having an Oscar nomination in 1967 (although it was a strong line-up that year)&#x85; doesn't matter, To Sir, With Love is a beautiful film, carried by a superb performance from one of the last living icons.

You're like us, and not like us, says one of them, which is probably the greatest compliment a teacher could receive, above the students enough to teach them but not too much, so he also can understand them. And through his experience, even Thackeray learns one thing or two about teaching, and about his very purpose in life. And I wouldn't be surprised to know that To Sir, With Love encouraged many vocations. Now, the film is not perfect, some details like the students wearing the same clothes every day betray its low budget, but I was in fact touched by the film's modesty and I guess the film was counting on the emotional pay-off of the ending that redeemed all these little things that didn't work, and I reckon the sight of Poitier almost bursting to tears after hearing one of the most beautiful cinematic farewell songs cut straight to my heart.Indeed, To Sir, With Love is also this beautiful melody that carries all the positive aspects of the film, and I will never believe how this never got nominated to the Oscar for Best Original Song (Talk like an Animal? Give me a break), another mystery like Poitier not having an Oscar nomination in 1967 (although it was a strong line-up that year)&#x85; doesn't matter, To Sir, With Love is a beautiful film, carried by a superb performance from one of the last living icons.

It is a favourite movie of mine, hearkening back to those years when I was a relatively young, unspoilt kid. who had no idea what the 'Big Bad World' was like( I was an 11 year old boy when 'Titanic' was released on 'March 1998' here in India). I had went to see Titanic being impressed by the huge ship, the story . My father had booked tickets at Globe Cinema Hall(Esplanade Kolkata- now closed)a week beforehand. But my mother, learning about certain scenes , persuaded my father to return the tickets. But as desperate I was back then to see the film,I had quietly removed the tickets from his Office- Bag and hid it. When He learned of it, instead of scolding me, he decided to keep the tickets. I remember feeling extremely awkward during the painting and the car scene, trying to hide my eyes, and still daring to peer through my fingers. But Titanic moved me, totally. It was a wonderful Romantic film, and the power of love and the inevitable tragedy had brought tears to my 11 year old self back then. And oh, the music! I remember when the movie had finished and the credits started rolling with the famous song, everyone was exiting the theatre. I was stuck there , with tears frozen in my cheeks, unable to move, unwilling to leave. I felt so lost so saddened. The tag line really hit home for me-  Nothing on Earth could come between them Some of my friends have found the movie to be nothing more than a disaster picture, some have found it to be a moving love story that is universal. Watching the 3D version was reliving those memories! It wasn't as affecting as it was back in '98 but it was surely nostalgic. The 3D post-conversion was brilliant, I mean really good, But I imagine it to look no less better in its original 2D version. Though the 3D was never distracting, it felt almost as good as that of 'Avatar'.Depth was stunning! And the newly 4K restored print sparkled with fine details. But now my BIG complaint- (SPOILER AHEAD) - The nude-sketching scene of Rose, was unjustly, and badly censored. any instances of Kate Winslets Breast or lower torso was removed, zoomed-in, pan-scanned. Even the kiss, after Rose says thank you and takes the painting was cut. It totally put me off. I lost my interest in watching the movie. They raped the artistic integrity of the movie, right there! It was such a beautiful and sweet scene. I read reports that the censor board of India passed the film uncut, hence I was shocked to see such abominable censoring. But then this is not just India, this is a part of India- The state of West Bengal, and anything can happen here.Is a Woman's body still an object of shame??? Well I don't know if the particular Cinema owners did that or not, which I doubt, but still this is by all accounts unacceptable. I guess most of you living outside India( at least in the US, UK, Aus, Eu) are lucky enough to see the movie in an Un-Raped form. However in spite of all this the charm of the movie remains undeniable, even after fourteen years('98 release in India).I watched it on 10th April, 2012, exactly a hundred years after the ship sailed from Southampton (April 10th, 1912). And intend on catching it once again on the 15th a hundred years after it sank(April 15th, 1912). May all the souls who perished on the night find peace, and all those whose lives were changed forever after the disaster. And RIP Gloria Stuart !

It's not a slasher movie. There's only one scene that has any blood in it, and that appears during an operation. Rather it seems like a drama with scientific overtones.A cosmetic surgeon (Brasseur) has turned his daughter's face into hamburger in the course of an auto accident. With the help of his aide (Valli), he begins to kidnap beautiful young women, lift their faces off in his secret operating room, then dumps the dead body that's left over. He identifies one of the cadavers as that of his daughter, so she's considered dead and gone. Once he gives her a new face he can supply her with a new identity and she can begin life over again.The daughter (Scob), who has retained her own eyes, is meanwhile suffering from moral scruples. She submits to the transplants, which have all failed, but she wants only to die and be rid of this burden.Now, for most of the film, Scob wears a mask that resembles closely the face of the actress underneath, and it's not bad. It's not the mask of a gargoyle. It's the mask of an attractive, delicate, and intelligent woman. And, okay, granted a rubber mask isn't likely to be very expressive one way or the other, but frankly the rest of her doesn't look in the least bit damaged.The cops and another doctor might be a little unsettled by the goings on but everything looks sufficiently kosher that they don't pursue the matter, so they play a very little part in the story. It's not about the police.The ending is superb. The desperate Scob kills Valli and sets a horde of experimental dogs loose on her father, whom they tear apart. Then, still wearing her mask and a flowing gown, she released the cage of experimental birds and drifts out into the darkened garden with doves fluttering around her, one perched on her arm, an ethereal figure in the shadows. Free at last, I guess. It's a poetic image.If it's a horror film, it's a horror film for grown ups, not kids. The kids might enjoy it if it were in gaudy color, if there were blood spatters all over the walls and draining down the scuppers of the operating room, and if the doctor's head were bald and had a thousand pins sticking out of it, and if we got to see that original accident, which would have to climax in an exploding fireball.

In an odd fourth-wall smashing fashion, Starr (Brooke Shields, The Blue Lagoon) refuses to be drawn by Randall and quits. Randall, in some unexplainable way (one of the film's problems), goes into the strip to convince Starr to return before the deadline. She's busy, though, with tracking down a scientist in Puerto Rico and Brazil. Seems the egghead has invented a unique rocket fuel that has attracted both a bumbling band of Russian spies (What? No Nazis?) and Starr's rival newshound, Libby Lips Lipscomb (Diana Scarwid of Mommie Dearest).Intrigued? If not, congratulations. You have better sense than me, who saw the film for free and still wants the 94 minutes of my life back! The. . .film tries to be cute and campy so much, it descends.Directed ineptly by Robert Ellis Miller, who used an obviously first draft script by James David Buchanan, Noreen Stone & Jenny Wolkind (a pseudonym for Delia Ephron, Nora's sister), Starr dims to black than shines, from start to end, especially from the start. After the women's liberation movement, the novelty of a female reporter seems dated, and those who know and enjoyed Brenda Starr are either dead or collecting Social Security.

The fact she goes through silly, implausible costume changes (I didn't bother to count how many. Sorry, Bob Mackie!) did next to nothing to help her in a flat, cardboard role.

At least poor Ms. Scarwid shares the sentiment of any unfortunate viewer when referring to Starr Oh! I wish I could kill her! Interestingly, the film was shelved to distribution disputes before premiering in 1986. Three years later, it bowed in France, where Shields was popular. Another three years, it came back here and bombed, without much publicity and wallowing in the shadows of better comic book\/strip adaptations.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"10 April 2012","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" What the hell were the people behind Brenda Starr thinking (or were they even thinking to being with) when they made this&#x85;film based on the long-running, now-defunct newspaper comic strip by the late Dale Messick? Sure, comic strips, let alone comic books, weren't treated seriously then (Hollywood still had the Man of Steel on their brains), but if you make a film based on a fictional, antiquated female reporter (thanks, Gloria Steinhem), you have an embarrassing cine-wreck.In the supposed real world, comic strip artist Mike Randall (Tony Peck, son of the Oscar-winning legend Gregory) toils on the Brenda Starr strip for Messick. In an odd fourth-wall smashing fashion, Starr (Brooke Shields, The Blue Lagoon) refuses to be drawn by Randall and quits. Randall, in some unexplainable way (one of the film's problems), goes into the strip to convince Starr to return before the deadline. She's busy, though, with tracking down a scientist in Puerto Rico and Brazil. Seems the egghead has invented a unique rocket fuel that has attracted both a bumbling band of Russian spies (What? No Nazis?) and Starr's rival newshound, Libby Lips Lipscomb (Diana Scarwid of Mommie Dearest).Intrigued? If not, congratulations. You have better sense than me, who saw the film for free and still wants the 94 minutes of my life back! The. . .film tries to be cute and campy so much, it descends.Directed ineptly by Robert Ellis Miller, who used an obviously first draft script by James David Buchanan, Noreen Stone & Jenny Wolkind (a pseudonym for Delia Ephron, Nora's sister), Starr dims to black than shines, from start to end, especially from the start. After the women's liberation movement, the novelty of a female reporter seems dated, and those who know and enjoyed Brenda Starr are either dead or collecting Social Security. Who the hell is supposed to watch this film, let alone enjoy it? Casting then-hot fashion model Shields as the title role was a bad attempt to get young audiences. The fact she goes through silly, implausible costume changes (I didn't bother to count how many. Sorry, Bob Mackie!) did next to nothing to help her in a flat, cardboard role. It's not one of her best moments. Doe-eyed Peck's no help, awkwardly being both comic relief and potential love interest. When he tries to make Starr utter a foul profane word, instead of jeepers, it comes off a fact to the film's datedness. Also of no real use, aside of being beefcake with a eye-patch, is the dashing, mysterious Basil St. John (a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton) who captures Starr's heart. At least poor Ms. Scarwid shares the sentiment of any unfortunate viewer when referring to Starr Oh! I wish I could kill her!

I had just moved to England in 1995 and had gone from being a 20 minute drive to a small multiplex chain cinema, to being a 5 minute walk away from the Light House independent cinema in Wolverhampton. Not only was it close but it was cheap and I would regularly go there to see films big and small. I was lucky because this rough period was throwing up things like Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction and many other really strong films. Fresh was one of these and I remembered thinking it was great but, not having seen it since, I wasn't sure if maybe the period in my life was also giving it a rose-tinted memory in my head.I watched it again last night and did so as a different person &#x96; 35 instead of 18, living comfortably instead of a struggling student; regardless of time and place though, the film still gripped me from start to finish and justifies my memory of it being an excellent film. The plot starts out as a ghetto film that fits into the genre of the early 90's (Menace II Society, Boyz n the Hood etc) but then in the middle it becomes much more of a thriller where young Fresh tries to turn the table on his dealing employers in revenge for the murder of one of his friends. Both parts of the film work equally well and merge into each other seamlessly. Just like the construction of the city environment in the opening titles, the film builds on the details and at times the viewer will be a few steps behind Fresh in terms of his plan. It is a dangerous game and there are quite brutal moments in it, but these just help up the tension, of which there is lots.Yakin directs really well throughout the film and is aided by excellent cinematography, capturing a sense of place really well. The patient orchestral score also fits with this and the slower pace that it can at times have, however all of these qualities (however good they are) tend to get lost in the background of the praise because front and centre is a terrific performance from a very young Sean Nelson. He is the heart of the film and the ability to deliver his character is key &#x96; and he nails it. Fresh isn't on a moral quest for what is right, he is very much on a personal mission and he does it by playing cynically with those around him, making sacrifices of both himself and of them. It is a great performance throughout and it is hard to imagine anyone else but him in that role &#x96; perfect bit of casting. That he stands up on his own with such a strong support cast is also impressive. Esposito is great despite hamming up his accent and his abs a little bit &#x96; amusing to watch this character back through the filter of Breaking Bad as well! Jackson was pushing to the front on the DVD cover due to Pulp Fiction's success, but he is only in a small role, albeit a good one. Beyond them La Marre, Brice, Wright and others are also good.Almost twenty years old, Fresh is an excellent film that is well made across the board as both a hood movie and a thriller &#x96; my memory was not faded, this is a great film.
