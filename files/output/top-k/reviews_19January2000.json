I think that many wanted to prove that they were above Star Wars fever, and that they could look at the new picture with a critical eye.  This led to my second point.- I think that many critics were guilty focusing on and being overly critical when it came to otherwise insignificant things.  It seems as if many forgot that to see the movie as a whole.  For example, some focused in on Jar Jar Binks.  Sure the Gungan is rather silly and reminds you somewhat of the Ewoks, but if you're not focusing in on him, it takes nothing away from the film.-The third reason I thought Menace received its bad reviews was that many adults expected the movie to capture the same feeling that the original Star Wars did for them  back when they were ten years old.  Well unfortunately, one looks slightly different at movies as they get older.  People went into the theatre looking for the same thing they got as a kid, and the whole time they should have been looking for something new.  Even though Menace is part of a series, it is and individual movie with its own individual traits.-The fourth reason that I believe that we see so many bad reviews and\/or votes on the IMDB is because of the bandwagon.  I sure many here have thought, Hey, the critics panned the movie, and I sure don't want to look like I'm unsophisticated\/ignorant\/an idiot or so on and so forth.  I better say I didn't like it.  Unfortunately, many people here feel that they are in an elite group of movie buffs that can only like what the mass public hasn't seen or slam what the mass public likes.Now let me talk about why the Phantom Menace was great.-First and most importanatly, it was easily the most or one of the most visually stunning movies ever made.  After I finished the movie the first time, I felt like I had missed a lot going on on the screen.  So much time and effort was spent giving detail to things outside the main subject area that it is almost impossible to rest your eyes on a single person\/alien\/starship for much time. Have you ever seen a place as beautiful as Naboo, anywhere?-Secondly, the casting was very good.  Critics said that as Qui-Gon Jinn Liam Neeson was dull.  He is a Jedi people!!!  They are trained not to get emotional.  Until A New Hope, did Darth ever get emotional, he never even lost his temper.  What about Yoda?  I promise, if he was human, critics would call him boring too.  I think that they just like him because he is a little green guy who speaks funny.  Another casting triumph was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala and Padme Naberrie.  She brought the elegance and beauty to the screenthat the part needed.-Third reason I liked this movie was the lightsaber fight.  Beautiful choreography and brilliant presentation.  I have never seen a fight this fast or this dazzeling.-Lastly, the set-up.  Man!  I can't wait for the next movie.This is a great movie that I feel was never given a cahnce by everbody. So if you have never seen it and if you don't cross it off the list before you do, I promise that you will find The Phantom Menace as spectacular as I did.

Confined to a wheelchair at home with his leg in a cast, the photographer seems to be incredibly lonely, a photographer who seems to have lost some of his humane instincts by not allowing mostly decent people to have their privacy. We see through his eyes what he believes to be a murder, but what we don't see is all the rest of what happened as his suspicions all come exclusively from his point of view.This was one of the best Hitchcock films ever made, and is second only to North by Northwest. The Hitch managed to assemble top talent for his movies, beginning with Rope for Jimmy. Rear Window was Jimmy's personal favourite of the Hitchcock movies. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Freemont, the rich, beautiful girlfriend does not have the most essential part but her presence does manage to unearth Jeff's solitude. Notable performances from the supporting cast include Thelma Ritter, as Stella the maid and Raymond Burr, as Lars, suspected murderer. Certainly the movie has in tow all the great elements on its side. The best of scripts, the best of talent from the acting stable and a mastermind director of suspense. Another of the more interesting elements is the musical score, which is provided courtesy of the songwriting man as he attempts to unleash his musical masterpiece.Does this provide an excuse for prying into the lives of other people, by unearthing the curious inner person of us all? I hardly think so, but it brings a very real insight to the lives of others, particularly shown through the character of Miss Lonely Hearts, that there are a lot of lonely people out there. It also shows that our neighbours can be doing a lot of interesting things if we are watching at the right moment.After the whole murder business which pulled Jeff further and further into the mystery to the point of no escape, I think I will stop spying on my brother and his girlfriend. It after all, was my new year's resolution before I turn fifteen. But just by writing the words to this review makes me want to watch the movie again. Hitchcock created an intriguing treat which cannot be spoiled by repeated viewings of his 50s thriller classic.

The Titanic hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with Ben-Hur. During the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of Schlindler's List and The Silence of the Lambs. Without a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, and in sixty years we'll be wondering what we were thinking.Rating 5\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 January 2000","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Julio Medem's brilliant films thrive on enigma, obfuscation, tease and irresolution.  LOVERS is his most playful yet, because it seems his most lucid.  There is the usual pattern of proliferating doubles, connection of motifs, bending of time; yet, rather than confuse or complicate like before, each separate entity seems thrusting towards the linear, Unified Whole of the conclusion, which is satisfying in an old-fashioned romantic way, until it too is irreversibly, indeterminately split.The plot is Medem's simplest yet two young children, Otto and Ana, are brought together by the affair between their parents which eventually grows into marriage.  Otto continues to live with his mother, but increasing love for Ana causes him to move in with his dad so they can enjoy furtive lovemaking.  Otto's mother, presumably ins reaction to a double abandonment, commits suicide; depressed, Otto tries to do likewise, fails, and leaves Ana and his family to become an air-messenger pilot.  After a failed relationship with an old teacher, Ana goes to Lapland to live in a cabin owned by the father of her mother's new lover.  A series of extraordinary coincidences seem to bring Ana back to Otto.Anyone who has seen a Medem film will know what to expect surface realistic observation is rejected in favour of an excessive formalism, artifice and patterning that allows access to greater emotional truths.  The doubling is astonishing - male\/female, mother\/father, son\/daughter, sister\/brother, earth\/air, North\/South, death\/rebirth, lost\/found, concealment\/revelation etc.  Two halves should make one whole, but it never does in a Medem film, leading only to further fragmentation.  The two main leads are played by three different actors each, leading to a triple splitting of self which is further underscored both by the permanancy of the actors playing their parents, and by the different actors playing them slipping into the wrong time frame, e.g. the young Otto appearing in the adolescent Otto's plot.Further dislocation occurs in the formal patterning of repetition and coincidence.  The same scenes are repeated in different historical moments with different characters.  The same events feature different protagonists, depending on the subjectivity of the teller.  The main formal device is to have each lead tell in turn the story, but instead of clarifying, this only further confuses, because each sees differently from the other.  Medem then undermines this obvious truth by showing a kind of innate bond between Otto and Ana the palandromic fact of their names, the way each uses the other as a representation of a beloved dead parent etc.  And yet again, THIS is denied in the film's most excruciating scene, where, years apart from each other, the two finally occupy the same space at a few feet's distance, on a cafe piazza, and fail to realise.There is no such thing as a key to Medem, as his labyrinths are Theseus-proof, but the opening credits bear close scrutiny, revealing images of fragmentation - the crashed plane - and rupture, and an intimation of subjectivity that drives the film.  LOVERS' ending suggests that it is Ana's striving for wholeness, after the ultimate dislocation - death.  This reading, though, is questioned throughout - how, for instance, do we account for Otto's voiceover.  We are forced to question how much of what we see is, if not literally plausible, than related.  Most importantly, it makes us question the past, a history, and how it's told.Medem's films, especially VACAS, are concerned with the difference between literal history, as told by the winners, and the messy, interior, emotional history of people as they live.    VACAS featured a character named Peru, the name of Medem's son to whom TIERRA  was dedicated, and who stars here as the  young Otto.  LOVERS is dedicated to Medem's father.  The film is obsessed, like VACAS and, to a lesser extent, TIERRA, with family relationships, with tradition and continuity, with a saga that seem linear (generation follows generation) but is actually circular, as the past is continually replayed and distorted in the present.A crucial subplot here is the meeting of Otto's grandfather with a Nazi bomber during the Guernica atrocity, an act that reverberates throughout the film, and touches, for good or ill, every character.  The duality of the film is linked to the duality that split Spain apart throughout and after the Civil War.  Another historical layer is linked to Medem's own work, as I outlined above, issues of continuity, which include style, cast, doubling, scenes (especially that of a photographer capturing his family), animals with supernatural powers, unresolved, or a proliferation of, endings; as well as discontinuities (e.g. for the first time, no Emma Suarez).For all its brilliance, this is my least favourite Medem film.  It spends a little too much time in the air - its matrix of meaning is not as grounded in the blood and earth of his previous work.  This is probably linked to the acting.  In the earlier films the almost naturalistic truth of the actors clashed fertilely with the formal artifice.  Here, the callow acting of the leads fails to achieve this, leaving one a little unsatisfied.  The older stars are magnificent, though, especially Medem regular Nancho Novo, the loveliest man on film; his OWN abandonment is heartwrenching.  There is also a great deal less comedy than previously, again, I fear, due to the acting.  These are serious quibbles, but ultimately irrelevant - this is easily the best film around at the moment.

I loved it and hated it.The Good StuffThe cast (and casting) is fantastic, with stellar performances across the board.  I particularly enjoyed the performances of Jeremy Blackman (Stanley Spector, Boy Genius) and John C. Reilly (Jim Kurring, Dorky Cop), although there isn't a weak performance to be found in the movie.The characters were all really enjoyable, albeit often slightly over the top, particularly Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and Claudia Wilson (Melora Walters).The incidental nature of the separate plots is interesting and the individual plots are often compelling.  The centralization of the plots around Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) works well, and I particularly liked the use of the opening sequences to explain the nature of coincidence and make the entire movie seem more plausible.The Bad StuffMany people are going to tell you this film is directed incredibly well, which, in my opinion, is only partially true.  There are a great many interesting sequences and film techniques used, many of which often work quite well.  However, I found the overall nature of the direction to often be so heavy-handed with the use of bizarre camera movement that I think it somewhat detracted from the emotional content of the film.  Granted, it doesn't compare to the all-time offender in this respect, Oliver Stone's directorial farce in Natural Born Killers.There were a few sequences in the film that were so awkward and out of place that they seemed merely put in for bizarre effect.  I refer particularly, of course, to the singing interlude with all the characters, and the rain of frogs.  No one will ever convince me that these two ridiculous occurences enhanced this film.This movie is really just too long.  As interesting as it was, I started to lose interest after the singing sequence.  This is a particular problem because the pacing of the film starts out so intense and then continously slows as the film progresses.  This is an interesting (and pretty effective) device, but it hurts in a 3 1\/2 hour movie.I personally think some of the Frank T.J. Mackey character sequences and a lot of the interaction between Claudia Wilson and Officer Jim Kurring could have been removed to shorten this movie by about 45 minutes, and maintain interest throughout the film.  And my god it would have been wonderful to remove that damn singing sequence.My ConclusionOverall, Magnolia was a very interesting movie, but mostly just because it was filled with such wonderfully portrayed and wholely unique characters.  I felt more like I was watching a set of virtuouso vignettes than an actual movie.  While I thought the acting and casting were some of the best I've ever seen, in the end I didn't really like this movie as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier (and really great) work on Boogie Nights.I gave it a solid 8.  If you're easily put to sleep in a movie theater, skip it.  And you may want to wait for videotape anyways, to give yourself some quite possibly needed pauses during a 3 1\/2 hour long set of truly great audition reels.

This is a particular problem because the pacing of the film starts out so intense and then continously slows as the film progresses.  This is an interesting (and pretty effective) device, but it hurts in a 3 1\/2 hour movie.I personally think some of the Frank T.J. Mackey character sequences and a lot of the interaction between Claudia Wilson and Officer Jim Kurring could have been removed to shorten this movie by about 45 minutes, and maintain interest throughout the film.  And my god it would have been wonderful to remove that damn singing sequence.My ConclusionOverall, Magnolia was a very interesting movie, but mostly just because it was filled with such wonderfully portrayed and wholely unique characters.  I felt more like I was watching a set of virtuouso vignettes than an actual movie.  While I thought the acting and casting were some of the best I've ever seen, in the end I didn't really like this movie as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier (and really great) work on Boogie Nights.I gave it a solid 8.  If you're easily put to sleep in a movie theater, skip it.  And you may want to wait for videotape anyways, to give yourself some quite possibly needed pauses during a 3 1\/2 hour long set of truly great audition reels.

So much power and emotion, so that as you watch you gape at it.  A sorrowful plot ending and based on truths mixed with things in the middle of the play such as an affair and age changes that are false provides two and a half hours of stage entertainment.  In 1996, they released a movie.The movie version, I have to admit, falters a lot. So many unnecessary things are added, things that just take up time. Some things are changed from the play, such as the purpose of Tituba's conjurings.  The movie moves somewhat shakily, as scenes are chopped up and served to viewers over multiple days' time in the movie.  Scenes not in the book edition but in the Broadway play edition (such as the wood scene) are added, which in most cases is a good thing-- we get more out of the facts this way. However, once the hearing scenes begin, the action becomes very intense, and for those who have never seen the play before, is an exhilarating experience waiting to see what will happen.The actors in this production are mostly quite good, but in some cases, over-the-top. Mary Warren was excellent, and Winona Ryder really made you HATE her character.  Danforth, Parris, and Putnam both did very good jobs as well, and Parris really expressed greed and egomaniacal traits.  Paul Scofield as Danforth was a grest secondary antagonist.  Joan Allen was jyust fine as Elizabeth, as was the actress of Tituba.  However, Hale, and I hate to say it, but even Daniel Day Lewis as John Proctor don't seem to meet up with the rest of their fellow cast.  Hale seems to exaggerate irrelavent things.  Still, beyond that, he doesn't pose a huge problem.Now for an analysis of Proctor.  As my high school is in rehearsal for this play as I speak, I think it is easily naturally to point out things about your own part, and this is mine.  I did not find total dislike with Day-Lewis.  In certain scenes, he did great, especially directly after Elizabeth speaks to Danforth in the court.  He also displayed a good amount of remorse and angered reason with Abigail, and annoyance with Mary Warren.  Still, he seemed very calm around things that people back then in that society would gasp at, had they a clear mind as he did.  Maybe as he filmed he thought it was his character, but hanging of all of those innocent people... Rebecca Nurse's arrest... it seemed as though he didn't really care.  In the end, I find dislike with the final speech over the signature signing.  His impressive parts even out the not as impressive better than I had originally thought, but not so well as Hale's actor did.  In certain parts, I cannot help but use his influence as I read, something I try to steer away from doing, so his performance was not BAD. It just wasn't superb.Along with these, the movie provides excellent authentic visual scenery, true to the times.  It is some of the best.
