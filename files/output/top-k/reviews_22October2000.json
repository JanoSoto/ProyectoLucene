Just as he did with She's Gotta Have It, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X, Spike goes beyond the jugular and tries to make us all take notice.  And it appears as if he has succeeded.  I know he has with me.Great start with Damon Wayans' opening narration (great use of this mostly-misused Wayans brother's actual super talents) setting the stage of his life he was in as he began to lay out the film before us.  And Jada Pinkett-Smith was a fine voice of contentious reason, never letting up from start-to-finish as well as seeing the truth of what was really happening all around everyone.  And Michael Rappaport was fine in embodying a latter-day white Negro (as a white person who partakes in black culture with his talk, lingo, interests, passions as well as actually marrying black, as he disclosed of doing in this role), not unlike the white male who was part of the Mau Maus either.  And then, there was Tommy Davidson (talented like Wayans in the afore-mentioned vernacular)  and Savion Glover (who can act as well as dance superbly; GREAT CHOREOGRAPHY), who go from poor street performers to the hottest commodity on television as a result.  In Wayans' original intents backfiring on him, the monster is out of control and regrets run rampant, turning the film from laugh-out-loud funny to stunningly-dead serious as the film wears on.If this was Spike's intent, to show us one thing in the beginning and turn it into something else altogether different at the end, he more than succeeded.  In the process, he serves up an indictment on our society with regard to the price society as a whole not only pays on racism, but success as well.  When these issues bring on the conflict they knowingly can, it creates hard feelings which can lead to the destructiveness this film eventually presented.  Though on a lesser scale in She's Gotta Have it, the downward defection on Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X (even knowing how that one would end) and (YES!) Summer Of Sam is no less impressing with regard to how Spike wants us to stand up and take notice about how badly our differences can lead to further distrust and misunderstanding where there indeed needs to be better trust and understanding.  In bringing this out uncompromisingly, Spike succeeds in once again making folks take heed where heed does not want to be taken.  That may well be a factor with regard to whether or not this film is nominated for the awards it deserves to be nominated for. (A multi-win storm is befitting a film of this stature, not limited to, but including any Best Actress award (Pinkett-Smith); any Best Actor Awards for Wayans, Glover or Davidson; Best Director (Spike deserves it); and....BEST PICTRE!!!)  It was also great to hear some fresh Stevie Wonder songs in this one; befittingly relevant as Stevie always is!!!!!Like American Beauty, which held up a collective mirror to some of the hypocrisies this country takes for granted, Bamboozled follows suit as well in a major way.  May this film be seen in that same venue as well.  For all that it is and it has done, it certainly does deserve the comparison.

First off, the special effects will make you drool.  They are so good, and so original that no one, NO ONE can say this movie is 100% bad.  Oh, and Catherine Zeta Jones is in it.  That's about it though.Movies like this are like M&Ms (this is a long analogy, so go with it).  The movie's soul (the characters, the acting, the plot, the theme, etc...) are like the chocolate.  The extra stuff (the special effects, the sound, etc...) is like the candy coating.  As you know, about 90% of an M&M is chocolate, because that's what tastes best.  Same goes with movies. Now, M&Ms need the coating too.  Other wise, it would just be chocolate, boring chocolate.  In movies, special effects are nice editions, but they need a chocolate center to cover.Now, if the IMDb editors haven't cut out my analogy, if the Haunting was an M&M, it would be all coating.

But, if some one, say the actors or the director says, Hey, I was in\/directed the Haunting, people will run in terror.  This is a scary movie.  It's scary that someone had the idea to make it.

However-when the movie took a turn for the worst, the camera stayed in stern focus and the lighting became dull.

The audience responded affirmatively in both instances, and such began the movie.  If you answer yes to both of these questions, this is a must-see movie.  If you answered no, you should still see this satirical romp following the actions of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The director, writer and star of Best in Show, Christopher Guest, is no newcomer to fake documentaries.  As the lead guitarist in the aforementioned This Is Spinal Tap (1984) and the director, writer and star of Waiting for Guffman (1997), he is perhaps the master of the field, exploring a common theme, as reflected in the Guffman tag line There's a good reason some talent remains undiscovered. Guest explores this theme further in Best in Show, looking at ordinary people not mockingly but almost tenderly.  You understand the characters' fears and insecurities, and you can only see too much of people you know or yourself in them.  More importantly, you like these characters.  When Eugene Levy's character Gerry Fleck reacts to his wife Cookie's (Catherine O'Hara) past wild sex life, you know that this is a man who loves his wife and whom his wife loves, despite his huge dorkiness and her having slept with almost every man they meet.  Pookie and I work as a team, he says, and they do, singing in harmony about their beloved terrier. The other characters are as banal and human as they can be; the braces-wearing yuppie couple, played with aplomb by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, take their dog to a therapist because the dog is depressed and angry about having seen the couple in the Congress of the Cow Kama Sutra position.  They wax poetic about having been raised amongst catalogues, extolling the virtues of J. Crew and L.L. Bean, and describe their similarities as loving soup, outdoors, snowpeas, talking and not talking. These two are perhaps the most caricaturistic and one-dimensional of the characters in the film, but you feel sad for them for their transference of parental instinct onto their woeful dog. Best in Show has its share of comedic highs, most notably, the interplay between Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), the hopelessly clueless commentator, and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), the British dog expert.  As Buck barrages Trevor with inane and hilarious questions, Trevor brings up the most specific detail about the different breeds and the particular judges. Buck reminds me of my Uncle Bob, the man who doesn't know anything about anything but talks about it anyway, and it's perhaps the funniest part of the movie. This movie is kind to its characters while making fun of them, and the result is hilarity.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"22 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Audiences and critics seem to have trouble with true emotion in the movies. Audiences eat up fake sentimentality (cloned romantic comedies, chick flicks and Robin Williams schmaltz) with a spoon, and the critics follow closely behind to castigate them for it. But confront them with something where feelings are born from the gut, from the soul, and they'll quickly, angrily dismiss it. This is bad enough among the audience, but it's even worse with so-called critics who should know better. Which brings me to Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes whose North American premiere sparked the same divisive debates it was greeted with at Cannes.As has been noted innumerable times, the story is the hokiest of melodramas, rife with coincidences and impossible bad luck. This fact has been used to attack the film, with critics berating Von Trier for concocting such a story, for unabashedly using such melodramatic conventions in this day and age, for expecting the audience to buy it (I even read a review criticizing the courtroom protocol). All of which is merely a means to avoid dealing with the naked, unself-conscious depth of emotion which is the true subject of the film. Whatever else he is, Von Trier is not a cynic; from the undeniably brilliant but arrogant technical wizard of The Element of Crime and Zentropa has emerged a true artist who infuses his movies with the full passion of his heart and soul. He once sought to reinvent cinema through technology; he now seeks to do it by throwing off any self-imposed distance with his subjects and presenting their personality and emotions fully upon the screen. The carnal pleasure of that split second in the cinemas, when the projector and the loudspeakers, in unison, allow the illusion of sound and motion to burst forth (as Von Trier wrote in one of his numerous manifestos) has been abandoned for the world of pain and hope encased within Bjork's heartrending screams at the conclusion of Dancer.Bjork's performance and music are the key to the film. As Von Trier and co-star Catherine Deneuve stated, Bjork cannot act, she can only be (which explains how she could have a breakdown while making the film). Using her vulnerability and inexperience, Von Trier does not simply coax a performance out of her; he uses her awkward naturalness as the emotional core of the film. Her pauses between words and lines and her stumbling repetitions, instead of breaking the illusion of character, enhance it, making Selma more real, more genuine, than any dialogue on a page could achieve. As Selma is another in Von Trier's line of childlike women (Breaking the Waves, The Idiots), her bluntness and lack of artifice work perfectly with Bjork's inexperience. Watch the delightful and touching scene between Selma and Jeff (Peter Stormare), her lovelorn neighbour, when she tells him that she doesn't want a boyfriend (but if she did, it would be him).These qualities apply to the musical sequences as well, which Von Trier distinguishes from the reality scenes by using brighter colours (the film is shot completely with digital cameras). Rather than using familiar songs from American musicals to represent Selma's happy fantasy world (as is done in the Steve Martin version of Pennies From Heaven, a clear inspiration for Dancer), the songs are original compositions by Bjork, and thus serve as extensions of Selma's character, her feelings and hopes given unlimited expression and lifted above reality, just as the film begins with an overture played over a series of changing abstract paintings. The contrast between Selma's fantasy and reality is not meant to be ironic, the blissful happy endings of musicals commenting on the real brutality of life and all that. Von Trier is not interested in irony; the songs ARE Selma, their hopeful exhortations (in defiance of her blindness, I've Seen It All) and resigned acceptance of tragedy (after killing Bill, You Just Did What You Had To Do) as clear and uncomplicated as Selma herself, with Bjork's voice moving from awkward, monotone phrasing to moments of piercing power. All this comes together in the unforgettable final scene, which I wouldn't dream of spoiling; a few members of the audience I was with found it so overwhelming they had to flee the theatre.A brief mention of other contributors. Catherine Deneuve lends her legendary presence and official Gallic seal of approval to Von Trier's daring, and manages to be quite convincing as a punch-press operator (she makes a mean sink). David Morse, one of the great unrecognized American character actors, is touching, frightening and pathetic as the sad Bill. Peter Stormare (best known as the hulking killer in Fargo) perfectly expresses Jeff's dogged devotion, making him both comic and touching (his final scene with Bjork is heartbreaking). An unrecognizable Joel Grey (the Master of Ceremonies in Cabaret) has a wonderful cameo as an aged Czechoslovakian musical star, and tapdances on the judge's desk in Selma's courtroom fantasy. Von Trier regulars Stellan Skarsgard and Udo Kier turn up in small roles.I will make this clear this movie is not for everyone. It is challenging, frustrating, and uncompromising. It demands attention and patience, but the rewards are great.  I have not talked much about plot, style or any other conventional review topic. They don't matter; this movie defies the cafeteria questionnaire-like evaluation from which most reviews are made. Like David Lynch's The Straight Story from last year, Dancer in the Dark is a work of art grounded in pure emotional simplicity, a simplicity so daunting that the immediate response is to throw it aside disdainfully and rent a Julia Roberts movie. Don't fall for it. This is the best movie of the year. Take a chance.

Watch the delightful and touching scene between Selma and Jeff (Peter Stormare), her lovelorn neighbour, when she tells him that she doesn't want a boyfriend (but if she did, it would be him).These qualities apply to the musical sequences as well, which Von Trier distinguishes from the reality scenes by using brighter colours (the film is shot completely with digital cameras). Rather than using familiar songs from American musicals to represent Selma's happy fantasy world (as is done in the Steve Martin version of Pennies From Heaven, a clear inspiration for Dancer), the songs are original compositions by Bjork, and thus serve as extensions of Selma's character, her feelings and hopes given unlimited expression and lifted above reality, just as the film begins with an overture played over a series of changing abstract paintings. The contrast between Selma's fantasy and reality is not meant to be ironic, the blissful happy endings of musicals commenting on the real brutality of life and all that. Von Trier is not interested in irony; the songs ARE Selma, their hopeful exhortations (in defiance of her blindness, I've Seen It All) and resigned acceptance of tragedy (after killing Bill, You Just Did What You Had To Do) as clear and uncomplicated as Selma herself, with Bjork's voice moving from awkward, monotone phrasing to moments of piercing power. All this comes together in the unforgettable final scene, which I wouldn't dream of spoiling; a few members of the audience I was with found it so overwhelming they had to flee the theatre.A brief mention of other contributors. Catherine Deneuve lends her legendary presence and official Gallic seal of approval to Von Trier's daring, and manages to be quite convincing as a punch-press operator (she makes a mean sink). David Morse, one of the great unrecognized American character actors, is touching, frightening and pathetic as the sad Bill. Peter Stormare (best known as the hulking killer in Fargo) perfectly expresses Jeff's dogged devotion, making him both comic and touching (his final scene with Bjork is heartbreaking). An unrecognizable Joel Grey (the Master of Ceremonies in Cabaret) has a wonderful cameo as an aged Czechoslovakian musical star, and tapdances on the judge's desk in Selma's courtroom fantasy. Von Trier regulars Stellan Skarsgard and Udo Kier turn up in small roles.I will make this clear this movie is not for everyone. It is challenging, frustrating, and uncompromising. It demands attention and patience, but the rewards are great.  I have not talked much about plot, style or any other conventional review topic. They don't matter; this movie defies the cafeteria questionnaire-like evaluation from which most reviews are made. Like David Lynch's The Straight Story from last year, Dancer in the Dark is a work of art grounded in pure emotional simplicity, a simplicity so daunting that the immediate response is to throw it aside disdainfully and rent a Julia Roberts movie.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"22 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Audiences and critics seem to have trouble with true emotion in the movies. Audiences eat up fake sentimentality (cloned romantic comedies, chick flicks and Robin Williams schmaltz) with a spoon, and the critics follow closely behind to castigate them for it. But confront them with something where feelings are born from the gut, from the soul, and they'll quickly, angrily dismiss it. This is bad enough among the audience, but it's even worse with so-called critics who should know better. Which brings me to Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes whose North American premiere sparked the same divisive debates it was greeted with at Cannes.As has been noted innumerable times, the story is the hokiest of melodramas, rife with coincidences and impossible bad luck. This fact has been used to attack the film, with critics berating Von Trier for concocting such a story, for unabashedly using such melodramatic conventions in this day and age, for expecting the audience to buy it (I even read a review criticizing the courtroom protocol). All of which is merely a means to avoid dealing with the naked, unself-conscious depth of emotion which is the true subject of the film. Whatever else he is, Von Trier is not a cynic; from the undeniably brilliant but arrogant technical wizard of The Element of Crime and Zentropa has emerged a true artist who infuses his movies with the full passion of his heart and soul. He once sought to reinvent cinema through technology; he now seeks to do it by throwing off any self-imposed distance with his subjects and presenting their personality and emotions fully upon the screen. The carnal pleasure of that split second in the cinemas, when the projector and the loudspeakers, in unison, allow the illusion of sound and motion to burst forth (as Von Trier wrote in one of his numerous manifestos) has been abandoned for the world of pain and hope encased within Bjork's heartrending screams at the conclusion of Dancer.Bjork's performance and music are the key to the film. As Von Trier and co-star Catherine Deneuve stated, Bjork cannot act, she can only be (which explains how she could have a breakdown while making the film). Using her vulnerability and inexperience, Von Trier does not simply coax a performance out of her; he uses her awkward naturalness as the emotional core of the film. Her pauses between words and lines and her stumbling repetitions, instead of breaking the illusion of character, enhance it, making Selma more real, more genuine, than any dialogue on a page could achieve. As Selma is another in Von Trier's line of childlike women (Breaking the Waves, The Idiots), her bluntness and lack of artifice work perfectly with Bjork's inexperience.

If you walk away from this movie without any reaction ... then you just don't get it.I like this movie because it didn't try to cover up what kind of life this boy faced.  I like this moved because it presented an unbelievable and somewhat unachievable challenge to the boy - and he accepted it.  I like this movie because it causes me to think.  And that is something that many other movies fail to do.The writers, directors, producers and actors should get recognition (not criticism) for attempting to cause people to not just think ... but take action to change this world.

This movie was the kind that leaves you thinking about it for days. The story was unique- something you don't see these days- and the actors did a wonderful job. Haley Joel Osment stole the show. What a great performance. You could totally see how he was stressed out at home, but when his alcoholic-abusive father got the boot, he was so much happier and at ease. His emotions covered the spectrum & he did a great job carrying them off. I found Helen Hunt & Kevin Spacey's characters very believable too as well as their performances.
