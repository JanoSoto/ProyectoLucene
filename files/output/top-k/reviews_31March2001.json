[{"date":"31 March 2001","score":"","review":"  Election isn't all that bad. It is, however, broad, unfocused (or wrongly focused on Matthew Broderick's character), tricky, jokey, and shallow. None of this would be as apparent if Payne's 1996 Citizen Ruth wasn't so sharp, controlled, and infinitely better, as well as featuring an host of incredibly natural and believable performances rather than the overplayed annoyances displayed here. Satire and farce rarely mix, as Election shows. It's sad to think that Citizen Ruth may have been a fluke, and that this level of siliness is all we can expect from Alexander Payne from here on.

It was just too stupid, making my head hurt along the way. And it's only a 71 minute film! What has happened to Matthew Broderick? He was Ferris Bueller, now he's a lame rip-off of a lame cartoon series? At least he's been in a couple of things lately to show off his acting skills (Election and You Can Count on Me). After I saw Inspector Gadget, though, I was kind of hoping that someone would put him out of his misery.
