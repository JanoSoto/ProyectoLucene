When I found out that Spielberg would be taking over after Kubrick passed away, I had mixed feelings about it.  On one had, I see Spielberg as a (usually) great director. I thought he would have the power to take this movie and turn it into something very special.  With his past work on Sci-Fi films, I kept telling myself He can pull this off!'  On the other hand, I really wanted Kubrick to direct this film, if he indeed chooses to.  I was also very worried about Spielberg's decision to cast Osment in the roll of David. However, I was to give him the benefit of the doubt.I love Kubrick's style of directing, and now I can only sit here and wonder what could have been.  I caught a late showing of A.I. last night with about 6 friends from work.  Needless to say I had very high expectations of this movie.

I also really liked Jude Law's character.  He is the only thing in the movie that really caught my interest and kept me watching.The whole Pinocchio references really turned me off.  I can't really explain why, but it didn't captivate me.  There was too many times in the movie where I just cringed at what being done or what was being said.  The part at the end where Teddy pulls out the lock of hair from David's mother was a real seat squirmier.  A good half of the theater was laughing at this.  I know this isn't the desired effect Spielberg wanted for that scene, but it came off as laughable.  Just the feeling of the movie trying to be emotional yet coming off as being ridiculous really conflicted with my thoughts.I thought the first half of the movie was pretty good.

I think he played the part of the robot boy amazingly.  No blinking, good movement and he would be what I'd imagine a robot boy to be like.  I was also intrigued to see how his emotions changed throughout the movie, having going from being very robotic to being as human as you or me.  Again, I also really enjoyed Law's character.  As for the parents..  Well, too forced and not believable.It was interesting to read reviewers opinions of this movie after I got home last night. I think they nailed it on the head when they say the movie should have ended when David was trapped under water, asking for the Blue Faire to make him a real boy.  I thought in fact the movie was going to end at that point.  However, it went on for 20 or so unnecessary more minutes. When I first saw the aliens walk onscreen, I was thinking How the heck do they play into this?  I did come to realize after a few minutes that these were not aliens, but highly advanced robot beings.  While it felt a lot like 2001 to me, it wasn't as interesting, nor did it give me something to think about.The special effects and musical score was outstanding in my opinion.  It is unfortunate they didn't have a good movie to go along with it.  It was a shame to see a number of people walking out of the theater, people laughing when that was not the desired effect, and a lot of people fidgeting in the seats.

I don't think so.To me, by that time, the prequels will BE what Star Wars is to THAT generation of fans, and the backlash that exists now about TPM won't exist because Episode 1 will be what Star Wars is to them and what they grew up with, as well as the other five episodes. It will be excepted as having the star wars feel, and so will the rest.For us, 16 years went by, and all that Star Wars was to us was the OT. And now we have three new movies being made that cannot possibly mean what the OT means to us since the OT is a part of what we grew up with. Now that we're adults, TPM won't be looked at by most people who grew up with the OT as what Star Wars is and that it's as good as the OT(except for the few of us who look at it the way that I'm talking about in this scenario). The music is totally new to what we've become accustomed to as far as what we think of as being Star Wars music. The characters aren't who we've come to know and love for the most part, and it takes place at completely different locations.But just think that when 20 years pass, the next generation of Star Wars fans WILL except these 6 movies as what Star Wars is since they'll see how it all flows smoothly together. Everything from the music, to the characters and their stories.I just find the remark It (TPM) just didn't feel like Star Wars to me, a stupid reason to complain about TPM. 20 years from now, this WILL be what Star Wars is to the next breed of Star Wars fans. It'll be what they grew up with and have come to know and love, just like the OT was to us. And just as we had new Star Wars movies made that got beef from a lot of fans, so would any other new Star Wars movie made 20 years from now.With TPM, the acting is no better nor worse than the Old Trilogy.  The lines are no more cheesier(I don't know where you get your delusions, laserbrain etc.).  The plot is actually more complex than the OT and just as deep if you actually understand the plot.Star Wars hasn't changed.  You have.  For most every person that I've talked to that saw the OT as adults thought that The Phantom Menace was brilliant and imaginative.  If other people in this category didn't, fine.  But most of the bashers of this movie were kids when the OT was out, and they grew up with it.  It's a part of their treasured childhood.

Spielberg obviously didn't feel that this movie should have been filled with as much harsh commentary in the subtext as I'm sure Kubrick would have included.  Spielberg, at every opportunity, strayed away from the social commentary and concentrated on the individual.  The problem with this is that the individual was a robot.  Sympathy for David (Osment) seemed like it should have been a secondary objective of the film, but Spielberg couldn't resist.The movie is very segmented, which is fine if you can pull it off by having one theme throughout.  This theme didn't exist, and left me thinking What is the point?  Anyone who has seen a lot of Kubrick knows that he hits you over the head with the points of his films, which made him one of the most influential filmmaker of our time.  Not necessarily at the box office like Spielberg, but in thinking minds all over the world.My biggest problemsThe hounds were so cartoony it made me think of the gymnastics scene in Jurassic Park 2... you should remember.  From that point forward, my skepticism began to grow.  The Flesh Fest could have been a great dark scene (like the ceremony scene in Eyes Wide Shut), but instead turned a group of present day monster truck fans into fickle promoters of the destruction of robots, or Mechas.I'll combine my last too major problems together.  I think that the Pinocchio theme was not done as well as it could have been done.  If you have seen The Sweet Hereafter, you know what a fairy tale can do if used correctly.  Also the end seems disjointed and forced... still interesting, but seemed like it was from a different movie, maybe Close Encounters?Subtexts that should have been accentuated There was a little talk of David being like Adam (from the bible). Shortly after there were halos of light around both David and his mother... kinda like Mother and Jesus... This goes through to the end where he communicates to the aliens.  David is special, but it was something that could have been more accentuated... It could have almost been like a modern passion play... But this takes a lot of extrapolation as the movie stands.Another great idea is that the humans hate the robots because they envy the robots and their immortality.  The idea of the human ego being challenged really could have been an interesting and humbling topic.I know Kubrick would have focused on more universal issues than Spielberg did.

The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie.  Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free. I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face?  These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight!  Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento.

These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight!  Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento.

It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie.  Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.

This film is probably the single best animated film (not counting Princess Mononoke, which Disney made sure was buried before it could take foothold) to reach the big screen over here in years. Wonderful animation, likeable characters and GREAT writing set this gem apart from its rivals, and despite not being a giant box office draw I suspect its gonna be revered for many years to come by children and adults alike.
