Matt Damon was introduced at the end of the film and took questions from the audience for about a half hour.I've read Ludlum's book and the movie is very loosely based on it. Essentially this is about a man found floating in the sea, near death from gunshot wounds.  As the man wakes, he has no memory and eventually he finds himself on the run with the aid of a woman he barely knows.  Unlike the book, there is no Carlos, Marie is a gypsy not a banker, and the movie is set almost entirely in ParisI thought the movies was less of a spy thriller than a movie about two people on the run.  There were several lighter moments in the film with Damon and Franka Potente on the run.  Potente is really good and very funny. Chris Cooper (a great character actor) doesn't have the greatest lines, but delivers them quite well.  Julia Stiles is also in this movie, but her role is rather small.  Clive Owen is in the movie as well (not driving a BMW though) and while his role is small, he performs well especially as he talks about his life and sacrifices.I thought this film was good entertainment, but not great.Matt Damon said that he studied martial arts and had weapons training for five months.  He did do most of his own stunts.  Some of the fights scenes were great with an almost Matrix-like super-soldier type attitude.  There is a great stunt near the end of the movie as Bourne makes a move to get down the staircase.The film was shot in Paris and the Czech Republic.

Upon closer examination of the films story and characters, you will see that it is showing us a frightening depiction of what America could have become had not our society improved.  It's completely ironic that we would have ended up choosing New York City (and later Los Angeles in the sequel), which in this country are landmark cities, as the last place to house America's worst criminals.  With all of the problems currently facing our society, is this what things could have eventually come to?Escape from New York is set in the future, in the year 1997.  We learn that Manhattan Island has become a giant maximum-security prison.  It is completely surrounded on all sides by a fifty-foot containment wall that has soldiers patrolling it at all times.  All roads and waterways that lead off of the island are mined.  The prison itself is kept under constant watch from security headquarters, which is stationed at nearby Liberty Island.  Everyone in the prison follows one simple rule once you go in, you don't come out.  When Air Force One, which we should all know is the president's airplane, is hijacked and crash lands inside the prison, the security officials in charge blackmail a hardened but highly decorated war hero who is currently on his way to the island to serve a life sentence for a daring robbery.  His mission is to infiltrate the prison and safely escort the president and the tape recording in his possession off of the island.  To ensure that the convict doesn't try to escape, two micro-charges are injected into his arteries that if he doesn't get the president back within twenty-two hours, will explode.  If he does succeed, the charges will be deactivated and all crimes he has been convicted of will be fully pardoned.  And so the adventure begins...From here we really don't know what to expect of this film and that's good.  You'd probably be expecting to hear car horns or the sounds of a city that is alive and full of people.  When we first see New York, it looks a lot like a ghost town, meaning as in dead.  The city is crawling with rapists, thieves and murderers.  Things in the city have become so bad, that some groups of people, most notably the crazies who are a group of underground subway-dwellers, have had to resort to cannibalism to survive.  The new New York is not a prison at all, but more of an asylum for the worst of the worst.  People here are basically living out death sentences, as that is the equivalent of saying these people are serving out life sentences.  It is really nice that the prison gives you the option of being executed on site, rather than dying somewhere inside the prison where you'll probably end up becoming someone's lunch.  Which would you prefer?Snake Plissken, played here by Kurt Russell, was an excellent choice to play a reluctant hero.  He plays his role very good.  Singer Isaac Hayes makes a great villain here with his role as The Duke of New York.  He is very good too.  It amazes me though about how a man such as himself could have come to power and become the most feared man in new New York.Escape from New York is an excellent film that has received a much deserved cult following.  This John Carpenter film is easily one of his best and I really like it.

The movie only relies on loud sound effects, special effects, music, and only the money from the box office. Everything else is just garbage. Whats worse is that there were four screenwriters who couldn't come near the talent of screenwriter David Keop(Screen writer for Jurassic Park and The Lost World) and who couldn't finish the final production of the script when Jurassic Park 3 started filming. And to sum it all, there was the kid's film director Joe Johnston who thought in his foolish ways to make Jurassic Park 3 light, and to settle this as a kid's movie ruining everything great and imaginable from Steven Speilberg.The plot?  Two divorced parents rent a plane for a low flying tour over the dinosaur Island and invite Dr Alan Grant as their guide. Thats all there is to the plot. They go to the Island and a couple minutes later, people start running and getting eaten. Sorry to say, but thats all there is. Couldn't those four screenwriters come up with anything better? Come on, thats more like the idea from an 8 year old.Joe Johnston doesn't want to put any thought or time whatsoever in the movie development. Instead, he ignores the standards that Steven Speilberg has set up in the first Jurassic Park movies and does things his way. He ignores how Speilberg has done the action. Joe Johnston takes the action his way making the action quick, lacking build of suspense, and having the action last only up to 2 minutes. Spielberg on the other hand does the action right making it last more than 6 minutes and adding suspense.Johnston also enforces the new super dinosaur. Its a Spinosaurus to be exact. He can take out a plane in seconds, kill off a couple merchants, and take out a T.rex. He can't scare the audience. Johnston next enforces the new talking and smart raptors. Instead of frightening the audience as Johnston wants them to do, the raptors make the audience laugh out loud.There is also stupidity. Amanda Kirby calls for her son through a loud speaker phone during a desperate situation. Paul Kirby tries to get snacks from a broken down vending machine. Billy steals raptor eggs for funding. A satellite phone survives in a dinosaur digestive system and rings. There is just more stupidity I can list on and on.Everything is so predictable. Who didn't know what was going to happen next when Amanda gazed too long at the raptor head in the lab? Who didn't know who would live and who would die in the movie? Everything is so darn predictable. This movie had to have been set out for the weak minded audience.The only better acting is from Sam Neil and William Macy. Tea Leoni's acting was horrible. Jeter's and Nivola's parts were wasted. Morgan was just randomly chosen. And the other two were just there for dinosaur food. Thats all there is to the acting.And theres more. Not only have the four screenwriters come up with corny dialogue such as Into the herd, Into the trees, Your no better than the people who built this place, What was that?, and the Barney joke, they also got away with RIPPING off from the well thought of lines in the movie Aliens.

It's just something that has to be done, because it's there. Why did I think this? Because Episode I was such a terrible, terrible film. God, the afwulness. What was going through old George's mind when he did that? Who knows? Who cares? Attack of the Clones, bless it's heart, is just fantastic. Everything Lucas did wrong in The Phantom Menace he does so very, very right in AOTC. And then some. My stomach churns at the thought of that syrupy little Lloyd kid in TPM, trying so desperately to be good. How could that wee little oik go forth to become Darth Vader? There's just no way. Hayden Christensen, however. Now that's more believable.

Like millions of people, I have grown up with these movies and have cherished the first three (or rather, the middle three, I suppose) since I first saw Star Wars (I cannot in good conscience call it Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope -- how arrogant can one mediocre director be) in the theatres (70mm was a wonderful thing).  I was excited, but ultimately disappointed by Phantom Menace, but still thought it was passably entertaining.

Episode II was BAD!  Its that simple.  Its not just that it was bad by Star Wars standards...it would have been bad by POLICE ACADEMY standards!!!The digital effects are impressive, I will admit that much (although in this day and age it is more notable when a move has bad special effects).  Its just that the advances in CGI technology have led Lucas to go for overkill (understandably since he has mucho dinero invested in them).  All the CGI amount to sensory overkill -- after the 150th spaceship flying outside the window of Senator Amidala's (the formerly elected Queen???) flat, its no longer cool.  And many of the effects of the original three had more...substance.  They felt more real, even if they didn't look more real. CGI Yoda looked incredibly real, it certainly fools the eye, but he doesn't FEEL real.  There is something intangible that is missing from the CGI that the puppet Yoda had.As for the film itself...as I said, it was just BAD!  The love story was laughable and groan-inducing, the politics were preachy, drawn out and confusing and even the action was rather boring -- the flight sequence was done as effectively and more stylishly in The Fifth Element (which pays homage to Star Wars, so basically Ep II copies a movie which was paying homage to the source...mutual admiration society?).  Even the much heralded Yoda fight sequence, while cool, only lasted ONE MINUTE!!!Maybe I've just become accustomed to the high adrenaline aciton of Hong Kong and HK influenced movies, but this movie was simply, blah.

And he really should hand over screenwriting duties to someone else as well.  These are his characters and his universe, to be sure, but someone else needs to breathe life into this franchise. It would be really interesting to see John Woo, the Wachowskis, David Lynch, Luc Besson or Ridley Scott take the reins for Ep III.  But it won't happen.I suppose its fitting.

Her psychic link seems like an extremely poor plot device, as she's able to see some killings, and others she can't. 4) In the first two Halloween films, Myers' house was a two-story Victorian house, here it's a Gothic-style mansion. (!) 5) In Halloween II, Myers was shot in the eyes, but here, his eyes seem completely unharmed.The filmmakers of this fifth installment (the fourth featuring Michael Myers) seems bent on following the Friday the 13th formula than following John Carpenter's innovative 1978 film, Halloween. Here, in an overly long barn scene that seems to be lifted right out of Friday the 13th, Part III is a clichéd-filled mess. Furthermore, many of Michael's killings seem more suited for the hockey mask wearing Jason Voorhees, as he kills off the irritating, sexually obsessive teens with a rake, pitchfork, and other sharp objects. However, Myers proves his incompetence as he slaughters just about everybody except his intended victim.The film's biggest mistake was killing off the likeable Rachel, Jamie's stepsister, in the film's first twenty minutes. Instead, we are left with characters that are as irritating as you have come to expect from a low-budget slasher film. Furthermore, Donald Pleasance seems over-the-top, more of a caricature of himself instead of being the voice of reason like he was in prior installments. Unfortunately, not even Donald Pleasance can save this basic cookie-cutter horror movie.Wendy Kaplan's character Tina jokingly said, This town should banned Halloween. I couldn't agree more. However, even though Michael Myers is the most infamous killer in Haddonfield - that doesn't stop the town from celebrating it or selling the pale-white Shatner mask.OVERALL Inept screenplay, shoddy direction and poor acting will make you reach for Carpenter's Halloween and yearn for the time when Michael Myers was actually an eerie horror character. *1\/2 out of ****.

I don't think it is that bad (as an action flick, that is) but it is not up to the task either (as a novel adaptation). Let's look at the low points of the movie(1) They strayed away from the original plot in the novel. However, if you do not read the novel at all you will find that a lot of places in the plot just doesn't make any sense. For instance, why the nuclear explosion in Denver... sorry Baltimore did not wipe out the city, and why the Russian President Nimarov (spelling?) trust and listen to Ryan more thant the US President.(2) The original plot is supposed to be a conspiracy between the Arab extremists\/terrorists who want to induce fear and confusion to the US + Russian, an ex-East German intelligent agent who couldn't handle the new era in Germany and the world alike, and a native america who hate the US government partly because they killed his brother (there is a couple others that I forgot... I read the novel a many years ago). They couldn't handle the new peaceful era of the world and they all like to take the world back to their likings. Where is that Neo-Nazi nonsense comes from? Those old white male right-hand extremists in the movie are just so lame and unbelievably one dimension.(3) So, why do we have to rollback Jack Ryan age and marital status? And, why is John Clark look so young? Is Tom Clancy really have a say in the making of this movie? This is just make for Ben Affleck, isn't it? And, BTW I'm really disappointed their treatment to the Mary-Pat Foley character in the movie (a pregnant disgruntle unintelligent woman? Give me a break).(4) Why do Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) running around all over the place towards the end of the movie? Is he needed in the dock in Baltimore?(5) Last but not least, there may be way to get pass the defense line of the US carrier group, but what they have in the movie was too easy! The carrier is only guarded by the galting guns? Come on!However, as a action adventure flick it is quite entertaining(1) The casts are choosen well, and I'm surprised by the performance of Ben Affleck. The role fit him well in this movie. Not to mention the top notch performance of Morgan Freeman (did he ever let me down? no).(2) As an action movie there is not many times that are boring. It builds up the tension, release it, and build up another one. At least I didn't fall asleep.(3) Special effects are OK. However, they should show more of the explosion (or may be they don't want to upset US viewers after 9\/11 too much?)(4) Human emotion are potrayed quite nicely. It shows the anger and fear of the people after the attack.BTW, about the nuclear bomb not went off during the fighter plane crashed I'm no nuclear scientist but if you have read any modern physics book for layman or freshman course you will know that it takes a lot to have a nuclear fusion explosion in terms of energy needed and precision. A situation like a plane crash WILL NOT cause a nuclear explosion. Also, because of straying away from the original plot of the novel, everyone here is complaining about the unrealistic aspect after the nuclear explosion during the Super Bowl. In the original plot there was a screw up in the manufacturing of the plutonium matter for the bomb, so the fusion process during the explosion cannot go all the way; the yield of the bomb was so low that it only destroyed the Denver football stadium and some surrounding buildings, not to mention the fact that the bomb was exploded INSIDE a concrete structure did help to contain the extend of the destruction (usually nuclear weapon explodes in the mid air right on top of the target to gain maximum effect).Also, those bombers that destroyed the aircraft carrier are not MiGs I believe, but I have to look up my copy of Jane's mil. aircraft guide to confirm. I could be wrong.At the end, The Sum of All Fears is an entertaining movie to watch, but it can only stay at that level, being entertaining and nothing more. I can only give it a 6 out of 10 at most. To be honest, I was not expecting a lot from the Sum of All Fears movie adaptation after I have seen Clear and Present Dangers, though.Last but not least, I still think The Hunt for the Red October is a better movie adaptation of the Tom's novel than all the others including The Sum of All Fears.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"5 June 2002","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" What Lilly Dillon (Anjelica Huston in a long tight dress) is doing in this movie is laying off a bookie's bets. But, like a lot else in this plot-challenged movie, it's not really realistic. The way it's suppose to work is this the bookie takes in some big time money on a long shot. This understandably scares the bookie since the fix may be on (or the nag might win legitimately) and if so, he's out a whole lot of money. So to protect himself, HE bets on the nag (using a confederate at the track).This is called hedging. Hedging, whether in sports betting or in the stock or commodities markets works like an insurance policy. But it comes at a price. Take a simpler case. The Yankees are entertaining the Dodgers at Yankee Stadium. The line on the game is Yankees -200, that is, the Yankees are about a two to one favorite. If you want to bet on the Yankees you've got to put up $200 to win $100. If you bet on the Dodgers you put up $100 to win $200. (Actually, the spread or vig reduces that to $180.) Now suppose the bookie gets a couple of $10,000 bets on the Dodgers. Since his daily handle is usually about half that, he begins to sweat. Sure, he'll have a $20,000-day if the Yankees win, but what if the Dodgers win? Then he's out $36,000 dollars and maybe out of business. So what does he do? He hedges; that is he goes to a bigger bookie or to his Lilly in Las Vegas and lays off the action with a $20,000 bet on the Dodgers. Now if the Dodgers win he breaks even and lives to book another day. If the Yankees win, he still breaks even (instead of winning $20,000). But that's the price he pays for laying off, for hedging. Call it insurance.Now the problem with all this in the movie is that Lilly cannot be at every race track in the country. So for Director Stephen Frears to make the action plausible he needs to show that Lilly's regular job is to hang out in California (by the phone!) to cover the West Coast tracks in case a lot of strange money comes in that the bookie needs to lay off. Presumably this is what Lilly is doing in the movie. For more realism, Frears could have shown Lilly hanging by the phone, working for several bookies.Frears has a great cast and they do a fine job. But the plot contrivances keep this from being a really top notch noir flick. Worse stupidity is the scene in which Myra (Annette Bening) finds a motel key on her 100-plus key ring to open Lilly's motel door. Even though Lilly is on the run, apparently she doesn't bother with a second lock, or the chain lock. (Sure.) Second worse stupidity is Lilly sitting in the track's parking lot in full view of the grandstand overhead (although admittedly many feet away) with the trunk of her car open and a drawer full of money exposed for all the world to see. She doesn't have to play with her money in the parking lot. She can wait until she gets to her motel. But this contrivance allows Myra to see the money with binoculars. And as for Roy Dillon (John Cusack) hiding his money inside some strangely thick clown paintings in his living room...I don't think so. And Dillon finding one die on the floor of the dining room car of the train doesn't work either because later he has to find the other one (an action we don't see) so he can fleece the sailors with his loaded dice.Not all the action is unrealistic however. Roy Dillon's little hustle with the flashing of the twenty and the switch to the ten is an actual con done innumerable times; and the reaction of bar keep who catches Dillon in the act is perfect, illustrating how people who work at cash registers feel about people who work little cons on them. And the business beginning when Lilly doesn't lay off the money on Troubadour, and hears the very sad news on the radio that the horse actually wins the race, and then gets punished by her boss, is realistic because he is out some serious money. By the way, a person in Lilly's position, in effect becomes a bookie herself, if she wants to. She can bet a little less on the nag and pocket the change when the nag loses, as the nag usually will. Of course if she bets nothing, the tote board odds don't go down and so the bookie will know. Worse is when she doesn't bet and the nag comes in. Now she has to pay the bookie out of her own money. In the case of Troubadour, a 70 to one shot, obviously she couldn't afford to pay off and so had to take a beating, literary. The dialogue between her and Bobo (Pat Hingle) is perfect if you understand that he knows that she steals a little, here and there.Be forewarned that the subplot is Oedipal and spicily played in parts. I'm sure Huston and Cusack had a few laughs off camera, but we are left not really knowing whether Lilly really is his mother or not. (Perhaps that's a good thing.)All in all there's some nice grifter atmosphere in the movie and Cusack is interesting as a baby-faced little hustler, and Bening is sleazy, sexy and desperate, while Huston is both fawning and cowardly, and sneaky strong.

Roy Dillon's little hustle with the flashing of the twenty and the switch to the ten is an actual con done innumerable times; and the reaction of bar keep who catches Dillon in the act is perfect, illustrating how people who work at cash registers feel about people who work little cons on them. And the business beginning when Lilly doesn't lay off the money on Troubadour, and hears the very sad news on the radio that the horse actually wins the race, and then gets punished by her boss, is realistic because he is out some serious money. By the way, a person in Lilly's position, in effect becomes a bookie herself, if she wants to. She can bet a little less on the nag and pocket the change when the nag loses, as the nag usually will. Of course if she bets nothing, the tote board odds don't go down and so the bookie will know. Worse is when she doesn't bet and the nag comes in. Now she has to pay the bookie out of her own money. In the case of Troubadour, a 70 to one shot, obviously she couldn't afford to pay off and so had to take a beating, literary. The dialogue between her and Bobo (Pat Hingle) is perfect if you understand that he knows that she steals a little, here and there.Be forewarned that the subplot is Oedipal and spicily played in parts. I'm sure Huston and Cusack had a few laughs off camera, but we are left not really knowing whether Lilly really is his mother or not. (Perhaps that's a good thing.)All in all there's some nice grifter atmosphere in the movie and Cusack is interesting as a baby-faced little hustler, and Bening is sleazy, sexy and desperate, while Huston is both fawning and cowardly, and sneaky strong. But see this for Huston who makes a complex character real.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw better in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the flipside - and it worked).Now a very positive gripe The Godfather A Novel for Television was first broadcast in 1977, it has recently resurfaced on some cable channels (covers I & II in chronological order and retitled The Godfather Saga). What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel\/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.I did tape a local broadcast of the saga in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion\/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years? ).I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons.

What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel\/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.I did tape a local broadcast of the saga in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion\/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years? ).I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons. I'll wait till they reconstruct the saga on a new DVD edition(if rumors are true) but please...no Part III.(Subtle Spoiler) Note Never was comfortable when Godfather PART II changed Vito's birthday from April 28,1887 (The Godfather -cemetery monument) to 1892 (from the opening In 1901 the godfather was born Vito...he was nine years old!) Marlon Brando's closing scenes led you to believe the 1887 birthdate.Francis Coppola is an artistic genius, he's never made up his mind to stop tinkering with editing the saga. Even the Godfather Epic 1902-1959 contained only some deleted scene and excised 2 or 3 scenes from the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to THE version where all the scenes are left intact.The Godfather   10 out of 10 The Godfather PART II   10 out of 10 The Godfather Saga (uncensored)  a  10+ ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"5 June 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I only saw The Vanishing a few days ago on cable and surprised I've never come across it before.The Vanishing reminds me so much of Breakdown, starring Kurt Russell where the movie plods along at a nice speed, nothing over the top happens or anything.Sandra Bullock, although on screen for about 10 minutes is brilliant as Diane, girlfriend of Jeff, played by Kiefer Sutherland.

It's a movie in which an ordinary woman from the New York suburbs, played with startling conviction and amazing range by the beautiful Diane Lane, begins to sneak away from her beautiful white dream home in the Hudson Valley, deceiving the family she loves so much in order to indulge in a cathartic sexual fling with a simply gorgeaous French hunk who's built like an Adonis. Her husband slowly suspects and then learns of the affair, and when he discovers how far it's gone, his reaction comes as as big a shock to him as it does to us.''Unfaithful'' is a domestic thriller that's been made with so much sultry juice and power that it is bound to have you thinking and talking about it long after the end credits roll. What the film observes very, very well is the deep, rich comforts of family life aren't always enough to keep even a contented person from straying.Connie Sumner (Lane) loves her doting, slightly fuddy-duddy security contractor husband, Edward (Richard Gere), as well as the life they share with their perky 8-year-old son.  So why does she let herself be seduced by Paul (Olivier Martinez), the insinuating Gallic book dealer who rescues her from a SoHo, New York windstorm? Is it because he's the sort of philosophe stud who drops pensées like ''There's no such thing as a mistake -- there's what you do, and what you don't do''? The film refuses to offer the usual excuses (e.g., cold-fish husband), and that makes the real reason all the more compelling. Connie slides into a fling because she's a sensual woman whose contentment is tinged with complacency, and because the opportunity presents itself in a way that's too sexy to resist.Once she gives in to Paul's charms, though, she gets addicted to them. The further he pushes her (a bit of S&M; a shag in a bistro bathroom), the further she wants to go. Lyne shoots the sex scenes like slivers of delirium that flirt with but never slide into fantasy, and Lane, in the most urgent performance of her long career, is nothing short of incredible -- a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story. I hope the Academy remeber this performance, because it is Oscar worthy without doubt.Diane Lane's work in the film's intriguing and gripping second half, however, wouldn't be possible without Richard Gere's own understated performance that is one of his very best. As these two circle each other, their marriage held together by the very cycle of forbidden acts that's also tearing it apart, ''Unfaithful,'' like a more languid ''Fatal Attraction,'' becomes a thriller myth of the perils of adultery, which few filmmakers can heighten like Adrian Lyne.Unfaithful is a first rate, sexy, cool and engrossing Hollywood thriller that is also refreshingly intelligent. 10 out of 10 for a GREAT movie!

I was surprised at how well-done the movie had been made but was deeply hurt and confused when it became clearly obvious that this was not a sequel but a stand-alone movie.  That is, it has no connections with the other films made from these novels. This angered me.  So much could have been done with the script had they left it on the same timeline.  So, I say that the movie in and of itself was good, ***1\/2 out of **** as a stand-alone film; but recommend Affleck or Ford come back, remake the film, and this time make it a sequel.
