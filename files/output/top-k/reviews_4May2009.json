[{"date":"4 May 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jumping right into the story, where the first film left off... Apparently Julie has nightmares, about the missing body of the fisherman killer who stalked her and her friends one year ago, so bad she can't get over the trauma of hitting him with her car. Even though he was a killer before she (and company) plowed into him, she's a good girl and still feels guilty. Or something. It's a stretch, but hey- anything that will get Jennifer Love Hewitt into tight clothes and have her and her new friends run around screaming while being slashed off one-by-one is a good excuse to greenlight a movie, right? Let me just talk to you from my viewpoint. I only sound cynical about this kind of thing. I own the film, I've always enjoyed it. I still do. But it's not a good movie. It's not even as fun as the old Friday the 13th movies used to be. And they weren't perfect either. I've always thought if they could put the formula of I Still Know together with elements from the Friday the 13th series, we would have a perfect horror film.The chasing, the stalking, and the blade-swiping and slicing sound effects of movies like I Still Know and Urban Legend - which are not particularly bloody or gory films - proves that the heaping piles of gore from the 80's slasher films (at least, before the MPAA hacked them out of the movies) are not necessary to make a really fun killer-themed horror movie. The suspense, the thrill of the moment is the most important thing. That's something I Still Know has a lot of. But the reason I suggested it would be so cool for this film to be mixed with the Friday theme is, and think of the possibilities... The victim pool was always so large in those movies. Even though it's predictable that so many would die and the characters are blanks because it takes considerable screen time to build up personalities, you had more chances for stalking scenes. It may have been repetitive at times, another he's watching you set up to the new person isolated as they're about to be killed. But I always had fun with it. Chase scenes are exciting. They get your blood pumping. Plus, they're noisy, so you can move around in your seat all you want and not disturb anyone else watching.Still features one of the most gorgeous locations I've ever seen in a horror movie. The constant pouring rain makes it a bit gray and drab, and takes some of the fantasy out of the experience, but even then- how many slasher films take place with a natural disaster threatening everyone in the background? And talk about a missed opportunity. To keep the movie under 2 hours, it avoids using more of the storm in the foreground of the story. Which almost makes me think that they had it raining just so the girls' clothes would soak through. Of course... if that's why it was raining, why were most of the girls wearing black and navy blue tops? In Scream, the cliché was to put the obvious female victim in a brightly colored top, so even in the dark, you could see her nipples. Even Hewitt, who wears a white shirt, has a navy blue bra on underneath. Anyway, it's the writing I have fault with. Not the film-making. The dialogue also could have used a little spit and polish. A lot of bad buddy exchanges, sex related one-liners (why do I care if the screenwriter isn't getting any?), and immature banter (which I could get for free babysitting some younger cousins).What I'm desperately looking for from a horror film, is anything that breaks the mold. That doesn't feel it has to conform to a set guideline with the typical parameters of traditional Hollywood movies. Here, there is the standard 'self-absorbed teenage girl not happy with the relationship she's got with her boyfriend'. Basic, but a bit long too, don't you think? This comes with its' own predictable scene of a sort of break-up between the lovebirds over a simple misunderstanding. One is less giving and more taking, the other sick of all the giving and never getting. Probably just a big stage production to disguise the fact that she's not having enough sex with him. Are there really any teenage girls in America that can relate to Julie's predicament? Especially when her boyfriend is drop-dead gorgeous and she's being hit on constantly by yet another drop-dead gorgeous guy who knows about the boyfriend and could easily slip into his position without any issues of jealousy or him being compared to her ex.Still is not a thinking person's horror film. Nor does it take risks. It pretty much just copies the first film in every way. You name it, it's here. Except... it does lack blondes. The first had a few blondes. This film however, opens up the rainbow of perspective female victims by adding a black girl and a Latina to the mix. But, no blondes. Guess you could call this one a real female empowerment tale. If, that is what you'd have called the first film. They run fast, so they get away better than the old model of horror heroines. And they scream louder too. So the boys will hear them further away and call for help. And they get stabbed better too. They fall right down and don't get up. Unless they're not dead. Then, they have to get up and wave to the camera, so the other surviving heroines (if there are any) know they're not dead. Though to be fair, I guess Julie saves her hot boyfriend at the end instead of the other way around. But in all seriousness, if the movie's going to be a slashfest, there should be more victims to choose from. Not just longer running scenes for 3 potential victims.
