While Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance, the director of this film apparently has forgotten about international audiences, the fact that a sit-com from the 1970's is not high art, and even though he was an oddity, Andy Kaufman as a person, playing a practical joke on American audiences, may not be interesting or well-liked to many.Is it news that Kauffman knew how to manipulate the press? (what star doesn't). Is it news that TV has its trends, and he hooked into something (no). As Paul Giamatti says...we got 40,000 people tuning in to see 'Taxi' every night... . Kauffman What do they know?. Giamatti exactly. Ah, yes, thank God for stupid American audiences.The funeral scene in particular was irritating. Coutney Love, Peter Bonerz, Kauffman's parents, all are reverently singing the world is a happy place (or some such nonsense) because the sing-along song is a backdrop behind Kauffman's coffin. What is the subliminal message? We, Hollywood, revere Kauffman; we know something you don't.Presumptuous, smug and really, I hope the international audiences out there don't think all American audiences are stupid. Some celebrities have gotten a free ride, (especially sit-com celebrities) and it would be refreshing to hear them admit that once in awhile.
