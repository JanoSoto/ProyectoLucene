Patrick Stewart is WAY too talented to be doing this kind of thing. He is excellent as Xavior, but his talents are still wasted. In an age when style counts more than substance, X-Men fares better than most comic book adaptions. It ranks better than any of the Batman films, but that's not so tough since they haven't made a good one yet. But this film makes the typical Hollywood flaw, it lets its' visuals and volume level get in the way of story and character development. Sure it loud, fast paced, and visually impressive. It makes for a good summer movie, and it's technical achievements assure it good sales when it hits video. But is there anything really worthwhile here? Not really. There is nothing within the characters or the story that really get to you. You simply do not care about the characters and their situations. You are not given the chance to. Instead, you're beat over the head with more meaningless, albeit impressive, action sequences. Unfortunately, we live in an age when that equates good filmmaking to mass audiences. Hollywood has only gotten the comic book translation right two times. The most recent was The Crow. It, like X-Men, was visually stunning. But The Crow made room for character development. You cared about what was going on. It had real emotion and an incredible performance by Brandon Lee. But the greatest comic adaption in Hollywood history is Superman. The original and its' sequel stand head-and-shoulders above all the others. They had incredible visuals and epic action scenes. But most importantly, they had character dimension. They all served a purpose to the story. The action served the story. They also remained loyal to the characters. Even the lesser Supmerman sequels, while not very good movies, remained faithful to the characters. If you've ever read an X-Men comic, you'll see many changes to the characters. They are either flat background characters that are thrown in because the audience expects to see them (Storm, Cyclops), or they are completely changed to fit into a modern movie. The biggest example of that is Wolverine. First off, he doesn't have the same demeanor, or accent, as the comic character. He was just over 5' tall, now he's over 6'. And he wore a bright spandex costume, not leather. The leather may be more 90's but it's just not true to the vibrant nature of the comic. So, all in all, I was very disappointed. It's just another flash in the pan. It will make a load of money, but will not stand the test of time. No one will remember this movie 20 years from now, except the fanboys whose lives revolve around X-Men. Still, it looks good so I give it 5 out of 10.

Thus, I patiently awaited for the movie to arrive with the anticipation level rising more and more as the days neared, my long-lost fanboy traits making every single fraction of a second nearly unbearable to experience.  Afterall, who could resist seeing the legendary X-Men emerge on the silver screen after so many years of biding?Unfortunately, I allowed my expectations to get the best of me, and as a result walked out of the theater not only slightly disappointed, but ashamed that I had expected this to be one of the best movies of the year.The first factor that disillusioned me was the commercial campaign of the movie--things such as the X-Men television special, which revolved rather heavily on governmental mutant control, and the Mutant Watch website.  Both painted the image that this particular film would not only bring forth the subject of discrimination, but in addition, discuss it to depths which could be deemed unprecedented in the genre of superhero\/action films.  Yet alas, the foregoing does not happen to prove true, and the fashion in which the subject emerges and thrives in the film adds the proverbial, lackluster Hollywood flare that so many of us hold dear.Secondly, it is to be expected that villains in superhero movies should possess a certain degree of superficiality;  but everything up to this point had suggested that at the very least, Magneto and Mystique would be the antagonists who would be most explored, while Toad and Sabretooth would play relatively minor roles.  On the other hand, the reality of the situation is that Magneto is characterized by relatively weak scenes (with the exception of the opening of the movie), whereas all of the other characters utter no more than two or three lines each in the entirety of the film.  A real disappointment indeed, as the major fights in the movie become devoid of any emotion whatsoever due to this.As far as the protagonists of the story are concerned--I'll simply state that this movie should have been called The Adventures of Wolverine and Rogue.

Much darker in tone than any of the two movies it is compared with (American Beauty and Happiness), this movie stands out, not as superior, but as uncooperative.

The ending pretends to tie everything together, or at least end a story, but nothing really happens.  Another movie which features a natural disaster (or unnatural in the case of Magnolia) this event really doesn't change much for anybody, and just serves to be an unusual backdrop.  In Magnolia, it changes people, and in Short Cuts, it shows the actual people's feelings and reactions.  The only thing that happened as a result of this ice storm could have happened in a much better way through other methods.  The last 10 minutes explain a situation that develops in the last ten minutes of the movie.  All in silence, it shows the amazing acting powers by having all of the emotions that they are having on the surface.So, in other words, this is a good movie, and everybody should see it.  Just don't really go out of your way to see it.  I think that the best movie along the same lines, although much darker, is Happiness.

It proves you don't have to use loads of gratuitous violence (Halloween, Scream - good movies but reliant on the visual rather than the abstract) to get your message across.Spielberg gets the ingredients spot on in every dept - the music we already know about, never has the big JW produced a more sinister motif for a movie that stays in your consciousness years after seeing the movie than this.The Editing deserves special mention because Verna Fields knows how to play with the audience, offering us brief glimpses of the horror from the deep. That's all we need, because William's score lets us know when the shark's around.The directing also is a tribute to the Big S himself. It's a pity he didn't win an Oscar, although I supposed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (its major rival at the time) won the sympathy vote.

Afterall, the shark is only doing what it does naturally and generally doesn't bother with bathers in real life. And yet after this movie was released back in the late 70s there was an instant backlash against any shark. Sharkhunters culled them and numbers dwindled, and Jaws, initially was to blame for that.Hopefully with a more environmentally aware audience these days the re-release of Jaws will have more positive effects than before.Anyway, for those who have yet to see this glorious moment in cinema history, go see it and be scared...very..very scared.*****\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"16 July 2000","score":"","review":"  ***SPOILER*** Oh happy days of 25 years ago.

The laughs really come in bunches in this film.  The scene where Carrey's character goes nuts and makes a rather risque announcement over the supermarket loudspeaker, then harasses a nine year old who had previously disrespected him, then ends up in a rather weird situation with a nursing mother (don't ask) and drives the car through the window of the barber shop was classical.  Also whenever he was talking Ebonics....very funny (don't make me hafta bust a cap).  I found some of those scenes with the big black guys mildly offensive and racist though.  I don't see why it should be funny just for those guys to talk how they usually do.

While I have not read the book, I was interested in the presentation of the subject matter, which has been covered successfully and not-so-successfully in a number of films, such as I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and Lisa, Bright and Dark.I was quite disappointed. The movie proved to be more of a caricature of the subject matter than any sort of revelation. Having studied the institutionalization period of mental illness treatment history (from the 40's to the 70's), I found the depiction of the psychiatric hospital and its staff to be shallow, one-dimensional, and just plain stupid. A justification could be made that the movie presented this depiction from Kaysen's perspective, but if I were Kaysen, I would be disappointed in the film.Cinematographer Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of The Bridges of Madison County, helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but James Mangold, who did a good job with Copland, strikes out as writer\/director in this film. The subject matter provides a lot of freedom to improvise, but Mangold gives us predictability to the point of being hackneyed. The focus is more on the hey, man, look at me being crazy set of experiences than the true depths of dispair of the characters. Mangold simply doesn't fill out the characters well, missing out on the integrity and depth required from them to connect on an emotional level. He seems to use a story structural mechanism similar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, where one prominent character (here named Lisa) helps to involve the other characters in the story as associates. However, Mangold misses the key connection in One, that the other characters and their plight provide the motivation for McMurphy's acting-out. That sense of life-and-death for Lisa is not explored in this movie.Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of The Bridges of Madison County, helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but focuses too much on Rather, we have to get sensationalized from the Lisa character Despite the lack of integrity The acting is good despite the weak script. Wynona Ryder turns a believable, steady performance despite a sense that the script doesn't really explore the intricacies of the character. Angelina Jolie is certainly a fine actress who excels at over-the-top roles, but I didn't find this to be one of her more memorable efforts. I much prefer her in Gia and Foxfire than what seems to be a somewhat shrill effort here. I was a bit amazed that she won an Oscar for her work here when there were so many good supporting performances from which to choose. Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave provide familiar, reliable faces for supporting roles.One reviewer described the movie as  The teen-bopper's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. I agree somewhat with that description, though One was far superior in almost every area, starting with the storyline. The film probably does succeed best as a vehicle to which troubled teenagers can relate.

We have flops like Punisher, Captain America, and the Batman sequels.  In fact, the only two remotely well-made comic book adaptions I can think of, are the original Batman and, I'm going out on a limb here, Spawn.  Movies are two hour pieces of eye candy, while comics are a continuing epic that not only have time to focus in on action, but also the character development of their heroines.  It is in this rare occurrence, though, with the X-Men movie, that that line between comics and movies has been crossed, and a very successful crossing at that.Bryan Singer, the director of X-Men, has crafted the greatest adaption of a comic book on to the screen that I have ever seen.  Throughout the movie, each character, whether villain or X-Men, has development, with the exception of Storm whose development I suppose was lost due to her being Halle Berry playing Storm.  Logan, a.k.a Wolverine, is the focus, and who better I ask?  He is almost everyone's favorite X-Men, and with good reason, he has frekin' adamantium claws, people!  The script, I must say, gave me great delight.  It is far better than what the early buzz gave it credit for.  I didn't get a chance to discover the writer, but kudos that that (those) certain person (people).  To me, the script came off as very intelligent, almost too intelligent.  When you combine that with the great performances given by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier), Ian McKellen (Magneto), and, of course, how can I not mention Ray Park (Toad) for his amazing moves and Famke Janneson for her being not only beautiful, but also suiting Jean Gray just fine, you get one helluva pace that just doesn't quit.  The movie seriously flew bye, as my childhood memories of reading the comic flashed before my eyes.  It is a true bliss to finally see your favorite characters up their on the screen, exactly the way you imagined it.What is so great about this movie, is not just the movie, but the way it sets itself up for something even greater.  This is truly one, great set-up for something bigger to come.  As I said before, each character had some sort of development.  Some examples include Sabretooth and Wolverine's dilemma concerning Wolvie's dogtags, also Wolvie's origin, the love triangle between Wolvie, Cyclops, and Jean Gray, Magneto's struggle, Ice Man growing up, the Mystique and Rogue connection (I'm not spoiling it), and even new characters (I can only hope Gambit, my favorite X-Men, next to Wolvie, or course).Bryan Singer has left the door open, and I can tell you that whatever comes again is going to make all the fans very happy.  This movie is a gift from God.  It not only satisfies for the two hours, but it also leaves you thinking about the sequel, and the sequel after that.  Only time will tell.

The Truman show was a good attempt and was heading in the right direction, but just as soon as you see him in a different light,,,,, there he goes, right back to his same old routine.

It really makes you think about all sorts of issues- of family, politics, values, all throughout the three hours.  Unlike many films of this length, my attention never wandered for a second since this film really did draw me in.I thought Fiennes was just great.  You really see him at his best here - he plays three different characters and they are so different from each other but of course have a common thread. James Frain as the young Gustave is also great too. This is a very good actor who should be getting more notice!I'll also be honest - I liked the love scenes and the naked scenes.  More male frontal nudity, I say.Anyway,my only complaint is that this film is not distributed more widely. It really is excellent and a lot of people would enjoy it if it were promoted more. It is not your typical art film and provides an excellent alternative to movies like Scary Movie and Gone in 60 seconds. Go see this one before it gets away.  It's worth it.
