Based on the novel by J.G. Ballard, it is the story of an English boy struggling to survive under Japanese occupation in WWII. The cast of Empire of the Sun deliver extremely strong performances. A pleasant surprise can be found in the foreign languages spoken throughout the film&#x97; although I had no idea what was being said, I got a general impression thanks to the way the lines were said.Christian Bale's character undergoes a drastic transformation due to his WWII experiences (but his dream of flying a plane remains consistent), and observing this transformation on screen is just amazing. Bale gives one of the best child actor performances in a film to date.An interesting thing throughout Empire of the Sun is the portrayal of the Japanese. Their part in the war is rarely touched on in WWII movies&#x97; after all, Nazis and their persecution of Jews provides a more interesting story. Although the Japanese are unmistakably the enemy, at times one feels great empathy for them, particularly the kamikaze pilots Jim admires. One fascinating character is a (Chinese, I think) boy about Jim's age, who, too, dreams of flying. The difference between the two is this the Chinese boy is free; he eventually joins with the Japanese as a pilot. The boy has practically no speaking interaction with Jim, and yet, the two characters are powerfully contrasted (I will avoid my bad habit of over-elaborating here).John Williams composes yet another fascinating score. A Welsh lullaby (called Suo Gan, according to Ian Freer in his book The Complete Spielberg) features quite prominently in the music, and its use is perfectly timed. The first time it's used, it's just a hilarious opportunity to watch Christian Bale lip-sync the song (faltering every once in a while, which is practically inevitable). But its subsequent usage becomes extremely powerful, as one remembers just what kind of boy Jim was when he first sang it in the film. The music's haunting melody is something that will probably stay with the audience long after the film is done.Call me biased if you like, but I really admire Spielberg's direction. Empire of the Sun is filled with heart-wrenching moments without launching into bathos. Spielberg makes some really clever directing choices. For instance, the first time we meet Basie (John Malkovich), who becomes something of a father figure to Jim, Spielberg doesn't show his face in full. It is always somewhat blocked by the shadows. Even when he goes out into the streets, he wears sunglasses, so we cannot see his eyes. This deliberate mysteriousness pays off, as it serves to spice up the audience's interest in this new character.I won't really describe the plot (which, to be honest, is amazing), because this is a film not worth spoiling. This is a little treasure. Empire of the Sun just about flopped at the box office, and has become practically forgotten, but it is nonetheless one of Spielberg's best films&#x97; a great movie that I highly recommend.

He loved the eccentric, the unusual. Every time I watch or think about the movie Eraserhead, I can hear him saying This is going to just blow your mind! And that it did. I can not compare this movie to anything else out there. Sure, I have seen some art movies that drag you into some strange territory never brought by regular Hollywood movies, but this... this was so different. Are you supposed to be watching a story with a beginning and an end, or is this just a day or two of the life of a man? Is he crazy, or is everyone else? Does the word crazy even apply here, and if not, what does? A regular review cannot suffice in even attempting to describe the story. Surly, there have been several sites online that have gone through pages of attempting to describe what goes on.I can tell you that Henry gets his girlfriend pregnant, and that the baby is the scariest looking creature ever to come out of a human body. But if I tell you about the lady that lives in the radiator, the (what I call) floating man, & the creepy parents, we are going to disagree in what we think we see. For example, I saw a world where nothing was working out for Henry, and that Earth, if that is the planet he is on, hates him. Stepping in a puddle, having an elevator disagree with his presence, and generally being the cause of everyone's trouble gives me the feeling that poor Henry has bad karma issues. Someone else will see a nightmare. Or perhaps Henry is in hell, custom made for him. But is it really depressing? Or is that just the way I was seeing it? It's worth detaching yourself a bit and feel the movie's dreamy state set in your brain for a while. Rather then analyzing everything, allow it to seep in and haunt you for the rest of your life.I can continue telling you all kinds of things that happen, or I think happened, such as adultery, murder, & suicide, but you probably won't find all of these things in the movie. You may find that adultery is just a fantasy, murder is actually love, and suicide is an awakening. Or none of these things. Or something different.Regardless, you must see Eraserhead. It's a film that begs conversation after you see it, but that's just what I thought. To someone else, this may be over-indulgence, egotism by David Lynch, a weird movie that must be forgotten to others, and to a select few, the most imaginative, visually stunning work of art on film.

Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I.

The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http\/\/www.apotpourriofvestiges.com\/ ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"17 May 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Stay away from this movie.Just watching it is like having Michael Myers gut you to pieces, and that is exactly how I felt after I finished watching this movie.The idea is terrible!

It is the Bond film which every Bond film tries to emulate, but almost none have succeeded. Perhaps the reason for this film's success is its gripping and intriguing plot, which though intricate, is easy to comprehend-the brainchild of Bond's creator Ian Flemming, which first appeared in literary form in 1957. The film adaptation certainly does the novel justice and then some more. SPECTRE, the mysterious criminal organization bent on world domination, has conceived of an elaborate plan by means of which they not only hope to extort money from the Soviets, but also severely embarrass, humiliate and ultimately destroy British secret service agent, James Bond, in retaliation for his murder of their agent, Dr. No (in the previous film). Having already been briefly acquainted with the plot against 007 in the beginning, the viewer knows that when the suave and sophisticated agent is sent to Istanbul, seemingly to rescue a defecting Russian agent who claims to have fallen in love with him and is bringing along a Lektor decoding machine (the ultimate price the Secret Service has been after for years) with her as her 'dowry', something is not quite right. There is an exciting fight sequence in a gypsy camp, a nighttime assassination in an Istanbul street, and the major highlight of the film, a train ride across Europe in the Orient Express. Also noteworthy is Robert Shaw's role as Donovan Grant, the SPECTRE assassin whose mission is to kill Bond, who maintains a subtle and ominous presence throughout the film. Though Grant is only really a henchman in the larger scheme of the villains plan, it is his confrontation with Bond which proves to be the climax of the film. Perhaps one of the endearing qualities of this film, apart from its realism and its chilling and tense Cold War atmosphere, is the fact that is in no way a formulaic Bond film (of course, back then, the classic Bond formula had not yet been developed). From Russia with Love contains more twists and surprises than any other Bond film, most of which have largely stuck to the formula, with minor variations here and there. Also, while Connery's Bond is quite tough as nails and a dangerous professional spy, hes still quite human and vulnerable and not a superhero by any stretch of the imagination. This film is ultimately the Bond film against which all other Bond films are ranked and proves that all the CGI, excessively gritty violence, implausible stunts and world domination plots in the world cant top an intellectual work of genius.

This isn't true. The simple stories are easy to get right, but a complex ensemble piece with multiple protagonists and numerous subplots can be just as effective, although it's a lot harder to pull off successfully. From Here to Eternity stands in the tradition of The Best Years of Our Lives, Seven Samurai and The Godfather, of pictures with interwoven plots that have become classics thanks to strong screen writing, intelligent direction and powerful acting performances.Part of the reason From Here to Eternity works is because it is very quick in establishing its characters and plot lines. It opens with a series of interlinking scenes, introducing us to Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Philip Ober, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, giving us clues about Clift's past and hinting at the future relationship between Lancaster and Kerr, all in the space of five minutes. Director Fred Zinnemann, with a confidence that is lacking in his earliest features, shoots these scenes with subtle technique to give them maximum storytelling effect. For example, he gives Clift's character a superb introduction, walking at a right angle to the marching column until he is brought right into close-up. Once the dialogue begins he uses sudden changes of angle to highlight certain lines, for example the close-up of Lancaster telling Kerr I'd be happy to help, at which point the audience know exactly what is going to happen between those two characters. Donna Reed is of course introduced a little later, but to compensate she is given a very distinctive first shot, framed on her own immediately after some busy crowd shots.But Zinnemann's direction isn't all pure functionalism. He makes sparing use of attention-grabbing stylisation when the moment demands it, such as the dolly-out through the rain-soaked window during Lancaster and Kerr's first kiss. And this stylisation even helps keep the narrative together, for example cutting from the roaring sea at the end of the famous beach scene to the smoke rising from Clift's cigarette. Throughout the various parallel plots there is a tone of melancholy and regret, and Zinnemann keeps this commonality with his consistency of style.Of course, you get the same problem or at least the same feature in From Here to Eternity as you do in They Died with Their Boots on or Titanic, in that the audience, knowing their history, know what is going to happen at the end. The strength of the non-combat story lines is such that we forget when and where we are, and as such it is important that we are eased into the finale of the Pearl Harbour attack so it does not seem such a surreal break in tone. This is done with characteristic subtlety, with two objects placed noticeably yet not obtrusively into the frame to jog our memories. The first is a calendar showing December 6th on the wall beside Burt Lancaster, and the other a signpost reading Pearl Harbour after his final meeting with Kerr.One of the biggest challenges for the makers of an ensemble piece is that you need a larger than normal pool of leading players, and yet you must ensure none of them will overshadow the others. This is another thing they got right in From Here to Eternity. Clift, Kerr and Lancaster are all competent performers without big egos, and they all give steady performances, even if they are far from career-bests. As to Sinatra, what's amazing is not the quality of his performance (it was always evident he could act) but that he was even allowed to play a dramatic, non-musical role. It just goes to show the increased flexibility of cinema in the 1950s, as well as the rising status of the musical genre. To give it some perspective, can you imagine Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby having done the same thing in the 30s? From Here to Eternity won 1953's Best Picture Oscar, and like all successful pictures was followed by a host of imitators. 1955's Battle Cry for example is another many-stranded story about soldiers at the start of World War Two, and even features a rather tepid knock-off of the famous beach scene. However, while Battle Cry has some nice moments, structurally it is an absolute mess, an example of how easy it is to do a botch job on a complex storyline.

The first is a calendar showing December 6th on the wall beside Burt Lancaster, and the other a signpost reading Pearl Harbour after his final meeting with Kerr.One of the biggest challenges for the makers of an ensemble piece is that you need a larger than normal pool of leading players, and yet you must ensure none of them will overshadow the others. This is another thing they got right in From Here to Eternity. Clift, Kerr and Lancaster are all competent performers without big egos, and they all give steady performances, even if they are far from career-bests. As to Sinatra, what's amazing is not the quality of his performance (it was always evident he could act) but that he was even allowed to play a dramatic, non-musical role. It just goes to show the increased flexibility of cinema in the 1950s, as well as the rising status of the musical genre. To give it some perspective, can you imagine Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby having done the same thing in the 30s? From Here to Eternity won 1953's Best Picture Oscar, and like all successful pictures was followed by a host of imitators. 1955's Battle Cry for example is another many-stranded story about soldiers at the start of World War Two, and even features a rather tepid knock-off of the famous beach scene. However, while Battle Cry has some nice moments, structurally it is an absolute mess, an example of how easy it is to do a botch job on a complex storyline. That's why From Here to Eternity is such a rarity, being an ensemble piece that really works.

However, it is ride, boldly, ride, not ride baldy ride. Sorry to nit-pick. This film is full of scenes and characters that capture the classic depictions of courage, bravery, humor and honor that carved our visions of the Old West. Cole Thornton was a hired gun, but had a conscience. Mississippi finished his 2 year quest to avenge the murder of Johnny Diamond, who raised him. J.P. Harrah was a respected lawman who became a pathetic drunk after a lost love. Then with the help of Cole, Mississippi and the bugle-blowing Bull, regained his dignity while staving off the land-grab attempt of Bart Jason. It is no 'Dances With Wolves', but it is a good look into the masterful style of Howard Hawks. This film is appropriate for all ages, and the subtle messages are quite powerful.
