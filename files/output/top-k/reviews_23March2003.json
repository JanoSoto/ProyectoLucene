This a sobering masterpiece, devoid of all of Raimi's usual tricks and flourishes.  That is not to say that this film lacks style, it is simply a different kind of style that Raimi employs here. Three men (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Brent Briscoe) stumble across a gym bag containing four million dollars.  They institute a plan that almost from the first word becomes unhinged and disastrous.  The way Scott B. Smith's story unfolds is brilliant, so I will not speak too much upon it.  The really great element of this film is that the actions the characters take are completely plausible.  These people are alive, free from the restrictions of plot mechanics.  A SIMPLE PLAN becomes a character study of sorts.  Consider the scene in which Lou (Briscoe) is tricked into being tape recorded, does he admit he has been cornered and give up?  Would he?  The psychology of what he does do is perfectly believable considering what we know about the character.  The actions of Jacob (Thornton) are another good example, he simply does not have the mental capacity to lie convincingly.  He tries to be clever, but fails at every turn and he hates himself for it.  I admire a film that ends the way A SIMPLE PLAN does.  It may not please those who crave Hollywood resolutions, but it is honest and does not betray what has come before.   The cast is great  Paxton (who can be irritating), plays his role of the slightly-above-dumb every man perfectly; Briscoe is perfect as the boarish drunkard Lou Chambers.  However, the films best performances are delivered by Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.  Thornton's monologue on evil is stunning and his Jacob, with humble dreams and hopes, becomes endearing and sympathetic...a fact makes the climax all the more powerful.  And watch Fonda in the scene where she is breast feeding her newborn child, how her voice and demeanor change when she speaks of the plan; it is a chilling sequence.  The rest of the rather intimate cast, including Chelcie Ross and Gary Cole, is equally as good.  A SIMPLE PLAN exudes style and skill.  The stark photography by Alar Kivilo, the haunting score by Danny Elfman, Sam Raimi's understated direction all help this complicated tale unwind until its' final frame.  This film does not waste a single image a fox bounding across the virgin snow, an empty window, the fresh innocent life of a newborn child, these symbols speak volumes of what A SIMPLE PLAN is about.  They add a rich subtext to the sad violence and frustration the characters find themselves entangled in.  One of the best films of the 90's, and certainly Raimi's most mature effort, A SIMPLE PLAN is sure to resonate with the viewer long after the film has ended.  10\/10                   ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Those who have followed the career of Sam Raimi will be surprised by A  SIMPLE PLAN.

Titles shouldn't have colons. Call your film K-19, or call it The Widowmaker; don't try to have it both ways.But such concerns are washed away by what happens when the voyage is underway. Before it's over we're made to watch disturbing footage of sailors working away inside the bit of the reactor where ten minutes' exposure might not have been fatal if they'd been wearing radiation suits, which they weren't; we're also made to endure the sight of their their blistered flesh afterwards. It's hard going watching this. But here's the thing at no point did I resent being shown this. We needed to see it, really, for the characters to have been treated with the proper amount of respect. Showing us the horrible nuclear scars is not gratuitous nastiness, not manipulation, but just a way of making sure that we get our taste of the natural consequences of the situation, too.I was forced to the conclusion that this is a film with very little in the way of false heroics. For the most part it's the real thing. Cold-war Russia, like the USA, was isolated from the world at large; the armed forces of both countries were (and are) isolated still further; and, as if more isolation is even possible, these sailors were effectively imprisoned on a secret submarine in the middle of nowhere. They're torn between fear of the immediate physical dangers facing them, fear of what the state could do to them even if they survive, and fear of nuclear war. No wonder their hands are inclined to shake. Bigelow gets all of this across and, more importantly, doesn't forget any of it just for the sake of getting a plot point or one-liner across.At least, she doesn't do so while the sub is at sea. If you were to start the film with the ship setting out and end it with ... well, the end of the voyage (I won't say how it ends), you'd have a faultless film. Alas, there's an epilogue. It's such a stupid one it's hard even to connect it with what has gone before.It ends with the same poisonous message of such standard modern-day hymns to the military as Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers. It's the we don't fight for cause or country, we fight for each other spiel. I've heard this echoed so often by people who serve in the US armed forces (or claim to) it makes my blood run cold.

The army is an instrument designed to kill people, and we actually want to LET it think that it's the only thing that matters? That it's above not only the law but morality as well?The preceding film makes nonsense of this. The crew of K-19 elect to submerge their ship and risk their lives rather than risk an accident which might see the United States retaliate against Moscow precisely because they DO have other things on their mind. These people, luckily, are human beings first and sailors second. So why is the prologue - which really begins with the military trial the officers face upon their return - even there? Why is it allowed to have precisely the same revolting flavour (watered down, thank goodness) that films subsidised and vetted by the Pentagon invariably have?I suspect so much of this drivel is being produced that it now finds its way into perfectly good films, like this one, by accident.

It vividly and brutally portrays what war is like in an era of computers, helicopters, far range missiles, and select highly trained soldiers, without ever losing it's touch with the human side of the story or falling back on cliché. The film often feels like you're watching jazzed up news footage, with shaky news-camera type shot framing; the information always given bluntly through officers and soldiers giving orders. Thus, the profundity is taken from the visual cues, characters, and the chain of events of the story itself. The movie is extremely intense, the action and violence rarely stopping, yet unlike a lot of war films, it never feels gratuitous (shooting-for-the-heck-of-it-with-no-cinematic-reason), and the violence, special effects (crashing, building destruction, explosions) and gore don't look fake and are probably the most realistic fighting scenes I've ever seen. It all just adds to the realism and psuedo-documentary feel of the film. Suprisingly enough, it all helps the storyline as well. You must pay attention or lose track of the storyline and characters (hint keep an eye on their helmets, their names are written on the helmet band, and it proves VERY useful in keeping track of the characters). Unlike some war films, the many characters, despite their fairly divided and limited amount of screentime, endear themselves to the viewer, and the actors showcase some excellent acting. This isn't an acting film whatsoever, with very little scope, time, or material for the actors to create memorable characters, but this film seems to overcome that, and the acting is one of the shining points of the film. In one bloody and intense scene (and my favorite scene of the film), a young soldier (who we're inconspicuously acquainted with earlier in the film) is seriously wounded, and the ensuing scene, though intensely bloody and not `mushy', is also highly emotional. Scott and the actors just let the scene roll scene honestly and let it play out. The film is full of many such scenes, but it never once tries to manipulate your emotions. It is brutally honest and technical, sometimes confusing, but it was the news, is the stories of these men, and will one day be history. But even more than the freshly conceived look at the human cost of the war and the amazing street fighting sequences, probably the most compelling and exciting aspect of the film is learning about what happened in Mogadishu and seeing how modern wars are fought. I had known almost nothing about it, but the film very clearly lays out what happened, and shows the tactics and dangers that modern soldiers face while going into hostile territory.This film is an important look at modern life that will be a very important source for people in years to come, to see what modern combat is like. Ironically enough, a year after it was made, the world is seeing, live on the news, what modern war is made of. Hopefully it will shed some perspective on the dangers that our soldiers face on a day to day basis. It also shows how great filmmaker can still take an old subject and make it fresh and new, but most importantly, the film brilliantly shows that through the years human cost, bravery, suffering, and sacrifice hasn't and will not change.

But whereas my lack of interest in the other movies continued when I woke up, with Amélie I continued to be enthralled by the strange mix of reality and fantasy that the heroine's world revolved around.Seeing it on video again, it worked just as well without any sleep interruptions; this hugely successful French movie may well be a basic trifle at its centre, and it may play at times like a Gallic take on Ally McBeal with a dash of Emma - a dreamy young woman takes it upon herself to move among people's lives for the better (helping those who deserve it and tormenting those who don't), but finds that she in turn needs help in sorting out her OWN life - but its high rating among IMDb users is understandable.

However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras &#150; if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent.  Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.
