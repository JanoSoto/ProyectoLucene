[{"date":"23 August 2010","score":"","review":" The Scream Trilogy is the film series that redefined fear. They revived the horror genre, making films such as Psycho, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween proud. Wes Craven is the master of suspense. When Kevin Williamson's script was out on the prow, Craven was really the only proper choice to direct. His method of scaring the audience never fails. He has so much control over the three stories without the feeling of over-directing. For many years, Freddy Kruger was hailed as Craven's masterpiece, this trilogy is now and will be his crowning achievement. Kevin Williamson wrote the original and the sequel, then Ehren Kruger came along to write the third when Williamson declined. However, Williamson basically outlined the story for Kruger, leaving the dialogue and details to Kruger. All three scripts are absolutely incredible and tantalizing original. The story grows as the series continues and it becomes more intricate. Now, it'd be tough to choose between the three, which is my favorite. But, I think as the story becomes more complicated, I was more intrigued, which may be the only factor to say the films get better as we go along. That aside, the three are so close together with quality, entertainment, suspense, and as films overall. It's difficult for a film trilogy to achieve that. Most times, sequels get worse, but here? No such thing.The thing that really separates Scream from the average film series besides the screenplay, the direction, the suspense level, the tech stuff, and the visuals is the acting. This is what I call true acting ensemble. The two dazzlingly standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally grows up and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a wannabe b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. Parker Posey is the best addition to the entire trilogy in Scream 3. She is given a very meaty comedic role and she puts her soul into the role. Without a doubt the funniest character in the trilogy. She has great chemistry with Courteney Cox and David Arquette in the love triangle. Cox, especially because essentially Posey is playing Cox's character in Stab, which is Scream (a film within a film). I can't picture anyone disliking Jennifer Jolie (Posey's character). She has so much fun with the role and we have fun watching her. Patrick Dempsey gives his best film performance here in once of his first film performances. He drives his character without any noticeable fears. Part 3, gives the cast a chance to express some comedy into the series, and everyone is perfectly cast. Except for Kelly Rutherford, who won the of Christine over Kate Winslet? WTF? I mean seriously? C'mon. Jamie Kennedy has a cameo here as the deceased film geek, Randy, which is pitch-perfect. The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen. The films also include a killer score and frightening sets (especially John Milton's house, where the climax of Scream 3 takes place).Bob Weinstein, the producers of the Scream trilogy, now demanded a fourth installment. Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best. Overall, without a doubt, the best trilogy ever made. My personal favorite films; they're fun, very scary, with excellent performances, writing and directing. What more could you want? The three easiest 10s I've ever given. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2010","score":"","review":" The Scream Trilogy is the film series that redefined fear.

This is what I call true acting ensemble. The two dazzling standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally grows up and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a wannabe b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. In Scream 2, she finally lets lose and says 'I don't care, and gives in. Right as she confesses herself, the situation diminishes. Cox is so good in the scene where she is the sound room and sees Dewey being stabbed through the mirrors (to what she thought was his death). It's heartbreaking. Scream 1's acting was the most surprising. Mainly because with the horror genre you tend not to think, Oh, I'm in for some great acting. It's stereotypical. After you see the first scene with Drew Barrymore, you'll be blown away; I was. She is so powerful in her one scene. She kind of pulls a Janet Leigh in Psycho. She was the biggest movie star, at the time, of the Scream cast. No one expected her to be the opening kill. Her acting isn't short of Leigh's either. For that scene to work, you needed an actor who could really hold his or her own and make it convincing. Drew was that actor. Skeet Ulrich plays effectively the infamous, Billy Loomis. Ulrich is spine chilling and creepy here, but does it with so much charisma.The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen.

Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best.

The films take place in 1757 in the American Colonies.The films starts off with three of the Mohicans hunting and successfully killing an antelope. Then the Mohicans are recruited by the British Army to become a militia and are promised that if their homes are attacked that they can go back and defend them by Major Heyward. Major Heyward is dating and plans on marrying Colonel Munro's daughter Cora (Stowe). While the Major, Cora and her sister, and other British troops they are ambushed by Native Americans that are supported by the French only to be saved in perfect time by three Mohicans, including Hawkeye (Day-Lewis). From there Hawkeye and Cora begin to start falling for each other as the tension between the Native Americans, French, and British grows in this corny adventure story.The plot of this film is extremely weak. It is full of romance and drama... just like every other film except that every other film is remotely interesting. The whole time I was watching this film I was losing my interest because there was nothing interesting going on. Everything was so predictable and many things were just unbelievable. Such as how one of the Native Americans faced about twenty and was able to kill them all. And also at the beginning during the ambush that everyone died that was not a significant part. During the film is was queue brutal murder to make an emotional reaction and queue a minor character's death. It just seemed so staged and traditional that it was not at all enjoyable.The acting in the film was not all that great. The great Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors of all time, is not known to be such a great actor for this film. Yes, he did put on a believable accent, but I was not able to feel a connection to his character. Nor could I feel one to Stowe's whose performance was not in any way special. All she did was look sad at certain parts and like she was in love at others. Another poor thing is that I did not feel any connection between their characters. If I feel no connection with myself with the characters or between the characters themselves then the acting is not very good.The direction of this film by Michael Mann was under par as well. Anyone can get beautiful shots of beautiful landscape there is nothing noteworthy about that. Mann didn't succeed in getting beautiful shots of not so beautiful landscape, which is what a great director needs to be able to do. A great director also needs to connect the characters on the screen so a connection from the audience to the characters can be made, but yet Mann fails again. Now Michael Mann is a very successful director and he goes on to make some pretty solid films so don't think I am bashing him. It is just good to know that he improves in the future.The best part of the film is easily the score. It is moving and provides the emotion that the rest of the film is not able to give. Perfect for this kind of epic film. The film won an Oscar for sound which it definitely deserves.Overall I give this film a 3\/10, due to the fact that it is very bad for the reasons explained above. I don't know why this film is so highly rated everywhere I check, maybe it is not for me. Anyway I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys historical, romance, or epic films.

The films take place in 1757 in the American Colonies.The films starts off with three of the Mohicans hunting and successfully killing an antelope. Then the Mohicans are recruited by the British Army to become a militia and are promised that if their homes are attacked that they can go back and defend them by Major Heyward. Major Heyward is dating and plans on marrying Colonel Munro's daughter Cora (Stowe). While the Major, Cora and her sister, and other British troops they are ambushed by Native Americans that are supported by the French only to be saved in perfect time by three Mohicans, including Hawkeye (Day-Lewis). From there Hawkeye and Cora begin to start falling for each other as the tension between the Native Americans, French, and British grows in this corny adventure story.The plot of this film is extremely weak. It is full of romance and drama... just like every other film except that every other film is remotely interesting. The whole time I was watching this film I was losing my interest because there was nothing interesting going on. Everything was so predictable and many things were just unbelievable. Such as how one of the Native Americans faced about twenty and was able to kill them all. And also at the beginning during the ambush that everyone died that was not a significant part. During the film is was queue brutal murder to make an emotional reaction and queue a minor character's death. It just seemed so staged and traditional that it was not at all enjoyable.The acting in the film was not all that great.

Remember what Robotech did with Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada? Digimon the movie does the same, only with less effort made to keep up the illusion of the 3 separate stories being 1 coherent tale. While long time fans will cry foul of the show once they hear of the numerous cuts made to the original OVAs, the American Digimon the movie never did aim for the otakus. The target audience for this movie is no doubt the kids who have watched Saban's adaptation of the Digimon anime series.On first viewing, it is easy to mistake this show for an actual made in America animated movie. The art and animation style is very different from the TV series and in fact follows more of the western animation conventions than Japanese anime. For example, the level of detail in the artwork is painfully low, with characters being just simple outlines with flat colors without even simple shadows or clothing folds. The characters' eyes are smaller with less of that anime shine, and the designs have been simplified somewhat. However, the animation is a lot more fluid and expressive. Movements are shown in full with little of the usual cost cutting measures that anime uses such as repeating stock footage or panning the camera over a still background. Not exactly movie level animation, especially when compared to other theatrical animated movies, but nonetheless satisfactory.The combination of Three OVAs naturally translate to 3 loosely connected acts told from the narrative standpoint of Kari, one of the main characters. The first act taking place eight years ago, details the first encounter between the Kamiya siblings, Tai and Kari, and digimon. One day a mysterious egg appears from out of their computer and soon hatches into a cute bubble blowing creature. The children decide to keep it while not letting their parent find out, but the creature mutates overnight into a more monstrous lizard-like form. What follows is a devastating battle in the streets of their neighborhood between two ferocious Digimon, a battle only hinted at in the TV series.Now this first act seems rather unnecessary. It has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie and serves nothing more than to introduce those who are not familiar with the Digimon franchise to the Kamiya siblings and a few core concepts. A very refreshing thing was the re-interpretation of Digital Monsters as scary monstrous beasts, a stark contrast to their less threatening portrayal in the TV series.THe second act is possibly the heart and soul of this movie. Four years after the Kamiyas' first digimon encounter and a short time after the events of the first Digimon TV series, Izzy the computer genius discovers a computer virus that is actually an evolving digimon. As Tai and Izzy race to gather the digidestined for one final battle, their digimon buddies must enter the internet and destroy the virus digimon before it becomes too powerful. The stakes get raised once the virus, calling itself Diaboromon, hacks into servers all over the world turning all computers crazy. Society gets thrown into chaos and the technology that even the digidestined take for granted, such as emails and telephone, now becomes the source of their downfall.Truly epic in scale, Digimon The movie's second act has both surface level thrills and deeper emotional themes. There is a nice subtext satiring society's dependence on technology and the dehumanizing effect of internet communication (a theme that director Mamoru Hosoda expounded upon in 2010's Summer Wars anime movie). It is in this segment where the English script shines the most. Witty in-jokes and word puns pepper the energetic dialog delivered by a fine cast of voice actors who masterfully grow into their roles.So enjoyable was the Diaboromon segment, right up to its awesome climax involving a brand spanking powerful new digimon taking on gazillions of diaboromon clones, that it is regrettable that Digimon The Movie had to end on an extremely weak note.The third segment takes place in present day and it involves the remnants of the diaboromon virus from four years ago returning and infecting a digimon called Kokomon. Kokomon is one half of a set of twins. He and his twin brother Terriermon belonged to an American kid called Willis. The digidestined from the Digimon season 2 get drawn into this conflict as Kokomon becomes increasingly powerful. But unknown even to them, is that Willis' digimon twins are somehow connected to the Kamiya's first digimon encounter 8 years ago and Diaboromon's emergence four years ago.This act is where it all falls apart. Not only is it the weakest in terms of story and its link to the previous two acts, but the writing seems rushed. Jokes that were supposed to sound timely and witty end up being really out of place and only serve to spoil the otherwise serious tone of the show. As the act reaches its climax, the editing done to the scenes becomes even more slip shod leaving many gaping plot holes. Even the battle sequences have been edited to the point of incoherence. And that ending? All too sudden and honestly, a little freaky especially when taken in context with the music.Whether a change for the better or worse, the music incorporates many American pop tunes that, save for one, effectively complements the scenes they are coupled with. At least the catchy music is a good distraction from the ear grating digi-rap that opens the film and the other shortcomings of the movie.Fans of Digimon, especially the Japanese digimon series, would undoubtedly give this a miss. It is recommended however that one at least watch the second act of this movie just for the fun of it.

Egon, ray and Winston are all back as the ghost busting team and are all so likable and you just want to be there busting with them. they are definitely a great team and have great chemistry as one. this time they go up against viggo the Carpathian. or perhaps HE IS Viggo!. he is the scariest villain the GB's go up against in the 2 films. nothing really scared me in the first film, except maybe slimer charging peter but even that was pretty tame. viggo is a truly scary villain, and that painting......wow. its the stuff nightmares are made of. i know that as a kid i had horrible ones of this guy. like they say, a movie is only as good as its villain, well that is true here, viggo is terrifying. and the slime also creep ed me out. the yanoosh (sp?) character is hysterical and is played brilliantly.

And while I've greatly enjoyed some of these films, others have struck me as overrated drags.Battleship Potemkin falls somewhere in the middle of the scale. I admire the film for its groundbreaking direction and sequences of extreme suspense and horror. But, on the other hand, much of the film is a little ... dull. Indeed, my girlfriend is now snoozing heavily in the next room, having passed out during the long sequence of the Potemkin approaching the rest of the fleet. (I suspect that I liked the film a little more than she did. Bless.) Now, I should unpack what I mean by dull, because I hate it when people are imprecise with their criticisms. I quite like a lot of films that can be construed as dull -- Twilight Samurai, Alphaville, Tokyo Story, and so on. But these films aren't boring to me; they're paced in such a way as to invite contemplation rather than generate excitement. And because I care about the characters in these films, this pacing doesn't bother me at all; indeed, it draws me into the story even more deeply.The trouble with Battleship Potemkin is that it doesn't have great characters; nor does it really invite you to contemplate anything. At heart, it's an action movie designed to appeal to the most basic of emotions, not your brain. So, in the slow stretches of the film between action segments, Potemkin sort of grinds down. This problem doesn't spoil the film completely, but it does in my opinion prevent it from being an all-time classic.So why did I give it an 8? Because it truly is fascinating to watch. Because the Odessa steps sequence is rightly celebrated (and the imitations aren't as good). Because the propaganda bits are actually sort of interesting. And, of course, it's full of memorable images that are both beautiful and terrifying.And yet, I can't help being a little annoyed at film critics for over-praising films that were groundbreaking for purely technical reasons. Even though film is a largely visual medium, shouldn't we be more invested in plot, characters, and themes than in novel use of cuts\/dissolves\/montage\/etc.? There's more to movies than clever trickery with the camera -- or there should be, anyway.In short, Battleship Potemkin looks great and is a fascinating piece of film history, but it might not entertain you, and it almost certainly won't enlighten you.

The Toons have there own home, Toontown, but there star in live-action films and can do almost anything. A high-boiled, heavy drinking Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), whom brother was murdered by a Toon, is assigned a case by a movie studio to take incriminating photos of Jessica Rabbit (voiced Kathleen Turner) and Acme Corporation owner Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) to get Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to focus on his latest movie. But when Marvin Acme is found dead Roger Rabbit is the prime suspect, with the sadistic Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to destroy the Toon. But upon further investigation by Valiant he discovers a wider conspiracy over the ownership of Toontown.With a budget of $70 Million Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a very expensive film for its time. Director Robert Zemeckis is known for using the most state of the art technology available to him. He uses it to great effect, blending live-action and animation together. For children they will enjoy seeing cartoon characters and live-action actors working together on screen and the over-the-top slapstick comedy that animation can offer. The animation is very much of the style of a Looney Toons cartoons that I used to watch when I was younger, with similarities to Tom and Jerry shorts. There is also pretty of verbal comedy and it does play on its crossover, like the rivalry between Donald Duck and Daffy Duck. But there is pretty for adults, with elements of film noir in direction, character and plot, strong in jokes of classic cartoons and filmmaking and excellent writing with it's plot and characterisation. There is of course also a nostalgia factor.Who Framed Roger Rabbit was Hoskins' first major Hollywood film and he does an excellent job as the serious Private Detective who harbours bitter feelings towards Toons. He plays the role very much like a detective with the usual backstory and problems but ends up forming a partnership with some very zany characters. He also had a tough job because for the most part Hoskins had to act alone. He shows his comic side as well and with Zemeckis' skilled direction show a compelling backstory to the character. Lloyd was brilliant as the sinister, scary and sadistic villain he truly captures evil and is more scary then most horror villains. His sadism is shown by ruthlessly killing an animated shoe which is enough to give people nightmares for weeks.A great family film.

He plays the role very much like a detective with the usual backstory and problems but ends up forming a partnership with some very zany characters. He also had a tough job because for the most part Hoskins had to act alone. He shows his comic side as well and with Zemeckis' skilled direction show a compelling backstory to the character. Lloyd was brilliant as the sinister, scary and sadistic villain he truly captures evil and is more scary then most horror villains. His sadism is shown by ruthlessly killing an animated shoe which is enough to give people nightmares for weeks.A great family film.

The Toons have there own home, Toontown, but there star in live-action films and can do almost anything. A high-boiled, heavy drinking Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), whom brother was murdered by a Toon, is assigned a case by a movie studio to take incriminating photos of Jessica Rabbit (voiced Kathleen Turner) and Acme Corporation owner Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) to get Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to focus on his latest movie. But when Marvin Acme is found dead Roger Rabbit is the prime suspect, with the sadistic Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to destroy the Toon. But upon further investigation by Valiant he discovers a wider conspiracy over the ownership of Toontown.With a budget of $70 Million Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a very expensive film for its time.

The plot is fun, but highly contrived -- Murray plays an American tourist in London whose brother (Peter Gallagher) tries to get him out of his hair by booking him into a live theater experience. Murray's character, Wally, is mistaken for a real hit man and finds himself caught up in an international conspiracy to bring the cold war back.There are a lot of good solid laughs coming from the situational comedy of Murray's predicament -- he never realizes at any point that it's not all a game, so he constantly puts himself in danger. Along the way he picks up the mistress of a government official (Joanne Whalley) and falls for her. Whalley unfortunately can't carry the kind of emotional weight they've put on her. Gallagher and Alfred Molina grab most of the unexpected laughs. The climax is a bit predictable and under-whelming.I found myself enjoying this one more when I first saw it in the late 90s. Perhaps the premise of the cold war situation is even more stale now than it was in 1998. Basically though I think this is a fun, light movie that works well for one viewing but can't really be cherished the way Murray's best comedies can. The direction by Amiel is uninspired and uninvolving (the only other film I've seen by Amiel is the disappointing heist film Entrapment). You have to wonder if the whole thing was just a frozen funds tax write-off for the company that produced it. There are enough laughs in the first part, especially a funny car chase and miscommunication between the two brothers. However the film doesn't fully pay off the viewer's investment.

Although at first hesitant of embracing his controversial work, he soon changes his mind when he realizes what this would do for his career and science. But, some problems arise when trying to revive the creature...Young Frankenstein is hugely popular, scoring 8 out of 10 on IMDb and considered by many to be Mel Brooks' best and one of the funniest comedies of all time. Is it good? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. But I neither think it's the funniest of Mel Brooks' work (History of the World, The Producers and maybe even Silent Movie are funnier) or one of the greatest comedies. Maybe it's not aging well or I just don't get it, but I just don't get it.The bulk of the jokes are vaudeville and slapstick takes on the classic Universal Studios version of Frankenstein, even going so far as to use many of the same props. And while some of the scenes stand out as funny (the Puttin' on the Ritz scene, for one) the bulk of the plot is very nearly the same as the classic film. I respect the homage, even the use of the black and white film, but it does not deviate enough to be unique in my mind.In contrast, consider Brooks' Spaceballs. Yes, it is a parody of Star Wars. But it does not follow the plot too closely, deviates in almost every way, incorporates other plots and science fiction references... and has a whole variety of humor styles mixed in. While maybe not the best of Brooks' work, this film is a much more solid comedy and stands up better for a variety of audiences. (IMDB rates it lower, but I cannot agree on that.) Marty Feldman (Igor) is often overshadowed by his co-stars and Brooks, but he makes a strong Igor, and his eye condition could not have been better utilized. This character is the one clear improvement from the original film, and should not be overlooked.Gene Wilder (and Gene Hackman) were both great, of course. Many consider this to be Wilder's best role. I simply cannot accept that Frankenstein, as great a character as he is, somehow trumps Willy Wonka. As made clear when Johnny Depp -- a brilliant actor -- tried to be Wonka, there is no replacing Wilder, even by the best stars of our day.Don't get me wrong. The film is great, the directing and cinematography are excellent. The cast is amazing, particularly some of the supporting cast (like Teri Garr as Inga). But to say this is Mel Brooks' best film, one of the best comedies of all time or Gene Wilder's best role is just not correct, in my opinion.

Standing unfairly in Spielberg's shadow is Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper, who makes Poltergeist eerie and suspenseful enough to keep the film engaging when the special effects are full-blown and the lid has been popped off in terms of realism. The subtle and effective camera movements at various moments will keep you on edge, some technique that draws slightly upon Hitchcock (as well as Spielberg, who undoubtedly had a hand or two in much of the production seeing as he was on set most of the time).Poltergeist tells the story of a young family in California living in a development who experiences supernatural activity in its house starting with the youngest daughter hearing voices in the TV set and continuing with moving kitchen furniture. At first it seems like some fascinating paranormal activity, but soon it becomes anything but subtle.Despite the film's full-on embrace of the supernatural instead of sticking with minute suspense, there's still a strong curiosity factor that makes the ghostly mayhem intriguing rather than scattered and unnecessarily chaotic. Much of the events happen before we have any true sense of what's going on, which draws us in to figuring out what the events might signify and of course how they'll be resolved. In this sense, Poltergeist remains suspenseful throughout, making it effective through the excessive use of strobe lights and wind machines.The cast also possesses an anonymity which keeps the focus on what's happening in the house and suggests that this could happen to anyone.

It focuses on a cursed rat-monkey that bites a horrible woman at the zoo, turning her into a zombie and leaving her much abused son to try and hide it from everyone. He's in love with a girl who his mother hated, a gypsy girl who was told by a tarot card reading that great love and horrible things were in her future.Understatement of the century.Naturally, the zombies spread and soon the town is terrorized by them. This film is depraved, so very, decadently depraved! It is gory, indeed gorier than anything I have ever seen in my life. It may be the goriest film ever made, I cannot say for sure only because I've not seen every splatter fest the world has to offer. But it is so gory you cannot believe,and utterly hilarious! The gore is fake, but no less entertaining and more funny because of this. Since the movie is nothing but gore, I am loath to spoil any of this inventive carnage for the first time viewer. Just go see it.However, it is almost too much of a good thing. I was queasy many times during the film, and I have a cast iron stomach for fake gore. Saw doesn't even bother me in the slightest, but this is no Saw. It is much more intensely bloody. It borderlines disgust for me, so if you dislike gore DO NO, I REPEAT DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! You will hate it, you probably will be sick, you will be irrevocably scared by it.However, if you want zombie splatter comedy, you can almost do no better than this!

It focuses on a cursed rat-monkey that bites a horrible woman at the zoo, turning her into a zombie and leaving her much abused son to try and hide it from everyone. He's in love with a girl who his mother hated, a gypsy girl who was told by a tarot card reading that great love and horrible things were in her future.Understatement of the century.Naturally, the zombies spread and soon the town is terrorized by them. This film is depraved, so very, decadently depraved! It is gory, indeed gorier than anything I have ever seen in my life. It may be the goriest film ever made, I cannot say for sure only because I've not seen every splatter fest the world has to offer. But it is so gory you cannot believe,and utterly hilarious! The gore is fake, but no less entertaining and more funny because of this. Since the movie is nothing but gore, I am loath to spoil any of this inventive carnage for the first time viewer. Just go see it.However, it is almost too much of a good thing. I was queasy many times during the film, and I have a cast iron stomach for fake gore. Saw doesn't even bother me in the slightest, but this is no Saw. It is much more intensely bloody. It borderlines disgust for me, so if you dislike gore DO NO, I REPEAT DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! You will hate it, you probably will be sick, you will be irrevocably scared by it.However, if you want zombie splatter comedy, you can almost do no better than this!
