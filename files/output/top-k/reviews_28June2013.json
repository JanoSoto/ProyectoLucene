It literally picks up where the 1978 classic finished, Dr. Loomis looks outside to see that Michael (who had just been shot six times) has survived his wounds and has run off from the scene of the crime. Laurie Strode who just went through the attack from Michael is meanwhile taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. After dispatching a random girl, Michael takes off towards the hospital in order to finish what he started and kill Laurie! He'll first have to get through a handful of nurses as well as a determined Dr. Loomis in order to accomplish his mission.I LOVE this sequel to 'Halloween' (1978), a film in which I gave a perfect score to. The setting first of all is a great one for a slasher flick. The hospital is dark and creepy and filled with doctors and nurses who were clearly thrown in to add to the body count. The musical score is just as effective, and Michael Myers is just as deranged as he was in the first film. The acting all around was pretty good, particularly from the nurses. Pamela Susan Shoop, Tawny Moyer, Ana Alicia and Gloria Gifford do a very good job as the unaware hospital staff. There is a great atmospheric feeling to 'Halloween II', you never know where Michael is going to pop out of in the dark corridors of the hospital. We also get some backstory to Michael and Laurie, of course being that they are brother and sister. It really ties everything together quite nicely and explains some questions people might have from the first one, like perhaps why was Michael after this girl? The one downside to 'Halloween II' was the lack of character development. It was done well in the original film, but not in this sequel. We meet the supporting characters, but they are clearly there just to be killed off.Jamie Lee Curtis does well as Laurie, but her character is given a back- seat in this one. She doesn't really do or say much until the final chase scene (which was also done well). Overall Halloween II is an EXCELLENT horror film that should be seen by all. It has some great scares, great kills, some tense moments and a wonderful main setting at that dark and deserted hospital. I also love that it continued right where the first one left off.

In able for this next film to be in the same league as Beauty and the Beast, it would have to contain characters, songs, music and a story that are just as memorable as what the prior film offered. As it turns out, the result was the Disney Studio's 31st full-length animated feature, Aladdin (1992). This is another highly entertaining Disney animated feature from the Disney Renaissance. It contains everything you could wish for from a Disney flick including good laughs, thrilling action, cool animation and awesome songs. We follow a young man named Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu who are sick of being poor and always having to dodge the guards for the sake of stolen food. They dream that one day they'll be rich enough to put an end to all their troubles. But when they meet a princess named Jasmine who doesn't care for life in the palace because she never goes anywhere and is being forced to marry another prince, things change. After a series of events occur, Aladdin is thrown in the dungeon and a fellow prisoner offers him a way to escape in exchange for doing a task for him. Now, Aladdin has to go to a secret place outside the city of Agrabah called the Cave of Wonders where he must retrieve a magic lamp. This magic lamp contains a highly energetic and fully animated genie (Robin Williams) who can grant Aladdin almost any three wishes he would like. So Aladdin wishes that he was a prince, that way he can try and marry Jasmine. But an evil sorcerer named Jafar and his parrot Iago want Aladdin's lamp and will do anything to get it. Will Aladdin be able to outsmart Jafar and win the princess? Want me to summarize why to see Aladdin if you haven't? Two words Robin Williams. He was naturally born to voice the genie in Aladdin. I'd guarantee that no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't find another actor that could compete with the high energy and witty comedic style that Williams incorporates into the Genie. It's been said that much of the dialogue by Robin Williams was improvised or added in since it wasn't in the original script. To be honest, I couldn't tell the difference between what was and wasn't in the script since Williams did such a great job at making it all sound natural. That is precisely how inspired the casting of Robin Williams in this role was. I also thought that Aladdin and Jasmine had good chemistry between each other. I liked the conversations they shared with one another regarding how frustrated they are with the lives they're currently living. I don't know about you guys, but when Jasmine states that her life of luxury is similar to prison since she can't go outside the palace walls, that's when I thought maybe being a prince or princess isn't such a good idea. The reason being that in some areas of the world, there's a good possibility that some royal figure will have no choice but to live that lifestyle. If that wasn't enough to steer you guys away from living a royal life like Jasmine, she's also being forced to get married against her will. Suddenly, a normal lifestyle is sounding excellent to most of us, isn't it? Jafar is another worthy addition to a list of the best Disney villains out there. I admire how he enjoys being the most diabolical douchebag to everyone he is around. If there is one thing about some of the greatest Disney villains out there that makes them great including Jafar, it's that they enjoy whatever evil things they're doing. Because they're able to get so much thrill and enjoyment out of what they're doing, that makes us all the more entertained by them in the process. You'll practically love to hate this guy. If there's one thing about Aladdin that I didn't care for story wise, it would be in regards to Aladdin lying to Jasmine about him being a prince in general. I didn't like this part of the story much since most of the dialogue that results from it can be a little too cringe worthy and painfully obvious for my taste. Also, the clichéd conflict between Aladdin and the genie that results from this part of the story feels forced and unnecessary. I simply felt that it was one routine plot device that didn't need to be in this story at all. Given that it's one of the highest grossing animated features of all time, I think it's safe to say that there's little more to explain about why Aladdin is such a great Disney animated feature. We all know how great the songs by Alan Menken, the late Howard Ashman, and Tim Rice are especially Friend Like Me, Prince Ali, and A Whole New World. The fast paced, highly energetic, and colorful animation is perfectly suited for a film of this style. I've already gone into detail about Robin Williams' performance, the character of Jafar, and the relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine.

Henry said cheerfully, while he poured himself a beer and adjusted the red headband. He was wearing something that resembled a camouflage jacket and army boots, the same Kristl was equipped with.Kristl took a long and deep breath, In those days a veteran soldier was an outcast. Spit out by society because of the Vietnam war they had lost and of a society tired of war.Yeah..That part is clear. It is kinda spelled out.Now it has been reversed. Nowadays he is put on a pedestal and revered. They can't do any wrong. And this, my American friend, is called irony.

The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be cliché for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. Are you not entertained? scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting.

Pulp fiction contains a lot of those brilliant unique ideas but I feel, fails to put them into practice in order to make an interesting and exciting film.*Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the film already go watch it and decide for yourself.

Now seeing as Pulp Fiction is split in to different stories of different people that is already a hard thing to do. Hard but not impossible. Sin City despite its many faults had me rooting the whole way through hoping that Bruce Willis would be safe and manage to rescue Jessica Alba from the clutches of that strange yellow guy.Pulp fiction however does not manage the same. After the incredibly smart conversation between Travolta and Jackson in the opening scene I was loving the film. I really liked the writing even if this sort of Philosophical conversation didn't quite fit Travolta's Pony-tailed Hit-man character.The abrupt switching to Bruce Willis' story then made me almost forget about Travolta all together, so much so that when, who i thought was the main protagonist, gets shot halfway through the film. It didn't really mean anything. I moved on. It wasn't impacting enough for me to feel any sort of emotion. It was like when the wise talking heavy gunner in a Vietnam movie gets shot.

Its just a shame he didn't play more of a part.Other than characters, I felt that the films real weakness was the lack of any strong plot. Yeah all of the crooks stories manage to inter-wind but i didn't feel that they were interesting enough for that to be the films main selling point. I felt at the end i had quite enjoyed what i just saw but really i could have not seen it and went on with my day. I personally feel like Pulp Fiction is a film that relies entirely on its Style to try and carry it forward. I will admit, it is a film with a very well written script, great conversation pieces and an incredible cast. It just fails at being anything more than boring.

I am actually surprised Van Damme would do something like this given his ego because couldn't he see just how ridiculous it was. Its like the ultimate spoof of the 80's action genre. Who better to do it than John Woo? I constantly hear how legendary this director is but I often wonder if this opinion too is a joke. The guy almost killed the Mission Impossible franchise with ridiculous hair, constant slow motion camera tricks, and ridiculous hero analogies. And here we have Hard Target with the exact same MO. Hair, slow-mo, hero analogies all over again. Some day I might have someone watch this film and tell me how many times he goes into slow motion which is not dramatic in this case or even remotely cool but instead looks ridiculous, hokey and dumb. Especially when your hero is sporting a greasy, stringy mullet. Now all this being said, I'll be darned if this isn't some sort of bizarre cheeky entertainment.

The scene with Van Damme standing on the seat of a dirt bike, shooting bad guys and then rolling over the top of their car...is just too ridiculously legendary to not be cool. This is the stuff Chuck Norris wishes he had under his belt.Jean Claude Van Damme is not a great actor, never was. But there is no arguing his chemistry in the 90's. There is just something slick and cool about that enormous ego that he has. His character in Hard Target is just about portrayed as God-like. He has this untouchable, swoon at his feet persona that it so ridiculous that its fun to watch. Yancy Butler is the stereotypical required female partner to Van Damme. She does alright and certainly has the deer in the headlights look down pat. She literally looks 90% of the time like she is on an infomercial that is selling Jean Claude Van Damme and she wants it! Her longing looks and open mouthed gaping is hilarious. Their chemistry is okay but really sort of unnecessary. Lance Henriksen is actually the perfect action hero villain. He has the look down and he a cold blooded horrifying killer. He probably has the best role in the entire film. He is a very worthy action film villain. Not to be outdone Arnold Vosloo is a brilliant right hand man to Henriksen. He could have easily been the lead villain in his own right. He is equally as cold and calculating and you get two great final battles when Van Damme takes them on. Wilford Brimley makes a cameo as the obligatory old man that the hero cares about.John Woo gets constant praise from fans for being a brilliant action director but his style is always the same and is so awkward at times. He has to be the king of overusing slow motion and when you pair it together with Van Damme and this story it just makes it even more cheesy. Now all this being said Hard Target has found its niche. Twenty years later and it can sit comfortably in action classic status. You can laugh at it and marvel at the action scenes. Plenty of explosions and gun fights and non-stop action especially towards the end of the movie. I can give them kudos for actually creating a solid story even if its a little cookie cutter and predictable. Ultimately Hard Target is nothing but sheer entertainment no matter how you take it or look at it. Nothing wrong with that but it certainly makes a lot of grievous errors in film making and they should just be lucky that it will likely continue to achieve cult status amongst action fans and Van Damme junkies. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Simply put Hard Target is a terrible movie.

The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney also has a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the Night on Bald Mountain sequence in Fantasia? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has made some dark and more adult stuff before, but none more so than their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to put her to justice (though she really didn't do anything wrong). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) cast him under a spell. She teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness? The most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be cured of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991), one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be Hellfire and The Bells of Notre Dame because they have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. My only personal criticism is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms don't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

The latest one was Robin an Marian (1976). Of course, having never seen it, I was expecting another rehash of Errol Flynn and little fluffy gay guys running around in bright green tights but I can say that I was pleasantly disappointed!As we all know Sean Connery, born 1930, made his mark in films during his 30's in the 1960's doing James Bond. Unfortunately, the scripts were horrible, the acting was hackney, and he wore a nasty 'rug' on his head during those films. But fortunately for his future ... and ours ... those roles propelled him into the beginnings of stardom. During the mid 1970's he abandoned the mainstream and grew into more serious roles worthy of major note. He also grew his trademark beard and threw the 'rug' in the garbage.So back to Sherwood Forest the film is set as a comeback of Robin Hood to Nottingham and Sherwood as an aged Robin returning home after spending two decades in the Crusades.

Of note is that Robin wears Saracen armor in the final battle scene an aspect other directors would miss.CINEMATOGRAPHY This was my major disappointment.

Johnny says that he won't marry her until his mother is dead (she is dying very soon). So when he goes to visit his mother, he asks Loretta for a favor Invite his estranged brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage), who had a falling out with him some years ago, to the wedding.

Compared to others in the same category however, it's definitely not the strongest. The story is predictable the popular guy makes a bet claiming that he'll be able to make the school's biggest loner\/outcast the prom queen. And, of course, by the end they fall for one another. Not a big surprise, but the story is still really fun to follow. With many witty one- liners, there were many laughable moments. However, as a hopeless romantic, my favorite part is the one where Zach and Laney have a close conversation concerning her late mother. I thought Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook worked really well together. The movie got REALLY cheesy at certain parts, not because of the lines (which also occasionally happened), but because of the character delivery. However, I never thought either of the leads overdid it. They had good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two of them. Although it's not the best film of this sort that I've seen, I still enjoyed it and I'm glad I finally watched it. I would recommend it if you're having a girls night or are just in the mood for a 90's film.

Basically, set in the 1960's in Washington state, young Czech mother Selma Jezkova (Golden Globe nominated singer Björk) has a great passion for musicals, and is rehearsing for the part of Maria in The Sound of Music, but she is slowly going blind due to a hereditary degenerative disease, this also affects her job working in a factory. She lives in a mobile trailer home, on the property of the local sheriff Bill Houston (David Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara Seymour), with her twelve year old delinquent son Gene (Vladica Kostic) who always seems ungrateful, talking to the sheriff she reveals her secret that she is losing her sight, and her life slowly goes downwards. Selma gains some positivity from her close relationship shy but persistent fellow factory worker Jeff (Peter Stormare), and friendship with fellow factory worker Kathy nicknamed Cvalda (Catherine Deneuve), but of course unable to see she is vulnerable to manipulation and getting by. This is evident when she is seen by Bill storing amounts of money in a tin she keeps in the cupboard, she is saving this money for an operation for his son who will develop the same effects of blindness as her, but Bill steals this money, and demanding it back he refuses to give the money, but he wants to die and tells him shoot him, she does do so. Selma gives the money to an institute where he son can have an operation, and then she is caught by the police for the crime of murder, questioned she only reveals the smallest details, and eventually she is convicted and given the death penalty, and Jeff and Cvalda get her money back to get a good lawyer to help free her. She refuses this help and would be rather die than have her son go blind, prison guard Brenda (Siobhan Fallon) does her best to comfort her as her fear of death gets closer, and even walking to the gallows she finds the ability to break out into song as she hugs other prisoners. Selma gets to the gallows, but suddenly collapses and is forced to be strapped to a board, as she becomes hysterical she is told by Cvalda that her son's operation was successful, being blind she is permitted at her request to be hanged without a hood, and in relief she sings, but is hanged before finishing. Also starring Cabaret's Joel Grey as Oldrich Novy, Vincent Paterson as Samuel the director, Jean-Marc Barr as Norman the shop foreman and Udo Kier as Dr. Porkorny. Björk is best known for her unusual eclectic style of singing in great songs like It's Oh So Quiet and Play Dead, but she also proves a good acting talent as she plays the tragic victim to blindness and justified crime, the supporting cast is well chosen as well, what really makes this song and dance picture different is not just the picture quality, but being filled with happy and catchy tunes during dark subject matter, it is a terrific musical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Song for I've Seen It All (also nominated the Golden Globe). Good!
