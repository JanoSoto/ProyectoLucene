I also grew up on the Disney classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman creeped me out so badly when I was little I thought I would never see the day when I would see that topped. Now after seeing this I think I just have. The Headless Horseman is terrifying here, Christopher Walken does a phenomenal job playing him. I do agree that the story does drag on occasions, but plenty makes up for that minor fault. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is amazing, like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, the sets and cinematography are dark and Gothic, and the special effects are wonderful. Also Tim Burton I think was the perfect choice for director, he is oddball and eccentric and that directorial style is perfect for this film allowing him to give a clever, unique and atmospheric take on the story. The music score by none other than maestro Danny Elfman is dark, suspenseful and haunting, like it should be. The story is a true timeless tale of horror, and really well structured here, as is the nuanced script. The performances are excellent once again, with Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as the maverick yet intuitive Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci fine in a poignant sort of way as the lovely Katerina. Solidly supporting them all the way are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths. And of course the film is full of cruel shocks and thrills, the murder scenes are shocking and violent but not in the sense that you have to look away.

I was a preschooler when this was released, and I remember hearing about the film and seeing a bit of it within the next few years after that. However, I never actually sat down to watch the 1990 blockbuster until 2006. At the time, I wasn't sure what I thought of the first hour or so, but found it very powerful later on! After a little over four years, I've seen the hit modern-day fairy tale again, from start to finish. I still certainly wasn't as impressed as so many other viewers definitely have been over the years, but still think it's a good first Burton\/Depp collaboration.Edward is an artificial human being who lives in a mansion up the hill from a suburban neighbourhood. This mansion was the home of his inventor, who died just before he got to finish his invention, leaving Edward incomplete, with scissors for hands! One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs is not having any luck with her sales, and decides to go to the mansion to try and make a sale, not knowing who lives there. Up on the hill, she finds nobody in sight until she reaches the top floor, where she meets Edward, and it seems he has never been off the mansion property! Peg takes him back home with her, and he stays with the Avon representative, her husband Bill, young son Kevin, and teenage daughter Kim at their house. The artificial being is admired by most of the neighbours, but Kim's boyfriend, a thug named Jim, does not think too highly of him, and he could lead Edward into a load of trouble! At the beginning of the film, we see a grandmother about to tell her granddaughter the story of Edward Scissorhands. This elderly woman is not played very well by a young actress in makeup, trying to speak in an elderly voice. After the story begins, the part where Peg Boggs discovers the mansion and searches for someone inside is a little tedious, but the mansion is a fascinating location, and the scene showing her meeting Edward for the first time can certainly grab viewers. Edward, played wonderfully by Johnny Depp, stands out as a likable character, but some of the other characters are not portrayed so well, especially Esmeralda, the Christian fanatic who thinks Edward is from hell. I honestly don't get this character! Is she meant to be funny?! If so, she's not. She's just weird, absurd, and annoying! Good thing she only has four scenes! There are also some fairly sappy moments in this film. However, most of the movie is well done. It's usually intriguing showing the protagonist's relationship with the people in the neighbourhood, and there are some other good performances, such as Winona Ryder as Kim, Vincent Price as Edward's inventor in flashback sequences, and Anthony Michael Hall as the despicable Jim. Later on, the film gets very dark, intense, and often heartbreaking, and I've never seen a character harder not to hate than the one Hall plays here! The tension and emotion at this point are unforgettable! This first Burton\/Depp collaboration is probably thought by many to be their best. It does seem to be more popular than most of the others, but I have to disagree. Unlike some people, I've found some severe flaws here, but overall, I still think it's a very good film which deserved its success, even if it's not as great as its reputation suggests. I would say the film is most effective after the first hour or so, which was what I thought the first time as well, but I think the movie as a whole was better for me the second time. It's probably a good thing I didn't see much of Edward Scissorhands as a kid. What I saw at the time didn't hurt, with Edward accidentally puncturing a waterbed and struggling to try and eat with his scissor hands, but it might have gotten to be a bit too much for me near the end, especially with the Jim character. Well, it was rated PG-13. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for kids, except maybe older ones, but for many adolescents and adults, I'm sure it's a worthwhile fantasy drama, with a bit of humour.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"2 May 2010","score":"","review":" Like the more lesser known DUCKTALES movie, this film is also based on a famous Disney TV show, GOOF TROOP, starring, naturally, Goofy. That said, A GOOFY MOVIE feels somewhat disconnected from the show, as indicated by the style of the animation and the lack of certain characters around. Not that it is a detriment at all, however; in fact, A GOOFY MOVIE is all the better for it.Goofy is cast as a suburban '90s father who bumbles his way through everything, including almost vacuuming up a prized cardboard statue and smashing a fence when driving his car out of the driveway. An admirer of old-fashioned things like Xavier Cougat, High Hopes, and fishing, he is a frequent source of embarrassment to his teenage son Max, who is going through that typical adolescent stage where girls, rock 'n roll, and social acceptance are more important to him. Smitten with one particularly pretty classmate, Roxanne, he plucks up the courage to ask her out on a date... but not before hijacking the last school assembly to put on an impromptu rock concert as his idol, a rock superstar named Powerline (Tevin Campbell, who gets to sing two of the movie's liveliest and memorable tunes, Stand Out and I 2 I). Max does this to both impress the girl and win admiration from his classmates (who think he's, well, a goof-ball), but the exasperated principal misinterprets his actions as a case of being on a road to crime, a point that he over-exaggerates in the extreme on a phone call to Goofy. Needless to say, Goofy is horrified by the news and forces Max to go on a cross-country vacation with him to Lake Destiny to reestablish their bond. Of course, what Goofy doesn't realize is that Max, who has no choice but to cancel his date, boasts that he will be on-stage at Powerline's newest concert in L.A. instead. This sets up a source of tension that escalates between Goofy and Max as they stop at rundown, cringeworthy resorts such as Lester's Possum Park (a very loose parody of Disney's Country Bear Jamboree) and even get into an encounter with Bigfoot. (The latter experience culminates with the beast dancing to the Bee Gee's Staying Alive on Max's headphones.) Amazingly, though, Goofy and Max begin to bond as their trip progresses; but Max is still troubled by his predicament, and, thinking his father won't understand, he decides to alter the map so that they can go to the concert instead... ultimately realizing that telling the truth is the better thing to do.Even with the presence of a iconic lovable bumbler like Goofy as the star, A GOOFY MOVIE is primarily targeted at teenagers, who will undoubtedly relate to Max and his adolescent struggles. On the other side of the fence, parents will also be able to identify with Goofy as he deals with his son's resentment about the vacation while trying to prove that all he really wants is for his son to be happy. It's not often to see such a complex development in a project which is disconnected from Disney's canonical features, much less one from a character best known for tripping on his heels or bungling simple tasks (ala the How to Goofy shorts). Ultimately, though, that's what gives A GOOFY MOVIE its heart. No character is portrayed as a purely perfect hero or a downright evil villain; they are surprisingly more multi-layered than what you'd come to expect. Critics have often dismissed this film as a lesser effort from Disney, but A GOOFY MOVIE has achieved a loyal following, purely because of the surprisingly realistic, honest depiction of teenager relationships with their parents. (It also marks the first time we've ever seen Goofy look genuinely crushed and betrayed, particularly when he discovers his son is manipulating him into going to some place other than their fishing destination, as well as having a heated argument with the boy immediately afterward.)One issue that I do have with A GOOFY MOVIE, however, may be that some of the newer characters introduced, from cheese-guzzling Bobby, to nerdy class president Stacey to Roxanne herself all don't have much screen time.

That said, A GOOFY MOVIE feels somewhat disconnected from the show, as indicated by the style of the animation and the lack of certain characters around. Not that it is a detriment at all, however; in fact, A GOOFY MOVIE is all the better for it.Goofy is cast as a suburban '90s father who bumbles his way through everything, including almost vacuuming up a prized cardboard statue and smashing a fence when driving his car out of the driveway. An admirer of old-fashioned things like Xavier Cougat, High Hopes, and fishing, he is a frequent source of embarrassment to his teenage son Max, who is going through that typical adolescent stage where girls, rock 'n roll, and social acceptance are more important to him. Smitten with one particularly pretty classmate, Roxanne, he plucks up the courage to ask her out on a date... but not before hijacking the last school assembly to put on an impromptu rock concert as his idol, a rock superstar named Powerline (Tevin Campbell, who gets to sing two of the movie's liveliest and memorable tunes, Stand Out and I 2 I). Max does this to both impress the girl and win admiration from his classmates (who think he's, well, a goof-ball), but the exasperated principal misinterprets his actions as a case of being on a road to crime, a point that he over-exaggerates in the extreme on a phone call to Goofy. Needless to say, Goofy is horrified by the news and forces Max to go on a cross-country vacation with him to Lake Destiny to reestablish their bond. Of course, what Goofy doesn't realize is that Max, who has no choice but to cancel his date, boasts that he will be on-stage at Powerline's newest concert in L.A. instead. This sets up a source of tension that escalates between Goofy and Max as they stop at rundown, cringeworthy resorts such as Lester's Possum Park (a very loose parody of Disney's Country Bear Jamboree) and even get into an encounter with Bigfoot. (The latter experience culminates with the beast dancing to the Bee Gee's Staying Alive on Max's headphones.) Amazingly, though, Goofy and Max begin to bond as their trip progresses; but Max is still troubled by his predicament, and, thinking his father won't understand, he decides to alter the map so that they can go to the concert instead... ultimately realizing that telling the truth is the better thing to do.Even with the presence of a iconic lovable bumbler like Goofy as the star, A GOOFY MOVIE is primarily targeted at teenagers, who will undoubtedly relate to Max and his adolescent struggles. On the other side of the fence, parents will also be able to identify with Goofy as he deals with his son's resentment about the vacation while trying to prove that all he really wants is for his son to be happy. It's not often to see such a complex development in a project which is disconnected from Disney's canonical features, much less one from a character best known for tripping on his heels or bungling simple tasks (ala the How to Goofy shorts). Ultimately, though, that's what gives A GOOFY MOVIE its heart. No character is portrayed as a purely perfect hero or a downright evil villain; they are surprisingly more multi-layered than what you'd come to expect. Critics have often dismissed this film as a lesser effort from Disney, but A GOOFY MOVIE has achieved a loyal following, purely because of the surprisingly realistic, honest depiction of teenager relationships with their parents. (It also marks the first time we've ever seen Goofy look genuinely crushed and betrayed, particularly when he discovers his son is manipulating him into going to some place other than their fishing destination, as well as having a heated argument with the boy immediately afterward.)One issue that I do have with A GOOFY MOVIE, however, may be that some of the newer characters introduced, from cheese-guzzling Bobby, to nerdy class president Stacey to Roxanne herself all don't have much screen time.

He had brought the DVD to my home and as he is a hardcore fan of Brad Pitt, he has bought almost every major hit movie of Pitt and since I am also a fan, we both watched it together. I thought it would be a cool movie like other Pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre.Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. Though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, Somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. In many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that Somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. Enter Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to Somerset. Then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. The seven sins are - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Lust and Wrath. While Mills believes the killer is an insane person, Somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. The killer is a John Doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by Kevin Spacey) and it takes every last bit of Somerset's and Mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wife of Mills and they are very much in love. Will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of God and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - The society or the detectives? David Fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. This could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old Hollywood clichés and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. Also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. I was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. And in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. Morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to Pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. No matter how insanely talented Pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with Jolie (back then, it was Jennifer Aniston). Tracy is genuinely portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. She played a major part in bringing Mills and Somerset together. I loved her scene where she introduces each other. Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie.

Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. Though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my Brad Pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, I loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant.10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"2 May 2010","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes, this one is are very good and entertaining movie with an interesting twist, not the best one in film history as some people say but still a quite good one, and a good acting of the two brilliant main characters without any doubt.What I dislike about the film is its slow paced introduction which I found somehow long and boring, the idea of the fight club and its intentions itself and that the whole thing seems logic to its members, the somehow exaggerated end and the fact that you don't get to know what the whole sense or intention of the terroristic organisation has to mean or not to mean in the end.All in all, this one of the movies you should have watched once in your life and which you should know to make yourself an opinion.

Either he had a high opinion of Hitchcock, or a high opinion of himself. I'm drawn to think it is the latter, because Dressed to Kill is a pretty blatant Psycho rip-off. Anything Hitchcock can do I can do better, is what must've been on de Palma's mind, well maybe not better but equally well. The result is a mildly entertaining psychological thriller, sporadically intriguing and suspenseful but with mediocre acting, and a poorly executed climax.Kate Miller (a middle aged New York housewife) has a one night stand with a stranger she meets in an art gallery. As she leaves his apartment, a woman in black leather hacks her to pieces with a razor. The only witness is a local prostitute who has just finished with a client on the same apartment floor. The police make her a suspect, and she is given only a few hours to get the proof that she claim she has. She teams up with Miller's teenage, science geek son to do a little surveillance and spying, on Miller's shrink who may know something about the killer that he has not told yet.It wasn't until the climax when I realized that this film is painfully close to the story line of Psycho. Up till then I was enjoying myself, and despite the feeble characterization, I found myself sympathetic, perhaps even more so than toward Psycho. After all, how can one not have empathy for a boy whose father is a Vietnam casualty and has lost his mother to cold blooded murder, or to a prostitute, who is a perfectly nice human being who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Dressed to Kill is resolved with a sloppily written climactic scene, which is a classic example of Deus ex machina. And if that isn't enough the film adds one last sequence for gratuitous suspense, and is clearly a feeble attempt of de Palma to avoid a conventional ending. Dressed to Kill is not much of a movie, but I've seen worse. If you are not a tough critic it may worth a peek if it is on TV at a convenient hour for you.

Films that are daft enough but enjoyable enough to have their leads be able to spot vital clues linked to the overall success of their goal whilst being in a state of near intoxication by way of hard alcohol. Nick Nolte's character does this towards the end of Mulholland Falls when watching a short, silent piece of moving image footage, but there you go. The film itself is a dank and involving noir inspired thriller from 1996 about corruption and murder amidst the higher-ups of the nation and one man's quest to uncover it; only, he doesn't know it at the time. The beauty of these stories is that they establish a hard-as-nails male lead whom keeps within his little pool of dishing out pain and retribution, effectively, before broadening them out into a wider scope of scum and dispute; the catch being that the negative characteristics on these outside of the pool are tougher to spot they're still there, but they hide amidst this sea of expensive furniture, clothing and generally plush mise-en-scene.The film begins with two 8MM pieces of film footage that we feel we have no right to observe some blast footage of an atomic weapon being tested and therefore detonated, exemplified when we sporadically cut to another film and an army official pushing the camera operator, ie; the audience, away from the general area; as well as another film in which a mounted camera is pointing at two people about to engage in sexual activity. Such is the tone the film will take, and such is the battle the lead has on him that in order to succeed in his mission, he'll need to break on through and confront things that certain others would rather you wouldn't see or realise were there. Corruption is a rife and pleasurable theme for classical film noir, or more contemporary noirs that pay homage; corruption usually equating to cheating, lying or deception and when the general ingredients are on the money; the piece ends up worth seeing.The film would have you think it's about four guys, police officers in 1950s Los Angeles, taking names and kicking their way around town, bullying those they deem guilty of whatever crime by tossing them down a hill just off Mulholland Drive. At least it might've been about that had it been set several years prior to events here. Here, Nolte's cop named Max Hoover gets in way over his head and finds himself on a road to all things dangerous when he and his crew come across a woman firmly embedded within the ground out in the open wilderness nearby a construction site. It looks like she's hit the ground from a great height, but everyone's puzzled as to how it might have happened. Further more, Hoover knows the girl from recent times.Hoover has a wife he struggles to truly connect with over the course of the film, she's young; attractive and enjoys reading Hemingway, but like most films about butch men working together for the greater-good; Mulholland Falls is more interested in a relationship between two males, that of Hoover and Chazz Palminteri's cop Elleroy Coolidge, a guy in that group of four which also consisted of Michael Madsen and Chris Penn &#x96; but loosing both of them would do the film no harm. The death of the young girl, a certain Allison Pond (Connelly), affects Hoover in ways that doesn't see him afraid to admit to, purely because he once upon a time had an affair with her, rendering the investigation somewhat personal rather than just strictly business. What do we come to learn of Palminteri's character? Well, we learn that it's not wise to back chat him just prior to taking a drink out of a glass full of something, but we also come to find of the issues he carries; someone whom it is revealed suffers from personal problems of his own and much to some of the other hard-nosed archetype cop's confusion; his issues and the exploration of them somewhat going against what it is that makes these archetypes in these sorts of films so recognisable.Coolidge's thoughts on the Western film genre, for one, is supposed to signify a broader sense of thinking away from all the hard-nosed work while his linking this to thoughts on the ramifications certain events have on future items display a meek sense of sensory awareness. It is no coincidence then that the two find a degree of solace with one another and it ought not be much of a surprise to see Coolidge connect with Hoover in the way they do; one coming to the other's aid and sharing the burden of the film's denouement together. The film eventually branches out into a feud between those within the world of the 'just', a sort of documentation of the birth of internal affairs, only not making out that that's what it is particularly evident; instead delivering dramatically rather than historically a tight enough narrative to do with corruption and 'the enemy within' linked to the F.B.I. and The U.S. Army. Yes, there are sequences that feel patched on; yes, we know exactly who'll survive and who won't survive certain gunfights half way through and yes, it really could do without two of its four leads of whom the film barely makes any attempt to really get the most out of the performers in question, but Mulholland Falls is a knowing if somewhat flimsy tale of a man's life coming apart as he confronts past mistakes and current ones on the state's behalf.

No one wants to come forward about what they saw, and the girl's lawyer gives in easily by letting the men off on a lesser charge and lesser jail time. The victim is furious and feels even more trashy because she doesn't want these guys to walk away with the truth hidden. The lawyer then decides to prosecute the guys who cheered and supported the rape in order to make sure the truth comes out.This movie had a much deeper meaning and story than simply a rape. The victim here comes off as flirty and provocatively dressed and often times it makes it seem like they were asking for it and a girls character can really be hurt by that and this movie beautifully shows that no matter how you act, or dress, or even what you say has no justification on rape or doing something to someone when they tell you no. It's rape pure and simple and these jerks that watched and cheered and did nothing are very responsible and very guilty too. The movie had many good messages and it's an honest depiction of rape and how people try to classify it in different ways, when in reality rape is rape and there are no innocent sexual abuse or rape cases out there.I thought Jodie did an amazing job, as did Kelly McGillis as her attorney. Bernie Coulson is also a great underrated star who did well here. Leo Rossi is such an annoying actor when he needs be and he did really well as one of the cheerleaders here. The direction was pretty good and the over all story was very nicely done. I think the thing I liked best was the victim's need to become a stronger woman after the events occurred, that really spoke to me, because it was almost like a passage into womanhood for her.I thought the movie was really good, it was honest and blunt and did well with telling the whole story without details and then at the end it had the courtroom drama, which I always love, and then the details come out and we here them from many peoples point of view. 4\/10 stars - nice drama ","genre":null},{"date":"2 May 2010","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" A girl is raped by a bunch of men in the game room of a bar, and they are cheered on by other drunks.

Although this is the setting for the movie, the actual theme is that of a person, McMurphy (Mac), providing better therapy to the patients of a mental institute than the doctors or nurses can provide. The story focuses primarily on Mac as is tries to lure each of the patients out of their comfort zones and into life. As Mac does this he becomes a larger than life hero in the eyes of the mental patients, and a thorn in the side of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Ratched has a harmful, narcissistic need for control. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest does an excellent job of setting the mood for a mental institute both in the sound and visual department. The institute itself is run down and feels as though money is tight for upgrades. This really brightens Mac's colorful personality, and sets a nice contrast. Often times the dialogue is just a bunch of chaos because the mental patients get into argument frenzies. These arguments help give the feel of a mental institute, while also allowing the camera to zoom in and capture Mac or Nurse Ratched's feelings about the given situations. All of the above, along with realistic lighting, great camera work, and terrific acting won the movie its Oscars. Irony plays a large role in why One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was and still is successful. There are quite a few situations of irony, with the main two coming from Nurse Ratched's need to control, and the surprise ending. As mentioned in the theme, this movie focuses on how well Mac helps the patients in the mental institute. As a sharp contrast though is how much Nurse Ratched, the helper, is harming her patients with manipulation and brow beating. As for the surprise ending, well, that will be left a surprise. This movie is not unlike others that have come along, in which the main character takes hold of a group supposedly doing the right thing, but were not. Most recently we saw a similar character in How to Train Your Dragon. In How to Train Your Dragon, Hiccup, a young Viking, teaches the other Vikings that the dragons are good when it was common belief they were bad. Hiccup is being manipulated and brow beaten by society and especially by his father to kill dragons. It's not hard to see the similarities between Hiccup and Mac, or Nurse Ratched and Hiccup's father. It's an entertaining theme, watching one sole character change an entire group for the better. It is a universal theme that movie goers will enjoy for years to come, no better example of this theme is found than in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I would find it unfair to a reader not to mention this; although this movie is a good one it suffers from a pacing standpoint. This movie's middle section is not unlike an action movie. What I mean by this is that in action movies, sometimes there is so much action that the viewer gets bored. In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the middle portion of the movie is filled with crazy people acting crazy to the point of exhaustion. If you can get over this, or find amusement in it, then this movie will surely entertain.

But the whole movie is quite charming and entertaining and tells a beautiful fantasy story filled with clichés. The young and charismatic Matthew plays a nice role as a naive and annoying thief, Rutger Hauer incorporates the tough guy waiting for his vengeance and Michelle Pfeiffer the charming young lady. The key message of the film that one has never to give up and wait for a good twist or idea to solve one's problems instead of using violence is a typical, but nice idea. The ancient traitor who wants to correct his errors in an innersight experience is a nice gadget of this film, too. The films has a quite large type of genres, beginning with fantasy elements (the curse of the hawk and wolf), romantic elements (theor faithful love), dramatic elements (as the hawk is heavily injured and as the wolf seems to commit a huge mistake), action elements (as the young thief escapes from prison and military) and philosophical elements (love, religion, faith) with some interesting twists (the change of mood of the monk, the eclipse).The only negative elements are that the movie deals with a lot of clichés, that the end is quite predictable. Another bad point is that the film has been turned in 1985, but that the graphics are rather old fashioned and that there is a lack of special effects or interesting director's ideas. This lack of ideas makes the film quite ordinary which is quite sad as the actors are doing a good job and as the whole thing could have been better as many interesting basis elements are there but not no profound or surprising aspects based on it.

A bit less diversity, but a more profound analysis could have made the film a lot better.All in all, the movie is quite entertaining and is especially interesting for its young main actors who have all become well known actors in their later careers.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"2 May 2010","score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Dark City is a film that should get more recognition. After watching it several times I am convinced that it's one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best science fiction films ever. It flows well from scene to scene. The cinematography is gorgeous. One of the Strangers mentions that the city was created from different eras of human history. In this bustling metropolis exist vintage cars, monorails, tall old style buildings, and the people wear 1930 fashion. All this contributes to a city that is fascinating to look at. The story is also interesting. It revolves around what makes people human. Is it just our memories or is there more to it? Many human conditions are represented in the film.The characters fit in well with the story. William Hurt plays inspector Frank Bumstead, a man who's lonely and obsessed with little details. Almost all characters are played by famous actors. Jennifer Connelly plays John Murdoch's beautiful brunette wife, and there's also a woman (Melissa George), who takes a liking to Murdoch, who's a pretty blonde. What's important is that these people aren't there just for show. They all play important roles, and they're all different and well-rounded characters. There's a lot to like about the film. The score is fitting, and there are two good vocals songs; Sway and The Night Has A Thousand Eyes. Every scene is well thought-out and filmed. What I liked most about Dark City though is that it's a science fiction film noir. It's a great film too. It's more coherent than Blade Runner (1982). Dark City influenced The Matrix (1999). Both were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney using some of the same sets. Comparisons have been made between scenes from the films, making note of similarities in both cinematography and atmosphere, as well as the plot. But Dark City is a better film. I give it my highest recommendation.
