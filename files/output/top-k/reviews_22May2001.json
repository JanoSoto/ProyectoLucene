Nowadays, however, kids aren't as gullible. So for the past few years, studios - including but not limited to Disney - have come out with some very cool movies that have appealed to both children and adults. Toy Story was a pioneer in this field, although it's not the only one. Follow the evolution to Antz and A Bug's Life, and finally you come to the present masterpiece, Shrek.   Shrek is a giant green ogre (voiced marvelously by Mike Myers) who lives alone in a swamp. Every now and again the people from a nearby village try to oust him (shades of Frankenstein!), but he scares 'em away right proper. But unbeknownst to Shrek, the evil Lord Farquaad (don't read it too quickly in front of kids!) has banished all fairy tale creatures from the forest and placed them on Shrek's swamp. Imagine his surprise! (The creatures include knock-offs of Pinocchio, the three pigs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and so on.) And to add insult to his further injury, a charmed, talking donkey named Donkey (voiced by the inestimable Eddie Murphy) wants to be Shrek's pal.   To get the creatures off his land, Shrek goes to the source of the trouble - Farquaad (John Lithgow). The evil one, after Shrek beats the beejezus out of all the lord's knights, tells Shrek he will get rid of the fairy tale creatures if the ogre will go on a quest for him. The quest, it turns out, consists of Shrek journeying to a far-off castle and rescuing a fair princess (Cameron Diaz). Oh yes, and slaying a dragon, too, to get to her. Does this sound like the typical kids' film so far? And of course, Donkey must tag along.   One of the best trends in recent yeards regarding these animated movies is that when producers get celebrities to voice characters, they give the celebrities free reign to improvise a little. Murphy is hilarious, audacious, and absolutely riotous as Donkey. He easily steals every scene he's in, which is most of them. Murphy's as funny here as Robin Williams was in the original Aladdin, a wild, untamed bundle of energy and raucous humor. He drops a couple of mild double-entendres and the requisite flatulence jokes and a whole bunch of pop culture references. Lithgow is wonderfully sneering as the short-statured lord, both despotic and self-serving, but one of those Snidely Whiplash-type characters who always seem to be muttering under their breath, Curses! Foiled again! Diaz has a lovely voice, tenuous when it should be, strong and mighty when it should be.   But it's Myers as the humble and yet garrulous Shrek who's running things here. He's at times petulant, antisocial, and moody, but also courageous and very knightly indeed. There are some who have quibbled about Myers' using a Scottish accent for Shrek, but according to reports the actor (who's from Canada) was originally supposed to do a Canadian accent. Personally, I think the Scottish one's a lot better.   This is great whiz-bang fun, and the in-jokes never let up. Watch it all the way through!

I am a Robert Altman lover myself, but have not been afraid to criticize his films in the past. I'm probably the only one who will say that I hated The Player. I felt it was a rather childish lash out at Hollywood. I also criticized greatly Short Cuts and Brewster McCloud (although I ultimately gave them the thumbs up). But he has made at least one of the best films ever made, Nashville, a masterpiece through and through, and several other very good films, including MASH, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and his previous film, Cookie's Fortune, which I would deem wonderful. Doctor T struck me as also very excellent, and I'm giving it an 8\/10, which, in four-star criticism, equals a 3.5\/4 stars.First, before I discuss why I liked the film, I must point out its most glaring fault, the one which, I think, must sour the film for most of its viewers. This is the whole Hestia Complex deal to which Dr T's wife, played by Farrah Fawcett, becomes subjected. Obviously a made-up complex, it seemingly insults our intelligence. According to her psychiatrist, it is a complex which crops up when a woman is loved too much. When she has everything she could possibly want. It happens because the mystery of existence no longer exists. Thus, a woman with this complex reverts to a childlike state. This whole complex thing pops up within the film's first act, and, since we don't believe it, we just say, Oh, that's so stupid. That could never happen. And then we just block it out of our minds for the rest of the film. Whenever it crops up again, we just try to ignore it. Fawcett's acting skills make the whole thing seem even more stupid. This is not the right attitude to take. It is not stupid, per se, but what is truthful to say about it is that it is contrived. Contrivances are not a no-no when it comes to art. If you think they are, then you obviously don't remember Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette, among others. You have to just accept the contrivances as much as you can, suspend your disbelief a little. This whole Hestia Complex thing is utterly important for your understanding of Dr. T.Now, onto the rest of the film. Another reason why, it seems to me, people would complain is the lack of a plot, or a conventionaly plot, anyway. These people would have to fully admit that they are completely unfamiliar with Robert Altman. Even if they are not, they still have a semi-legitimate complaint. The film's meaning takes a long, long time to reveal itself. One could easily get lost in the meantime, especially if that person has chosen to disregard the Hestia Complex portion of the film. I still don't see how it's all that different from films like Nashville and Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. Nashville is a very difficult film, and, as Pauline Kael asks in her famous review of it, What does it mean? Actually, I think I myself have figured that out (and I'd be willing to share my views on it upon request). But for several of his other films, I have not. To tell you the truth, that is why I have always been so ambivalent towards Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. I may have liked a lot of both of them, but, when it all comes down to it, I never really saw the point. However, I still enjoyed them. With Dr. T, I believe I did get the point. It's just that it isn't revealed until the film's climax, the wedding scene. By then, I'm sure a lot of viewers have already thrown up their hands. Yes, it is a long time to wait, but you just have to be patient sometimes. Altman is not interested in spoon-feeding us any answers.Okay, so here's my interpretation, so maybe you should skip this paragraph and the next if you want to figure it out for yourself or if you are just so angry that you don't give a care what some other idiot thinks it means it's all about stability, to put it simply, the possession of it and its lack. To be stable may seem like a wonderful thing, but it can also get mighty boring. Dr. T appears to be a near-perfect human being. While it would have been simple to make a stupid comedy about a sexy male gynecologist (see the Saturday Night Live sketch, Mel Gibson World's Sexiest Gynecologist, to see how it could have turned out), this is just not done here. Women crowd to get into his office not because he is sexy, but because he is just so good to them all. He's warm, and he obviously cares for everyone around him, strangers included. The rich-and-unsatisfied wife is a stock character in drama. We don't ever see Dr. T's wife in that characterization, but she was obviously in that position. Dr. T's daughters, Connie and Dee Dee, appear at first to be pretty stable. They're a doctor's daughters and dress very beautifully. Dee Dee is a cheerleader, kind of a dream profession, but she's not very good. She's also about to get married, but she will regrettably have to abandon a more rewarding relationship to do so. To get married is, of course, the American symbol of stability and normalcy. Connie is in bundles, although she constantly asserts to her father, Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Hardly. She is constantly in knots over her sister's foolhearty decision and she obsesses about JFK's assassination (the film takes place in Dallas). To boot, Dr. T's sister, Peggy, has arrived at his home, divorce pending, with her three daughters. Peggy is completely unstable; she can hardly deal with her young daughters and she drinks like a fish. Dr. T also has an assistant, Carolyn, who constantly interrupts personal conversations and rest time with the pretext of anxious patients; the truth is that she is lonely and secretly in love with her boss. Dr. T is being crowded by these and many other women in his life, and, like any doctor, relaxes on the golf course. There, he meets Bree, a woman pro golfer who has decided to relax a little herself. With all of his burdens, Dr. T immediately becomes involved with this source of stability, someone who is confident in her current decisions. All of this may seem like a mess to many, but it shouldn't be if you know a film like Nashville.As Altman likes to do, the climax takes place at a marvelous setpiece, Dee Dee's wedding. It is outside, and it's threatening to storm. A bundle of problems are arising, and, as it begins to pour, chaos ensues. Dr. T's experiences an epiphany stability is overrated. Not everything can be perfect, so it is pointless to exhaust oneself trying to make it so. A similar theme runs through Cast Away of the same year. Dr. T embraces the chaos and jumps into a covertible. As he puts the top up, the wind rips it apart. He laughs and drives off in the rain towards Bree's apartment. He has chosen to convince her to run away with him. She wants no part in it. She is happy where she is, is stable. She knows that she cannot control her life perfectly, but she knows that she must exert some control. Hurt but not destroyed, Dr. T drives away. We don't know where he's going, and I doubt he does either. As he drives, a tornado descends upon him and sucks him away. This part probably angers a lot of viewers also because it is so random and untelegraphed. But I think it works. Fantastically, Dr. T survives the tornado, but has ended up in an isolated area of Mexico. The village nearby is isolated and in need of a doctor to deliver a baby. He does so. He is there to begin a new life. Again, he exists in a state of possible stability as the town doctor, but also there exists the possibility for random events, i.e., the mystery.

The film's meaning takes a long, long time to reveal itself. One could easily get lost in the meantime, especially if that person has chosen to disregard the Hestia Complex portion of the film. I still don't see how it's all that different from films like Nashville and Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. Nashville is a very difficult film, and, as Pauline Kael asks in her famous review of it, What does it mean? Actually, I think I myself have figured that out (and I'd be willing to share my views on it upon request). But for several of his other films, I have not. To tell you the truth, that is why I have always been so ambivalent towards Brewster McCloud and Short Cuts. I may have liked a lot of both of them, but, when it all comes down to it, I never really saw the point. However, I still enjoyed them. With Dr. T, I believe I did get the point. It's just that it isn't revealed until the film's climax, the wedding scene. By then, I'm sure a lot of viewers have already thrown up their hands. Yes, it is a long time to wait, but you just have to be patient sometimes. Altman is not interested in spoon-feeding us any answers.Okay, so here's my interpretation, so maybe you should skip this paragraph and the next if you want to figure it out for yourself or if you are just so angry that you don't give a care what some other idiot thinks it means it's all about stability, to put it simply, the possession of it and its lack. To be stable may seem like a wonderful thing, but it can also get mighty boring. Dr. T appears to be a near-perfect human being. While it would have been simple to make a stupid comedy about a sexy male gynecologist (see the Saturday Night Live sketch, Mel Gibson World's Sexiest Gynecologist, to see how it could have turned out), this is just not done here. Women crowd to get into his office not because he is sexy, but because he is just so good to them all. He's warm, and he obviously cares for everyone around him, strangers included. The rich-and-unsatisfied wife is a stock character in drama. We don't ever see Dr. T's wife in that characterization, but she was obviously in that position. Dr. T's daughters, Connie and Dee Dee, appear at first to be pretty stable. They're a doctor's daughters and dress very beautifully. Dee Dee is a cheerleader, kind of a dream profession, but she's not very good. She's also about to get married, but she will regrettably have to abandon a more rewarding relationship to do so. To get married is, of course, the American symbol of stability and normalcy. Connie is in bundles, although she constantly asserts to her father, Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Hardly. She is constantly in knots over her sister's foolhearty decision and she obsesses about JFK's assassination (the film takes place in Dallas). To boot, Dr. T's sister, Peggy, has arrived at his home, divorce pending, with her three daughters. Peggy is completely unstable; she can hardly deal with her young daughters and she drinks like a fish. Dr. T also has an assistant, Carolyn, who constantly interrupts personal conversations and rest time with the pretext of anxious patients; the truth is that she is lonely and secretly in love with her boss. Dr. T is being crowded by these and many other women in his life, and, like any doctor, relaxes on the golf course. There, he meets Bree, a woman pro golfer who has decided to relax a little herself. With all of his burdens, Dr. T immediately becomes involved with this source of stability, someone who is confident in her current decisions. All of this may seem like a mess to many, but it shouldn't be if you know a film like Nashville.As Altman likes to do, the climax takes place at a marvelous setpiece, Dee Dee's wedding. It is outside, and it's threatening to storm. A bundle of problems are arising, and, as it begins to pour, chaos ensues. Dr. T's experiences an epiphany stability is overrated. Not everything can be perfect, so it is pointless to exhaust oneself trying to make it so. A similar theme runs through Cast Away of the same year. Dr. T embraces the chaos and jumps into a covertible. As he puts the top up, the wind rips it apart. He laughs and drives off in the rain towards Bree's apartment. He has chosen to convince her to run away with him. She wants no part in it. She is happy where she is, is stable. She knows that she cannot control her life perfectly, but she knows that she must exert some control. Hurt but not destroyed, Dr. T drives away. We don't know where he's going, and I doubt he does either. As he drives, a tornado descends upon him and sucks him away. This part probably angers a lot of viewers also because it is so random and untelegraphed. But I think it works. Fantastically, Dr. T survives the tornado, but has ended up in an isolated area of Mexico. The village nearby is isolated and in need of a doctor to deliver a baby. He does so. He is there to begin a new life. Again, he exists in a state of possible stability as the town doctor, but also there exists the possibility for random events, i.e., the mystery.

I am a Robert Altman lover myself, but have not been afraid to criticize his films in the past. I'm probably the only one who will say that I hated The Player. I felt it was a rather childish lash out at Hollywood. I also criticized greatly Short Cuts and Brewster McCloud (although I ultimately gave them the thumbs up). But he has made at least one of the best films ever made, Nashville, a masterpiece through and through, and several other very good films, including MASH, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and his previous film, Cookie's Fortune, which I would deem wonderful. Doctor T struck me as also very excellent, and I'm giving it an 8\/10, which, in four-star criticism, equals a 3.5\/4 stars.First, before I discuss why I liked the film, I must point out its most glaring fault, the one which, I think, must sour the film for most of its viewers. This is the whole Hestia Complex deal to which Dr T's wife, played by Farrah Fawcett, becomes subjected. Obviously a made-up complex, it seemingly insults our intelligence. According to her psychiatrist, it is a complex which crops up when a woman is loved too much. When she has everything she could possibly want. It happens because the mystery of existence no longer exists. Thus, a woman with this complex reverts to a childlike state. This whole complex thing pops up within the film's first act, and, since we don't believe it, we just say, Oh, that's so stupid. That could never happen. And then we just block it out of our minds for the rest of the film. Whenever it crops up again, we just try to ignore it. Fawcett's acting skills make the whole thing seem even more stupid. This is not the right attitude to take. It is not stupid, per se, but what is truthful to say about it is that it is contrived. Contrivances are not a no-no when it comes to art. If you think they are, then you obviously don't remember Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliette, among others. You have to just accept the contrivances as much as you can, suspend your disbelief a little. This whole Hestia Complex thing is utterly important for your understanding of Dr. T.Now, onto the rest of the film.

The path that the love story would take was crystal clear five minutes into the couple's first interlude.  The scene on the bridge was recycled sappiness that dates at least as far back as It's a Wonderful Life.  And honestly, I can't think of a better example of emotional manipulation than the ending of this movie.  I was surprised and disappointed in myself that I didn't see that ending coming sooner than I did.Having said all of that, I think this movie has in its heart of hearts a noble goal.  Some people are saying, Yeah, the kid had a nice idea and all, but that's just not the way the world works.  Well, whose fault is that?  What they really mean is that that's not the way that PEOPLE work.  By calling it the world they allow themselves to sleep at night feeling like there's some abstract automated mechanized system out there running and making decisions about every aspect of our environment and it would be an exercise in futility to try to oppose it.  They forget or dismiss the fact that this system is set up, run, and maintained by people.  That's us -- you and me.  Knowingly or not, we decide how this world works.  I feel like this movie is trying, however clumsily, to remind us of this fact, and it is for this reason that I hesitate to dismiss it entirely.

I agree with some of the comments posted here, that the child does not fit with the characters and plotlines, there should have been some development with the main characters' relationship with each other before a family was introduced, especially if they are releasing a third!Sadly though the film falls into the tired stereotypical view of a sequel, where the writer has not spent enough time in developing the plot so that each event affects the relationship between all characters. As a result the characters appear flat and do not relate very well with the audience. However this is still no where near as bad as some of the sequels I have seen before, like the terrible regurgitation that Disney's Dinosaur  is to Don Bleuth's  The Land Before TimeIf there is one word to describe the plot in this movie, the word would be LinearI will add a bit more though and talk about the SFX for a moment, generally the sfx were good but in the last scene when the Scorpion King appears I laughed at how terrible that effect was, it seemed to me that they wanted to finnish this scene as quickly and as cheaply as possible(Perhaps their budget ran out?)

First, the subject matter. The movie is not for everyone. I agree with that. But I liked the way the subject matter was handled. It is handled in a way that most of the actors at least deliver a line that is funny. The other reason critics overlooked this cult classic is because of its pace. The critics couldn't keep up with it and that's why they couldn't find any laughs.But for me,  Radioland Murders is a classic cult comedy that pits good performances and slapstick against visual effects. The visual effects in the movie never distract from the main storyline. This is evident in two scenes. the opening shot and the sequence in which Brian Benben hangs from the call letters when he is on the lam for murder.The storyline takes place in 1939 at the radio station WBN, where they are attempting to create a fourth national network. But behind the scenes, everything is going wrong. The biggest sponser demands that half the scripts need to be rewritten. Roger Henderson (Benben) is trying to win back his wife, Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson) and both Roger and Penny are trying to solve some very real murders that started at the same time the show did.I liked just about every scene in the movie, with my favorites being the interrogation scene and the scene where Rick Rochester (Michael McKean) and his band are going round and round due to the turntable, resulting in one of the six murders that occur without the film.As I said, the perfomances are excellent. Brian Benben was born to play Roger, as well as Mary Stuart Masterson, who was born to play Penny. Ned Beatty is very good as General Whalen, as is Jeffery Tambor, who plays his son Walt Whalen Jr. Michael Lerner is wonderfully crazy as Lieutenant Cross.

Over the last 4 or 5 days I have watched the entire four films over again. Here's my objective reasonsing behind my opinion. First, two things that I will not hold against this movie or Lucas. 1) It is impossible to follow the original trilogy, especially after 16 years. Expectations combined with the grossly overdone media hype pretty much sealed Phantom Menace's fate as a dissapointment. 2) I'm sure it is very difficult to SPECIFICALLY write a movie as part one of a trilogy and have the story make any real sense. While Lucas has always claimed that A New Hope was envisioned as the start of a trilogy, I just don't buy it. The ONLY aspect of New Hope that lent itself to a sequel was the fact that Darth Vader didn't die.Here are the big problems with Phantom Menace that were never problems with the original trilogy. 1) Lack of direction. While the CGI shots were all gorgeous, and the sets and locales very nice, the actors were all very wooden and appeared bored. While directing was never a strong suit of the original trilogy, at least it wasn't a liability. 2) Lack of character development. Some might say this is due to lack of direction, but I think it's due to a fairly weak script. In A New Hope the main protagonists really pulled you in and you were interested in their struggles. In Phantom Menace, the characters were just too shallow. Anakin was VERY unconvincing, due to a combination of horrid dialouge and wooden acting. Obi-Wan wasn't even needed in the film at all until the climax. The characters in Phantom Menace simply didn't inspire any great emotion. Something that you cannot say about A New Hope some 24 years later. 3) The BIGGEST fault in the film and something that is DIRECTLY against Lucas' own views. SFX that take precedence over the story. That should be the tagline for Phantom Menace. The story is very compelling, deep and interesting for about 20 minutes total. The rest of the movie is simply padding for the next blockbuster CGI overload. The Pod Race scene and the journey to the underwater Gungan kingdom being the two biggest offenders. Sure, these scenes look great, but both could have been cut down by at least half and the movie would have been just as good. Another example is Jar Jar. While upon repeating viewings, he gets less and less annoying, being annoying isn't my biggest fault with him. My biggest Jar Jar issue is that Lucas forced him on us. It's as if he said, Maybe if I put JarJar in 85% of the scenes, the audience will forget he's a fancy computerized cartoon. Of course this horribly backfired. The majority of the audience found Jar Jar annoying, therefore concetrating on him more, which made him look that much more like a cartoon as opposed to being just another character. Sure CP30 was annoying here and there in the original movies, but you never thought of him as a man in a suit, he was always a character. I quickly wrote off Jar Jar as a computerized Looney Toon only put in the movie to fall over himself. Lucas never pulled him off as a character. (The other CG characters were much more convincing however).In my opinion, these are the three major faults of Phantom Menace that place it squarely on the bottom of the Star Wars movies. None of the original three films had any of these same faults. That being said, I still thought it was an enjoyable movie overall. I don't share the love it \/ hate it mentality of many of the reviewers here. As a stand alone film, I would give it 7\/10. Here's my ranking for the Star Wars films.Episode 1 5\/10 Episode 4 9\/10 Episode 5 10\/10 Episode 6 8\/10 (NOTE I thought Episode 6 was only 7\/10, but it gained one point for the final space battle.
