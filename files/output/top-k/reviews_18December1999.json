[{"date":"18 December 1999","score":"","review":"     Teen Schwartzman (budding play-wright and extracurricular maven), and oldtimer Murray (professor and wealthy industry maven) are both romantically interested in instructor Williams at elite private school Rushmore.  The focus, if a focus can be determined, seems to be on the sometimes rocky relationship between Schwartzman and Murray.  Too little is done to explain the motivations of the male leads, and the film lacks continuity, cutting from one vignette to the next.  Williams does grow on you through the film, and the story does have its moments, but something is missing here.  Not a bad rental, but a little too bizarre and\/or unconventional for my tastes.
