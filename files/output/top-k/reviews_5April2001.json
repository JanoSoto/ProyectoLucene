It has managed to stay hidden in the background from critic eyes and yet it literally crouched up onto the competition and take everyone by surprise at the last minute. If you look at all the films selected for Oscar nominations, every one of them has been playing in the theatres for a long time or has been a major box office hit. The only film that is remotely similar in feel is Chocolat and at best it is a long shot to win Best Picture. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came onto the seen not too long ago and not with a lot of marketing hype and yet it has managed to garner the second most Oscar nominations next to the goliath film, Gladiator. This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do make women the strong central characters.The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not.

This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do make women the strong central characters.The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not. Take this film for what it was meant to be&#133;a story about a legend, inner strength and undeniable honor.Alan  ","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"5 April 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  A team of young scientists working for the Defense Department invent a serum that transforms laboratory animals into an invisible state.

Anyway what of the film.  I ought to warn you that I haven't read the book so I can't say whether it was faithful to the story or not, but a guy in the discussion group seemed to think that it was fairly faithful, bar some omissions that were needed to squeeze it into it's just over 2 hour running time. The story is fun with some great twists appearing in the final third of the film.  It revolves around the complicated inter-relationships of three friends over a period of around twenty years in France during the latter years of Napoleon's life.  Woven into this story are a lot of characters but unfortunately there are only a few that we are ever given a real insight into.  But these characters are fascinating and the actors playing them are great.  Special note should go to Guy Pierce who played an unusual character very strongly.  But the show was stolen by Richard Harris who not only brought a light touch to the film just as it was beginning to get quite depressing, but also added a much needed sense of gravitas to the story. The locations were great, as were the costumes.  The music was awful, but everybody complained about that so hopefully they'll change it.  The film had too long a build up and the third act was bogged down by needless socialising scenes used to show us that the Count of Monte Cristo was fitting into society when we had already accepted that fact.

The Big Lebowski is like an answer to my prayers.  This is a comedy that works in ALL aspects.  Sometimes you have a comedy that's funny, but the writing's terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving.  This movie not only has a great cast, but it's wonderfully written (by those genius Coen Brothers), lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack.  Each and every character has a quirky, notable personality.  My favorite, though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes, was Jesus Quintana (played masterfully by John Turturro).  He cracked me up so hard!!!  And I love that scene where Jesus goes up to bowl, licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slow-motion as he hits a strike.  He dances in the lane and rejoices, while we hear a Mariachi version of the famous Hotel California in the background.  Only the Coen Brothers can make a scene work that smoothly.  There are other memorable sequences, like the musical number called Gutterballs with Jeff Bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by Sadam Hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women.  You watch a scene like that, and you wonder why this movie didn't nab an Oscar for Best Art Direction.      Ethan and Joel Coen have a great sense of originality, and that also showed in their other hilarious comedy, Raising Arizona.  I loved that movie, too.  But I loved this movie twice as much.  Some won't approve of its maximum dosage of f words, but I was laughing so hard that didn't bother me one bit.  The Big Lebowski is one of those flicks that shows you what comedy is all about, and how to really form a good punchline with perfect timing and delivery.  As a bonus, the film is packed with stunning visuals.  It's such a great movie to look at.  There are no cheap shots in this one.  The dialogue is imaginative, yet realistic.  It's not the least bit pretentious.  You know, as you watch this, that this IS the way people talk.  And that was also shown in Fargo.  And I liked that even though the central character was a simple-minded individual, they didn't construct him like someone out of a Bill and Ted movie.  Jeff Bridges, who is perfectly cast, was extremely entertaining and I can say the same about John Goodman as his easily-angered friend who follows all the Jewish holidays even though he's not Jewish.  I find it a tad appalling that critics have panned this movie and called it slight and forgettable.  This is more intelligent than most comedies in recent years--or any year.

I saw a premiere in Boston for free so i figured i can't go wrong. (expect of course if it was the blair witch project 2, Yuck) Well it turns out i was right, the movie was cheesy fun and i emphasized on the word cheesy.The point of the movie is simple, we live in a age of complete advertisement, you are a target market. Every thing around us is all advertisement, sporting events, concerts, movies, heck just look on the top and bottom of this site and i will guarantee that there is a add for something. this movie surrounds this topic in a slap stick sort of way.The writers exaggerated that everything is controlled by media and entertainment, in this case putting hidden messages in music to brain wash teens into thinking what is cool and what isn't.

Anderson has once again enlisted the services of his favourite group of actors (the excellent Reilly, Hoffman, Macy, Hall, Moore) with the much talked about addition of Tom Cruise as sex guru Frank TJ Mackay. The story takes place completly in L.A over the course of 1 long day. Essentially this could be considered Short Cuts 2 and Anderson produces flawless performances from his very talented cast. Even smaller roles are superbly acted and Cruise's turn as Mackay defies all expectations, frequently delievering quotable one liners (i'm quietly judging you). Anderson directs with great skill and like other budding directors (David O Russel, Guy Richie) really shows visual flair (the zooming cancer sequence). This film is extraordianly moving and deals with emotions we all face, depression, loss, desperation. Some have said this film is too depressing and hollow but that is life sometimes, and if this film is 'too depressing' guess what, that is what life is like sometimes. Anderson (29) shows confidence and skill switching between storylines. How many other directors would be brave enough to show his entire cast suddenly break out in song? but the gambit works and feels very appropriate for that moment in the film (however Mann's 'Save Me' would have been a better choice for this scene) This is a film that really requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate as i found the switching between charcters to be a little off putting at first. This is a film of few faults but Anderson does occasionally loose focus of the story at times. Every charcter is so well observed and acted and you can really empathise with many.

The development of the characters of the warden, and Brooks, for example, really fleshes out the story well.The acting and direction is perfectly subtle and restrained, and though the feel may be a bit slow at times for some people, it gives a good sense of the feeling of time slowly dripping by in these people's lives.What a shame that this was nominated for so many Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor (Morgan Freeman), and adapted screenplay, cinematography, music, etc., but didn't win anything. Granted, Forrest Gump is a great film, too, but it would have been nice if Shawshank had at least won something. Oh, well, that's not really important in the big picture, I suppose.

Everyone is relatable, and I can see a lot of myself in Alvy especially.Bittersweet but not sad, touching but not sappy, Annie Hall strikes note after perfect note.  I don't think I could ever get tired of it.  And I think it's a movie that most everybody should see.

One of the funniest, most honest, challeging, interesting movies I've seen.  And I never get tired of watching it.Woody Allen co-wrote, directed, and stars as Alvy Singer, a Jewish comedian living in New York City (Sound familiar?).  The film chronicles the years he spends with Annie Hall, a particularly long and important relationship in his life.  Jumping around in time, it presents the big picture of what it's like to be that guy, in that place, in that time.The film is very, very funny, one of Allen's funniest, and filled with lines that you laugh at once, then realize how smart they are and laugh again.  No one could really be that quick, but when it feels so good, go with it.  Alvy often breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the camera, to great comic effect.
