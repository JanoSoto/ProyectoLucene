For those of you who loved the Royal Tenenbaums and haven't seen the other Wes Anderson movies, I envy you, because you have quite a show ahead of you! *Especially* with Rushmore, which is slighty better than Bottle Rocket in my opinion.I'll admit, the humor is out there. It is not for all. If you are in love with movies by the Farrelly Brothers, or any teenybopper comedies like American Pie - - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!! Because you won't get it.I AM SICK AND TIRED of people commenting that they HATED this movie, or that they HATED Bottle Rocket or Tenenbaums, or that they HATED other great movies by great directors (Coens, C.Guest, etc.) So, I'll repeat IF YOU ARE A COMPLETE IDIOT WHO NEEDS EVERYTHING SPOON-FED - - just simply STAY AWAY! You don't get it, and you never will. The easiest solution to your problem is to just put your leash back on get back in your line - - and STAY AWAY FROM ME!!!!hehehe, just had to get that off my chest. .. .anyway, rushmore is a great movie if you enjoy something a little different... Take dead aim on the rich kids. Get them in the crosshairs, and take them down ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  After seeing that the Royal Tenenbaums was slated ahead of Rushmore on the user rating system here at IMDB, i feel I have to stand up for Wes Anderson's best work (Rushmore and Bottle Rocket).

Unfortunately his foolish, aimless and violent thrillers are far from being perfect.He has an ability to direct excellent, speedy action scenes with lots of destruction, blood, explosions, shooting, excitement and superb special effects but for some reason everything else doesn't seem to matter anymore. All of this seems so pointless when the movie has no meaning of any kind. Therefore his flicks are aimed for more simple people who want to shut off their brains and try to avoid all thinking while watching 'em. Harlin's movies are for innocent kiddies who are sick and tired of cartoons - for those little boys who sneak to watch these films at evenings after mommy and daddy are already at sleep.Well what is his best work? Sometimes even sadistic Cliffhanger (1993) was only watchable and the amazingly terrible Cutthroat island (1995) is obviously best to left unmentioned. His early projects Born American (1986) and Prison (1988) - ones he directed before he got some bigger name in Hollywood - were quite memorable and good but I guess in the end it's a tight battle between Deep Blue Sea (1999) and Die Hard 2 (1990). What I'm saying is, Deep Blue Sea isn't all that lousy.Samuel L. Jackson is probably the most well-known actor of the movie but it doesn't make the other ones look like less good. No troubles in acting department, that is. Movie is basically so full of worn-out clichés and stolen ideas from Jaws to Alien and dozens of others movies it's easy to find it irritating. Still, if it works it works. It's that simple. Deep Blue Sea has a nice, gripping script and once again Harlin gives the audience many thrilling effects, shocks and chases. It builds lots of excitement and keeps it up throughout the movie. Pretty good effort from Harlin but I guess in the end Die Hard's first sequel will remain as his greatest work.
