[{"date":"27 April 2014","score":"","review":" Being a fan of the punk rock and heavy metal community, I decided to check out SLC Punk. I can honestly admit that the film had a lot more depth than I had imagined it would. The film raises a lot of questions about loyalty and how long one can hold onto their beliefs as time passes.At the start of the film Steveo and Heroin Bob, played by Matthew Lillard and Michael A. Goorjian, are dedicated punks determined to spread their anarchist message in the highly conservative Salt Lake City. Their social circle has grown quite large with devoted followers. Steveo's parents are proud former hippies who have since become wealthy lawyers, an act by which Steveo accuses them of selling out. Over time, SLC's punk ring starts to dissolve with Steveo, Bob, and Trish as some of the few remaining punks, with Steveo beginning to question his own beliefs.Steveo mentions in the film that in order to be a true punk you cannot simply draw on a band's lyrics or how they dress, but you must truly believe in the code of anarchy which he firmly abides by. As the film progresses, though, he starts to see the negative aspects of this lifestyle. A fellow punk has a mishap with LSD and ends up homeless with brain damage. His girlfriend is caught cheating on him causing him to attack the man she was sleeping with. These events make Stevo question his beliefs and make him wonder if he is truly a punk. At a party, he falls in love with another girl and stays with her even after she points out these flaws. After a tragic event happens following the party, Steveo gives up the punk lifestyle and returns to college and thus himself, sells out and describes himself as just another poser.Ultimately I think SLC Punk's message is that, simply, people change. It doesn't matter how devoted to something someone is, they will likely move on in time. To remain frozen in time in an ever-changing society is futile and one must learn to expand their knowledge of society and life in order for their views to stay relevant. In the end I think that this film teaches great lesson on finding yourself and discovering what kind of person you will become.

One thing about war genre is that director can be obsessed with the infeasible idea of depicting the cruelty of as many people as possible, but deer hunter has no such ambition, it simply tells us a story between three blue-collar workers' life, totally changed by the harrowing war. But the pain is self explanatory, it is simply out there that we automatically internalize it without the necessity of the movie itself conflating it to the dark nature of humanity and warfare.Normally, what kind of director have the guts to hold the camera steadily to a wedding for so long unabashedly, to meticulously and objectively observe every particulars and trivia happened there, thus allow the audience themselves to see each character's mindset and personality, each sparks and subtle fermentation between those young people, each encounters reflective of their unpreparedness of life and more solemnly and impending, the war, each purposeless and dare-devil machismo's ludicrousness, which only serve to contrast the utter atrocity and macabre of the war and even make the former seem juvenile and pediatric. The movie moves slowly as if it has all the time in the world, and it is about to show us the deeper reality between figures, we see Michale has this huge impulse to kiss Linda but his restrained it, this two-second moments has more romantic tension than all your contemporary New York City love stories can ever get in sum, and its not a punch in the stomach, we always sorta of getting it, Meryl's role in this dabble and cul-de-sac town is a marvel to everyone, she's vulnerable and delicate, has a drunkard abusive father yet she can maintain her breathtaking grace and have fun with her friends, she is meant to be something that has the chemical so powerful to change the route of the movie. We also see a grim-faced veteran sitting taciturnly at the bar, refusing to engage in the tumultuous and cheerful background, and the drunk crowd's amazing numbness show their unpreparedness an ignorance of the war, they have zero knowledge of what could be after them, possibly because of their youth and stupidity, but more likely because of their subconscious refusal to think about what is awaiting their far away from home, that's why when they are so heavily drunk and running naked on the street, they promised each other of never letting each other alone in the war,its a bit of martyred romanticism and adolescent promise, but its still effectively spellbinding immediately and Michale did realize its promise. And I really just enjoy the way they sang together in a bar playing snooker, ChristopheR Walken has such a style, as alway.The whole movie's opening is linear, chronically developed with steady pace without letting one single shot being wasted or redundant, shows us each person's traits and prebolds their destiny. The crowd's bantering and even verbal altercation on their deer hunting shoot ed in such a joyous way, that I simply give up my compulsory psychoanalysis and just enjoy their dialog, this part could have worked as a audio-book. It's natural, plain and very characteristic, with the composing foggy sceneries of the valley, the happiness ofcommaraderies between the crowd is escalated to a ecclesiastic level, more like a ritual for them to re communicate and re unionize. Michale's stubbornness and his swerving principle has always accompanied him, (if he refused to lend a pair of boots, he wont do it), and that's probably another reason why Michale turned into a resolute and granite soldier with an uncompromising and courageous spine, though going through the same ordeal as nick and Stevie, he's the only one who still has the strength to try, try to assimilate himself into the old small town lifestyle, still has the power to purge the harrowing and slit-throat memories out of his brain while nick and Stevie had succumbed themselves to the inflictions and haunted fears, one physically and one mentally. Of course the most carving image of deer hunter is the notorious Russian roulette, probably the most nerve cracking moments on big screen with exactitude and genuine that I can barely watch through, which is the award-winning moments for Christopher walken as he gradually has a nerve breakdown under the audience's eyes. But the when the war ended, this sort of gambling is continued, thus I'm not sure if the director is predominantly inclined to flagellate the inhumanities of war, but how the war can bring changes to innocent individuals, with the side dish of the classic gravitas of war. Seriously I don't particularly see deer hunter as a war movie, but a movie consistently and continuously spanned around three friends' lives, from one of them's wedding to another's funeral, war is just one of the many important event that happened in their lives, the accentuation is surely not the war, it's the influence it has upon normal small-town human being, the antiwar sensation is something we can possibly deduce from the particulars of the movie, it never is the central topic, and it's the way I love to depict the war.

But the message behind them was political and very clear. It opened a can of worms when discussing vigilantism and crime rates. Death Wish 3 casts off any sign of political undertone and goes right for the blood splattering exploitation of a drive inn classic. Quentin Tarantino probably loves Death Wish 3. It is light on the story this time around and it is really just 90% Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) blowing away bad guys one after another. The fortunate thing for Death Wish 3 is that somehow it endears itself to you in the most guilty way. As a red blooded male at least you find yourself wide eyed and your blood pumping watching our favourite vigilante take out ridiculously violent revenge against the most insane and over the top group of thugs yet. The first two films managed to avoid being campy or cheesy but Death Wish 3 definitely crosses that line. The neighbourhood that Kersey finds himself in is the definition of living hell and the thugs that dominate it are ridiculous but it makes it more fun to watch them being blown away.Charles Bronson is the pinnacle bad-ass. He endeared himself to us from the very beginning in his plight for justice and self-peace. He hasn't found either and now he's cornered into cleaning up the worst neighbourhood on the planet. Bronson rumoredly didn't like the script for Death Wish 3 and I think maybe it shows in his very unemotional, stone cold performance. Fortunately, it works because he is often like that. He just doesn't seem himself this time around but he still kills like no ones business and looks cool doing it. Ed Lauter, a great character actor, plays a cop who is tired of doing things the legal way and corners Bronson into doing his dirty work. He isn't a villain per se and he is the one last remnant of the whole political\/moral debacle that Death Wish has dealt with. Lauter is good but underused until near the end. Deborah Raffin is an unfortunate addition to the cast, nothing against her. She does a fine job in a very empty and pointless character. They try to force a ridiculous romance into the story that seems out of place and pointless. Its like a story thread that doesn't go anywhere and gets left behind in a hail of bullets. Martin Balsam, Gavan O'Herlihy, Kirk Taylor, and Alex Winter are some of the more noticeable performances either for being campy or for at least driving the story. The addition of a single villain a big-bad if you will is completely different for the series. It shows that film makers trying to turn Death Wish into a mainstream action flick. It isn't a bad move and the villain is decent but sort of underdeveloped. His final death scene though is truly 80's action awesome.Michael Winner returns for his third and last time at the helm of the Death Wish franchise. Honestly, this doesn't even feel like his style and I wonder if someone else took over as it sounds like there was a lot of animosity on the set so much so that Winner and Bronson never worked together again. Sometimes when a film goes through behind the scenes chaos like that it shows in the final product and I think Death Wish 3 is an example of that. However, they are fortunate enough that Bronson and Death Wish are both iconic in their own way and I think Death Wish 3 came out at a good time to be considered an exploitative classic. I certainly didn't hate watching it, but rather I felt disappointment for the direction of a shockingly intelligent series thus far. It had always been exploitative and violent but the purpose, moral ambiguity, and political side has been cast off for sheer balls to the wall violence. Fun and guilty pleasure? Yes for sure.

And although I watched Dirty Dancing eleventy million times when I was younger I never really liked it.I zapped in around the beginning of Dance with Me, where Rafael talks to Ruby about dancing and she tells him off. My first impulse was Hah! Serves you right. Dancing isn't the breeze you believe it to be. and to switch channels.I don't know what made me stay. Maybe it was Chayanne's boyish smile (which surprises me a lot as neither he himself nor the character he portrays is my type at all), maybe it was the overall lightness of the movie, I couldn't say. But stay I did.And I didn't regret it. The dancing is wonderful. It speaks. It tells me things about the characters that no dialogue could ever bring across without being - well, yes - cliché. And yes, the movie is predictable and - here we go again - cliché (I seem to like this word a lot tonight...) but somehow this does not diminish its charm one jot.

I guess it's as good a thing to do as any when you're having your morning coffee and cigarette.This movie truly is a milestone in bad superhero movies and just movies in general. If you haven't seen it yet, see it immediately just to laugh at how atrocious it is. I couldn't begin to list the faults with this movie, but this'll give you an idea laughable acting, atrocious dialogue, endless bad puns, poor production values, the list goes on. This is that one film where nitpicking is an unheard-of term. Everything that could go wrong with a movie goes wrong in all its glory. When it comes to plot, Mr.Freeze (played laughably by Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to freeze Gotham with the help of Poison Ivy (a misfire of a performance by Uma Thurman) who wants to cover the city in plants, an amazingly lazy evil plan that contains two elements that can't even co-exist. So it's up to Batman and Robin (the most irritating on-screen partnership in film history) to stop them.........that's it - no character development, no clever twists, just dumbassery and terrible puns all the way. Although Joel Schumacher apologised for this film years later (kudos to him), it doesn't change the fact that this film buried Batman in a pile of disappointment and criticism only to be resurrected in great fashion by Christopher Nolan years later. The main problem with this film is that it is clearly designed to sell toys. When usually toys are the bi-product of a film, this film is totally at the mercy of the toys it is meant to be selling. It's like a person being taken for a walk by their dog. The toys and merchandise have clearly made the film their servant. Not to mention the film is just cheesy and corny all the way through. I'd be wrong if I told you the film is isn't worth seeing just so you can say you sat through it, but if you know nothing about the movie come for Batman, but stay for the laughs.

Even that joke is played out for far more than it is worth and, like the cutaways to the elders' bland dinner engagement, gets to feel repetitive before long. Thankfully, the actresses chosen to fill in the shoes of the menaced pranksters are an engaging lot&#x85;even if Castle's reprise of the upbeat opening music cue (heard over the credits cleverly displayed through opening and shutting eyes!) for the ending was perhaps a bit misjudged seeing how the two sisters had just been threatened by a knife-wielding serial killer! Incidentally, for the typically ingenious ad campaign for the film, Castle proudly proclaimed to cinema patrons that the film they were about to watch involved uxoricide and had selected seats strapped with belts intent on keeping viewers from leaping out of them in shock!

The film's dedication states This motion picture is dedicated to those Americans, both living and dead, whose gallant effort made possible daylight precision bombing. They were the only Americans fighting in Europe in the fall of 1942. They stood alone, against the enemy and against doubts from home and abroad. This is their story . Gen. Frank Savage (Gregory Peck , though John Wayne turned down this leading role) is sent by Gen. Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) to the combat group after the Bomber Commander Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is relieved of duty . As a hard-as-nails general takes over a bomber unit suffering from low morale and whips them into fighting shape . However , the newcomer General also begins to feel the strain of the leadership . This is a story of valiant twelve men as their women never knew them . It is an example of a pilot's enemy position call . During World War II pilots would call-out the positions of enemy airplanes by referring to their bearings via the use of a pretend face of a clock . In this case, 12 O'Clock meant the enemy was directly ahead, whereas 6 O'Clock would mean directly behind. High or Low referred to whether the enemy was above or below the airplane respectively. Even meant that the enemy was level with the pilot's plane. This is a thrilling film dealing with patriotism and heroism , starred by a maverick General and his underlings carrying out risked feats on air and bombing German installations . However , the air battles were cut together from authentic World War II footage . In fact , the opening prologue states  The air battle scenes in this Motion Picture were photographed in actual combat by members of the United States Air Force and the German Luftwaffe . Much of the flick concerns the relentless fight of a brave General , masterfully played by Gregory Peck , to whip his outfit into a disciplined team in spite of heavy casualties . This film is frequently cited by surviving bomber crewmembers as the only accurate depiction from Hollywood of their life during the war . Based on a novel by Beirne Lay Jr. and Sy Bartlett ; being well adapted by these authors , they wanted the script to concentrate fully on the psychological effects of war and the theme of commanding . Many characters in this film were based on real-life people such as Gen. Savage inspired by Gen. Frank Armstrong and many others . Excellent Gregory Peck as the flight commander who takes over an England-based bomber squadron and it helped assure him a place in Hollywood immortality . Very good support cast such as Hugh Marlowe as Lt. Col. Ben Gately , Gary Merrill as Col. Keith Davenport , Millard Mitchell as Gen. Pritchard , Robert Arthur as Sgt. McIllhenny , Paul Stewart as Capt. 'Doc' Kaiser and Dean Jagger as Maj. Harvey Stovall , he won an Academy Award for secondary actor for his fine acting ; most of them inspired on real characters . Evocative as well as sensitive musical score by the classic Alfred Newman . Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Leon Shamroy , usual cameraman of super-productions . Henry King 's direction is well crafted , though William A. Wellman was attached to direct at one point . Here Henry King is more thought-provoking and inclined toward brooding issues and no much action , as a romantic subplot, which features in the book, was dropped at the studio's insistence .
