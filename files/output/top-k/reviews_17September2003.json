I prefer movies that are just plain weird because because the director has a uniquely strange vision and that's the way they turned out e.g. the movies of Russ Meyer, David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Ed Wood, Jess Franco, Walerian Borowczyk. There are a couple of exceptions I have a lot of time for - the Chiodo brothers 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space', and this one, 'The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension'. Some people absolutely adore this movie, others think it is one of the worst ever made. I fall somewhere in between. Every time I watch it I always slightly disappointed, as it never lives up to what it COULD have been, but there's enough good things about it to not make me regret having it in my collection. The best thing about the movie is the cast. Peter Weller stars as the super scientist\/surgeon\/rocker\/all around good guy Buckaroo Banzai, and he may have appeared in some other forgettable movies but I have a soft spot for him because he was in two of my all time favourites, 'RoboCop' and 'Naked Lunch'. The rest of the cast includes lots of familiar faces and character actors - Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Clancy Brown, Dan Hedaya,etc.etc. John Lithgow really hams it up as Dr. Lizardo but it suits the material. I also got a kick out of seeing 'Quincy's sidekick Robert Ito, and a small cameo from Rosalind Cash from 'The Omega Man'. The one thing that really lets the movie down for me is the naff music. It should have been more like Devo and less like Eddie and The Cruisers. 'Buckaroo Banzai' is a silly movie, but it is a silly FUN movie, and if that's what you're looking for, you could do a LOT worse. In fact I'd take this movie, flaws and all, over just about any hilarious comedy or buddy action movie churned out by Hollywood over the last few years. At least this movie leaves me with a smile on my face, and not anger for wasting my time sitting through cynically created and marketed unfunny garbage. Plus, what was the last movie you saw that had Thomas Pynchon in jokes?!

Yep, a physicist. Whoa. And if that didn't scare or thrill you, then either will this movie, because that's probably the scariest thing about this turkey.Reeves plays Eddie Kasalivich (say it ten times in a row real fast), a student of physics and an on-the-side machinist who likes to put his physics to work with his machines, of course. Eddie has a brand-new project that is going to blow the world away - literally. Because his experiment sets off a chain of events, or CHAIN REACTION -- ding-ding! -- that succeeds in demolishing an entire building, city, and more. But methinks that it has nothing to do with his theories nor experiments -- it all is on-screen so audiences can see things go boom.But of course, if we as an audience wanted to see things go boom without a reasonable plot in the first place, we would just go see an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, which tend to have an amount of fun in them to satisfy anyone's cinematic action tastes. Chain Reaction thinks it's real smart and tries to be real smart by inserting lots of smart dialogue, in hopes that audiences will think it's a smart movie. It's not. It's more ridiculous than anything, and the long stretches of scientific mumbo-jumbo dialogue stand in the way of what we want to see -- fights, explosions, and big booms. And besides, how could the filmmakers possibly believe casting Keanu Reeves as a physicist would convince audiences it was a smart film? A slacker computer nerd who turns out to be The Chosen One, okay, yeah, I'll buy that, but a physicist? Insert guffaw here.Eddie works for Dr. Barkley (Nicholas Rudall), who is trying to extract sources of energy, or power for the layman, from water. Eddie succeeds in doing this along with his co-scientist, Lily (Rachel Weisz). Lily could be a potentially real character, but Rachel Weisz would never be the woman -- the movie acts like it could be telling a true story. It's just replacing peace with chaos and dorky scientists with pretty Hollywood faces.When they try to post their findings on the Internet, or The Big Interactive Computer Thingy to the layman, it sets off a CHAIN REACTION that results in a mysterious man named Shannon (Morgan Freeman) trying to frame them as spies selling their findings to the Chinese. He basically tries to frame them for doing exactly what Bill Clinton did. As Homer Simpson once said For shame. D'oh!Chain Reaction pauses at too many scenes to cram in unintelligable scientific goobalee-glock to the audience.

Just picture it Chain Reaction 2 Smarter and More Unoriginal Than Last Time! Tagline What if the world around us was all an illusion? What if CHAIN REACTION never happened?

Although I love a good Who Dunnit, mind games just aren't my favorite things to watch on film. However. This one is one of the best mixes of psychological AND supernatural genres of horror I've ever seen.I am amazed at the creative perpetration of such a complicated plot, sub plots, and extremely deep and well developed characters.The narrative is completely explanatory, filling in any blanks the direction may have left in its attempt to stay within budget. The acting quality is superb and great attention has been paid to the scenery, settings and prop details. The dialog is good and strong, and the narrative is not only thought-provoking, but some of the pearls of wisdom shared are truly eye-opening if you are open minded enough to allow that sort of thing.The filmography and cinematography of this move are exemplary.This movie all around just soars above other movies which have attempted this device.While other critics have compared this movie to Seven, this production is uniquely written, directed and portrayed. The only real similarity I found in the two are the darkly christian sub-texts and interpretations of the deeds done. I find it to be the veritable breath of fresh air one needs in order to keep stagnation and creativity block at bay.This unique and creative story line is quirky, imaginative and twisty.It defies your imagination and demands that you use it. Those who do not understand the plot, of this movie, simply do not possess the intelligence and creativity to think outside a dogmatic upbringing.John Goodman is very likable and believable as Jonesy, John Hobbes's (Denzell Washington's) partner. As they puzzle together the clues and begin to put together the pieces of a picture to which they can't yet even begin to see the outline, their characters and the working relationship between them become well defined and developed early on in the movie.The plot and story move right along, with no slow spots and no waste of film. What seems in the beginning to be a lull in the movie, actually gives you so many details you need in solving and understanding the bigger picture, that if you allow yourself not to pay attention to those scenes, you will not be able to follow the movie later.This is definitely one of those movies you have to WATCH. You can't just view it while you're doing other things, and still get anything from the movie. Take the almost 2 hours away from your busy schedule and let Denzell Washington entertain you, SCARE you, and maybe even make you think of other possibilities in this world.Sometimes, I think the basic job that human beings have, is just to figure out what the hell is going on? John Hobbes.Ignore the religious undertones, sit back and enjoy it.As the pieces begin to go into place, the puzzle gets even more complicated. This is where the intricate sub-plots begin to come into play. It's amazing how Gregory Hoblit (Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, and LA Law among others) keeps the story and plot separate and yet coherently brings them together without losing track of what is happening. Absolutely brilliant.One of the main things I enjoyed was experiencing the bond between Hobbes and his mentally-challenged brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) and his nephew Sam (Michael J. Pagan). I appreciated the loving way Hobbes dealt with them both, even in times of crisis.There are moments which mark your life; moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same, and time is divided into two parts before This and after This. John Hobbes.I found the narrative to be very intelligent and inspiring. Narrated by Denzell Washington in a cool, even voice.The scene inside the station house where the Fallen begins to interrogate Hobbes's character and then moves out into the street, again and again...is one of the most compelling psychologically freakish scenes I've ever experienced. It really, honestly spun me out. As one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, it goes into the Horror Hall of Fame along with the Redrum and the Heeeeere's Johnny! scenes of Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, for originality and outright freakishness.While most of the scary scenes of this movie are suspense, there are some out right scare you moments.All in all, I have to say this movie is by far a most excellent and entertaining movie all the way around.This production also contains a good, strong and believable performance by Donald Sutherland as Hobbes's Captain.

You can't just view it while you're doing other things, and still get anything from the movie. Take the almost 2 hours away from your busy schedule and let Denzell Washington entertain you, SCARE you, and maybe even make you think of other possibilities in this world.Sometimes, I think the basic job that human beings have, is just to figure out what the hell is going on? John Hobbes.Ignore the religious undertones, sit back and enjoy it.As the pieces begin to go into place, the puzzle gets even more complicated. This is where the intricate sub-plots begin to come into play. It's amazing how Gregory Hoblit (Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, and LA Law among others) keeps the story and plot separate and yet coherently brings them together without losing track of what is happening. Absolutely brilliant.One of the main things I enjoyed was experiencing the bond between Hobbes and his mentally-challenged brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) and his nephew Sam (Michael J. Pagan). I appreciated the loving way Hobbes dealt with them both, even in times of crisis.There are moments which mark your life; moments when you realize nothing will ever be the same, and time is divided into two parts before This and after This. John Hobbes.I found the narrative to be very intelligent and inspiring. Narrated by Denzell Washington in a cool, even voice.The scene inside the station house where the Fallen begins to interrogate Hobbes's character and then moves out into the street, again and again...is one of the most compelling psychologically freakish scenes I've ever experienced. It really, honestly spun me out. As one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, it goes into the Horror Hall of Fame along with the Redrum and the Heeeeere's Johnny! scenes of Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, for originality and outright freakishness.While most of the scary scenes of this movie are suspense, there are some out right scare you moments.All in all, I have to say this movie is by far a most excellent and entertaining movie all the way around.This production also contains a good, strong and believable performance by Donald Sutherland as Hobbes's Captain. I still love Sutherland's performances from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers days. I've never seen him portray a character poorly.He's definitely one of the greats. While I haven't liked every movie he's done, I've always enjoyed watching a real professional actor at work.I also have to say the same thing about Denzell Washington.While I've not always liked his movies, I've always enjoyed his roles and performances.This is one of my favorite thrillers and by merit of quality, originality and creativity, it rates a 9.4\/10 from...the Fiend .

Yes, The Phantom Menace is a flawed film but in no way does that make it bad. Its quite entertaining and visually stunning. George Lucas finally made the movie after 16 years apart from Return Of The Jedi. I know why some people are disappointed but I didnt mind the film at all.The acting is fine but I have a few complaints. Liam Neeson is quite good as Quigon, its in no way up to what the actor did in Schindlers List but its a good performance. Ewan McGregor is also good. Natalie Portman is fine, but she doesnt seem to have much to do here. Jake Lloyd is occasionally annoying but overall I think he does a credible job as young Anakin. Samuel L. Jackson has a brief but memorable role. Ahmed Best provides the voice for Jar-Jar Binks, and he makes the character so annoying, I think they should have reduced the character's screentime. The Best Performance comes from Ray Park who plays Darth Maul, he doesnt require as much acting as the others but he has one hell of a presence and has the right looks for the part. One of the disappointing things about this movie is they kill him off in the end.Star Wars was never known for having a grade A script, the script isn't weak here but occasionally has some bad dialogue. I like the way how Lucas planned everything out in this film, some scenes maybe be a bit familiar at times but are overall still satisfying. The ending is great, it does echo the ending of the original Star Wars a bit but the images are great looking and you see a connection between the characters. However, the script nor acting are not the most important things about this film, the special effects are. The Special Effects are quite brilliant, the pod-race is phenomenal and exhilirating. An underwater sequence is absoulutely beautiful. Lucas is known for applying great special effects to his films and he succeeds here. The Phantom Menace maybe flawed but it is certainly not a bad movie, it is enjoyable.

Although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he's just not a good director.Actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of Trekkies who say that William Shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. For although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original Star Trek, it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. Sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a Human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat is taking place. This lures the still-being-constructed Enterprise there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have experienced commanders (honestly, with how Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise's crew, save Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy, and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet God, who apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, what does God need with a starship. The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well.OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I've certainly led a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?So the plot's weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a Human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. Gee, I guess that means that Klingons should say isn't and don't more often than is not and do not. And the Cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad that I know this). Please... every ST race uses unique dialog. Why is Sybok the exception.The only thing to not complain about is the acting. I've always known Star Trek to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. Cudos also go to Leonard Nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock in his old age.Some other things I didn't likeShatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing Row, Row, Row your Boat in this movie.

For although his character, Captain James Kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original Star Trek, it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard McCoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.The plot is that some emotional Vulcan outcast named Sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. Sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a Human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat is taking place. This lures the still-being-constructed Enterprise there, since none of Starfleet's other ships have experienced commanders (honestly, with how Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them years ago). Sybok adds the Enterprise's crew, save Spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy, and Kirk. Sybok orders that the Enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet God, who apparently every race has a word for. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the Enterprise and Kirk asks, what does God need with a starship. The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok as well.OK, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just for releasing their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I've certainly led a trauma-free life. Why doesn't Kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join Sybok? What was the point of Sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?So the plot's weak. Another problem is that Sybok, though played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a Human religious fanatic. Shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional Vulcan. I guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. Gee, I guess that means that Klingons should say isn't and don't more often than is not and do not. And the Cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad that I know this). Please... every ST race uses unique dialog. Why is Sybok the exception.The only thing to not complain about is the acting. I've always known Star Trek to have great actors, and this movie is not exception.

You will understand this film a lot more.It relies so much on characters and a witty script as compared to explosions and fight scenes. But of course that's not to say it doesn't have any pyrotechnics or chase scenes or battles - the action scenes will satisfy even the biggest of action buffs. It just makes a lot more sense when they're there for a purpose.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Ryan Kimble. Kimble comes home from work one night after an emergency procedure at the hospital to find his wife brutally beaten to death by a one-armed man. The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer.After sentenced to death, Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail. But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine, coming to rest upon a railroad track. Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus, resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train, chained at his feet and arms. It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux.Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later. He is the ultimate seeker; he is barely ever wrong about anything, and when he is he doesn't like to admit it. Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved.Ryan keeps on running throughout the film, only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on. He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy, but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care Sam Gerard.If I am correct in my observations, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other. As Jones pursues Ford, it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why. It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience. This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions. We care for both characters in equal regards, and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis, who directed Collateral Damage and Holes. He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together. Given a terrific script like The Fugitive, Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film. The script and direction compliment themselves often, something that can't be said in most cases.Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in The Hunted, a film about a madman killer on the loose, and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him. The stupidity of the script hit me hard. I rewatched The Fugitive not a week after I saw The Hunted and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film.

The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer.After sentenced to death, Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail. But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine, coming to rest upon a railroad track. Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus, resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train, chained at his feet and arms. It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux.Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later. He is the ultimate seeker; he is barely ever wrong about anything, and when he is he doesn't like to admit it. Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved.Ryan keeps on running throughout the film, only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on. He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy, but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care Sam Gerard.If I am correct in my observations, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other. As Jones pursues Ford, it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why. It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience. This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions. We care for both characters in equal regards, and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis, who directed Collateral Damage and Holes. He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together. Given a terrific script like The Fugitive, Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film. The script and direction compliment themselves often, something that can't be said in most cases.Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in The Hunted, a film about a madman killer on the loose, and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him. The stupidity of the script hit me hard. I rewatched The Fugitive not a week after I saw The Hunted and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film. This is a movie that will wet the apetite of all action, mystery and thriller lovers alike who are looking for something different than the routine chase films. I know it did for me.4.5\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime"},{"date":"17 September 2003","score":"28 out of 38 people found the following review useful","review":"  Il Postino is a movie that received oodles of critical acclaim upon its release in 1994. While I don't think it was as good as advertised, I understand why it received such praise. In a movie world that is filled with dry and unamusing romance stories, Il Postino is a relatively lush and beautiful tale. The plot is fairly simple but loaded with subtleties that allow, even encourage, multiple viewings. Mario (Massimo Troisi) longs for something more than his simple fisherman life on an Italian island, so he takes a small job as a postman, delivering mail to famed romantic poet Pablo Neruda (Phillipe Noiret), who is living in exile on the same island. Over time, they develop a relationship that is based on Neruda aiding Mario in wooing his beloved Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). The final act is where the film makes the leap from well-made standard fare to something greater. With a couple plausible plot developments, characters and relationships are deepened beyond a basic love story, to a place that accents everything that happens leading up to that point. I can't say much else without giving things away, but stick with the movie to the end, even if you're dragging midway through. As you might expect from an Italian film, Il Postino has a very European feel. The passion of Italy is present throughout, explained through lifestyles, literal and metaphorical imagery, and the emotions of the characters. The setting is far from the bustling dollar-driven society in which Americans dwell, and a movie like this wouldn't get made in America, because the cultures are drastically different. The film's star, Massimo Troisi, is excellent. He embodies everyman qualities exceptionally, similar to Tom Hanks, yet with more...something. Soul perhaps? He, like the entire film, is just more European, and I hope you understand what I mean by that. Noiret portrays Neruda perfectly, expressing his romantic ways through both words and actions. Everyone else is very good, although no one stands out; the overall anonymity of the cast aids the viewer in establishing culture as well. The cinematography and the scenery it presents is often breathtaking, although not in the sweeping manner of something like The Lord of the Rings. Rather, cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo wisely chose to let the pictures speak for themselves. The elegant cliffs, white-capped waves, and rolling topography of the island gently yet firmly frame and support the story. A straight-forward tale should have suitable pictures, and Il Postino meets that requirement. The film is touted as a romantic comedy, and it is, although not in the traditional sense. The comedy isn't slapstick and won't elicit bushels of laughter. But there is an underlying sense of humor laced through the whole movie, often in simple movements, tasks, or occurrences.All of this combines to present something like a fairy tale replete with Italian heart and soul. Il Postino won't blow you away, but its tender lessons about life, love, and friendship will stick with you for some time, urging another viewing. Bottom Line A very European romance that is better than most anything Hollywood can conjure up.  8\/10.  (If you like the film, get the Collector's Edition DVD; it's quite good.)
