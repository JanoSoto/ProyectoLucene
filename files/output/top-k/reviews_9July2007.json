Yawn. But what a blast! I've always been a fan of Kevin Bacon, his comedic talents are simply astounding. He can make you laugh by just looking at the screen. This film delivers the laughs from the outset and just doesn't stop. It's easily Kev's best comedic role, ever. What a riot! I never knew a movie about such a macabre subject could be so funny! Kev's head-turn moment on the couch had me in stitches, as well as his drawl-ly accent. And the little kid in it, what comic timing! Don't be afraid of it Daddy...Samantha told me! And the Im supposed to dig...Jake...is...helping! And the immortal line, when he's at the party, and wants to be hypnotised by the googly-eyed chick, Yeah! Do me! I have since dressed like Kev and used this line at nightclubs on googly-eyed chicks...with varying results but it's always a GREAT TIME had by all concerned! This film is rollicking good fun for the whole family. Get a KFC-big-bucket, some popcorn, gather your timid brethren and ageing Aunt Judy and roll out those bean-bags for a night of family fun and feasting in front of the ol' boob-toob. My Aunt Ethel loved it, it comes with Ethel's Recommendation of 4 out of 5 patty-cakes.In all seriousness, i love this movie. I'm a big fan of David Koepp's work, and the commentary track on Stir of Echoes is entertaining and informative. This is a nicely done thriller, and I believe it has more replay value than Sixth Sense (a movie it is often compared to)..in fact, it took me maybe 8 or 10 viewings to realise the subliminal message just before Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is hypnotised.

You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer, cry, laugh, feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique, like 8 1\/2, which you reckon reinvented cinema language, weaving in and out of memory, dreams, psyche, reality, putting the human spirit up on the screen, making you cheer, laugh, and feel connected to all humanity.

Watching it again, probably more than ten years later, I can safely agree with myself from back then on how good of a movie it is. The acting is great and the story, while maybe a tad too sentimental and emotionally manipulating, is enthralling enough to stick with the characters and feel for them and their plight in getting through college with an education, along with their souls intact.A film like this makes you think about how good Joe Pesci used to be and regret that he has been out of the business for a while now. The guy never had the looks, the height, or even a voice that won't start grating on your ears before he even opens his mouth, but the guy is fantastic. He plays Simon Wilder with heart and realism, a homeless man who has regrets, but also piece of mind, knowing what went wrong and living life for meaning not materialistic necessity. In exchange for warm meals from Fraser's Harvard co-ed, he agrees to return the government thesis paper he is holding hostage. The paper is one that Fraser's professor fully endorses, but in the end is just a pile of nonsense that he himself doesn't believe in. Pesci must then try and make his young student learn how to see inside himself and realize that catering to those in power will never cause change or evolution in thinking.Besides Pesci, the main principles all do wonderful as well. It is a shame that Fraser has since rode his career down the toilet by doing children's fare and stupid comedies. Back in his heyday with this and School Ties, the guy showed he had some promise. Even the funny roles like Airheads worked, but unfortunately after that, he started to cash in the paychecks. Fraser shows that despite his jock physique, he has the ability to show inner intellect as well as a capacity to emit emotion. Some of the things that go on between he and Pesci strike tough cords and bring repressed feelings to the surface, but it is all a catharsis for both characters as they find out what it really is they need out of their own existences. As for the others, Moira Kelly makes you wonder what ever happened to her as far as film goes, Patrick Dempsey gives a performance with meaning while still keeping with his image of the day, and Josh Hamilton is entertaining enough to have made me see what else he's done since, surprising me to find he was one of my favorite roles in last year's comedy gem Diggers.Throughout the film, you know that tragedy will soon hit and the tears will flow, however, that knowledge never detracts from what is happening on screen. The writer doesn't copout when he could have, and the emotionally resonant moments are so because he allowed them to be hurtful and real. Infused consistently with the drama, though, are many moments of nice humor. No matter how serious Pesci might play, he is still a goofball through and through. A brilliant example of this is when he sits in on a government lecture at the school. His quips are funny, but when the professor finally calls him out, he holds his own and proves that looks are most definitely deceiving. That scene is worth seeing the film all by itself and it encompasses everything that the story is trying to convey.

Then i saw it. I wasn't sure what I was getting my self into, but it was Disney, so I decided to risk it.I'm glad I did. From the very beginning with the stain glass prologue I knew this was magical. I can relate with Belle's dilemma in the beginning, living in a small town where your potential can't be reached, being the black sheep of town for thinking differently than the rest. It was a powerful scene when Belle sacrificed her freedom so that her father could return home and become healthy. It paid off. she fell in love, made new friends, and lived in her own fairy tale.Now some people may say that adding all these other characters was unnecessary. I say, What's wrong with you? Let's face it. If the Beast and Belle didn't have other characters to help them get to know each other, Belle would still be in the tower and the Beast would still be a massive jerk. Mrs Potts, Chip, Lumiere, and Cogsworth needed to be in the movie or it wouldn't have moved along as it did.I have to say that Gaston is a villain who changes more than any other in Disney history. In most Disney films, the villain is a dark, sullen creature from the very beginning. Gaston, however starts the movie as a stuck up jerk, much like a Quaterback in high school. He then progresses into the type of evil that ruins the innocent and manipulates the simpleminded to get what he wants. I actually cheered when he fell to his death.From the time after Beast rescues Belle from the wolves, you can tell that a great friendship was blooming. During the Ballroom scene you could see a great love. Some may say that the film proves that a great makeover makes great romance, but if you actually watch the scene, Belle is reluctant to believe the Prince is her love, until she sees the soulful eyes. Belle fell in love with the soul, not the look. It didn't matter if he didn't change, she still loved him. This is one of the great Disney movies with a great message True love and friendship isn't looks and riches. It's loving someone from the inside out. If Hunchback ended with Esmeralda going with Quasi, it would be a much better film, almost up to par with Beauty and the Beast. If you've never seen it, see it.

Bounty hunter & occasional gun for hire leather clad babe Barb Wire (Pamela Anderson) runs a nightclub called the Hammerhead & generally gets on the best she can, Barb decides to capture bail jumper William Krebs (Loren Rubin) & hand him over for the reward. At first all goes well & Barb ends up with $20,000, however it turns out that Krebs was a wanted man. Wanted by both the freedom fighting resistance because of a pair of contact lenses he had & wanted by the evil congressional directorate because of, well, a pair of contact lenses. These lenses are important as they let the wearer pass through any retina scanner & defected congressional scientist Dr. Corrina Devonshire (Victoria Rowell) needs them to board a plane to Canada so she can warn the world about a virus which the congressional are planning on using to wipe out all resistance to them... Barb is caught right in the middle & has to choose a side to work for.Directed by David Hogan this sci-fi action adventure film was based a Dark Horse comic series of the same name & is a universally trashed film for reasons I personally can't quite figure out although people generally rubbish Pamela Anderson rather than the film itself which leads me to believe most have made their minds up before they see it or are just a tiny bit jealous. Before I go any further I have to say right now that Barb Wire has the best opening credit sequence of any film I've ever seen, period. The hot looking Pamela Anderson in a tight fitting leather dress dancing & being sprayed with water while exposing her breasts is just plain classy film-making. Anyway, the script by Chuck Pfarrer & Ilene Chaiken which could be described as a futuristic remake of Casablanca (1942) isn't anything I didn't expect from it, it's noisy, it has some violent action scenes, a few explosions, simplistic dialogue, a disturbing view of the future run by a Nazi uniform clad government & very one dimensional character's so what's the problem? Did Barb Wire ever promise it was going to be anything other than a futuristic sci-fi? Was it ever intended to be anything other than a fun B-Movie? Personally I think it delivers on some of it's potential but is missing something, the action scenes seem a little light & short, the first 30 odd minutes are great fast paced comic book action but it then loses it's way, some of the character's are just too lightweight & the mix of camp & seriousness isn't quite right. For all it's faults & it has some I liked it, there are bits & pieces here which I enjoyed a lot. It's a situation where I feel the sum of it's parts is less than what it should be.I think a lot of the blame for Barb Wire has to go to director David Hogan, this was his first film after making a couple of music videos & it shows. The character's aren't fleshed out enough, the film is uneven, the action scenes could have been brilliant in a capable director's hands but Hogan is more interested in placing the camera at cool angles & forgets about putting on a spectacle for the audience. Apart from the gunfight between Barb & two cops & a fight on top of a crane the action scenes are not exciting, far too forgettable & way too short. A stronger more experienced director might have ironed these problems out & Barb Wire could have been a great piece of sci-fi action, I still like it but feel it's flawed. A special mention goes to Pamela Anderson who looks fantastic in this wearing a selection of fetishistic clothing, the long leather coat, the tight corset & thigh high boots she wears while catching Kreps is just god damned cool & sexy! Barb Wire is a frustrating film for me because there are things I like about it so much but other things which I hate, Pamela Anderson & her leather outfits is one thing that I love though.Technically the film is aright, the daytime scenes all seem to have an orange sepia tone to them while the night scenes are very blue. The film has reasonable production values & a 40's period feel to the production design although the main locations seem to be a couple of old warehouses. There's actually not a bad cast here, Xander Berkeley, Udo Kier, Clint Howard, Victoria Rowell (I just couldn't stop thinking about Diagnosis Murder!), & Steve Railsback isn't a bad selection of actors at all. Pamela Anderson isn't great but she's alright & looks the business although Tamuera Morrison is truly awful in every scene he's in.Barb Wire could have been great, I think an inexperienced director who hadn't directed a sci-fi or action film before hurt the film in the end. I'm by no means saying Barb Wire is any sort of classic but there are moments here that I really liked, Pamela Anderson just looks great in leather & it has the best opening credit sequence ever, I can't recommend it but it's a film I'll always stick up for when everyone else is trashing it.

Tim Burton's Gothic masterpiece is still just that, a masterpiece. Even in spite of the now dated effects and Prince's very blatantly 80's soundtrack. Some still herald it as the best super hero movie and in my opinion that is not far from the truth.he story is not completely faithful to the source material. Batman kills people without any seeming moral qualms about it but the power of the film's style easily transcends the flaws that are indeed few and far apart. In short Batman (1989) rocks! Acting wise the movie is excellent with an all star cast that provides us with some great performances. Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in a controversial move by Burton and despite the initial uproar from the loyal fans he has since gained a very loyal following who names him as the best Batman even in these post Batman Begins days. This is not hard to agree with. Despite Jack Nicholson getting by far the most attention Michael Keaton does a great job in bringing Bruce Wayne to life. He balances the guilt and brooding melancholism well with the character's wish for justice and brings some of his comedic talent into the character as well giving him a lot of edge. Kim Bassinger, however, is mercilessly boring to watch. Sure she has some appeal in the looks department but lets face it. She was never much of an actress. The supporting cast does very well as well. Billy Dee Williams proves he can do more than back Han Solo up and Jack Palance's performance is truly unique. Michael Gough is also good and unflinchingly loyal as Alfred Pennyworth despite a relatively small amount of screen time. The shining star, however, is of course Jack Nicholson who proves himself one of the most versatile actors to this day with his tour de force performance as the Dark Knights ultimate nemesis, The Joker. He literally steals every scene he is in and in spite of his joking nature he proves to be truly menacing. It almost seems as though the rest of the cast is struggling to keep up with him because he is quite simply brilliant as The Joker. Heath Ledger has some big shoes to fill, even though I know Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight is drastically different from Burton's.In terms of how the film looks it is easy and perhaps a bit obvious to label it as Gothic which is of course Tim Burton's favored style. Its not only in the settings of the movie but also in the wardrobe and general make-up. The film has some incredible shots of Gotham with its towering spires and dark alleys and is always interesting to watch. The design of the Batsuit is dark to say the least and actually a little bleak. Luckily this was remedied in the sequel but it still looks great. The Batcar looks incredibly cool and is one of my favorite car designs for any movie I have ever seen. All the gadgets are in place as well and they all look great.In terms of storytelling the film is excellent. The flow is great and the advancement of the characters is very satisfactory and the birth of The Joker is one of my favorite film moments ever. What I feel the movie lacks, however, is any real character development for Batman himself. Even though Burton struck gold by casting Jack Nicholson as The Joker it was also Batman's unfortunate undoing. Despite Keaton's sincere efforts the film feels much more like a movie about The Joker than Batman. This is, in my opinion, a shame because as Batman Begins proved, Batman himself can be an interesting character. This is one of my only beefs with this otherwise excellent movie. The story works, however, and despite being a movie about a man who dresses up like a bat has a lot of credibility.All in all Batman is a great super hero movie. Easily still one of the best in the (sub)genre. Tim Burton's vision defies time and is still as entertaining today as it was when it was first released. Kudos to Mr. Burton and all other involved.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2007","score":"","review":" Its been more than 15 years since Batman ravaged the box office and took in more than 400 million dollars world wide and it still holds up beautifully in the recent competition with other super hero movies.

Acting wise the movie is excellent with an all star cast that provides us with some great performances. Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in a controversial move by Burton and despite the initial uproar from the loyal fans he has since gained a very loyal following who names him as the best Batman even in these post Batman Begins days. This is not hard to agree with. Despite Jack Nicholson getting by far the most attention Michael Keaton does a great job in bringing Bruce Wayne to life. He balances the guilt and brooding melancholism well with the character's wish for justice and brings some of his comedic talent into the character as well giving him a lot of edge. Kim Bassinger, however, is mercilessly boring to watch. Sure she has some appeal in the looks department but lets face it. She was never much of an actress. The supporting cast does very well as well. Billy Dee Williams proves he can do more than back Han Solo up and Jack Palance's performance is truly unique. Michael Gough is also good and unflinchingly loyal as Alfred Pennyworth despite a relatively small amount of screen time. The shining star, however, is of course Jack Nicholson who proves himself one of the most versatile actors to this day with his tour de force performance as the Dark Knights ultimate nemesis, The Joker. He literally steals every scene he is in and in spite of his joking nature he proves to be truly menacing. It almost seems as though the rest of the cast is struggling to keep up with him because he is quite simply brilliant as The Joker. Heath Ledger has some big shoes to fill, even though I know Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight is drastically different from Burton's.In terms of how the film looks it is easy and perhaps a bit obvious to label it as Gothic which is of course Tim Burton's favored style. Its not only in the settings of the movie but also in the wardrobe and general make-up. The film has some incredible shots of Gotham with its towering spires and dark alleys and is always interesting to watch. The design of the Batsuit is dark to say the least and actually a little bleak. Luckily this was remedied in the sequel but it still looks great. The Batcar looks incredibly cool and is one of my favorite car designs for any movie I have ever seen. All the gadgets are in place as well and they all look great.In terms of storytelling the film is excellent. The flow is great and the advancement of the characters is very satisfactory and the birth of The Joker is one of my favorite film moments ever. What I feel the movie lacks, however, is any real character development for Batman himself. Even though Burton struck gold by casting Jack Nicholson as The Joker it was also Batman's unfortunate undoing. Despite Keaton's sincere efforts the film feels much more like a movie about The Joker than Batman. This is, in my opinion, a shame because as Batman Begins proved, Batman himself can be an interesting character. This is one of my only beefs with this otherwise excellent movie. The story works, however, and despite being a movie about a man who dresses up like a bat has a lot of credibility.All in all Batman is a great super hero movie. Easily still one of the best in the (sub)genre. Tim Burton's vision defies time and is still as entertaining today as it was when it was first released. Kudos to Mr. Burton and all other involved.8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"9 July 2007","score":"","review":" Its been more than 15 years since Batman ravaged the box office and took in more than 400 million dollars world wide and it still holds up beautifully in the recent competition with other super hero movies.

Her dad asks, who's the father. She replies in the most defiant, in your face tone, the fact is I've been balled by so many guys, I do'not know if the baby is white, black, Chicano, Chinese or Indian. SMACK(the sound of a backhand across the face). Now that is a funny scene. This pretty much sums up the attitude of the movie. We're hippies. You're square. You're lives are normal. We've made a mess of ours. You need to loosen up and be more like us. I saw this movie At the age of 12 and left the theater thinking about its powerful message. INDIANS CAN REALLY KICK BUTT WHEN THEY'RE TRAINED IN THE MARTIAL ARTS. Thats right. Lets face it, thats all anyone really wanted to see in this movie. In fact my friends and I use to debate who could kick who's butt, Billy Jack or Bruce Lee. Problem being one was a fictitious character with fictitious skills, the other was the real deal.Twenty years later I was able to see the movie again on late night t.v. While watching I realized that what seemed to be a great movie in 1974 was actually one of the silliest movies I've ever seen. Its not that the fight scenes were poorly done or that the acting is horrific but the plot of the movie is absurd.A freedom school(what are they taught there? How to be hippies?)where screwed up kids are indoctrinated with yet even more left-wing hogwash, leaving them with even less of a moral compass.A spoiled brat town bully who thinks its his job to screw and\/or rape his way thru the female population.A half breed Vietnam vet trained in martial arts, who's job it is to defend the freedom school from said town bully\/bullies. Lets start with the school. They teach a pacifist philosophy and yet they come into town on weekend outing raring to let everybody know they are the counter culture with a stack of chips on there shoulders to boot. Everything about them, passively or not, comes across as confrontational. Word of advise. If you live in a place where the majority does'not really appreciate you're values, STAY UNDER THE RADAR! In 1971 most communities would have been leery of a bunch of hippie types moving in near by and rightfully so. Think of the Manson family and Spawn ranch.The character of Billy Jack while interesting in concept comes off as way too mellow dramatic. The ice cream store Pr whoop-ass dialog is a good example. In fact the clenched teeth line delivery thru out the movie gets annoying real quick. One Interesting aspect about the first two Billy Jack movies(Born losers\/Billy Jack)that I have not seen mentioned is the plot flip between the two. In Born Loosers he is actually defending normal straight society against the on slot of the counter culture where as in Billy Jack its just the opposite. But I guess Laughlin was just following the trends of exploitation movies of the time. Everything Pr Easyrider = freaks bad. Everything post = freaks good.From what I understand, Laughlin believed so much in Billy Jack that he thru all his career eggs into the Billy Jack franchise basket. Thats a shame because the movies arn't all that great.
