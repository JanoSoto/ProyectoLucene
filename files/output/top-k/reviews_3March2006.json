After the success of 1984s The Terminator, and 1986s Aliens, Cameron brings us another hit film with the sequel to The Terminator.Back in 1984 Skynet sent a cyborg back from the future to kill Sarah Connor before she conceived a son that would grow up to lead the resistance and defeat the machines. It failed. Now Skynet has sent back a more advanced and even deadlier Terminator, called the T-1000, to kill Sarah's son John (Edward Furlong), who is now a young teenager with an attitude and living with foster parents. However the rebels were once again able to send someone back to protect John Connor. What follows is one of the most action packed films to ever hit the screen.The special effects in T2 are much improved over the old 1984 film, and the pacing, classic Cameron, is just as well as in the earlier film. However this time around the acting by Linda Hamilton seems a little too forced, and the storyline doesn't resonate as well as in the earlier film. What would, since the earlier film had such a unique story. The only thing T2 could do, as a sequel, is follow the story and keep us interested. It does all those things, but it can never quite match the ideas that were brought forth in the original film because after all it is just a second part to that movie.Arnold Swarzennegger's role in this film can't quite reach the pinnacle of success of the first film either because here he is made into a good guy as protector of John. Since the new Terminator is so much more advanced, Arnold is kind of made to look a little weak here, and that takes some of the edge away from his character. After all, in the original he was made into this almost indestructible machine that kept coming at you and never stopped. It was fearsome and incredibly scary. He no longer has that now as the good guy. But Robert Patrick, as the advanced T-1000, was perfect for the role. He is just as cold and unforgiving as Arnold was in the first film, but he can morph into anything, including family and friends, and that makes him even more deadly because you never know who or what he could be.I thoroughly enjoyed Terminator 2. It was a fantastic film, and I saw it more than once, so that tells you how much I liked it. The visuals were stunning for 1991, but I can't quite give it classic status like The Terminator and Aliens for reasons mentioned above. Still this is a thrilling experience, and many people did indeed like it more than the first film. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a sci-fi action adventure. And this one delivers the goods. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 March 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" James Cameron just keeps putting out hit after hit.

Many of its puppet stunts still look convincing (and many don't, something noted by certain critics even at the time). Many are such art, it almost doesn't matter. The problem they faced was that while they knew of motion blur, because they saw films frame by frame every day in editing, they didn't incorporate that into their puppet's movements. They were concerned with many things, particular layering methods, and keeping the puppets propped up for the transfer guage to the next frame. Also some rear projection, as Kong lying on the beach or breaking his chains, lost some shadow and seem faded as a result. Etc.The stop motion models were well-constructed, particularly the armatures. Except for certain refinements, these probably were not substantially improved by Harryhausen, later, carrying on the same 'O.B' tradition. The full-size models, the close-up face of Kong in various scenes, were probably only slightly less convincing than those used in films half a century later. Kong demonstrated various matte and layering methods which became standards, and not just for adventure or creature films. Instead of layering in a lab, many times they literally had to rewind the same film and shoot double or triple exposures of the original stuff they had just shot. Glass was painted for foreground - foreground miniatures were used - middle glass and miniatures - fuzzy painted backgrounds - more painted glass - more dioramas props and miniatures. And all of that was lined up in front of the camera. This is all the early 1930s. The great grotto where Kong fights the 'snake' had nothing but layering going on. And there is so much of that thought, and sleight. For that, for the integrated musical score, and more, it is a first class film, and remains so to this day.It's a retelling of the tale of Beauty and the Beast, the beast being tamed by beauty in the fable, juxtaposed with the natural history museum fad of the day in all the newly discovered dinosaur bones on display. O'Brien actually had a stop-motion dinosaur film in the works, called Creation. Some of that was apparently used in Kong. Cooper and Shoedsack had been nature documentarians, roughing the 'wilds', taking risks with wild animals in sort of a precursor to the Aussia adventure seekers on cable TV, today. They were cowboys with cameras, and ten-gallon hats, or whatever (B-westerns, John Wayne to the rescue, were also big in that era). RKO was in trouble. Cooper came in (it's said that Armstrong's Denham is a dead ringer for Cooper). Cooper had wanted to do a film about an ape, or one giant ape. He saw what O'Brien was doing, and killed the project. That was going to go into something, better. So O'Brien, O.B. ('obie') as they called him, became the master animator for King Kong, heading up a staff of very talented people.In this BatB meets the Lost World meets Zane Gray, some scenes have an originality now passed to cliché. The attempt to win Ann's favor so that she would board the ship is one. There's the 'log toss'. The curtain going up on the 8th wonder is another, of course. Top of the Empire State Building. The final line, that the beast went 'soft' and was killed by beauty. There are so many. Kong is almost lovable in the final scenes of tenderness toward Ann. The puppet brought tears to the audience. That emotionalism is surprising in the 1930s, where a hardier class of people were to forget the death toll, and that the 'sensitive, sweet monkey' plucked a woman from her bed, moments before, and dropped her to the pavement far below, or injured or killed people walking by, in cars, in the train he tore up all the while holding Ann in his right hand, and never mind the number of the Venture's crew and villagers, rocked, socked, chomped in half or stepped on. Lovable Kong. And it's Denham who rightly bears the shame (and consequences, see Son of Kong).As for the acting, Wray, a famous silent film actress, seemed a bit too camera-aware in the important 'softening' scene with Cabot, who seems to play the tough guy a little too tough to be convincing, in some scenes. I think she wanted to play it, in a number of scenes, as a sort of 'sassy broad', a Mae West, or whatever 'sassy' sorts were popular in the era. But her role is basically just to, scream. She seemed uncomfortable, at least in the early sailing scenes. But like these creature\/effects films of today, it's not about the characters - it's all about the dinosaurs (and in this case, Kong). These particular characters, particularly Ann and Jack, and Skipper Engelhorn and Denham, just have entered into the culture, on the strength of this movie, which was in many ways decades ahead of its time.It was a film where black actors played fierce and threatening roles. They weren't shuffling and rolling their eyes. They were effectively sneaking on board to abscond with Ann, in order to please their 'god'. It was intended, I think, to ape (if that's the word) a documentary. People had not seen such things. It was just more of the spectacle, more of the 'amusement park', more of the thrill. But it wasn't condescending, save for the emotionalism. At the end, the villagers join with the crew to keep Kong out, but quickly fail. These are not bloodthirsty, maniacal murdering savages. They are just the islanders living in a magical and supremely dangerous fantasy island.A great film!

Although Madonna is usually always bashed by one or all critics in every movie she's done, but often, what critics think, and what I think of a movie are usually on different ends of the spectrum. I wish I could say the same for this Movie The concept was a unique one, which helped drive my curiosity enough to want to see this film A Woman and her Gay Best friend get drunk one night, do what a drunk couple does best, she gets pregnant, and a dramatic comedy unfolds with the ordeals faced by a gay man and his baby mama. Unfortunately, between the movie's script (both the story itself and the writing) mixed with a wide variety of Actors, ranging from not that good to not that bad make for a very uncomfortable journey into an inter-sexual family.

It was only 2 years ago that I bought it on DVD. I find this film very different to other vampire films. It's the only film I've seen so far that you actually get to find out what it's like to be a vampire, instead of being afraid of them. Caleb is a good-looking young guy who meets a strange girl and quickly becomes a attracted to her. Just when they're starting to get to know each other, in sheer panic as daylight approaches, she bites his neck. Caleb, confused and shocked at the same time, is at first unaware that he is 'turned' and it would change everything... No sooner than he is bitten is he speeding away in a van with a group of strangers, who have a hunger for human blood. Throughout the film we get to see the excitement, frustration and even fear of being a vampire. As Caleb's father and sister's search for him takes off, he begins to accept that he is no longer an ordinary human, but 'one of them.'

Tolkein. Despite the irony in trying to retain democracy's visage by inserting a man into the Presidential post without an election, writer Gary Ross has crafted a pleasant enough diversion, DAVE's excellent performances redeeming any conceptual constitutional glitches.Kevin Kline is such a marvel in both roles &#x96; as the real American President, Bill Mitchell and as his temp agency doppelganger, affable Dave Kovic &#x96; that never for a moment do we doubt that he is, in fact, two different people, even when both his personas (who look exactly alike, but give off wildly disparate auras of authority and sheepishness respectively) are sharing the screen.When Bill Mitchell suffers a stroke and goes into a coma (during a sexcapade with one of his secretaries), in order to keep the nation's peace of mind, oily Chief Of Staff, Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) and his rationalizing apprentice, Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn), secretly hustle lookalike Dave into the President's chair, crash-coaching him on public appearance and board meeting protocol. Alexander's agenda is to puppet Dave into handing over the Presidency to him, but conscientious Dave, oblivious to Alexander's machinations, sees an opportunity to do some good whilst ensconced in faux public office and (with the help of morose Charles Grodin &#x96; tautologous, I know) actually forges a more sturdy economic stance for America.Sigourney Weaver, as Mitchell's estranged wife, is thrown in to add unnecessary romantic subplot to an already-implausible story. (The day any First Lady divorces her President &#x96; keeping in mind that she not only divorces him, she divorces the life of unbridled enablement that comes with laying down with the Leader of the Free World - and shacks up with a temp agency lookalike who can offer her a ten-year-old Lexus as her primary mode of transport, you might as well jump on that schoolgirl you've had your eye on, for the Gates Of Hell are surely about to open and swallow humanity.) Though the politics of President Mitchell and Dave Kovic are never mentioned outright, Mitchell was painted as a Republican, whilst Dave was noticeably fashioned after beloved Democrat Clinton. And in hindsight, this proved to be the funniest thing about Mitchell's philandering, as it presaged Clinton's Monica-gate by a couple of years.The fact that the American populace can take the profligacy of the American Presidency for granted says something not about their vaunted freedom, but about their tolerance for mendacity. This society itself has set up nonsensical rules regarding marriage and fidelity, yet when demonstrated that those rules matter not, and that we can easily tolerate their infraction &#x96; even joke about it &#x96; what was the point of the rules (and their attendant penalties) in the first place? When an American President can perjure himself whilst simultaneously making us doubt exactly what having sex means, we have to ask ourselves, Are we actually all virgins, then? A scenario like Bill Mitchell setting up a lookalike to press flesh so that he can be elsewhere spanking flesh needs no rationalization or justification, we are so inured to governmental duplicity of this sort. Though no textbooks would own up to it, we KNOW that the President obviously has a harem on call, and though the lookalike ploy may be a stretch in the Real World, we can be sure that a goodly percentage of his business meetings are spent releasing his pent-up, world-broiling stress into some tart vessel bent over backwards for her country.Still, if this movie had been made before the Kennedy administration, someone would have been shot.In not promoting partisanship, the movie tries to illustrate what any politician can do if he were to unselfishly actually serve his country instead of himself. Refrain We Can Dream, Can't We?

The title of this movie is all the better for that very reason because I have never seen a title that could be interpreted in more ways than one and still not suck. Reversal is not a word anyone uses ten times a day and i am not even sure that you could translate it into Danish but it fits right in here.The people who have seen this movie must be millions and as someone who can remember when the real thing happened - trust me - this is not reality but what a thrilling experience anyway.

The five main roles are all men and they are pretty interesting, led by Danny Glover's character, who is very, very creepy.I'm hesitant to say much about this film for fear of giving anything away for those who have not seen it. Suffice to say its a rough movie in regards to language, violence and general attitude but the story grabs you quickly and is tough to put down once you are into it.One complaint I read said this film never made it big because it was too convoluted a storyline. In fact, the story isn't really pieced together until the last few minutes. Well, a lot of films over the years were like that (Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes mysteries, just to name two) and no one complained.The fact that FBI agent Dennis Quaid would figure things out to the exact minute does stretch credibility so don't look for a film that makes a lot of sense it's simply a very tense thriller that entertains, so it serves its purpose.Lee Ermey, the fanatical drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, also is fun to watch in here. Jared Leto and Ted Levine also contribute nicely. It's a man's film, for the most part and an effective diversion for two hours.

The actress in this movie was only twelve!! How could have a studio have released this movie, or any actor have worked in it is beyond me. I really doubt any of them will work again, who would hire them? The director should be arrested for exploiting children.I feel sorry for people who would watch this.Just because a movie is critically acclaimed does not mean its good. Directors get knighted as artists when in fact its just a way of bringing attention to their work and making more money off young people who need something to look up to. There are good movies out there but please don't believe that because someone has enough money to make the lame movie they want, that they are any good (movie critics are the lowest strata of society). i promise you these exploitive directors probably all started out in pornos inorder to support their drug habits. Why would we watch their movies and promote whats noxious in this world ?
