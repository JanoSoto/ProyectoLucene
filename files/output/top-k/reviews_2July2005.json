I don't want to spoil the ending* This is a much better moving movie then the blown up Cameron version. I feel the romance in the Cameron version was the whole story. To me that romance would of been just effective if it was in a cornfield in Kansas. It brought nothing to the film. If it wasn't the only story it would not have bogged the movie down like it did. In this version of the Titanic there is a romance with a real young and good looking Robert Wagner playing a college student who is on the ship with a bunch of his classmates trying to act like they are Cornell students because their college has the same initials. He is really sweet and his object of affection is a American snob who thought she was a European snob. What I liked about them is that he was really sweet and it didn't take long for her to warm up to him. Unlike the Cameron version in which the Kate Winslet character was so annoying and played too many games that got him in trouble that I felt the wrong person died in the end. But the real story in this version is about her parents. Played by 2 of my favorite actors Barbara Stanwyke and Clifton Webb. It seems the mother wants to bring her daughter back to reality and stop acting like a snob and the father disagrees. He thinks she is trash, but he really loves her. Before we learn this we find out that they are getting a divorce and are just acting OK because of the children. When the father threatens to take the little boy, he finds out something he never knew. A very big bad secret. He who was always a loving dad starts treating the little boy like a piranha and the little boy has no idea why. When the ship hits the ice, the father gets to action. Before that we get introduced to all of his snobby friends because now all he does is play cards day and night to stay away from the family. We get to meet Molly Brown ( Thelma Ritter), the Astors and the Guggenhiems. I like the way they incorporated them in to the story. What happens next is a stunner and a heart breaker. I am not going to tell because this movie deserves to be seen. Camerons heartbreaking end cannot compare. I mean this versions ending was something that took 2 seconds to happen. It was not something that we were hyped for like the Winslet\/ De Caprio ending whom from the very beginning of the movie you knew something bad was going to happen to one of them ( the wrong one as far as I am concerned). This one no hint. Of course we get the supporting players such as Richard Basehart playing the defrocked priest. But their were no villains like the Camerons version. This to me was more realistic and it told more of a human story. And the boat, well that was just a backdrop for the story. I mean we all know what happens to the boat. If you want fact look at A Night To Remember, which was taken from a very famous book, with accounts from people working on the ship. Mainly Lighttoller. The best of the Titanic movies. This one is very good but it tells a different type of story. I give it a 9 for that kicker of a ending and the good appealing actors and fast moving story.

The intellectual, patient personality that's Sommerset & the young rebellious let's dance Mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development.We as the audience are confronted with biblical\/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if Sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns.Se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history.Sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer John Doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that John Doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins.Pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (XXX) movie. We're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go.With that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. Even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), Se7en is a great police drama by director David Fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 OUT 0F 10 STARS !

Well I just happened to re-watch the film and I must say I think it is a great film! Liam Neeson is the perfect Jedi leader with Ewan as Obi Wan who plays the part well. And I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually liked the character Jar Jar Binks. Jack Lloyd made a fair act playing the young Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. The Queen is cool and Padme is sweet, plus Palpatine is very crafty with his duel persona as the Sith lord Darth Sideous. Now this film wasn't perfect for one thing, one of the coolest Star Wars villains has only ten minutes of screen time in the entire picture. Darth Maul was a great henchman, his role was perfect for the film. Plus he looked great with the horns and he had the two sided lightsabre. The last battle between him and the two Jedi's is great too! I liked the pod race with Anakin and the droid battle with Jar Jar. But there are times you can tell the film is real hokey, just look at Yoda. Plenty of times he's on screen he looks like a puppet. Samuel L. Jackson is good as Windu who you see later in the saga, putting on a good role. The plot is twisted a lot but works with the Queen being in danger of being destroyed by a droid army sent out by the Sith. The acting is done greatly and the special affects are the same, breath taking. This is a good Star Wars film and a good way to kick off the first episode of the prequel trilogy, highly recommended. Star Wars Episode 1 gets the big 9, only a notch away from being perfect like Parts 4 and 5. Enjoy!

They will hate the way the movie portrays marriage and family and children. They will hate the vulgar language and the drunken maundering and the utter charmlessness of almost every character in the film.

That can be hard to watch, and it isn't every body's cup of tea. I fall into the other 50%, the group who enjoy this kind of savage, mean-spirited humor.

It doesn't hesitate to show blood or violence, and to a higher extent, it gives the film one of its dark elements.Bruce Wayne's former fiancée, Andrea has come back to Gotham City for a vengeance on all the mobsters who were involved in the killing of her father. Batman cannot allow that, it's his City. The joker is dragged into the frame when it is found he is one of the mobsters who was involved in the murder of her father. The story contains no flaws. None, whatsoever.The film possesses everything you'd hope for. A kick-ass Batman, violence, dark elements, a sense of romance, action, a good cast and a license of its own to be creative in its own story. The worst bit is the credits, when it finishes you off with a jazz-like song. That's the only thing I can say that's bad about it.A true landmark in movie history.

I think the reason why it doesn't have the acclaim accorded to the first two is that it was made too late and doesn't have the powerhouse actors the first two did. Notably missing is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall wasn't offered enough money) and Sofia Coppola should not have been cast as she wasn't an actress (Winona Ryder backed out of the project at the last minute). The funny part of trivia about this film was Coppola's visit to Duvall's house in which Duvall thought he was wanting the recipe to his crab cakes not offering him a part in this next film and the fact that Coppola threatened to start the film with Michael's funeral because Pacino wanted so much money. Again real life situations are part of this movie and are obvious to the semi-trained eye. Garcia isn't bad he just isn't enough to make it truly great which in and of itself isn't his fault the movie was just too contemporary for it's own good. The ending goes for a real slam dunk and it achieves it as far as ending the trilogy. The best part is the mob meeting that was good and so was the action following it. You need to watch this for closure and that's about all.

Now that I am older and have seen all of the Batman's several times I realize that Batman Forever while still decent was a major letdown from the previous two. Val Kilmer comes in and manages to pull off Batman but Bruce Wayne not so much. The chemistry with Nicole Kidman, wait a minute there was no chemistry. Nicole Kidman was awful in this movie and really was not needed. The best acting came from Jim Carrey who portrayed the insane and obsessive Edward Nygma\/The Riddler but was a little over the top. Tommy Lee Jones was way over the top with his portrayal of Harvey Two Face. The show was much more lighter and humorous than the previous two but most likely because of a different directorial interpretation of Joel S.
