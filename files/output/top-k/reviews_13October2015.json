[{"date":"13 October 2015","score":"","review":" Following a brutal murder, a detective's investigation into the horror movie revolving around the victims of a similar incident coincides with previous rampages and tries to find a way of stopping the ravenous killer from continuing.With a lot to really like about it and only a few mild flaws, this is a certainly fun entry in the series. One of the film's greatest strengths is the fact that the stalking scenes are suspenseful. The opening is just as good as the others which gets really going early on with the phone-call goes into the great bedroom search that is really suspenseful. There's also nothing wrong with any of the stalking scenes in here as there's a fantastic scene inside the studio where the killer chases one of the actors through the different backstage areas, and with several great ideas brought in to keep this going along in the closets and stage-doors, this one scene leaves a great impression while the assault on the house is fantastic and features a couple great scenes. The best scenes, though, come from all the stalking and chasing down at the end, from the discoveries in the basement to the chase behind the glass mirrors in the secret passageways and much more, these scenes are really entertaining. This one also has some suspense from the calls, with the twist of different voices rather than the one since it adds to whether or not the voice is real or the killer's. This one has plenty of action to it as well, including a frenetic chase through rush-hour traffic, the fantastic house assault and the big chase through the studio are all fun and give the film a fantastic pace to it. The fact that this one also decides to really fill in a couple of holes in the story nicely, and there's some fun to be had from the really good explanations, which make sense and makes this really feel like a well- rounded trilogy. These here are what the film does right as this one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws. The biggest one is that there's a whole lot of padded time in the film, unlike the others which is way too long and seems stretched out. The beginning hallucinations don't do much, as there's no reason why these are there other than to give false scares and the ending explanations just take forever and gets too over- explained at several points, which becomes a torturous monologue to something that was perfectly understood minutes earlier. Along the lame kills that are really repetitive and don't offer up much blood and gore here, these small flaws are what keep the film down. Rated R Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.
