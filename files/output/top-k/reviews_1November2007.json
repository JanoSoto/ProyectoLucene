Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.Tom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a snuff film, where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake, it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman, Max, they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not, but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and actors find out about them.8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart, there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again, I'm sure most wouldn't either, but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job, but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story, he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch, it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2007","score":"37 out of 45 people found the following review useful","review":" When I watched 8 MM, I didn't know what to expect, but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his.

But my boyfriend just kept on telling me how funny this movie was and was tormenting me on how I wouldn't give this film a chance, so finally I just decided to go ahead and see what it was about. Now that I've seen it, while I think it is still very stupid and has some of the worst acting that I've ever seen in my life, I think this was one of those films that it was so bad that it was good. I think the only thing that really made me laugh about this film was Robin Shou, I haven't seen him in any other film other than Mortal Kombat, so it was amusing to see him in this film. He was so serious in this film and that his character as a ninja getting into these silly situations was just priceless. Chris Farley was alright, I have to admit that I could actually stand him in the film, I know that sounds bad, but from me, trust me, that's a compliment.Haru is the fat, white ninja, he was raised by the ninja master and has never succeeded at being a ninja like his brother, Gobei. But when Haru meets a girl who names herself, Sally Jones, she needs help from a ninja to find out if her boyfriend is a murderer. It turns out that he is also in a big counter fitting scam and Haru wants to help her out and goes to Beverly Hills to find a way to capture him. With the secret help of his brother and his protégé, Joey, Haru will help his dove and learn the life of a ninja in Beverly Hills.Over all Beverly Hills Ninja is a stupid movie, it has bad acting, and a silly story, but for some reason I did laugh a few times. It made the film kind of enjoyable, even for a Chris Farley film. I think my favorite part was the Japanese kitchen scene where we see Robin Shou dressed as a woman and how Chris Farley accidentally kills a guy who is about to kill him. So give this a look if you are interested in seeing a silly comedy, that's pretty much what Beverly Hills Ninja is.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2007","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I am by no means a Chris Farley fan, I'm not sure why some people think he is so funny, most of his humor seems so forced and just makes him look like an idiot.

Having seen it many years after it was made, I missed all the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project upon it's initial release. I had heard many different opinions from different people; it seemed like a 50\/50 divide between who liked it and who didn't. That probably levelled my expectations as I simply didn't know what to expect. But I really enjoyed it and some parts of the film were the 'heart-pounding-hard-in-your-chest' moments you expect from all horror films, except that they were amplified by a heightened sense of reality with the documentary-style filming. This is ultimately what the film relies on for it's horror of course; it draws you very close to the hearts and minds of the characters involved and you genuinely feel scared for them. So many horror films simply have characters 'made for dying', that you don't really care about and are just included to eventually become victims.I am a fan of the low-budget, low-gore style it employs, simply because it still scares you regardless. There are some flaws in the editing style needed to be employed to make it realistic (ie. times when it is unrealistic for them to have their camera switched on, but would be very scary to watch for the audience) and I did feel the film came to a quite abrupt end. But it is also very necessary to applaud the actors, who are part of the reason the film is so believable. Overall, you can't fault the way in which this film helped reinvigorate the horror genre. With the number of mindless slasher films reaching stupid levels in the mid-90s - Friday 13th Part 9 was released in 1993 and A Nightmare On Elm Street 7 in 1994... - I can still feel today, even watching it 8 years later, how important this film was.

I remember the summer of 1995 my friends and our parents took us to see The Might Morphin Power Rangers The Movie and we thought it was the greatest movie ever made. I know that's sad, but we loved the show and the movie lived up to a great episode with an even better budget. I hadn't seen the movie since '95, but my boyfriend and I went to Target and found this movie on the $5.50 shelf and I grabbed it for old times sake since he was also a Power Rangers fan when he was a kid. We watched it and I have to say that despite how bad it is and how mega cheesy the lines and acting are, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is what it is. It was aimed at kids and was terrific for them, the story was so bad that it was actually good.The rangers are living their lives in the fast lane, they're sky diving and roller blading, I mean is there anything they can't do? But anyways, all that is put on pause when Zordon warns the rangers of Rita and Zed's evil plan to raise Ivan Ooze. Ivan is planning to take over the world when he shrinks Rita and Zed and is putting all the kids parents under a powerful spell to make them do his bidding. Ivan then visits the command center and destroys it leaving Zordon in bad shape and now the rangers have to save the world on top of saving Zordon and become the powerful ninjas to regain their powers and defeat Ooze.Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is extremely silly and cheesy, but I don't know what people were expecting when they watched it that it got such a bad rating. It's one of those movies that is so bad that it's actually good. Although Zordon's face will haunt my dreams for a long time, it was classic the way the actors who played the rangers presented their lines, I loved how they would fight and do back flips, yet could say their lines perfectly without sounding out of breath. Also how they replaced certain rangers with people who looked like they were picked out of a kick ball team line.

I had heard that it was extremely violent, and exploitative of gay men. Violence is not really my thing. I had seen Friedkin's earlier film, The Boys In The Band which I did not like at all. The Boys in the Band seemed to me to be filled with stereotypical, largely unhappy characters. The film's view of gay life seemed skewed to me so, I decided to pass on Cruising. When Cruising recently became available in a remastered disc with features and commentary by director Friedkin, I decided to take a chance and watch it, and I am very glad I did. I think it is a masterful film that works on every level, as a murder mystery, as a psychological thriller, and as a social commentary of sorts since the film takes place in a millieu seldom seen on mainstream screens at that time.Is it violent? Oh yes, graphically so. Some scenes are very hard to watch, but so compelling that you cannot turn away. The violence is not gratuitous and is in fact important to both the atmosphere of the film and sequence of the plot. Friedkin creates tension in the film from the very first frames when you see what appears to be a severed arm floating in the river, and continues to ratchet up the tension throughout the film. This tension drives the murder mystery. The solution to the murders could be considered ambiguous,yet emains compelling through the very last shot. The ambiguity of the film lets you draw your own conclusions in a way that causes you to think more deeply than you would if it was all spelled out. I think this is a real strength in the film. Is the film exploitive of gay men? No, I don't think so. The film is realistic in it's locations which are gritty and stark. The bar scenes feel real. The bars are leather bars, and the men in the bars are there to engage in what you would expect to see in a gay S\/M bar. If you don't like what you see, that is your choice, but I don't think that Friedkin films what you see in a way that is exploitative of the patrons. It is what it is, and you see it. In other scenes in the film you see the police exploiting some of the men, and that feels authentic to me too, for the most part, because that is also the way it was, like it or not. It is in this backdrop that Pacino's character of a young cop must find a killer. Pacino's performance is both subtle and affecting. It is simply one of his best. Given that, I wonder why he did not appear with Friedkin in the features of the disc, or as a contributor to the commentary. I found this to be both strange (is he disavowing his performance by not appearing?) and a real disappointment.Pacino's character is changed forever by his experiences in the film. How much he has changed is ambiguous. A careful viewer will see Pacino change throughout the film, though most of the change is implied, and not directly stated. Since Friedkin was willing to show us so much authenticity in the bar scene, and in subsequent scenes, he should have shown us more authenticity in the development of Pacino's character, and by that I specifically mean, at the very least a kiss between Pacino and one or more of the men he meets and or confronts in the film.The weakest character in this film is Pacino's girlfriend, who is played by Karen Allen as if she is completely comatose, if not downright stupid. The role is both badly written and underplayed. The changes in Pacino's character need to be mirrored more clearly by the reactions of his girlfriend, otherwise, why is she in the film at all? Friedkin has dropped the ball here.See this film, regardless of whatever you have heard about it. See it and draw your own conclusions. It is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of Friedkin's work.

The Boys in the Band seemed to me to be filled with stereotypical, largely unhappy characters. The film's view of gay life seemed skewed to me so, I decided to pass on Cruising. When Cruising recently became available in a remastered disc with features and commentary by director Friedkin, I decided to take a chance and watch it, and I am very glad I did. I think it is a masterful film that works on every level, as a murder mystery, as a psychological thriller, and as a social commentary of sorts since the film takes place in a millieu seldom seen on mainstream screens at that time.Is it violent? Oh yes, graphically so. Some scenes are very hard to watch, but so compelling that you cannot turn away. The violence is not gratuitous and is in fact important to both the atmosphere of the film and sequence of the plot. Friedkin creates tension in the film from the very first frames when you see what appears to be a severed arm floating in the river, and continues to ratchet up the tension throughout the film. This tension drives the murder mystery. The solution to the murders could be considered ambiguous,yet emains compelling through the very last shot. The ambiguity of the film lets you draw your own conclusions in a way that causes you to think more deeply than you would if it was all spelled out. I think this is a real strength in the film. Is the film exploitive of gay men? No, I don't think so. The film is realistic in it's locations which are gritty and stark. The bar scenes feel real. The bars are leather bars, and the men in the bars are there to engage in what you would expect to see in a gay S\/M bar. If you don't like what you see, that is your choice, but I don't think that Friedkin films what you see in a way that is exploitative of the patrons. It is what it is, and you see it. In other scenes in the film you see the police exploiting some of the men, and that feels authentic to me too, for the most part, because that is also the way it was, like it or not. It is in this backdrop that Pacino's character of a young cop must find a killer. Pacino's performance is both subtle and affecting. It is simply one of his best. Given that, I wonder why he did not appear with Friedkin in the features of the disc, or as a contributor to the commentary. I found this to be both strange (is he disavowing his performance by not appearing?) and a real disappointment.Pacino's character is changed forever by his experiences in the film. How much he has changed is ambiguous. A careful viewer will see Pacino change throughout the film, though most of the change is implied, and not directly stated. Since Friedkin was willing to show us so much authenticity in the bar scene, and in subsequent scenes, he should have shown us more authenticity in the development of Pacino's character, and by that I specifically mean, at the very least a kiss between Pacino and one or more of the men he meets and or confronts in the film.The weakest character in this film is Pacino's girlfriend, who is played by Karen Allen as if she is completely comatose, if not downright stupid. The role is both badly written and underplayed. The changes in Pacino's character need to be mirrored more clearly by the reactions of his girlfriend, otherwise, why is she in the film at all? Friedkin has dropped the ball here.See this film, regardless of whatever you have heard about it. See it and draw your own conclusions. It is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of Friedkin's work.

But the thing I find now is that the movie no longer works for me, it seems to of lost it's spark!! Maybe because it's been 15 years since all of this happened?!?! Anyway, at the time I found Oliver Stones production a wild and cool ride into the life of Jim Morrison and the Doors, but at the same time found it to be over the top. One example was the Doors live performance on the Ed Sullivan show. The the real footage of Jim in '67 singing Light My Fire had him standing still, but in the movie Val Kilmer struts over to the camera and says the word higher during the song in an in your face kind of way. Another would be the wild side of Jim constantly being shown and as any Doors fan would know Morrison wasn't always like that. I guess Oliver Stone had to make an appealing movie and usually drama and the worse side of someone will draw people to a movie.No doubt the Doors gained popularity at the time once again because of this film. Back in the early 90's how many people did you see wearing Jim Morrison T-Shirts? For me the best parts of the movie were the three live concerts in New Haven, San Francisco and the notorious Miami. Val Kilmer was awesome and I don't think anybody else including Michael Hutchence would of done a better job at the time. Kilmer was almost Jim Morrison he was that convincing!!! He even sang a little during the live performances.Like I said earlier an awesome movie at the time and a great experience, but will only remain a memory to me.

In all honesty, it's easier to see how it was originally panned than it is to understand the praise that is now routinely heaped upon it. That's not to say the film is particularly bad &#150; it's just not particularly great and, apart from the hard work of a solid cast, fails to outshine any number of westerns from the fifties and sixties.A too-old James Stewart plays a lawyer fresh out of law school who is robbed by the villainous Valance (Lee Marvin in the kind of role he was born to play) and ends up washing dishes in the homely café of Swedish immigrants Nora and Peter Ericson, and their illiterate but comely daughter Hallie (a too-old Vera Miles). Of course it's not long before Stewart and Miles are exchanging affectionate glances across a pile of soapy dishes, much to the discomfort of big Tom Doniphon (a too-old John Wayne)who also has plans for Hallie.At times this looks more like a stage play than a film, and the pace is a little too leisurely for my liking. There's nothing wrong with a deliberate pace if the time is used to add depth to the characters, but when it's used to give us a potted version of the American legal system and US constitution this viewer's eyes quickly start to glaze over. The roles are clearly defined here Stewart is the optimistic face of the new west, bringing justice and literacy to the backwards west, while Wayne and Marvin are symbols (good and bad) of the old west that must inevitably move aside for the new.As usual with Ford, there's a terrific cast of supporting players. Amongst them Edmund O'Brien and Andy Devine stand out, O'Brien for managing to inject some recognisable human traits into a character who might otherwise have been a typical stereotype, and scratchy-voiced Devine for the distracting annoyance of his cowardly buffoon of a sheriff. Woody Strode also delivers a typical performance of quiet dignity as Wayne's faithful sidekick. For his part, Wayne, although little more than a supporting character for much of the time, is always a welcome presence when he appears on the screen. Only when he is centre stage does the film really come alive.

Clint Eastwood is one of Hollywood's unsung celebrities, because he never shows a hint of pretension or vanity.And Petersen has supplied Eastwood with a worthy adversary. The very underrated John Malkovich is just brilliant as Mitch Leary, the ex-CIA assassin who plays intricate mind games with Horrigan. Malkovich being the exceptional method actor that he is gets to try on various disguises to stay one step ahead of Horrigan.The psychological games Leary comes up with to torment Horrigan are given considerable gravitas by Malkovich. He comes across as a concerned friend and then a cold blooded killer at the drop of a hat.Petersen never allows things to slow down for too long. He gives the characters time to breathe in between the inevitable plot mechanics, but there is considerable excitement to be had from watching the agents pin down Leary's trail. There's never a dull moment.And the cast do an admirable job avoiding the predictability that comes with the genre. As well as Rene Russo's tough and forthright performance, Dylan McDermott does nicely as Frank's partner Al. It's a slightly generic role. The young pup who gets in over his head, but McDermott is a charming enough actor to make you warm to him. All the more so when he meets a tragic end.John Mahoney (taking time out from my favourite sitcom Frasier) adds warmth and geniality to Frank's boss Sam. Then there's Gary Cole who has a tricky part to play. A cocky, snot-nosed agent who tolerates Frank, and doesn't always listen when it might have made a difference. Still, Cole understands the difficulty in playing such a role, and ensures the character never gets too annoying.The only real black mark on ITLOF is Fred Dalton Thompson's White House Chief of Staff. It's like Wolfgang Petersen couldn't resist including at least one stock, generic character. In this case, a pompous, self important politician only interested in the President's image. Thompson is too good an actor to be lumbered with such a one-dimensional character.But elsewhere, ITLOF is a film that's very difficult to find fault with. There are wonderful gems to be found as Wolfgang Petersen's inexorable direction moves towards its inevitable conclusion. The night of the Presidential election.It builds to a final showdown between Frank and Leary within the confines of an elevator. But its good stuff all the same.

Zombie's film is too cool for anyone's imagination -- brutal, savage, bordering on the obscene.Carpenter manipulates your mind and senses with cats yowling, branches scraping the side of a house, lighting, shadows and curtains wafting before an open window. Zombie manipulates me by turning up the soundtrack to a preposterous volume.When Michael Myers, age 11, kills a schoolmate by beating him to death with a tree branch, Zombie interprets the sound with a noise like a snare drum hit pushed through an effects unit. The victim suffers and begs for minutes on end, surviving blows that would have killed a Cape buffalo.Carpenter's film has one brief-if-obligatory flash of nubile breasts.

An old friend of John's contacts him and asks him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, which he explains is a result of supernatural forces. John is skeptical and reluctant, but quickly takes the case and begins to observe a bizarre chain of events.James Stewart plays the role John Ferguson and is effective at portraying the transition from impartial investigator to an increasingly involved and even unnerving one. Kim Novak is also excellent as the enigmatic and sporadic Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is also memorable as Midge, particularly in the painting scene.Most of the story doesn't rely on direct plot twists, but rather a methodical investigation of the mystery presented near the film's beginning and the interesting and peculiar behavior of the subject under investigation.

This methodical approach is effective, although personally I preferred other Hitchcock films that featured more twists over this one.

His conviction, upheld in a second trial, before he is finally released by a federal court, is practically an operational definition of the term railroaded. Rubin Hurricane Carter would still be in Trenton State Prison, a hell hole if there ever was one, if it hadn't been for the altruistic efforts of three adults and one adolescent member of a Canadian commune, who became amateur sleuths by accident.The film isn't particularly complicated. In fact, it's dumbed down to a point beyond which a lack of comprehension would be attributed to pathology. Almost all the frissons that might have made this more than a simple tale of moral strength and fortitude have been left out or shaped to fit a familiar mold. Dan Hedaya, for instance, is Paterson, New Jersey's Detective Della Pesci, the personification of racist-motivated darkness.

It would have been so EASY to give the heavy a family and a dog or at least a social context -- rising black crime in the cities of the 1960s and the panic associated with it. Yet the writers and the director throw away any chance to turn the film into something other than a condemnation of racism and the white people infected by it. As a kid, Hurricane stabs a middle-aged white guy only to save his chum from an oily child molester. Does anyone believe this? Ho hum.Not to diminish the heinous effects of racism (or, more generally, prejudice) in our justice system. It's an imperfect machine, and Carter suffered abominably for every fourteen-year-old black kid who ever decorated a brick wall with graffiti from a can of spray paint. During one of his trials, the prosecution refers to his having been convicted by a jury of his peers and Jewison gives us a long shot of the all-white jury, in case we might otherwise miss the point. We can't help being relieved when Carter is ultimately released, and can't help thinking somewhere in the back of our minds about those twenty years of imprisonment.Nobody really has much to do as far as acting is concerned. Denzel Washington is pretty good at projecting pent-up anger and defiance. And the writers have his character develop too. At first he concentrates on turning his body into an instrument of power. But after reading some inspirational books he develops his mind as well, and in practical ways. He resists being swept up in the prison system by rejecting what sociologists have called the small reward system of total institutions. If favors are returned by cigarettes, Carter doesn't smoke. If submission leads to protection, Carter can do without the protection. His career in the Army, however, was not quite the smooth ride the movie gives us, but let's not dabble in too many discrepancies between art and life.The other characters are rather blank. Life in the Canadian commune was evidently not lastingly satisfying. (Carter and Deborah Kara Unger's blond altruist were married, then divorced.) But we don't really get to know much about them. They -- and Carter's legal defense team -- are played mostly as bland do-gooders who would have failed if not pushed to the wall by the power of Carter's will.There's a good movie around this story, lurking someplace, unorganized, entropic, waiting for someone to write it and put it on the screen. It's a parable of good and evil. Not of good people and evil people, but of people who are each, within themselves, good and evil, just like all the rest of us. But this isn't that movie.

Yet, a Tibetan monk sees honor in him and orders him back to the States, to fight evil and redeem himself. Cranston, thus, becomes The Shadow, a superhero with the power to control men's minds and defeat them. On the streets of New York City in the Roaring Twenties, he is feared and respected but no one knows his identity. When he meets Margo Lane (Penelope Ann Miller), he is thunderstruck by her clairvoyance and her ability to resist his mind control, as well as her stunning beauty. Margo is the daughter of a brilliant scientist (Ian McKellen) who is working on nuclear fusion, that is, the atomic bomb. Into this setting comes a man from far away, a descendant of Ghengis Khan, who has not forgotten Lamont's dastardly deeds in the Orient. He, too, has special powers and he is especially interested in Reinhard Lane's atomic discoveries. Can The Shadow defeat such a powerful man? This film, despite other problems, is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. The special effects are mind-blowing and the art direction is absolutely wonderful. The actors are also quite fine, with Baldwin doing a nice job as the unusual superhero and Miller is enchanting as the love interest. The rest of the performers, including McKellen, Peter Boyle, John Fine, and the wonderful Jonathan Winters, are more than up to snuff, too. However, the film definitely fits the style over substance category, as the plot is uneven, slow-moving, and unoriginal, at times. If you love superhero tales or have a hankering for visual effects, you will enjoy The Shadow. No, it is not, by far, the best comic-book-turned-film adaptation in the movie repertoire. But, it is certainly worth a look, especially because of its gorgeous sense of style and visual beauty.

It was extremely successful and generated large profits which helped restore the financial state of the studio. Although this might have led to a plethora of other Cat People films from various studios, it did not happen. Instead 40 years of continuing content changes in typical U.S. feature films went by before this 1982 remake was undertaken by the same studio. During this period the Hayes Code requirements had been abandoned and violence, nudity or highly erotic sequences had became commonplace (or even expected) in mainstream films; but heavy Freudian obsessions were no longer in favour. Not surprisingly this longer duration wide-screen remake, which was produced in colour and with a much more generous budget, took a very different form to the 1942 film; but rather confusingly they have many similar sequences and the principal characters have been given the same names. (IMDb User Comments on the earlier film, which discuss some of these differences, help minimise this confusion.) In this remake Irena is younger and has no idea of her heritage, her animal trainer parents died when she was very young (we wonder how?) and she was brought up in an orphanage, but her brother Paul in New Orleans eventually traces her. The film has a short but photographically very dramatic introductory sequence explaining how legendary werecats were first created when our distant ancestors sacrificed young women to service the sexual needs of the black leopards that they worshipped; then opens when Irena joins Paul. She quickly learns that he is inherently randy and regularly calls on the services of prostitutes who must be surprised when he transmogrificates into a black panther and rips them to shreds after their union, so regaining his human form. The cause of death is obvious and there are long, obviously unsuccessful, searches for an unknown escaped cat. Paul explains to Irena that they are both examples of surviving but now very rare cat people. He wants her as a mate so that dangerous transmogrifications can end although they are still able to attain sexual satisfaction. Unwilling to accept incest, Irena forms a relationship with Oliver a zoo-keeper in the New Orleans zoo, and later becomes jealous of Alice, a colleague of Oliver's. This leads to a re-run of the famous swimming pool sequences from the 1942 film.This 1982 film has become a cult favourite noted for incorporating a great deal of violence and gore. One very graphic scene shows Paul as a panther attacking Oliver's assistant zoo-keeper and effortlessly tearing out his arm, later when Paul has been killed before he could revert to human form we see an autopsy on the panther during which its belly is cut open and a complete human hand and forearm extracted. The film also incorporates copious nudity. The legends of lycanthropy make the shedding of all clothing (possibly apart from a small symbolic piece of the fur of the were-creature whose form is sought) one way to initiate the morph process. The film makers have used this to justify extended sequences showing Nastassja Kinsky as Irena roaming in the New Orleans swamplands completely naked. This is probably artistically justified - it is certainly not depicted lasciviously. But why should Alice have been shown as topless in the swimming pool scene which presumably takes place in a public pool? For a direct comparison I re-watched both Cat People films recently. In both the photography is way above average, and so is much of the acting - with near Oscar worthy performances by the two Cat ladies. Both films are vastly superior to most of their contemporary releases. One might define a good movie as a melding of good acting with good photography under a great director. Jacques Tourneur was the better director and this makes the 1942 film the more memorable, but Ferdinando Scarfiotti and Albert Whitlock's use of matte paintings in pre-computer days to create the introductory sequence of the 1982 film was for me the most memorable single feature of either film. The most striking impression I got from watching these films in sequence was the way in which both so closely reflected the culture of their day. In 1942 the Hayes code dominated movie-making. The story used in the re-make would have been totally unacceptable for both sexuality and violence - let alone incest. A simple kiss, rather than an orgasmic frenzy, had to be the initiator of transmogrification; reducing the legend to little better than the fairy stories where the frog Prince needs a kiss from the Princess before becoming her glamorous suitor. Horror films of this period were usually slasher films with cardboard cut-out characters and totally predictable endings. The studio may have expected this film to be similar, but the vision of Lewton and the craftsmanship of Tourneur overcame such limitations completely and successfully. By 1982 film-makers had become free to exploit their greater freedom and establish new limits, so any remake needed stronger meat. In those pre-AIDS days nudity and eroticism had become open doors, whilst public acceptability of extremes of essentially unnecessary violence was being increasingly tested. Films such as 300 and Gladiator show this process has not yet ended - Cat People shows the start.(ULTIMATE SPOILER AHEAD) This film ends with Irena making passionate love to Oliver in full knowledge of what will ensue. He waits with a tranquilliser dart at the ready, so that after the Irena panther has been caged in his zoo they can continue to love each other - although with bars eternally separating them. Symbolically effective, but not quite a conventional happy ending, this was presumably acceptable to most viewers of the period..

In those pre-AIDS days nudity and eroticism had become open doors, whilst public acceptability of extremes of essentially unnecessary violence was being increasingly tested. Films such as 300 and Gladiator show this process has not yet ended - Cat People shows the start.(ULTIMATE SPOILER AHEAD) This film ends with Irena making passionate love to Oliver in full knowledge of what will ensue. He waits with a tranquilliser dart at the ready, so that after the Irena panther has been caged in his zoo they can continue to love each other - although with bars eternally separating them. Symbolically effective, but not quite a conventional happy ending, this was presumably acceptable to most viewers of the period..

I was a teenager when I saw Plenty on stage at the National Theater in London. I remembered the play vividly, Kate Nelligan's performance was sensational. Fred Schepsi's Plenty has a totally unique life of its own. We're allowed into Susan's mind and Susan has Meryl Streep's face. Her performance makes her character's intellect visible, cinematic. Intimidating, fascinating, extraordinarily beautiful performance. I think David Hare has written here one of the best female characters I've ever seen and Meryl Streep strips it of every pretense. She can lie even to herself but not to us. It is mesmerizing at times. A ping pong ball going through the character's brain as she listens. Alone, so alone in the world. She never expresses it with words although she, I think, is totally aware of it. The infuriating sense of being incapable to adapt, to belong. Wanting and not wanting. Mesmerizing! As if this wasn't enough, Tracey Ullman, Charles Dance, Sting, Ian McKellen and John Gielgud giving, perhaps one of the best film performances during the final part of of his life I felt rather lonely in my love for this film until I started reading some of the comments posted here and realized I wasn't all alone in the world. Nice to meet you all.

A couple of friends told me how cool it was and I relished over having the privilege of sharing their opportunity to see R rated Horror. But the movie to me was nothing special. The hype immensely outweighed its value and I was quite frankly, disappointed. Sure there are some chilling movements and usage of slow motion and antics with camera angles. But the final result was pretty stupid.The killer falls from the window after having been shot by a 6 round pistol and is then missing. Donald Pleasance gives a look of shock and anguish and glosses his eyes over the screen. The premonition is There will be a sequel, and then some and then some. Gag me.Jamie Lee Curtis is nothing but a drab chick that panics and falls repeatedly when being chased. P.J. Soles is an equally annoying chick with a dimwitted boyfriend. You can only enjoy the deliberately slow and banal moments of their demise. Donald Pleasance is the only real actor here and it's the expression in his eyes and intensity of his voice that carries this slow and plodding plot line.The killer to me was very disappointing. Watching a slow, plodding mental case in a dumb mask wasn't scary enough.I am one of the select few who thought this movie was overrated and I can think of numerous, maybe hundreds of horror films better and scarier than Halloween. I can even think of films not under the horror genre scarier and more suspenseful than Halloween.Case closed.
