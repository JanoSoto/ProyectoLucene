To many it brought a crushing sense of disappointment and anger at what Lucas had done to his universe. And granted many of the flaws so religiously pointed out by all and sundry do harm the movie.But I remember coming out of the cinema and thinking At least Lucas tried something different. Phantom Menace is a part of a trilogy that has a very different tone to episodes IV-VI. Yes the dialogue is bad; yes the acting is variable or just plain bad. Yes much of the emotion is drained away. But after a sluggish start the film gets better and the last 30 minutes is a superb piece of film-making.Perhaps Lucas' biggest mistake was to make the film too political, instead of concentrating on Anakin - he comes into the movie about 40 minutes in and seems poorly sketched. Anakin is a slave, so why is he such a good person to begin with? He should be angry, dangerous, a bit of a rogue but with some good points. Lucas makes him a goody two shoes kid guaranteed to get right up your nose. He also seems nothing out of the ordinary, so why the other characters behave like he's the second coming appears rather strange at this distance. Jake Lloyd is not a good choice for the part. Jar Jar. Oh, Dear! Can we move on?Also Obi-Wan is really a walking piece of cardboard in this movie. Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, but he delivers a really bad Alec Guinness impression in place of a performance. Liam Neeson looks full of wisdom, but delivers some rather sleepy line readings. Natalie Portman struggles with a difficult part and just about brings it off. The most intriguing character is Darth Maul, an evil Sith Lord for whom a little screen time goes a long way. His light sabre duel with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan at the film's climax is the best of the series.That said, there are numerous continuity plot-holes in relation to the original trilogy. Why on earth would slaves need a protocol droid. To Help Mom just doesn't wash. Lucas forces it to happen for simple plot expediency.And yet Phantom isn't the worst of the series - I'm going to commit sacrilege here to Star Wars fans. Return Of The Jedi is easily the weakest of the movies. The acting in that is even more indifferent; the story is simply a rehash of the first two movies, and only Jabba's Palace and the speeder bike chase really stand out. Apparently to be a Jedi you must learn to use your sabre like an axe, with frequent chopping motions a must! No, Phantom is not a great movie, but it is an underrated one.

I can understand all the drugged-up adolescents who mindlessly love it&#151;they don't know any better. What I mean is, it's sad to see intelligent people who think this film is intelligent and a masterpiece&#151;they do know better. I guess this is how low the entertainment industry has come, and I can't find a single film that expresses it any better than this one. By all accounts, this should have been a freaking amazing movie. It appears to have all the elements that makes movies like Pulp Fiction so amazing, and for the first half hour it was amazing. Then it became a carbon copy of every other movie just like it, and, dare I say it, completely unoriginal and bland.There are countless negative reviews because of the violence cheesiness, but this isn't one of those reviews. I'll talk about the violence later, but I want to get one thing clear right now. This is a negative review simply because Natural Born Killers lacks anything even remotely original or different or intelligent, contrary to the popular opinion. That is why it's bad. Does it have some entertainment value? Sure. But it's entertainment I've seen a thousand times before, in better movies.The directing style is a mix between Quentin Tarantino and Takashi Miike, but doesn't come close to the perfection of either. At times it's just so cheesy it ruins the entire mood. Oliver Stone relies heavily on surrealist imagery here that may seem completely original to the moderate movie watcher, but to someone who knows anything about fiction, it's old news. Very old news. Though Natural Born Killers is far from all-out surrealism, it uses the same old tricks that surrealist fiction has used for centuries. It makes the viewer think they're watching something original when it really is just using weird images to mask a painfully unoriginal plot. Without the directing, the bare-bones plot is your standard serial killer story that you could watch on one of the woman's television networks. Nothing more.The supposed deep moral has likewise been used hundreds of times. Media's fascination with violence. So what . . .? Media is obsessed with violence because the public is obsessed with violence because of human nature. Didn't we learn that in Sunday school before we were old enough to go to the bathroom on our own? It's nothing new. The ancient civilizations even knew it. It's no more intelligent for Natural Born Killers to repeat that than it is for me to repeat one of Newton's laws. I read one reviewer who said anyone who calls Natural Born Killers shallow has a shallow mind, but that's just paradoxical. It's not shallow for a person to realize something is shallow. Study up on your psychology, bud.On every level, minus maybe the directing, it's completely typical. Even the iconic characters are just typical rednecks with little personality. So what's the big deal with this movie . . .? The violence is even generic. After reading countless reviews, both negative and positive, making me think this was the biggest bloodbath on screen. Here's a big, loud What a joke! I watched the director's cut, and I didn't even seen enough violence to justify this as a PG-13 movie. In fact, I didn't see any violence at all. Literally. Just like every other annoying kids-movie-in-disguise, as something even mildly violent happens (even a fist fight) the camera cuts away and looks at the wall or the floor or something else BUT the violent act. Every single time. Most gunshots don't even leave visible bullet holes or visible blood splatter. I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say there is more on-screen violence in the PG-13-rated James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace. And, seriously, compared to movies today like Saw III, Natural Born Killers Director's Cut is, as my title suggests, nothing but a fun kids movie. But don't take my word for it, I was an adult when I first viewed this. Instead, read the forums on this site and count how many 10 and 12-year-olds watched this and weren't disturbed in the slightest. The number is even higher than I estimated.Besides the lack of any on-screen violence, the supposed disturbing content wasn't disturbing, either. It's all just typical rape references and and lack of morality you can see in PG-rated westerns, not to mention modern cartoons. Sure, these are terrible things in real life, but as a desensitize society, this is no worse than a formal conversation. Dark has ceased to be dark to us in art because we've seen it so many times. But instead of try to re-sensitize our society by playing out things that are genuinely disturbing, Natural Born Killers once again just rehashes old clichés.And here is where I really drive the stake into Natural Born Killers. There is something that I have not seen a single review mention, and it's the fact that it fails as the parody it tries to be.Aren't parodies supposed to be so over-the-top that they point out a flaw in whatever they're parodying? Every single flaw I've just mentioned above adds to why there is NOTHING over-the-top about Natural Born Killers except the cinematography (and even that is a lot more typical than most people would expect).In short, Natural Born Killers fails at everything it tries to accomplish. It takes a very promising idea from Tarantino, then reverses it and ultimately ruins it by trying to be intellectual.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2008","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's sad to sit here and read all the positive reviews of Natural Born Killers.

The same thing has just happened to me in December 2008 on BBC 1. Why are these little gems of films shown so late, and why do the listings fail to highlight them as worth watching?The film could have had no other ending than it did. The fact that August told Annalee that she would meet with kindness beyond the northern ridge and the attitude of his equally poor neighbours shows that in 1815, the anti slavery movement may have penetrated to these backwoods. At least, some of the local population were incomers from Europe where slavery was virtually unknown and who relied on their own efforts to carve out a living. I feel the ground is laid for us to suppose that the neighbours will shelter August and help him to start again and that inevitably he will marry again - perhaps to the young woman who has known her own mind since a girl and who looks at him with admiration. Those who wanted a Hollywood style romance have no historical understanding.The brutal master is revealed as Annalee's father, which is why he is so desperate to get her back - he owns her in every sense.

Both The Bad Seed and Twisted Nerve (the other one) controversially suggest there's a direct connection between the protagonists' deviant murders and their mental inheritances. The main difference, however, is that the latter film is a provocative, mildly sleazy and in-your-face shocker whereas The Bad Seed is a very stylish, eloquent and sophisticated period piece that moodily builds up its suspense towards an remotely uncomfortable climax. Personally I always cherished a huge devotion for (horror) movies dealing with murderous children. Considering the time of release and the obvious lack of explicit bloodshed, it may not be my favorite 'evil child' movie, but it's undeniably a pioneer in genre and thus a hugely important trend setter for later horror movies. Cherubic 8-year-old Rhoda Penmark is the seemingly ideal daughter polite, intelligent, helpful and well-mannered. Her mother Christine slowly starts to notice, however, that Rhoda reacts extremely fanatic and relentless to certain things, like for example the spelling contest at school where she missed out on winning the medal by a narrow margin. But when the boy who did win the contest then mysteriously drowns during a school's picnic in the park and Rhoda is the one who was last seen with him, Christine has real reasons to get concerned. She gradually witnesses the dark side of Rhoda's character and righteously begins to wonder if her behavior could be linked to her own awful childhood memories. Probably the year 1956 was still a bit too soon for such a disturbing central premise, but what a shock-impact it must have made! The script is adapted from a stage play by Maxwell Anderson (which must have been even more shocking to behold) and that's admittedly the biggest problem I have with The Bad Seed. There where other reviewers around here surefooted claim the film doesn't at all suffer from the typical stage-restrictions, I think it does. It's a slightly overlong film with a minimum of sets and art-decoration. And even though practically all the performances are marvelous and unforgettable, the film is exaggeratedly talkative and some characters' monologues - like, say, those of the incredibly overactive landlady Monica &#150; should have been a little more succinct. The entire final act is simultaneously brilliant and tacky. The first climax, where you actually expect the film to end (or, as in my case, hope the film would end) is staggering and efficiently shocking. The second and ultimate climax, on the other hand, may look tremendously spectacular but it's thoroughly unconvincing and doesn't at all fit the tone of the film. The end sequences are just clear evidence that Hollywood had to follow a strict set of rules regarding morality and that the right punishment overcomes those who commit crimes.

But the leading star of 54 is Ryan Phillippe as a fictional Jersey boy Shane O'Shea with ambitions to seek employment in that club as he gets his feet wet into the establishment arranging tables as a busboy. Then as he progresses, much to the approval of Rubell, he gets promoted as a waiter and sugar daddy to the club's clientèle. Salma Hayek stars as Anita Randazzo, the club's coat check girl who's eloped to another busboy and roommate of Shane's, Greg Randazzo (Brecklin Mayer). Greg has his sights set on becoming a waiter, but due to his marriage commitments, he is deprived from his ambition, therefore making his dreams are sadly limited.What makes this movie only average at best is that the agonizing struggles of these fictional characters is that it's been rehashed and been done several times before. Critics who have expressed their harsh disdain on 54 compared the plot and the story as the weaker sister to Boogie Nights, which was more successful at the box-office. I get the impression that the critics claim that 54 steals most of their main ideas and themes, with only difference is that 54 is tamer than Boogie Nights. While I agree to some extent that this movie isn't anywhere near perfect, and that there have been better disco-themed movies than this one, but what makes this film passable is that it has all the essential ingredients to make for a compelling movie. Unfortunately, the resources were not carefully featured.In the case of Steve Rubell, his climb to success from a steakhouse proprietor to a highly successful club owner gets very meager notability, leaving most of his content in the dark, while the main plot is centered around these stereotypical failures as the struggle to climb the corporate ladder in the nightclub enterprise, which to me lacks any kind of depth to the movie. One of the questions that crossed my mind was how did Rubell emerged from running a steak house to owning club that Princess Grace and Truman Capote visited regularly? That should have been the core of 54. What about the aftermath of Rubell after his imprisonment due to his club being shut down via tax violations? That's where the importance of the movie should have been. Instead we are forced into watching overdone ego-driven hyper-extended melodrama with bare-chested men in tight shorts in a movie with an abundance of loose ends.The acting as a whole was a snore casserole with a side order of yawn juice. But it's not entirely to be blamed by the actors, but perhaps due to the messy script. The big surprise comes from the performance of Mike Myers, breaking away from his comical roots to play an impressive portrayal as a restrained, but mysterious bar owner (I'm sure the real Rubell was more charismatic, if he was able to persuade Arab princes to his New York establishment). Salma Hayek is fun to watch as a coat-check girl who has aspirations to be a singer and paves the way for Shane into getting used to the customs and surroundings of the nightclub. It was a treat to watch the energetic geriatric Ellen Arbertini Dow get down and boogie as Disco Dotty (though her cussing was not all that necessary, even for an old woman). The scenery of this movie in terms of props and setting leaves much for one's desire.

But the leading star of 54 is Ryan Phillippe as a fictional Jersey boy Shane O'Shea with ambitions to seek employment in that club as he gets his feet wet into the establishment arranging tables as a busboy. Then as he progresses, much to the approval of Rubell, he gets promoted as a waiter and sugar daddy to the club's clientèle. Salma Hayek stars as Anita Randazzo, the club's coat check girl who's eloped to another busboy and roommate of Shane's, Greg Randazzo (Brecklin Mayer). Greg has his sights set on becoming a waiter, but due to his marriage commitments, he is deprived from his ambition, therefore making his dreams are sadly limited.What makes this movie only average at best is that the agonizing struggles of these fictional characters is that it's been rehashed and been done several times before. Critics who have expressed their harsh disdain on 54 compared the plot and the story as the weaker sister to Boogie Nights, which was more successful at the box-office. I get the impression that the critics claim that 54 steals most of their main ideas and themes, with only difference is that 54 is tamer than Boogie Nights. While I agree to some extent that this movie isn't anywhere near perfect, and that there have been better disco-themed movies than this one, but what makes this film passable is that it has all the essential ingredients to make for a compelling movie. Unfortunately, the resources were not carefully featured.In the case of Steve Rubell, his climb to success from a steakhouse proprietor to a highly successful club owner gets very meager notability, leaving most of his content in the dark, while the main plot is centered around these stereotypical failures as the struggle to climb the corporate ladder in the nightclub enterprise, which to me lacks any kind of depth to the movie. One of the questions that crossed my mind was how did Rubell emerged from running a steak house to owning club that Princess Grace and Truman Capote visited regularly? That should have been the core of 54. What about the aftermath of Rubell after his imprisonment due to his club being shut down via tax violations? That's where the importance of the movie should have been. Instead we are forced into watching overdone ego-driven hyper-extended melodrama with bare-chested men in tight shorts in a movie with an abundance of loose ends.The acting as a whole was a snore casserole with a side order of yawn juice. But it's not entirely to be blamed by the actors, but perhaps due to the messy script. The big surprise comes from the performance of Mike Myers, breaking away from his comical roots to play an impressive portrayal as a restrained, but mysterious bar owner (I'm sure the real Rubell was more charismatic, if he was able to persuade Arab princes to his New York establishment). Salma Hayek is fun to watch as a coat-check girl who has aspirations to be a singer and paves the way for Shane into getting used to the customs and surroundings of the nightclub. It was a treat to watch the energetic geriatric Ellen Arbertini Dow get down and boogie as Disco Dotty (though her cussing was not all that necessary, even for an old woman). The scenery of this movie in terms of props and setting leaves much for one's desire.

This dead end job turns into a nightmare when a catatonic man staggers in pleading for help, a notorious killer en route to Death Row arrives, and a vicious street gang besiege the building and avow death for all inside ...John Carpenter, like most of the best filmmakers, carved his career out of adversity. He didn't have connections or easy breaks, and he didn't make career moves. He clawed out his own path, without compromise, through skill, hard work and dedication. Assault On Precinct 13, his second film, made for the tender sum of around $100,000, is a complete masterpiece; one of the best movies of the seventies, and a stunning achievement given the resources he had available. Almost every other equivalent film looks cheap, features nudity and has dated badly. By contrast, this film looks sensational (it's in Panavision), features brilliant writing (by the director) and is timeless. The one criticism that can be made is that it's a little derivative; the overall story is highly original, but many moments come from other movies, notably Rio Bravo, Night Of The Living Dead, Once Upon A Time In The West, even a story from Richard Schickel's 1973 American Cinematheque documentary on Hitchcock. The characters all come from Howard Hawks archetypes - the good man, the philosophical outlaw, the gutsy girl - as do the survival rules; anybody who is stupid or cowardly dies. Early on, a superior tells Bishop there are no heroes anymore, but in fact they are alive and well in this mythology. In essence, Assault On Precinct 13 should be viewed as a modern urban western fairy tale; the street gang are simply Indians attacking the covered wagon, or waves of zombies converging upon their human prey. Early on in his career, Carpenter honed his love of mixing genres (see Starman, Big Trouble In Little China, Vampires) with his beloved auteur's theme of isolation - many of his movies feature sieges (The Fog, Prince Of Darkness, Ghosts Of Mars). What makes the film so enjoyable for me is his perfect sense of rhythm - events build up, the eerily effective percussion synth score ratchets up the tension, the story deftly manipulates all the main players together, and all the while the atmosphere of fear and disconnection grows. We identify with the situation and the people. The story is fantastic and yet plausible. The characters are real and yet stylised. It's a proper movie experience, made by someone who knows how to control us, and it works brilliantly. Equally impressive are the performances by the relatively unknown cast. The three leads are wonderful, Loomis (who also did the costumes) and Cyphers both score in the first of several roles for Carpenter, and Burton is great as the doomed convict Wells. Stoker takes the most conventional role but plays it with watchful intelligence, a rational but quickly adaptive hero. Joston is sensational as the enigmatic, self-deprecating Napeoleon Wilson, stealing all the best lines (I don't sit in chairs as well as I used to.), and Zimmer is truly fabulous as the sensuous, quick-witted Leigh - I wish she had made some other movies. Her scenes with Joston in particular - like the moment where she gives him a much needed cigarette - crackle with frisson and humour. Carpenter is a puppet master, dancing these characters around each other, extracting all the value he can from dialogue, editing, photography and mise en scène. He shoots in a grand traditional third person style, with elegant composition, smooth tracking shots and several fine set pieces like the shocking ice-cream truck murders, the classic throwing-the-shotgun moment (which comes from Red River), the ruthlessly cut shootout sequence and Wells' tragic escape attempt. It's a confident, polished, expertly constructed thriller which belies its humble origins and the inexperience of its makers. Trivia - editor John T. Chance is actually the director, taking his pseudonym from John Wayne's gruff hero in Rio Bravo. Remade in 2005 by Jean-François Richet as an agreeably different cop actioner. Perhaps I'm biased - Carpenter is my favourite filmmaker - but I reckon that shot for shot this is the most entertaining low-budget suspense film ever made. A must-see.

His first morning there he spends collecting specimens in jars from the sand, he is approached by a rather suspicious local, who questions him as to his motives for being there, Niki dispels the locals suspicions that he is some authoritative figure snooping and goes on his way. Resting briefly in an old boat, he ponders humanity's dependence on paper qualifications to prove our credentials to others, passports, driving licences, university certificates, medical certificates etc and what a suspicious world it would be without them. Niki ( incidentally a name we only find out a the end of the film) falls asleep with the hazy sun beating down on him, he is awakened by the same local, who asks him, how he is going to get home, as he has missed his last bus. Somewhat bewildered Niki says he'll have to walk, the local man says he might be able to help and offers to help find him a bed for the night in the nearby village. Niki is led through the treacherous dunes until they come across a large pit, at the bottom of which lives a woman, it is here that Niki will spend the night.Niki immediately questions the woman, as to why she would live in such a desolate place, in a ramshackle house where the sand is constantly flowing through holes in the roof and he is amazed to find that her nightly Sisyphean task involves filling baskets with sand that has blown into the pit and having it hoisted up by the locals. After feeding him, the woman tells him he doesn't have to help on his first night here, he finds this a curious statement as he is only staying one night? The truth behind the pit is soon revealed as Niki finds that there is no way out of the pit, the rope ladder having been removed by the locals.Teshigahara is perhaps best known for his surreal and existential works, Woman in the Dunes fits right into this category. The setting of the sand dunes with the blinding sun gives the film an otherworldly dreamlike quality, with continuing rivers of sand also adding to this quality. The revelation that he is being kept captive is also a rather scary and intriguing, the film traces Niki's mixed emotions of anger and aggression, his denial of his captors, his change of heart and the fact he would stop at nothing to get the merest of rewards from them. His transformation is complete as he himself turns into a captor, of the woman that he now shares his life with.The film is an epic at almost 2 ½ hours, its pace is incredibly slow but strangely it still doesn't feel that long, this viewer being drawn in to the complexities of the film. There's also a very sensual and sexual subtext, with the burning heat and little to do during the day and with the woman's recommendation that they sleep naked because the sand will chaff them, it is inevitable that sexual liaisons will happen and they do, sometimes it rough and ready and they wrestle each other, sometimes its sensuous as they provocatively wash the sand from each other in some very intimate moments.Woman of the Dunes I have heard is full of subtext and hidden meanings, some are contradictory to the writer and directors visions so its hard to tell exactly on this my first viewing, exactly what they are so I will not even try to do so, I'll just sit back and let the film wash through my mind again and maybe it will all fall into place.

What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that horror should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any.

Basically, at Summer Camp in Maine, USA, two redhead eleven-year-old girls, Hallie Parker and Annie James (introducing then freckly faced Lindsay Lohan, playing both) coincidently meet each other, and after a little naughtiness with each other, become friends, and after finding out more about each other, realise they are twin sisters. Hallie by the way is the cool, laid back California gal, living with father Nick (Dennis Quaid), and Annie is the proper rose from London, living with mother Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson), and the girls, who never met their other parent decide to swap places to get their time together. Hallie seems pretty happy with her mother in London, but Annie discovers her father is planning to marry new love, the nasty and money hungry Cruella, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix). So the twins now have the plan for Hallie to reveal herself to Elizabeth, so that they can travel to America and try and get her and Nick back together, after eleven years apart. They do eventually get Meredith out of the way after pulling some tricks on her, and they do get Nick and Elizabeth in a room together, and there is a happy ending after that moment of unsureness, so the whole family are reunited with a wedding. Also starring Bruce Almighty's Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy (Parker's Housekeeper), Four Weddings and a Funeral's Simon Kunz as Martin (James's Butler), Gremlins' Polly Holliday as Marva Kulp, Sr. and Friends' Janice, Maggie Wheeler as Marva Kulp, Jr. The special effect tricks are so good it is really easy to forget there aren't really two Lohans, yes, she is cute and likable as both twins, I'll admit this is more for little girls, but I have to say, all the family should watch.

Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are brilliant as Cornelius and Zira. This film is essentially the flip side of the original 1968 film, although this time, the apes are caged, and the humans are in charge.The magnitude of the level of paranoia of 1973 America is a little far fetched, to say the least. Wouldn't the U.S. authorities (i.e., politicians and scientists) want to discuss future events with scientists Cornelius (an archaeologist) and Zira (a psychologist)? In the first film, ape society is unaware that humans once ruled the earth and had the power of speech. However, in Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Cornelius and Zira explain how apes became the pets and then the servants of mankind (after a virus killed off all cats and dogs). Once again, this is a huge inconsistency.Escape from the Planet of the Apes is an enjoyable chapter in the Apes movies. When I first saw this film as a child in the 1970s, I did not notice the aforementioned flaws, of course. Turn off your brain, sit back, relax, and enjoy this segment of the apes series.
