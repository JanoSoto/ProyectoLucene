A story would be nice. Technicalities. Blown up from a 16mm print, Director Stephen Verona's earthy look at 50's teenagers warrants another viewing. I saw this movie many moons ago, as a skiff made from nostalgia begins to creep over me like fog from the shores of Coney Island. In the 70's, as a kid, I was heavily into the music and the culture of that period. Three quarter's of our greasy gang, The Lords of Flatbush, went onto bigger and better things. Two of them became superstars. One died. When I saw the do-wop trailer on the DVD, I was transported back in time to when I was eleven years old again. It also brokered memories of those Crazy Eddie's commercials the one, in particular, with the five greasers singing do-wop in a high school boys' restroom, which played endlessly on New York City's local television stations back then. My favorite scene (in the movie) is the one involving the verbal exchange between Henry Winkler's character and the owner of the candy store. It's the best acted scene in the picture--and the most poignant. We find out that Winkler has the smarts and the talent (he's an artist) to escape the neighborhood. I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff. A young Sly Stallone is excellent as well. He has many of the flashier scenes in the film. I believe he wrote that showy, somewhat out of place, scene, toward the end of the picture, with Perry King and Stalone's pigeon coop featured prominently. It's more than a little obvious. Afterall, he did get screen credit for writing additional dialog. Stalone's whiny fiancé is a riot. Her accent--devoid of rs--is right on pitch. Susan Blakely is a tease. The worst sought of turn-off for a teenage boy. King deserves better. If you are looking for a slick coming-of-age flick here you may wish to skip this movie. However, with an open mind and some wistful thoughts, you may be entertained for ninety minutes. Go for it.

The original THE GETAWAY was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) Was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.By comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.Let's just get it said and out of the way -- Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. Like someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action\/adventure heist genre. By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. Peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. There's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.So I don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor\/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. I'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original. This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release Mr. Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood.

But the film suffers from a plot that is too predictable and from characters whose behavior is not believable.This is one of those movies that you can see the end coming a mile away. There are virtually no plot twists to deflect the story's straight-line trajectory. As such, the story is almost too simple and unimaginative to be worth telling. To varying degrees, most romantic comedies are fairly shallow. But Kissing A Fool has no subtlety at all, not in plot, not in characters, not in dialogue.Lacking any complexity, the story relies on two main characters, Jay (Jason Lee) and Max (David Schwimmer) whose behavior toward each other is not believable. They're supposed to be best buddies. But they are constantly at each other's throats. Their constant arguing not only is annoying; it calls into question their friendship. How can they be best buddies?The two are not at all alike. Jay is bookish and cerebral; Max is your typical arrogant, cocky self-centered sports freak jerk. All that animosity between these two guys does not lend credibility to their friendship; yet, it is the main contrivance that propels the film's plot. Further, it renders a story conclusion that is, by extension, also not believable.The film's acting is a tad exaggerated. I like Jason Lee, but he tends to overact in this film. Mili Avital, as the girl in between, is okay, but she doesn't have much to do. And David Schwimmer's performance is something of a hyper-masculine strut-fest. Some subtlety in acting would have helped a lot.For all that, Kissing A Fool is still worth watching, once.

YEEEEEEEHAAAAAWW!!! film,which,besides being unnecessarily LOUD(which I think was no mistake by the filmmakers to amp the volume of an already noisy film,evidently under the principle that ear-splitting=memorable),the movie also commits the following crimes science that was written for people who flunked science class in high school(fire and noise in space come to mind instantly);working my favorite element of this film Steve Buscemi as a likable,if sleazy,comic relief for about two-thirds of the film before trying to turn him into a treacherous character toward the end(maybe the reverse of his turn in 1997's Con Air); practically wasting Owen Wilson and character actor Will Patton in the flush to keep the cameras steady on Willis,Tyler and Affleck;not making up its mind whether it wanted to be a brainless-but-enjoyable summer action flick,a patriotic type thriller or a semi-comedic buddy-to-the-third-power flick.Another reviewer said that how DI and A differed was a matter of tastes,that people who appreciated thoughtful,more realistic dramas would appreciate DI,while action-lovers would go for A. Perhaps so,but I happen to enjoy a good brainless action figure like the next male,and I STILL found myself angry after this film. Perhaps it was mostly about my hearing that made me steamed,but that should account for something where your film enjoyment goes,right?

'Dr. No' got things off to an exciting, low-budget start, and it seems clear that the creators of the second 007 flick felt secure enough that they were establishing a franchise to reinforce (and in some cases, introduce) most of the series' trademarks Q and his gadgets, the pre-title sequence, Bond's flirtation with Moneypenny, a helicopter attack, etc. The movie in fact is so energetic and works so much into its almost two-hour running time, some of its clumsiness can be easily forgiven and even provides a measure of charm. The plot actually is a bit underwhelming compared to later ones in the series. No nuclear blackmail or end-of-the-world scenarios here- 007 is merely out to locate and steal a decoding device from the Russians. But it's enough of an excuse to hang quite a number of exciting sequences on, including one of the most convincing fight scenes ever filmed, period. The 'Bond Girl' for this second installment is Daniela Bianchi and I would say she is the second most gorgeous actress to embody this recurring plot requirement, right behind Jill St. John from 'Diamonds Are Forever.' It says something about her physical attributes that it is not TOO noticeable another actress dubs in her dialogue. The Mexican actor Pedro Armendariz has a key role (and a lot of screen time) as Ali Kerim Bey, British Intelligence station chief in Istanbul. His is an embarrassingly amateurish performance and one wonders why he was given such a large role; another distraction but not a fatal one. Robert Shaw, on the other hand, is dead-perfect as the deadly assassin Red Grant, wonderfully menacing and very believable. In fact, these last two actors are a good example of the dichotomy apparent in 'From Russia with Love'. And it's not just good and bad actors; terrific scenes are followed by incredibly awkward ones (when SPECTRE officer Rosa Klebb gives Tatiana (Bianchi) her instructions, the scene is as clumsy as Klebb's attempts to grope her during the proceedings). A prolonged episode at a gypsy camp serves no purpose and when the camp is attacked by an armed gang, it reminds one more of a scene from 'The Alamo' than a James Bond vehicle. And John Barry's trademark music score is overused, to say the least, blaring off the screen as Bond walks quietly through a hotel room and at other inappropriate times. But this is all nitpicking, right? For every moment where you roll your eyes, there's another that will have you glued to the screen. The catacombs below the embassies are a nice touch, and there's the aforementioned punch-out between Bond and Grant, which I hereby nominate for All-time Best Fight Scene Onboard A Moving Train.

There's another great action sequence with Bond and Tatiana making an escape by boat and blowing up four others in pursuit.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"15 June 2008","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Released three years after talkies out-won the silent medium on a permanent basis, CITY LIGHTS was not only one of Chaplin's boldest productions but also probably the one of his that has gained him most acclaim. So much has been said about this touching 'comedy of pantomime' that I find it difficult to know where to begin; words almost seem irrelevant.As with virtually every single one of Chaplin's movies, the story of CITY LIGHTS is easy to summarize the Tramp is in love with a blind flower girl who mistakes him for a millionaire. He is determined to get money for the poor girl's rent; he befriends an alcoholic millionaire, who is suicidal but friendly when drunk, cold and indifferent when sober. He is caught in a number of situations which, while difficult or even manipulating to him, appear side-splitting to us he saves the millionaire from committing suicide; he is confronted with upper-class life; he tries his luck as a boxer.It is within these elements that the story evolves, making it possibly the most delicate, moving funny-film ever produced, period. I say funny-film because I believe that is the justifying word to describe this film as an entirety. Although sentiment is present in large parts throughout, the age-old criticism of Chaplin's begging for pity has never seemed more out of place. Noticed when the Tramp fell off a barrel while admiring the blind girl outside her window? The sentiment presented here is indeed overwhelming, and the gag that resulted from it is as old as the art of modern comedy itself. But when we combine these two situations together, one sentimental, one embarrassing --and imagine the embarrassment which was enlarged inside the Tramp precisely due to the sentimental situation the moment before-- we get a brilliant, hilarious gag. The comedy is a result of what moves us and what moves us is a result of what makes us laugh.The fact that each detail comes together so gallantly is even more impressive considering that the most dominant subject of the film is something of a task to handle. Yes, I said earlier that the story is simple to summarize, but one of Chaplin's most striking strengths was his ability to establish room for complexity and different interpretations through a very plain formula. The most obvious theme presented here is love. But this theme is, as I see it, really just the story in itself, a surface to cover the underneath the different personalities we are introduced to --a Tramp, a blind girl, an alcoholic millionaire-- possess a constant tendency of somehow distorting the truth behind their real identities; and these personalities, puzzled and tricked as they are, do not say a single thing about love. If they even know what love is about, they surely do not know how to handle it. But love does, on the other hand, tell a great deal about these personalities; about identity.None of the major characters in this film are happy the way they are, and they escape from the reality by forgetting, imagining, or tricking. The millionaire drinks, the girl fantasizes in her blind world, and the Tramp, however well-meaning and perhaps even unintended, takes advantage of these sub-conscious fantasy worlds of the former persons, in his desire to get money out of the millionaire to help the girl. That is the only way for him to go, because while he may pretend to be a millionaire or a boxer, he does not, as Walter Kerr put it, belive it himself. At the very beginning of this film, there is the famous scene which has the Tramp lying asleep in the hands of a newly-founded statue representing 'Peace, Love and Prosperity.' The Tramp is hastily chased away by a furious crowd of aristocrats and intellectuals. It is then, after this embarrassing incident, that he meets the blind girl, the one person who, perhaps, can accept him as he is; but she mistakes him for a millionaire. After he has acquainted the millionaire, he gets his chance to live up to this pretended image for a time, when he is invited to fancy restaurants and parties, but the comfort he feels in these situations is as little as it was in the arms of the statue.We tend to think that the fascination of the blind girl in her millionaire was due to his money (and kindness!). There is no doubt that these factors are essential, as she expected him to be such. But we can still ask ourselves would she have been less moved by the kindness of the Tramp if she had known his true identity? Or would she, as the gamine in MODERN TIMES, have decided to fight along with him? The disappointment she expresses at the end, when the Tramp finally reveals himself, is of course a result of her expectations; love may make blind, but not quite as blind as the shock that a reversed reality would provoke out of a person who imagined a situation as completely different. There was, in the end, perhaps no need for the Tramp to pretend to be anything he was not, as the blind girl was in his own shoes; but the inacceptance of him in the society around, the coldness expressed by everyone but the one who could not see, had made him blind.I got chatty here, as I often do. But even if you don't appreciate my words, don't let that turn you off. CITY LIGHTS is, with its great cast and haunting musical score, a wonderfully sweet film which you can watch if you want to laugh, to cry, or be inspired; Chaplin does his most refined performance throughout his career. It fills my eyes with tears and arise my spirit with laughs, every time, whatever hour. All independent on your age and from which country you happen to come from&#133;and that's part of its genius.

He is caught in a number of situations which, while difficult or even manipulating to him, appear side-splitting to us he saves the millionaire from committing suicide; he is confronted with upper-class life; he tries his luck as a boxer.It is within these elements that the story evolves, making it possibly the most delicate, moving funny-film ever produced, period. I say funny-film because I believe that is the justifying word to describe this film as an entirety. Although sentiment is present in large parts throughout, the age-old criticism of Chaplin's begging for pity has never seemed more out of place. Noticed when the Tramp fell off a barrel while admiring the blind girl outside her window? The sentiment presented here is indeed overwhelming, and the gag that resulted from it is as old as the art of modern comedy itself. But when we combine these two situations together, one sentimental, one embarrassing --and imagine the embarrassment which was enlarged inside the Tramp precisely due to the sentimental situation the moment before-- we get a brilliant, hilarious gag. The comedy is a result of what moves us and what moves us is a result of what makes us laugh.The fact that each detail comes together so gallantly is even more impressive considering that the most dominant subject of the film is something of a task to handle. Yes, I said earlier that the story is simple to summarize, but one of Chaplin's most striking strengths was his ability to establish room for complexity and different interpretations through a very plain formula. The most obvious theme presented here is love. But this theme is, as I see it, really just the story in itself, a surface to cover the underneath the different personalities we are introduced to --a Tramp, a blind girl, an alcoholic millionaire-- possess a constant tendency of somehow distorting the truth behind their real identities; and these personalities, puzzled and tricked as they are, do not say a single thing about love. If they even know what love is about, they surely do not know how to handle it. But love does, on the other hand, tell a great deal about these personalities; about identity.None of the major characters in this film are happy the way they are, and they escape from the reality by forgetting, imagining, or tricking. The millionaire drinks, the girl fantasizes in her blind world, and the Tramp, however well-meaning and perhaps even unintended, takes advantage of these sub-conscious fantasy worlds of the former persons, in his desire to get money out of the millionaire to help the girl. That is the only way for him to go, because while he may pretend to be a millionaire or a boxer, he does not, as Walter Kerr put it, belive it himself. At the very beginning of this film, there is the famous scene which has the Tramp lying asleep in the hands of a newly-founded statue representing 'Peace, Love and Prosperity.' The Tramp is hastily chased away by a furious crowd of aristocrats and intellectuals. It is then, after this embarrassing incident, that he meets the blind girl, the one person who, perhaps, can accept him as he is; but she mistakes him for a millionaire. After he has acquainted the millionaire, he gets his chance to live up to this pretended image for a time, when he is invited to fancy restaurants and parties, but the comfort he feels in these situations is as little as it was in the arms of the statue.We tend to think that the fascination of the blind girl in her millionaire was due to his money (and kindness!). There is no doubt that these factors are essential, as she expected him to be such. But we can still ask ourselves would she have been less moved by the kindness of the Tramp if she had known his true identity? Or would she, as the gamine in MODERN TIMES, have decided to fight along with him? The disappointment she expresses at the end, when the Tramp finally reveals himself, is of course a result of her expectations; love may make blind, but not quite as blind as the shock that a reversed reality would provoke out of a person who imagined a situation as completely different. There was, in the end, perhaps no need for the Tramp to pretend to be anything he was not, as the blind girl was in his own shoes; but the inacceptance of him in the society around, the coldness expressed by everyone but the one who could not see, had made him blind.I got chatty here, as I often do. But even if you don't appreciate my words, don't let that turn you off. CITY LIGHTS is, with its great cast and haunting musical score, a wonderfully sweet film which you can watch if you want to laugh, to cry, or be inspired; Chaplin does his most refined performance throughout his career.

I try to watch several films a week in order to judge those I will view in the future with greater understanding of their relation with others in their genre. I will admit that I haven't watched very many films in my nineteen years, but I think that I've viewed enough to discuss Drugstore Cowboy fairly. I first became interested in the film when my dormitory neighbor (during my freshman year of college) had to leave school. I was speaking with his former roommate, and I saw this film on the floor. I was intrigued by it, so I asked if I could take it to our library. I did, and the next day I saw it displayed on the recently-returned shelve. I decided that I would watch it given how unusual I found its title. As I decided to become a film critic later that year, I was introduced to Gus Van Sant when I sporadically chose to watch Mala Noche from the library. I decided to view all of his films in the order he released them.Thus, I finally watched it. The film reminds me of the classic drama films I enjoy. Like those dramas, Drugstore Cowboy shows the ceaseless struggle of people to overcome their own handicaps. There are no direct or permanent antagonists. As the protagonist progresses, the obstacles they encounter, be they other people, the environment, or themselves serve are the antagonists. The greatest of dramas adhere to this trope but also provide a response to what may occur after these obstacles are overcome. Drugstore Cowboy is a member of this distinguished category.The film follows the life of Bob, just Bob, as he travels around the northwestern United States with his family stealing from drugstores to feed his addiction. Bob begins his journey in Portland, Oregon, his hometown. He travels with his wife, Dianne, and a younger couple. Eventually, the younger woman dies of overdoes, and Bob questions his lifestyle. He returns home and enters a rehab center, and leaves Dianne. While there, Bob meets a pastor who is attempting to recover from his lifelong addictions. The film ends as Bob is being transported to the hospital after having been shot by a former associate who accuses him of hiding drugs.Drugstore Cowboy distinguishes itself by its honesty. Bob does not speak with any emotion in his voice. He tells us about the events that he observes as a third party would. Not only does he retain objectivity in his narration, but in his drug addiction too. Bob knows that he is a drug addict but doesn't blame anyone for it. It's rather ironic; Bob is very mature in his acceptance of his problem despite his mother's dissonance with him. Matt Dillon acts appropriately in his role as Bob. He doesn't overact as he did in The Outsiders. He plays Bob as the realistically flawed character he is. Gus Van Sant also deserves credit for the multiple faces of Bob's character. He originally thinks he understands the reasons his life is always troubled. He is superstitious but learns after the young girl dies that his life is a cycle of sorrow and joy just like everyone else's. I was very happy and felt that this strengthened the film's effect.Despite Dillon's strong character development, the minor characters don't grow as much. James Legros' character, Rick, is just a supportive character but acts as a foil to Bob. He is idealistic about leading the group while Bob is subtly upset with it. The other characters also stay true to honesty theme Van Sant includes in this film. Dianne does not enter the rehab center even though she loves Bob. Bob doesn't chase her even though he wishes he could. This acceptance of their own character flaws transforms both of them into real people, worthy of our sympathy.Gus Van Sant should also be praised for the approach he took to directing this film. He superimposes images of various objects, usually over bob during voice-over narration. It's reminiscent of the high Bob gets after he shoots up. The voice-over narration is also useful because it shows Bob's transition into his new life as he narrates his past. The entire experience is an emotional monologue which never becomes sentimental.

They are simply a depiction of criminal life in American metropolis. This is life, not its ideal, its model but real life filled rather with decadence than virtue! The characters seem to follow the advice that Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) gives once to the boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) F*** ambition and fill their days with crimes, sex, and drugs.

What a look at God and faith!However, it seems crucial to state that PULP FICTION by Quentin Tarantino also has its serious dangers (perhaps it is even too leniently said). This is a movie where exaggeration and the lack of good taste are really present. For instance, the rape on Marsellus Wallace is a very disturbing moment. I also detested Mia's overdose and injection that she gets in the house of Vincent's drug dealing friend. Besides, I highly criticize the sequence The Bonnie Situation with the plot of one body - no head and the characters clean the blood flooded car from the parts of brain. This is Tarantino, you may justify. However, I am certain that there are lots of people who will rather concentrate on this facet expressing a strong criticism and no one, even people who consider PULP FICTION a masterpiece, cannot ignore that opposite viewpoint - the movie is filled with graphic violence.But of course, when watching PULP FICTION, you cannot skip one thing, certainly the special mood so characteristic of Tarantino. It is something which, as I have mentioned before, many detest, but which allows you, as a viewer, to experience the movie, to watch it memorably even though it is filled with so much violence and disturbing visuals. Although Tarantino got worse in years, this is purely the very best example of his unspoiled individual vision. I'm not his fan but this aspect quite impressed me in PULP FICTION - to be able to invite a viewer to something pretty personal, powerful, and thought provoking.As disgusting as a murder for some, as pleasant as a foot massage for others... a movie on its own though a film like many others but, at the same time, a movie like no other that's, I think, what best defines PULP FICTION with its strong and weak points ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 June 2008","score":"12 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, because here is a real story that really happened and was perfect for eventual translation to the big screen.

The second time I watched it, I knew the plot already so I really got to indulge in the characters of the film. And thats exactly what the film is, it's a character piece.Those of you who expect an energetic, stylized, violent, comic book-esque film like Pulp Fiction will not get that from this movie. Its a lot more tamed, and to say the least realistic. I love Pulp Fiction, its one of my all time favorite movies. But I doubt in the real world there would be two hit men in matching black and white suits. The scenarios of that movie, while fun and totally entertaining, aren't too realistic. Jackie Brown on the other hand has totally real characters that don't come off as too over the top.All the actors in the movie are superb.The lead is played by actress Pam Grier who nails the role. Tarantino again shows you don't need an a-list actor to carry a movie. Grier plays Jackie Brown, an airline stuartess in her 40s. Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell Robbie, a gun dealer who uses Jackie to bring him in money from Mexico. Robert DeNiro (in a smaller role for such a big actor) plays Louis, Ordell's friend who recent got out of jail. Bridget Fonda plays Melanie, a blonde haired surfer girl who lives with Ordell. Michael Keaton (my all time favorite actor)plays ATF agent Ray Nicollette who wants to take down Ordell. And Robert Forster plays Max Cherry, a bail bonds man. Without giving too much away, all of these characters in one way or another are all after $500,000 of Ordell's money. Every character in this movie is great and unique in their own way. But for me, Robert Forster steals the show. Max Cherry is without a doubt my favorite character in all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.To some people, this movie is just a crime\/heist movie. But to me there is something quite beautiful to this movie. After a few viewings of the film, you will notice that underneath it all, this movie is really about two people. Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Two people who are middle aged, lonely, and tired of their dead end jobs. Two people that meet in a very unlikely way. Two people that together figure out a way to steal $500,000 and get away with it. Take this movie however you want it. But to me, thats the heart of the movie, and thats why the movie works so well.In conclusion, Jackie Brown is not a graphic crime story like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction that preceded it.

RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper Dutch Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and jump clean. An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout The Longest Day. Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.But The Longest Day has its share of misfires; too.

The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.But the overall quality of The Longest Day is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story.

","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"15 June 2008","score":"","review":" The Longest Day is unquestionably a product of self-important Hollywood bloat, but it is also a noble attempt to do justice to one of then-recent history's most singular moments, the Normandy landings of June 1944. For the price of sitting through clumsy expository dialogue, misplaced comedy, and thumb-in-your-eye cameos, you get some terrific cinema and a decent war story.As an opening title tells us, its the fifth year of the German occupation of France, and on both sides of the English Channel, warriors await the inevitable clash of arms. RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper Dutch Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and jump clean. An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout The Longest Day. Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.But The Longest Day has its share of misfires; too. A lot of times in the movie, we are taken to a meeting room somewhere so the directors can tell you what is happening. The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.But the overall quality of The Longest Day is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story. Even more than its three sure-handed directors (Brit Ken Annakin, naturalized American Andrew Marton, and German war vet Bernhard Wicki) and numerous screenwriters (including James Jones and Cornelius Ryan, who wrote the book upon which this is based), you have a masterful editing job by Samuel E. Beetley, which sustains the film's galloping pace by keeping less important scenes to the barest minimum. Few films are as long as The Longest Day, but many feel longer. Too bad for Beetley he was up against Lawrence Of Arabia's Anne V. Coates come Oscar-time; any other year he would have won.It's not a great film otherwise, but it manages to hold up more than not, leading up to that winning wistful moment when Beymer, Burton, and the German come together.

Many years later he recovers and returns to his barber shop but the country of Tomania has changed from what he would remember (if he could remember it). The Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has laid claim to the country and is mercilessly persecuting the Jewish people. While Hynkel continues his political persecutions (which will next extend to brunettes), the unassuming barber finds himself in the midst of a form of resistance movement.Although it is considered a classic, I had never actually seen this film. At the end of a week where I had not only seen Little Man but also Norbit, I felt like perhaps my film-watching choices were not the best I could be making and decided to come to this next. I don't normally like to step into context when watching a film because my enjoyment of it (or not) is based on a modern viewing, but with Great Dictator it is important to note that Chaplin did not decide to do this film in the political climate that we now associate with Hitler and the Nazi party. At the time production started even Britain was not at war with Germany. So one does have to appreciate the career risks that Chaplin was taking by mocking an European leader so far from America. Of course time quickly showed his instincts to be correct and the film has lost none of its relevance.Being his first all sound talky, I was impressed by how Chaplin does so well with the comedy from the dialogue as well as the physical side. The film is very funny although it should be noted that those expecting the quick-fire of gags associated with his best silent shorts will be a touch disappointed because it is more of a proper film with a plot and events rather than just setups for jokes. In regards the plotting, it is not always as effective as it could have been but this is understandable with the nature of the film. This is best seen in the concluding speech, which in regards plotting is not a great ending but in terms of using the film to make an impassioned plea to the world, it is hard to criticise. As an actor Chaplin does surprisingly well as the barber, with a real sense of pain and longing in his turn. As Hynkel, he is funnier but not as smart in the style of comedy. The supporting cast is mostly very good. I was very impressed by Goddard's performance but of course my favourite one was Jack Oakie's wonderful Napaloni.The Great Dictator is undoubtedly a film of significance in regards cinema history but this does not mean that it is not interesting and funny at the same time. The nature of it means that it is neither as strong a story nor as funny as one would hope but as a total package it is hard to fault. There are funnier Chaplin films from earlier in his career but this is one definitely worth seeing.

Not just awful, but so relentlessly and completely awful she almost single-handedly ruins the picture. It had other problems, but her outrageous miscasting, her laughable attempts at a Puerto Rican accent, her complete lack of chemistry with her supposed love interest, Richard Beymer, the fact that she was neither a singer nor a dancer but was given a part that required a lot of singing and dancing--neither of which she pulled off--were among the film's downsides. Richard Beymer's performance, however, is not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be. He plays Tony a bit more naive and somewhat goofier, maybe, than he should have, but compared to the acting jobs turned in by most of the other Jet gang members, it wasn't bad at all. Much of the non-musical dialogue is insipid and painfully outdated even by 1961 standards, and other than Tony Mordente, the members of the Jets gang looked like exactly what they were--Broadway chorus boys. I realize this film isn't a documentary, and it was more important for the actors to be able to sing and dance than it was for them to actually *look* the parts they were playing--the Puerto Rican Sharks were a bit more authentic-looking, which was odd because the two main actors in that gang, George Chakiris (Bernardo) and Gus Trikonis (Indio), weren't Puerto Rican but Greek--but to tell the truth, the Jets were the sissiest looking and acting gangbangers I've ever seen. On the other hand, the supporting cast is actually pretty good--Simon Oakland as the gruff and racist Lt. Schrank, Ned Glass as Doc the candy store owner, John Astin as the doofus rec center director--but the gangsters themselves are just not very good actors. There are also several numbers where the songs aren't even remotely up to the level of the dancing that accompanies them (Cool comes to mind).That being said, there are several upsides to the film. The dancing is spectacular--especially in the terrific America number, which just explodes off the screen at you--and the Dear Kindly Sergeant Krupke routine is still hilarious, even if a bit forced. The film's main advantage, however, is Rita Moreno. She is absolutely volcanic and blows everyone off the screen whenever she's on it, whether she's dancing, singing or acting (her scene in the candy store where the Jets rough her up is especially chilling, and it's all entirely due to her). I think Rita was the first real glimpse Middle America got of how smart, funny, sultry and sexy a Latina actress could be--up until then Latinas were mostly caricatures such as Lupe Velez and Carmen Miranda--and in the numbers she was in, especially the America routine, you just couldn't keep your eyes off her. You could really feel the pain and anger in her voice when she sang the Stick To Your Own Kind number. She won the Oscar for this role, and few actresses deserved it more.All things considered, it's still a pretty good movie, although frankly much of it is quite dated and doesn't hold up particularly well. But the spectacular dancing, the infectious and beautiful music (especially Maria) and the Romeo-and-Juliet story still work. Natalie Wood, who didn't belong in this movie at all, doesn't quite manage to sink it entirely, even though she comes close on occasion (There's a Place for Us comes across as a bad parody of the old Jeanette McDonald\/Nelson Eddy movies where they sing into each other's faces and is hysterical in its awfulness).
