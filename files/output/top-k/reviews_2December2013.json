Thomas Howell was actually fairly relevant at one point. He's still a solid actor, but he's stuck in a hell called the Straight to DVD world. The storyline is so ludicrous and contrived, that it becomes enjoyable. Let me make this perfectly clear. Make sure you kick your brain to the curb. That is a necessity in order for you to enjoy this movie. I managed to put my brain to sleep, and I had fun. You would never, EVER see a movie like this made today. A man posing as a black person is extremely offensive. But this was the 80's, and things weren't so prohibited then. In all honesty, I wish they did make stuff like this today. As a reviewer pointed out, if this was a black man portraying a white man, nobody would have carped about it as much. It never takes itself very seriously, until the finale when it goes the typical Pay for your mistake, learn from it, and get the girl route, but as clichéd as it is, I had a huge smile on my face. Thomas Howell is solid as the lead. His commitment is commendable, and I have to give him credit for taking on such a wacky part. Rae Dawn Chong is as cute as a button. Her overly serious character is a bit annoying at first, but once she opens up, she is fun, and has good chemistry with Howell. James Earl Jones is fantastic as a professor, and steals many scenes. Leslie Nielsen has a bit part, which is fairly unmemorable, while Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Pre- Seinfeld fame, obviously) is in this as well. If you decide to watch this, and plan on picking it apart, I really question your sanity. Why watch something like this, knowing how goofy it is? It's a fairly fun movie, filled with glorious 80's cheese.

It has a bit of Scarface going for it sans the over-the-top accents. But what this movie has in common from the aforementioned two is that the drugs and the profits are piling on and the humanity is rapidly materializing into one huge mess. From the luscious, warm sunny California sun, to the cold, hard clink of the prison walls, director the late Ted Demme follows the career of George Jung (Johnny Depp) as he becomes one of the leading distributors of cocaine in the United States. Depp took the role by force as Demme felt confident that he was the right man for the job.His journey was filled with excitement which at the cost came several obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. The more fame he got, the more we see Jung slowly deteriorate in a malignant human being. The most fascinating thing about this movie is the way that Jung lingers on to remain sympathetic especially through these very complex times. He makes poor decisions, he doesn't fully commit to his relationship with his daughter Kristina (Emma Roberts and Jamie King), has no use for his father Fred Jung (Ray Liotta who was the best performer here and the more likable character portrayal) and yet through all his flaws, we still care for this anti-hero. George's rise to demise can be very hard to watch at times and the heartbreaks can leave an after-effect on its audience. The narration from Depp isn't coming from Depp's mouth but from a perpetual observer, we see Jung in a different light, a light coming from a relatively bad person who's still finds time to care for him as we sit back in grief as we watch the foundation of his mind progressively crumble.His words of wisdom going from being the happiest man alive to being one of the most miserable can be all summed up to what this film's about. Here's a man at his wit's end coming from the worst luck in the world after living going through a hellish ride with poignant features to go with it. His pride and his ambition became his biggest liability which landed in him a 60 year jail sentence. The film is not presented in a cynical way saying that dreams and wishes lead to one's demise, far from that. It's telling us these things happen to all of us in some point in our lives and it demonstrates that just how vulnerable and frail we our as humans and how everyone is capable of causing pain and destruction to ourselves and to other people. It's telling us that George Jung was a jerk and now it caught on to him. However, even people who are not necessarily jerks have fell into dark or even darker holes that Jung has faced. It could happen to anyone who is not careful so all I'm saying is be careful in how you live your life and prevent all obstacles in your way.So instead of looking at George Jung as an evil druggie, Demme succeeds in making Mr. Jung into a very flawed individual who let fame get to his head oblivious as to what the costs that come with this unexpected rise to fame. During the closing sequences of Blow, I held my hand to my heart in sorrow. Here was a man who was once a father, a son, and we see everything taken away at him due to his dreams and careless abandon. And even as the movie ends, his spirit wanders on aimlessly and speaks more volumes than the movie itself and in the end his action have faded and his presence is darkened.

Even after the first forty minutes of the film, when Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock haven't really drummed up anything remarkable, the film still heavily emphasizes both characters' qualities and their prime differences rather than ground them into reality like the film should. We still must be reminded that Sandra Bullock is different and free-spirited and Ben Affleck is straight-laced and getting married, but we don't get any more involved in these characters' personalities or their particular relationship other than it (a) is predicated off of the tired opposites attract philosophy and (b) that it really shouldn't be happening.Because of this, Ben Affleck's Ben Holmes and Sandra Bullock's Sarah Lewis feel like bland caricatures and not identifiable people. This is an issue when you have two characters that accentuate simple personality traits and those simple traits are the only methods of which we can define these characters. One is different, the other is a straight-shooter; these are very basic terms to describe people we've just spent one-hundred and six minutes with.Regarding the plot - as if I really need to - Ben is getting married and is on a flight home to Savannah, Georgia to attend the wedding. His plane suffers a crash before taking off and now, with his fear of flying even larger than it once was, must find another way back to Savannah. He meets Sarah, who must arrive to Savannah as soon as she can as well. Ben and Sarah decide to take an alternate method home together, which only results in more cockamamie circumstances happening to them over time. Ben, of course, being the cleaned-up fellow he is, hates when things detour from his original plan or intention, but Sarah, in the meantime, doesn't fret over small things. She loves flying by the seat of her pants, which may explain the problems she faces now with a custody battle.Affleck and Bullock, at this current point in time, didn't really need to establish their credibility in films. Affleck had already done both Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting, two phenomenal films, with Sandra Bullock appearing in Speed, a fine example of a truly tense and exciting thriller. Both actors had experienced carrying their own portions in a film in some way, shape, or form, and on that note, you'd think that Affleck and Bullock would be able to concoct believable chemistry with one another. However, Marc Lawrence's writing doesn't leave much to be desired in terms of development in their chemistry.If there's a light in Forces of Nature's smothering sameness, it's the atypical direction Bronwen Hughes takes for conducting the romantic comedy. Hughes seems to have an appreciation for visuals, nature (maybe hinted in the titled?), and natural lighting, making Forces of Nature a surprising experience for the eyes. I recommend watching some portions of it on mute so you can appreciate the beautiful lighting and cinematography (done very nicely by Elliot Davis and David Stockton) and not the goofy dialog that Affleck and Bullock engage in.Starring Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"2 December 2013","score":"","review":" Erique Claudine (Claude Rains) is a violinist for the Paris opera who has fallen in love with a young soprano understudy named Christine Dubois (Susanna Foster). Unfortunately, he finds himself unable to tell her of his love so he uses all of his money to finance singing lessons for her. This continues for 3 years during which time he begins to have problems playing the violin and loses his job after 20 years with the opera. His one remedy is to publish a concerto he had been working on for 2 years. However, following a misunderstanding at the publishing house he kills the publisher and has acid thrown on his face in the process. Now hunted by the police, he secretly escapes into the opera house which has thousands of rooms and hidden passages all over the place. But even after all of this he still harbors an insane love for Christine and is determined to have her assume the leading role by any means at his disposal. As luck would have it though there are two other people who also love Christine. The first is the leading baritone, Anatole Garron (Nelson Eddy) and the other is a police detective named Raoul D'Aubert (Edgar Barrier). Although both are rivals for her affection they share a desire to apprehend this mysterious phantom and protect Christine at all cost. Anyway, without divulging any more of the story I will just say that this movie wasn't exactly what I expected in that the horror was superseded by the musical numbers and the extravagant sets and costumes. That being the case it was almost like watching an opera within a movie. Now, I certainly didn't mind watching this film because it was plain to see that a lot of time and effort went into this production and it was quite enjoyable. But I would have preferred to see a bit more Phantom and a little less opera just the same. In any case, I found this movie to be above average and I recommend it to those who might enjoy something of this nature.
