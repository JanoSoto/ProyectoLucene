I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent). It was easy to cheer for this gang of misfits back then. The surprising this is, I always find myself tuning in to catch it whenever it appears on TV. It remains a surprisingly accurate portrait of young ball players, snobby league officials and overbearing parents. Walter Matthau is Buttermaker, the coach assigned to lead this motley crew of talentless kids. Their fortunes change somewhat when Matthau convinces the daughter of an old girlfriend (Tatum O'Neal, just coming off a shocking Oscar win for Paper Moon) to pitch for the team. Buttermaker taught her to throw a mean curveball prior to divorcing her mother. The Bears go from losers to winners when the local juvenile delinquent, Kelly Leak, joins the team. He's a virtual one-man team, swatting home-runs and catching everything in sight. The Bears end up going all the way to the championship game against the hated Yankees. The cast is excellent. Matthau is completely believable as a washed-up ex pro ball player who drinks too much. O'Neal is convincing as the star hurler, and Jackie Earl Haley (Breaking Away) makes a strong impression as Leak. Ironically, this is one of the few movies where Haley is one of the bigger kids. In later roles, he would always be the short guy in the group. Vic Morrow is perfectly smug as the Yankees coach who can't stand to see the Bears succeed. It sets up a classic battle in the championship game. The Bad News Bears was the forerunner, of sorts, of The Mighty Ducks. The main difference is that The Bad News Bears gets the baseball details right, whereas few American films have portrayed hockey in a realistic way. I still cringe at the thought of Youngblood. It also set the stage for two vastly inferior sequels (without Matthau or O'Neal). No, The Bad News Bears is a cut above most sports films because it helps you understand what it's like to compete at that age. It also makes great use of music from Bizet's Carmen. After seeing this film, you'll immediately think of the Bears when you hear the March of the Torreodors.

I can't seem to get enough of this movie. Everyone in its great, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Neve Campbell, the girl who plays her roommate, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jerry O'Connel (Stand By Me), Sarah Michelle Gellar, and everyone else in this movie make this scary and often witty movie better than Scream. 10 reasons it was better than Scream 10. More suspenseful 9. More Deaths 8. Better Scenery 7. Neve and Courtney looked better 6. Sarah Michelle Gellar 5. Better Ending 4. Better Killers 3. Better Beginning 2. More and Better plot 1. STU WASN'T IN IT HE WAS HORRIBLE IN THE FIRST I COULD NOT STAND HIM, HE WASN'T FUNNY AND HE ANNOYED ME!!!. RANDY WAS MUCH BETTER!! I give Scream 2 a 10\/10! It's great. I give Scream 9\/10 it's good but Scream 2 is better.

This is the ultimate insult to all filmmgoers.  They wanted me to pay money for this? (thankfully my roommate payed for the rental).  Some movies out there are in the so-bad-they're-good category (the Evil Dead movies), this fits in to the Just-flat-out-s**** category.  The special effects weren't even that great!  Sure they were animated with good results, but they just look bad! The baby rampage in Madison Square Garden (aside from being boring and totally pointless) was one of the most unrealistic CGI sequences I've ever seen, even in the dark. (Jurassic Park looked better five years ago in the light).  I genuinely hope Roland and Dean learn something from this waste of talent (I could be financially secure for a long time with this movie's budget) and will finally pull their heads out of their hindquarters.  Step one would be to find some screenwriters that have at least half a brain.  I wonder what the reaction will be to their next project.By the way, to anybody who thinks this movie has a great script and good acting...... I can find a nice hospital for you.
