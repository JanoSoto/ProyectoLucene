Once the movie started I was into it very quickly. (This part contains Spoilers) In the beginning, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie that is made by their idols, Terrence and Philip. The film is a little bit more than just a lot of foul language. After the kids see it, they start swearing all the time and tell their friends about it. Soon, a lot of kids in the country see it and also start swearing. The parents become very concerned about this. One day Kenny does something similar to what happens in the movie and ends up getting killed. The kid's Moms decide to start a war against Canada and execute Terrence and Philip. If I told you the rest, it would ruin the fun of the movie.This movie is a musical with some very clever and hilarious musical numbers, one of which was nominated for an academy award. The storyline is very clever, looking at how much came out of such a simple idea. At the same time this movie does have some good points that were brought up, such as how people think media makes kids to do things, and about freedom of speech. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it is definitely a clever movie with some huge laughs and good messages.

Now that I am grown up I have owned Them on both VHS and eventually DVD. I enjoy this movie. It is not only entertaining and very done science fiction, it is fun. I feel bad for movies like Them, The Thing, War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet and the Day the Earth Stood Still, because ever since Star wars, it's as if they have been relegated to second class status, when they should in fact be right up there with those movies.

I really like going there because the changing rooms don't have doors on them and I sometimes wander in and pretend to be from the Ukraine. Of course I'd only wander into the ladies changing room and stay there pretending to be confused until some of the staff came and led me out. Well, I used to do that. Last time I tried it there actually was a girl from the Ukraine, who I think used to be army special forces or something.Anyway, when I get discharged from hospital the doctors tell me to take it easy for a few days, until the swelling has gone down so I ask my mum to hire out a DVD from the shop for me. But rather than hiring out the film I told her to she decides to ask advice from the old guy Henry who works there. He's had something against me ever since Rufus got stuck down the back of the freezer and destroyed all that ice cream. So Henry being the 'expert' on films that he is tells mum to hire out 'Blade Runner' by Ridley Scott telling her that it's a 'classic'.Thanks mum! That's not insensitive after what I've been put through! All the horrible memories of the unprovoked attack and the police caution came flooding back when I saw the title of the film. Besides, how many times have I told her to not believe anything Henry says? Especially when he starts by saying The police came to the shop last night asking about your son&#133; In 'Blade Runner' Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a man who hunts down robots for a job. That sounds easy doesn't it? Well it's not because these 'replicants' look like people, and he has to use an old projector or something to read their minds, somehow. It seems to take AGES so why not do this instead Rick Deckard Hi. How are you? Would you like a drink of water? Replicant No thanks, I'm not thirsty. Rick Deckard That's right! Only humans can get thirsty! Die robot!! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! That's much easier than some stupid test and he could kill far more robots that way. His boss would be really pleased I'm sure. I mean, if Rick Deckard sold cars and in one day he sold seven, but there were only four in the shop his boss would be really pleased, just like if there were only four replicants on the loose and Deckard managed to kill eleven.And whilst we're on the subject of robots looking like people, wouldn't it be easier to make them look a little different? Couldn't they, I dunno, look like George Hamilton or something? That way there'd be no need for the test I just made up and anyone who looked like George Hamilton would be shot. Obviously George Hamilton would have to have plastic surgery to look like someone else, maybe George Lucas. That way when people shouted Hey George! he'd know that they were talking to him and look round. If he looked like Bob Hoskins and people shouted Hey Bob! he might get confused.Also, if I brought a robot and it only worked for four years I'd be pretty annoyed. I'll bet they have a program in the future like Watchdog over here in the UK. They'd soon have Tyrell on there going on and on about how he was selling robots that only worked for 4 years. If they had him on 'Watchdog' I bet Nicky Campbell would make insulting comments about Tyrell's glasses because they are kind of stupid looking. Surely though another company would make robots that worked for 10 years or something, or until their hair went out of fashion, and then beat the Tyrell Corporation at their own game. And what's with the whole more human than human thing anyway? That's a moronic motto. How about sexy robots that put out? That'd be a better motto, or maybe Tyrell don't smell, are bots are hot and we make 'em like George whether you like it or not! That's decent marketing and in the form of a rap as well to appeal to kids and gangsta's.After watching this film I can't wait for the future, but I don't think it's a classic, not like the excellent 'Battlefield Earth' or a film I wrote last night. There should have been more emphasis on what pleasure robots like Daryl Hannah get up to and maybe some steamy scenes in a women's changing room.

He actually bought it for me for my 15th birthday, telling me that he thought it should be shown at schools as anti-drugs education. Now, after several viewings, I believe he was wrong; not about the undeniable quality of the film, but over the idea that it was anti-drugs.More on that later. The film itself is a powerful piece of work, a recipe of equal parts comedy, tragedy and plain disgusting. The director Danny Boyle leaves his mark all over this film; bright colours stand out in an otherwise bleak landscape. The soundtrack is perhaps one of the best compilations ever assembled, tracks such as Born Slippy and Perfect Day in particular. But what perhaps makes these tracks all the more powerful is the incredible editing. Editors often do not get the recognition they deserve, in Trainspotting this has never been more obvious. At the start, when he gets his first hit while he gets knocked down in the football match is fantastic, just one example of an amazing performance from the unsung member of the cast.And a very good cast it is too. No one stands out as a dud, even Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) as Mikey Forrester. Robert Carlyle is at his psychotic best, Jonny Lee Miller debuts as Sick Boy and Ewan McGregor is fantastic, playing the part of Renton to perfection.Back to my dad. Kinda. Trainspotting is most definitely not an anti-drugs film. it throws you in a very personal situation with Renton, without making judgements on the drug use. Of course it shows the terrible effects of a drug addiction, the baby dies, Tommy dies; and yet he openly admits just how good the hit is. We end the film with Renton out of the addiction, without the same scars that we see in a more moralistic, more graphic without being as emotionally affecting, film such as Requiem for a Dream. (which somehow finds itself in the top 60, although thankfully not in the top 50!)

The film itself is a powerful piece of work, a recipe of equal parts comedy, tragedy and plain disgusting. The director Danny Boyle leaves his mark all over this film; bright colours stand out in an otherwise bleak landscape. The soundtrack is perhaps one of the best compilations ever assembled, tracks such as Born Slippy and Perfect Day in particular. But what perhaps makes these tracks all the more powerful is the incredible editing. Editors often do not get the recognition they deserve, in Trainspotting this has never been more obvious. At the start, when he gets his first hit while he gets knocked down in the football match is fantastic, just one example of an amazing performance from the unsung member of the cast.And a very good cast it is too. No one stands out as a dud, even Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) as Mikey Forrester. Robert Carlyle is at his psychotic best, Jonny Lee Miller debuts as Sick Boy and Ewan McGregor is fantastic, playing the part of Renton to perfection.Back to my dad. Kinda. Trainspotting is most definitely not an anti-drugs film. it throws you in a very personal situation with Renton, without making judgements on the drug use. Of course it shows the terrible effects of a drug addiction, the baby dies, Tommy dies; and yet he openly admits just how good the hit is. We end the film with Renton out of the addiction, without the same scars that we see in a more moralistic, more graphic without being as emotionally affecting, film such as Requiem for a Dream.

While I have read some reviews that claim that this is one of Lawrence's more creative roles yet, I can only laugh and gag simultaneously at these words. Lawrence was a major contributor to the downfall of this film. He provided no character analysis, no development, and definitely no humor to the entire story. It was as if we were watching a dress rehearsal in progress before the final script arrived with all of Lawrence's funny bits. From the quick introduction at the beginning of the film (a mere 7 minutes of character introduction), until the incoherent ending that was trying to monopolize on the popularity of Gladiator, we never see Lawrence's character of Jamal or Skywalker (depending on the care of the actors) emerge from the film. This was merely Martin Lawrence cashing in on his already overplayed self, stretching no further than his comfortable limits and never exerting anything fresh. He has fallen into the cracks of the Hollywood recycling bin and Black Knight reinforces that idea.Sadly, Lawrence isn't backed up with any better acting or story. Tom Wilkinson has done some amazing films during his career, but apparently was looking to buy a new car with this film. It required no real acting from him, just sloppy drunkenness with clichéd moments near the end that could have been pulled from any other film like this one. I think that was my major problem with this film (beside the lackluster Lawrence) was the story. There wasn't any. It felt like we were forced from the beginning to all of our different places and events just to fill time. There wasn't any redeeming value from the story. In fact, I would go so far as to say that whomever wrote this screenplay may have&#133;gasp&#133;plagiarized from nearly every other film like this one out there. The structure was nothing new, the formula literally had dust on it, and nobody seemed to care. Lawrence obviously didn't from the performance that he gave, but I expected more from Mr. Wilkinson who has impressed me in the past. This was not the best showcase for his talent, or for anyone's talent to say the least. We must always remember that it begins with a story, and if it doesn't sound good on paper than it isn't going to translate well onto the screen. This is a rule to live by for everyone involved with the Black Knight debacle.Finally, I normally don't mention this in my reviews, but with this film it just stood out more than any other that I have seen, but the production of this film was horrible. The costumes, the sets, and even the way the shots were framed seemed cheap in so many ways. The costumes are the first that come to mind because Lawrence always seemed like he was wearing something that was made with haste. How could he have quickly made this garment in the time that he was in this land? Who knows, but it was cheap and only lowered this film further into the muck pit. If the story is going to be bad, and the actors are not going to give their full potential by actually doing what they are paid &#133; to be creative &#133; than at least give us something to look at Production Team! Unfortunately, there was nothing ravishing to even glance at. The entire Medieval World that Lawrence works at from the beginning is cheap and obviously a set. I want a film to take me away from Hollywood and give me my dollar's worth, not rob me blind. The cinematography was done by a two-year old. Nothing spectacular, nothing worth writing about.Overall, this was a very poor film. Would it have hurt anyone working on this project to use a little something I like to call imagination? Creativity was not being used or welcomed in this film. You could tell that the director wanted to make the film, edit out what didn't work, finish, and relax at home while thinking of all the different ways that he could spend his Hollywood money! I blame two major players in this film for the overall poor quality. The first is Mr. Lawrence. If he does not expand his acting potential and bring something new to the screen, I don't think his Hollywood stay will be very long.

Gene Wilder was awesome as Wonka, and the original movie is a kids classic. Now there is a new movie coming out directed by Tim Burton. He makes such interesting movies and is a creative director, but I wonder why he couldn't have moved forward with one of the other Wonka stories. Certainly Johnny Depp is an odd enough and versatile actor to play the recluse of Wonka, but would have much preferred they left Charlie & The Chocolate Factory for Wilder and let Depp play Wonka on The Great Glass Elevator.

Yet, without a doubt the fact remains that this movie, on many levels is extraordinary.(not OK or good-extraordinary.) I Personally am very surprised there aren't a lot more comments on here about Baker Boys.Obviously, Michelle as well as the Bridges brothers were fantastic. But most have said that so I won't get into that to much. I was very impressed(and a bit awed) by this screenplay and how incredible, not just the dialogue was, but the mannerisms, the little back and Fourths and quirks of each person-the writing was way above merely being good. Beyond admiration, however, I was touched by the writer's ability to capture the world of entertainment and music so perfectly. This is a movie where, (after Suzy, frank and Jack), the music and world these people live in, becomes the fourth main character of the movie. And anyone who has lived in a similar reality at anytime in their life, will feel like their seeing old friends....My viewing experience was not perhaps the most fun I've ever had, for two simple reasons. One, because I, like many others, will concede this movie moves extremely slowly and unfortunately slow movingness in a movie is one thing that's always been a problem for me. Second, this movie is draped in nostalgia and made me feel more sad then anything else when it was over. The gloom I felt however, was also coupled with knowing I just watched a really well done movie-so it was gloom mixed with admiration, sort of like listening to Pink Floyd.It takes time to get into Baker Boys, it's a slow burn not an immediate rush. It is one of the most nostalgic pictures I've ever Seen. People have mentioned 70's, 80's I'd say those periods and even earlier. There's an old style glamor coupled with a bittersweet sleepy nostalgia-and anyone who has experienced the stuff of nighttime, and neon lights, will be back in that place again whether they want to be there or not.

This is the quintessential British comedy, superior in my view to its apparent successor 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', and a beacon of excellence in a sea of turgid, uninspired offerings from film-makers of a similar era. I have always found John Cleese to be Britain's finest comedian of the past 50 years and while I'm enticed to use this space as a simple eulogy to his genius, it is important to note that Wanda is far from a one man show. That said, if Cleese is to be remembered for anything other than his magnum opus Fawlty Towers, Wanda would be a fitting touchstone.Director Charles Crichton (a veteran of several 1950s Ealing comedies such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob') assembled a truly fantastic cast Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis add trans-Atlantic flair to the proceedings, with Kline particularly brilliant as the psychotic Otto, a hit-man with a penchant for seafood.... Although it's fair to say that the best lines are distributed equally among the cast, Kline bags more than an ample share, and has proved to be one of the more quotable comedic characters of recent times (I'm, uh, Harvey. Manfred... jen... sen... den). Jamie Lee Curtis is not quite as convincing as the conniving Wanda, yet more than holds her own while her colleagues produce their finest work (indeed, Kline was awarded an Oscar for his performance). There is excellent support from British actors Maria Aitkin and Tom Georgeson, and of course the wonderful Michael Palin as stuttering Ken, the animal lover.The writing from Cleese is often unnervingly sharp every single sentence seems to be laced with aesthetic value, and this is a fine achievement considering the film runs for nearly two hours. The farcical scenes (such as Cleese's attempt to hide his affair with Wanda from his wife) are achingly funny, exploiting both Cleese's inimitable brand of physical humour and the frequent juxtapositioning of the attitudes of British and American people towards romance, sex and relationships at large.I love the film. As an ardent 'Towers' fan, this humour is tailor-made for my tastes. While the plot is sometimes a little TOO convoluted for perhaps its own good (a little bit of indulgence from Cleese no doubt), this is still film-making of the highest calibre and remains my favourite comedy to date.

The story is incredible, but after the death of the cop, you can see the plot falling into an emotional abyss that takes everyone down with it. The horrific ending sticks with me and I don't think I will ever forget this movie.

Bjork is a very good actress, as well as talented with her chords. Cant give it a 10 for the following reasons seems like there could have been another ending here, another choice for Selma to make--realistically speaking. The choreography was a bit rough (for a musical) and the male singers were not as talented as the singers on the CD. While I am left in tears by the emotion of the movie, is this what I want in a film? Was the aim to shock us and make us mad? Why am I mad? Why did it have to end this way? I look for understanding of the material as well as entertainment in the plot, when I see a movie; this movie delivered a better appreciation for Bjork (who I knew nothing about, until I heard the Selmasongs--I love Orchestrated Songs), but thats it. While I am not for Hollywood endings, this ending is overly disturbing, and may have been better served with a Hollywood finish.

Sadly, only the middle of the three was a viable option (I'm at work early tomorrow) and so I settled for the only film that finished at a sensible time Metro. And even though it was an Eddie Murphy vehicle from the Nineties, I enjoyed it far more than I should have.Metro has an extremely basic story at it's centre hostage negotiator Scott Roper (Murphy) incurs the wrath of jewel thief Michael Korda (Michael Wincott) who then proceeds to pursue Roper and his girlfriend (Carmen Ejogo) with murderous intent. Throw in a clichéd car chase (well, it is set in San Fransisco) and a typically climatic face-off at the end and it's plain to see that Metro does nothing new for the action cop movie - something you'd expect Murphy to do, given that he plays action-cop-extraordinaire Axel Foley in the Beverly Hills Cop series. In truth, it's difficult to decide whether this is a good movie badly done or a terrible movie well made.I've made my mind up it's an average movie. Despite flashes of goodness, Metro wallows in stereotype and imitates every action movie gone before. The baddie who just keeps coming back, the attack on Murphy's girlfriend, the loser cop who comes good in the end. We've all seen these done to death and I, for one, have no desire to see them again. I admit, it was a brave decision casting Murphy as the lead. Many, including myself, thought he was finished when the Eighties did (at least, until Shrek came along) and he does look like a fat Snoop Dogg in this, which doesn't help. The other brave decision was making the romantic lead English, which doesn't happen every day.Other than that, this is strictly by-the-numbers. Why does every action film in San Fransisco feature a runaway tram? Why does it always rain when things don't go right for loser-cop hero, especially when their partner and best buddy gets taken down? Why does every car in San Fransisco fly instead of drive? I could go on but it's late and I'm tired. Plus, my typing is keeping my flatmate up. Basically, Metro is a good enough film but never threatens to get above OK. No ambition and little enthusiasm and it shows.
