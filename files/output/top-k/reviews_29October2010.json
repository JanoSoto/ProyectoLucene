[{"date":"29 October 2010","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Lake Placid (1999) ** 1\/2 (out of 4)A thirty-foot croc takes a large bite out of a diver so a fish warden (Bill Pullman), a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), a sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) and a millionaire croc expert (Oliver Platt) decide to try and figure out where it came from and what it's doing in this small lake in Maine. Soon more and more people are eaten but they think that the large creature could be due to an elderly woman (Betty White) who lives on the lake. LAKE PLACID, the title, is still somewhat of a mystery considering where the film is taking place and what the lake is actually called but that's not too big of a point as the overall film is fairly fun and does improve on a second viewing. I think the film's biggest flaw is that it's incredibly uneven. I've heard rumors that originally this was meant to be some sort of spoof, which makes a little sense considering the type of humor in the film. The movie goes for a lot more laughs and most of them come from Gleeson and Platt who are constantly at each others throats. The two actors are both very good in their roles and I must admit that I laughed at a lot of their banter. This humor expands to other characters including the one played by Fonda as she goes way over the top in order to get laughs. We have her New York City gal going through all sorts of country jokes as she's afraid to get dirty, to sleep in a tent and that type of thing. For me Fonda's character is the weakest written and she also goes too far out there. Pullman is good as usual but his character isn't all that interesting. The comedy in the film is certainly the main goal, or at least it seems that way. There aren't any real scares to be found in the film and I can't think of too many examples where there was even an attempt. The croc in the film looks pretty good and especially when you compare it to other large croc movies. I thought the effects of it taking were also pretty good, although I'll admit that the scene where it attacks the bear isn't all that effective. LAKE PLACID, in the end, is too uneven to really call a good movie but if you can put up with the comic stuff you'll probably enjoy up enjoying it as a B movie.
