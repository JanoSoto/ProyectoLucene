Pity, that is why 9\/11 happened, because no one believed that the fear could intrude in his life and did NOTHING to prevent it, NOTHING to prevent power been held by evil people and when the evil intruded the US was too late.

He and his Patlabor alumni take the Gibson-esque cyberpunk aspects of the setting they enjoyed most, ditching the humor and much of the character of the graphic novel. Interestingly, Shirow's first experimentation with digital media was mirrored by that of the film's production, which utilized what were at that time revolutionary digital visual effects. The result is a stark, more realistic vision of the future than that presented by Shirow, but one still over-run by problems emerging from society's new interconnectedness with technology.What could be called the internet 3.0 is ubiquitous. The main character, Major Motoko Kusanagi of Public Security Section 9, is a cyborg who's body is on loan from the government. She connects to the network through wires in her spinal cord, accessing information directly with her consciousness &#x96; her ghost. Like a computer program, ghosts can be hacked turning otherwise normal or modified humans into walking puppets. Simulated experiences - implanted false memories for example &#x96; are used as a template to control whole patterns of behavior so a hacker need not take direct control. The story centers around the exploits of an enigmatic hacker pulling strings on a multinational scale known only as the Puppet Master who may or may not be human.GITS-001 The film made an impact when it was released, not unlike that of Akira when it hit the international film circuit. It's a difficult science fiction film of the sort Hollywood cannot make dense without explanation; and much too hard to follow for the average movie-goer. For those well-versed in cyberpunk lore there isn't anything too new or groundbreaking. It's the excellent art direction based on the gritty, overcrowded streets of Hong Kong and Kenji Kawai's haunting musical score that lifted this above the typical cyberpunk fare, putting to shame its contemporaries like Johnny Mnemonic. It so redefined the cyberpunk aesthetic that many consider it the primary source of inspiration for the Wachowski Brother's sci-fi blockbuster The Matrix (an assertion with which I'm inclined to agree).There can be no question that Ghost in the Shell is an important film, a kind of spiritual successor to Blade Runner, which thankfully stands apart from Shirow's graphic novel. The two are quite different, and can be enjoyed for their own quirks and qualities. Unfortunately, there is a GITS 2.0 (renewal) version of the film made to take advantage of advances in CGI. Scenes from the original have been altered or outright replaced with computer graphics. As a fan of the original film, I see this renewal as completely unnecessary.

The main focus for this film was the development of the characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter could not have been better casted; he not only did a phenomenal job but also made the character come to life. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who played Ron and Hermione were also wonderful throughout the whole film. The other characters such as Dumbledore, Hagrid, and McGonagall may play smaller parts however they are no less impressive. Along with the characters, this film also introduces Hogwarts, which was an unbelievable creation. The journey for the three children into Hogwarts and into each other's lives was very well done.I feel an element which adds a lot of character to the film is its use of lighting. The scenes inside of Hogwarts are lit by candlelight, torches, and oil lamps which gives them a very old world ambiance. Although the scenes were darker, this use of lighting allows the audience a truer look into how Hogwarts would have been.Once everyone is properly introduced to the audience, the plot shifts from character development to the story of Harry's, Hermione's, and Ron's search for the Sorcerer's Stone. As the children explore Hogwarts and search for the truth it is important to see how the characters react to conflict and how it continually builds the storyline. This is also important due to the fact that it is the first movie in the series and is setting the groundwork for those that follow. The next movie in the series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, followed in the footsteps of its predecessor. It continues to develop the characters and helps to form an even deeper emotional attachment between them and the audience. The theme continues not only throughout the first film but all of those that follow. This made these films almost an addiction to the viewers, everyone who watches has a genuine concern for all of the characters and a curiosity about what will happen next. The unifying central concerns for this film were both characters and plot; both of these were equally important for the film as a whole. Together they created one of the most acclaimed family films of our time.
