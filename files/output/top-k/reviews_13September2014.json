[{"date":"13 September 2014","score":"","review":" Okay, so I am not exactly breaking the rules in talking about the Fight Club. If you're reading this, you've seen it so there is no point in keeping silent. After seeing this again last night, I decided to share my views on it. As evidence shows on the Top 250 list... Fight Club is one of the greatest films of all time. First, let's talk about the cast Edward Norton was a great choice, we can see that he has had to loose the beef from his previous credit, American History X, but this gave it an, almost, realistic approach to the film. He wasn't quite how the character is described in the book, but we can let that off, he still looked pretty fantastic, even in the insomniac look. Brad Pitt was an almost perfect casting, he was no longer a pretty boy who couldn't act. He was a great god on the screen, he fitted the role and, in my eyes, portrayed Tyler almost perfectly. We all know that H,B-C was a good cast, she's nearly crazier than Tim Burton... Which fits the role.Now we can move onto the Film vs Book argument. Obviously they have to change certain parts of the book to make it fit into a 100-150 minute film, otherwise they'd do what happened to The Hobbit. The ends of both the film and the novel differ drastically. In the novel, the Narrator does shoot himself through the cheek, just as Jack does in the film. What happens next in both stories is quite different. In the film, Jack is reunited with Marla and they watch the buildings disappear from the skyline. In the book, the Narrator shoots himself but then wakes up in what he believes is Heaven, however it is described that Jack is actually in a mental institution. The Narrator believes his psychiatrist to be God. Now, that is the biggest difference made, yes there are other big changes, yes there are story changing tweaks, but I did this one because it is a stand out difference. In my opinion, I am not too bothered by the change, it makes it more applicable to a film. It brings us into suspense as we try to figure out what happens after Does the building blow up? Does Jack die by Marla's side? As the transition to the credits appear, it is obvious, though that is only a flash, it may be a reference to one of Tyler's jobs. Feel free to respond and counteract. This is my first review. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 2014","score":"","review":" Okay, so I am not exactly breaking the rules in talking about the Fight Club.
