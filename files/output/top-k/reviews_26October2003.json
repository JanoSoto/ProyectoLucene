Sure, John Woo has made movies much more action-packed than this, but Carpenter's unique and potent blend of interesting characters, good screenwriting, and an excellent soundtrack has had me as a follower in its cult ever since the first time I saw it years ago. In fact, I believe this overshadows Halloween in not just content, but also in overall quality. (I, for one, see Halloween as one of the most overrated films of all time.) The plot A vicious street gang (with the wonderfully campy and dated moniker Street Thunder) have acquired automatic weapons. They're holding the city in a grip of fear. When they kill one guy's little girl while she's standing at the ice cream truck, the father tracks down the culprit and offs him promptly. Daddy (now in a very deep state of shock) stumbles into a police station for help). This particular police station has recently been closed down, but still, Austin Stoker and some others are hired to hold down the fort until the fate of the establishment is officially sealed. (A very memorable line that gives food for thought occurs when rookie cop Stoker semi-seriously says that he wants to become a hero on the first night of the job, and then is met with not much other than a robotic voice on his radio that states simply, There are no heroes anymore, just men who follow orders.) Pretty soon, when the father does make it to the soon-to-be abandoned titular precinct (even though it's actually precinct 6, DIVISION 13), hundreds of Street Thunder guys have followed him there. With the help of two hard-as-hell convicts, Stoker and a couple of secretaries are forced to wage a violent war with the gang, who won't stop until all inside the building are dead. Darwin Joston (who was in Eraserhead!) gives a stand-out performance as the sardonic antihero convict Napolean Wilson, my personal favorite character, who is all scathing sarcasm and really likes what he does when he gets a chance to clean up a lot of thrill-killing street punks. Action fans, attention If you have not seen this classic of shoot-'em-up violence (made all the more unique by the fact that, amid all of the multiracial characters, not even a split-second is dedicated to any type of martyr-like racial commentary and goes balls-to-the-wall with its no-nonsense action thrills), make it your first priority NOW!

Gregory Peck, for whom the screening was a special tribute to him after his recent death, is sneakily charming and provides good balance of performance to Hepburn's scene-stealing mannerisms. Eddie Albert also provides an excellent supporting performance as the photographer Peck assigns to take photos of Hepburn as the unknowing princess.What makes the film stand out is the fact that although the audience is well aware of the real identities of Peck and Hepburn, the two principal actors walk a masterful line of near-farce, culminating in a splendid fight on a dance barge with Secret Service agents assigned to protect her, when she is recognized later in the film.As a newcomer to this film, I have to say that had I been a young man at the time of it's release, I would have developed a tremendous crush on Hepburn in the same way I did with more recent alumni as Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts and Jessica Lange.A delightful discovery of old-time cinema.

The couple are portrayed by Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine; the tenant is Michael Keaton, who was in between his Batman movies at the time. Keaton slithers his way into the apartment without a lease or paying a deposit, ...yeah right! People that have the kind of money to buy a $750,000 building aren't that dumb. It would probably take, in most cases, over $100,000 for a down payment. Yet this movie would have us believe that people would just allow anyone to waltz into an apartment without being checked out. The script leaves a lot of things unexplained like this. We're supposed to believe it's because the couple are so desperate for money to meet the mortgage that they'd allow someone in that flashes cash like that. OK, but then Keaton violates any number of landlord\/tenant laws almost immediately. It should never take 6, 8, or 9 months to get rid of a tenant as the movie implies; because, it would most likely bankrupt any new owner. California must be the dumbest state in the country if that's the way it is there. In Wisconsin, you could throw someone out in about two months tops, worst case scenario. Also, a landlord has a right to enter the premises for any reason with a 24 hour notice to a tenant over here, which Modine attempted to do more than once. As a result, the varying degrees of law around the country would affect how viewers perceive this movie, alternating from suspenseful (as was the intent) to preposterous to downright bizarre. For me, it was just disbelief. The Modine character was a way over-the-top nut-ball himself, which is necessary for the viewer to believe that the Keaton character could get away with this for so long. Griffith redeems a small portion of the script in the last half hour, as she attempts to play detective. Keaton is the best thing in the movie, as he plays this whack-o to the hilt. You thoroughly detest him long before the end of the movie. The ending seems very tame though, considering all that's gone on before. Beverly D'Angelo has a small uncredited role, and Tippi Hedren has a bit in the last half hour too. There are just too many unexplained things in this movie for it to work, such as the landlord\/tenant laws problem mentioned above. In addition, what was the point of the male character that answered Keaton's door a number of times, only to leave and never be heard from again later in the movie? Why would Modine remain clam and collected when he just happens to discover Keaton's game, but then rage out of control at the mere sight of Keaton? The movie never uses the San Francisco location to good effect either. Wanting Keaton stopped is the only reason to continue watching this movie. You don't really care about the couple or too much else. It would be interesting to see this on a double bill with Peter Weir's The Plumber. ** of 4 stars.

Sean Connery is his Scottish partner, a hard-nosed fellow with an attractive daughter (played by Meg Ryan) who takes a liking to Harmon (by matter of script cliches). They hit it off much to the chagrin of her father, who continues to be paired with the young American. They end up in the usual car chases and on-foot pursuits.Action purses around just about every corner. There's a chase where Harmon is leaping over the hoods of cars and Sean Connery is dragging behind, looking very much out of breath and tired.

Connery tries hard to fight against the material, but Harmon is the film's primary flaw--he's like Kevin Costner on sleeping medication. Meg Ryan is the typical sweet Girl Next Door love interest, but she would display much more acting skills in the next year's When Harry Met Sally with Billy Crystal.The script leaps all logic.

Sean Connery has the Straight Man role that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover and Nick Nolte have all played before. Which leaves room for the Comic Loose Man. But Harmon isn't a comical guy, and he isn't as loose as he is just plain ignorant. This is a poor example of buddies.The movie was directed by Peter Hyams, who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film.

This is a poor example of buddies.The movie was directed by Peter Hyams, who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film. This movie suffers from lack of pace and lack of solid direction--one of its biggest flaws apart from casting decisions. Not only that, but the writer, Larry Ferguson, needs to take some lessons in how to cross the boundaries of a regular script and breathe into his characters life. There's a difference between written characters and typed characters. His are in the latter category.The movie is 97 minutes long and it feels two times longer. I recently saw a buddy flick called Hollywood Homicide with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett. Even that film was better than this--and Hollywood is making my list of the worst films of 2003. Only really big fans of Sean Connery should venture near this. And the fans of Mark Harmon should all be taken out to a field and shot.1\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":"Action, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"26 October 2003","score":"39 out of 44 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Woman In The Dunes' is a superb film adaptation of a fascinating novel by Kobo Abe.

Despite two horrific World Wars, mankind has still not learnt from his previous mistakes. World War 2's central catalyst was Adolf Hitler's self belief that the Germans were a superior race. It was his refusal to accept or respect the nature of other cultures that, in theory, led to his attempt to create a global German Empire. An attempt which caused the deaths of millions of men. In this age of knowledge and cultural understanding, man should have learnt to diminish the notion of the 'white man's burden', a term invented during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century. In order to create a world of cultural appreciation and respect, propaganda must stop in inferiorating the world by continuously illustrating the apparent 'greatness' of one nation. This is a concept that is clearly not understood by the producers of expensive Hollywood films.'Pearl Harbor' is a pathetic attempt to create sympathy towards the tragic event that began the war for control over the Pacific. Where do I begin? The story is simple. Affleck, a pilot based in Peal Harbor meets and falls in love with nurse Becksingale. He then joins the British RAF and has to leave Pearl Harbor. He asks his best friend Hartnett to watch over his girl. Affleck's plane is then shot down and he is assumed dead. After 3 months, Hartnett and Becksingale fall in love, and despite their gut emotions telling them that their relationship is morally wrong, they go ahead with it, yet to their disbelief Affleck's character returns. In the midst of all this emotional chaos, the Japanese attack and destroy Pearl Harbor. The film then goes on to deal with the love triangle as well as the United States' desperate attempt to regain a minor feeling of their supremacy and immense power over any other nation.'Pearl Harbor' has re-used the genre hybrid remarkably seen in 'Titanic'. The combination of a love story within a disaster was an outstanding formula in James Cameron's 'Titanic' that created one of the greatest love stories seen in cinema. 'Pearl Harbor' has jokingly taken the formula a step further by adding a love triangle to the equation; a move that appeared to be a very bad choice. Whether it was the poor acting or the terrible screenplay, the audience gain absolutely no emotional understanding or attachment to any of the characters. The love between Affleck and Becksingale does not grasp the viewer; their relationship is not poetic and attracts no warmth. Neither does the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett. Their best friend status is poorly reinforced and there is no sense of reality amongst it. This grows even worse when Hartnett falls for Becksingale, which makes him almost despised, especially when the film predictably hints Affleck's return by portraying an emotionless response to his apparent death. The weak bonds between the characters causes a lack of concern for them when disaster strikes. There is no grudge or sympathy.Contrary to the poor dimensionalization of the characters, the action is outstanding and maintains Michael Bay's well reputed ability to create perfect images of disaster scenes, i.e. Armageddon. The Japanese attack is amazingly shot, and detailed to perfection. The camera angles are beautifully positioned to provide a realistic sense of the attack. The horror and fear within all the characters is about the only emotional aspect they seem to show believably.With the poor start to this film leading on to an outstandingly impressive display of the Japanese attack, one would only assume it would get better. However, the viewer is terribly let down with a change in plot, that whether or not was historically accurate, was quite simply not necessary. It provides no balance for this story and almost seems pretty careless and stupid. I will restrict myself from detailing the events as I feel I would be wasting my time considering how out of context it was. For certain viewers, it may provide the need for a sense of self satisfaction, yet for the film to give itself some credit, the change in plot should have been avoided.The final insult of this picture is the closing message at the end celebrating the US's victory over Japan. To remind readers, the US's victory resulted in the use of mankind's deadliest invention, the atomic bomb, which was dropped on two different Japanese cities instantly burning hundreds of thousands of lives. This is an event that deserves to be dramatized just as much if not more than the attack on Pearl Harbor.All in all a poor film. Its attempt to become another 'Titanic' fails miserably. Despite the good action sequences, the plot is bad, the performances were not grasping, with the exception of Cuba Gooding Jnr's lovable character as the chef, and the overall quality of this film was not as high as expected from the director and producer in relation to their previous work.

Both of these can work together and form a terrific movie, or they can seperate and become their own. This one's in-between. It held my interest in certain areas, but yet also left me a bit disgruntled by the way it manipulates its audience. And there's a silly love story thrown in for good measure. That does it.Jude Law plays Vassili, a Russian sniper during World War II whose name may have been inspired by Vasoline gel as a funny in-joke. Vassili used to be a shepherd and learned how to aim a gun when he had to pick of wolves from a distance. There's a terrific opening sequence that reminded me of D-Day assault in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. But this battle goes on for too long and doesn't move like it should.After the mini-assault in the beginning of the film, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) is introduced as the political officer assigned to Vassili's unit. They take a liking to each other, but they both also take a liking to Vassili's neighbor, Tanya (Rachel Weisz). Tension builds between the two men as Ed Harris comes into this mess, playing Konig, a Bavarian man who is assigned to assassinate Vassili. He makes a remark that he will not find Vassili. He will let Vassili find him.Here starts a quite amazing story that could have been tremendous given a better touch and a better editing job. The movie isn't too long by the standards of most war films, but it certainly seems longer than most war films, and when you start to wonder why the faults of the movie start to hit you like a bag of bricks.There's an interesting and disturbing scene at one point when Russian soldiers are inside a demolished building. There's a big gaping crater at along the interior of the house, and the crater created a large hole in the wall overlooking the surroundings outside. Vassili does a leap of faith and makes it across unscathed. But the man who jumps next has his head blown apart mid-way across the crater. We then see Konig outside in a ditch, his sniper rifle smoking.Scenes like this make the movie rise out of mediocrity for a moment or two before it slips, like the dead man who tried to leap across the hole, into a crater. Perhaps this is the main fault of Enemy at the Gates--it tries too hard. Or perhaps too little. I liked the idea of a cat-and-mouse game set in World War II. But it isn't put to good use. The scenes that should come off terrifying, potent and paranoid come off simply as boring. There's a scene in the movie when Vassili is trapped behind an object with Konig right outside, his sights set on the boundaries of this object. Vassili makes a run for it, he's dead. He stays around long enough, and he's dead. But the paranoia of the scene never builds. My mind started to wander. That should never happen in a film like this.Jean-Jacques Annad (Seven Years in Tibet) knows how to evoke surroundings, but his characters are wholly unbelievable on the whole, and every time he is given good potential for a tense scene he seems to nod in the director's chair. The love story is reeking of the typical Hollywood treatment. Whereas a film such as Braveheart uses its tender love story to a definite advantage in regards to the story, the love story in Enemy at the Gates does little but tarnish the film's remaining image.

They take a liking to each other, but they both also take a liking to Vassili's neighbor, Tanya (Rachel Weisz). Tension builds between the two men as Ed Harris comes into this mess, playing Konig, a Bavarian man who is assigned to assassinate Vassili. He makes a remark that he will not find Vassili. He will let Vassili find him.Here starts a quite amazing story that could have been tremendous given a better touch and a better editing job. The movie isn't too long by the standards of most war films, but it certainly seems longer than most war films, and when you start to wonder why the faults of the movie start to hit you like a bag of bricks.There's an interesting and disturbing scene at one point when Russian soldiers are inside a demolished building. There's a big gaping crater at along the interior of the house, and the crater created a large hole in the wall overlooking the surroundings outside. Vassili does a leap of faith and makes it across unscathed. But the man who jumps next has his head blown apart mid-way across the crater. We then see Konig outside in a ditch, his sniper rifle smoking.Scenes like this make the movie rise out of mediocrity for a moment or two before it slips, like the dead man who tried to leap across the hole, into a crater. Perhaps this is the main fault of Enemy at the Gates--it tries too hard. Or perhaps too little. I liked the idea of a cat-and-mouse game set in World War II. But it isn't put to good use. The scenes that should come off terrifying, potent and paranoid come off simply as boring. There's a scene in the movie when Vassili is trapped behind an object with Konig right outside, his sights set on the boundaries of this object. Vassili makes a run for it, he's dead. He stays around long enough, and he's dead. But the paranoia of the scene never builds. My mind started to wander. That should never happen in a film like this.Jean-Jacques Annad (Seven Years in Tibet) knows how to evoke surroundings, but his characters are wholly unbelievable on the whole, and every time he is given good potential for a tense scene he seems to nod in the director's chair. The love story is reeking of the typical Hollywood treatment. Whereas a film such as Braveheart uses its tender love story to a definite advantage in regards to the story, the love story in Enemy at the Gates does little but tarnish the film's remaining image. And that's too bad.2.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"26 October 2003","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers I am one of those poor souls who watched `Magnificent' before `Samurai', thereby having my perspectives rather hopelessly screwed up. I would have no objection whatsoever that Magnificent was a good commercial adaptation of the Kurosawa's legendary masterpiece. It was, however, a capital sin to keep looking for things in Magnificent while watching Samurai, as I did the first time. Anyway, that was a long time ago. Watching the 200 minutes of Samurai again (on DVD this time) yesterday, I was happy to find that my perspectives had been straightened out. Instead of having cause and effect switched around, I was able to look at things the right way how these samurais were adapted in The Magnificent Seven. It was anything but straightforward.Let's start with the simplest. The most skilled samurai found the closest adaptation in James Coburn's (I'll use the actors' names for simplicity) dagger-sharp gunman efficient, deadly, cool, but not without human touch, so that he draws admiration rather than repugnance. Even the double-duel scene (one testing, one for real) at the initial encounter was closely replicated. The samurai leader is another case of close adaptation. One interesting thing is that while the samurai has his head shaved for a purpose (to impersonate a monk to fool the thief holding a child as hostage), Yul Brynner's baldness was part and parcel of his comprehensive image, as well as a symbol of his sex appeal.Now, we're getting into the realm of mix-and-match. The samurai who is the first to join is the equivalent of Steve McQueen, becoming second-in command. This is the guy with a short beard. The circumstance of his joining however, is different. Unlike McQueen, he does not take part in the opening action with the leader. He comes simply in answer to the advertisement, and joins the leader out of respect of what the latter is doing. He and the young man accompany the leader almost anywhere throughout the film, in checking out the ground planning strategies. However, unlike McQueen, he is not among the final survivors. The adaptation of the woodcutter to Charles Bronson stops at this very superficial aspect, i.e. the woodcutting. In fact, the woodcutter does not really have a counterpart in Magnificent. His fighting skills are mediocre at best, and if there's anyone in Magnificent fits that description, it would be Buchholz. But I don't even think that's the intention. The other characteristic of the woodcutter is that he's a bit of a clown, for which there is no counterpart. On the surface, the young samurai is Horst Buchholz. Adapted closely is his being by far the youngest, as well as his romance with the village girl. However, other main characteristic of Buchholz actually comes from somebody else, as we'll see later. We now come to the last two, polarised in terms of the degree of their adaptation. The street hawker, also the leader's good friend, has no counterpart in Magnificent. His clean shaven round face, short stature, benign smile and mild temperament make him the most un-samurai-like of the lot. It is he, instead of the second-in-command (of whom McQueen is the counterpart), who is among the survivors in Samurai (together with the leader and the young man). Finally, we have Toshiro Mifune playing the most complicated of the samurais. It is his characteristics, rather than that of the young samurai, that become the clay from which Buchholz is moulded. In Samurai, he is the guy who is eager to join but rejected, follows the crew until finally gets accepted, and sounds the alarm upon arrival to bring out the entire village from hiding. His temperamental nature turns out to be rooted in his origin as a humble peasant who has seen the bitter struggle between samurai and peasants. His love and caring of children, however, is reflected in another character, Bronson. There are two characters in Magnificent that do not bear much resemblance to characters in Samurai. One is Robert Vaughn, an old hand suffering from battle-fatigue; the other is Brad Dexter, who is under the self-delusion that some hidden treasure is involved in the project. Finally, it is interesting to mention that in Magnificent, the chief villain is not simply a cardboard figure as in Samurai, but given a life through the remarkable performance of Eli Wallach.

The Special Effects are still impressive but they are losing their freshness. They were eye popping in the first two movies but there just good here. There is actually one scene where the effects look sort of fake.These movies have never been actor movies, the dinosaurs mostly overshadow the actors. But the acting was still a little better than ok. Here, Sam Neill is flat. Laura Dern has barely any screentime. Tea Leoni is very out of place. William H. Macy has one funny scene but other than that his performance isn't much. Whats really disappointing about this movie is that dinosaurs are less interesting here. We have an oversized Crocodile and Raptors with shi* coming out of their head. The Pteranodons are the only ones that shine. There actually more evil. Yeah and what the hell??? The T-Rex, he was the star of the first two films. Why the fuc* would you kill him off. Where the hell are the other two? They could kill the Oversized Crocodile.Overall, JP3 was a disappointment. Its hard to say if there should even be another sequel. It may be time for this franchise to go extinct.

Agent Doyle requests some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life, since his childhood. They were a simple family of three his widow father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and yesterday I watched again, now on DVD. Although being a low-budget movie, the screenplay is sharp, with no flaw. The cast is outstanding, but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand'). If at least it were 'The God's Hand', it might be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended.

A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is loved by critics, filmmakers, film-students, and dumb goth kids. It is hated by other critics, other filmmakers, other film-students, and dumb religious freaks. Kubrick has always been controversial, here most of all. The cause of the heat surrounding the picture is that no one can agree on what the movie is really saying. The film was hot enough to be nominated for Oscars, but too hot to win them (strange, since MIDNIGHT COWBOY won two years before).Let's get down to it. The film itself is terrific. Kubrick's cold, objective style brings the viewer the spellbinding tale of a violent, drug abusing punk in an England of the future who gets screwed by a system that longs to regain control. Anthony Burges's book provides a language that accounts for so much quotable dialogue, Kubrick's camera gives us a stark Pop Art future that is a stage for our players without overwhelming them, and Malcolm McDowell gives one of the best psychopath performances that's ever hit the screen.

Al Pacino gives a majestic performance as a Cuban refugee who works his way into a life of crime on the streets of Miami.

However, he's just too dumb to stay at the top, and soon he finds he has a price on his head. The film is severely hindered by its insanely overlong running time. There's a detailed and in-depth story to tell here, but at nearly three hours the film is simply too lengthy. It also wallows in unplesantness for the sake of it, with endless scenes of people snorting dope, killing one another, and rolling in their murderously earned wealth. There are powerful moments, true enough, including filmdom's most violent chainsaw execution sequence and a staggering climax in which Pacino single-handedly attempts to ward off a guerilla army that has infiltrated his mansion. However, on the whole Scarface is a disappointment because its emphasis is on sleaze and violence, with not nearly enough time dedicated to the other threads of the story.
