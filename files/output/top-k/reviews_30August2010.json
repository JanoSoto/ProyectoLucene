Very few of us watch it as a film by John Frankenheimer or as a film based on the novel by David Ely. We're instantly shocked to see Rock Hudson playing a very unusual role for himself. He was the romantic of Hollywood, he did big roles, starred in epic melodramas such as Douglas Sirk's Written on the Wind and George Cukor's Giant. All of us who know Rock Hudson know that he was a homosexual and the first celebrity who had aids. So he was not only important in the history of Hollywood, but many historians claim that he had a huge impact on the aids awareness. Back to the film; Seconds is a very unusual sci-fi thriller for its time, it is a story of unsatisfied people who desperately want to get a second chance to live.An old man living a wealthy American life with his wife suddenly gets a phone call from his long lost friend, who he thought was dead. The man on phone tells him to come to a certain place under the name, Wilson. There he arrives to a mysterious office and is told that he has a chance to start a new life with a whole new identity with the help of plastic surgery. In addition to the actual surgery this agency provides help to frame the death of the client, built a new reputation, a new life, a new past and future. When the man starts living his new life, he meets new people and finds out that the new life isn't much better than the last one. This realization leads him back to the agency where he is about to find out something quite shocking.There are several things that make this an unusual film. First Rock Hudson had only played commercial, romantic roles - roles that people could easily fall in love with. He gave life to characters teen girls could put up on their walls and read articles about. Now suddenly, he plays a role of an old depressed man, whose bourgeois life - built on the American dream starts to crack up. He starts to realize the sadness, loneliness and the dissatisfaction in his life. Second the subject is very agonizing; it's a story of people dissatisfied with their lives, everyone wants to get a second chance to fulfill their dreams. Because in earlier life making money seemed like the most important thing - now when you don't have to worry about the money, you can focus on the things that you really love. Third the cinematography, in the late 60's almost all films in Hollywood were color films, black-and-white wasn't good anymore. The cinematography is very artistic and at some points metaphorical. So basically the overall atmosphere of Seconds is what made it so unusual for Hollywood.Well as one can guess, these kind of, surrealistic, absurd films about dissatisfaction don't make much money. The film was played in the Cannes film festival and the people hated it, as did the critics. But now days many film historians say that the subject was far too daring for the time, Hollywood wasn't ready for that. People didn't want to see the misery and agony in life. In Europe these kind of films were already very common and many artists had dealt with these issues. When watching Seconds one cannot forget the situation Hollywood was during the time. In 1960's the studios collapsed and filmmakers started to make more personal films, such as Easy Rider, The Graduate, Alice's Restaurant, Midnight Cowboy and Five Easy Pieces. Even that Seconds isn't directly part of this group, movement I think this period had a huge impact on it.The role played by Rock Hudson is his finest performance. Even that I adore his roles in Douglas Sirk's melodramas, I think he really found his talent in Seconds. Probably because of the unique role, which was perfect for him. Rock Hudson was forced to live a double life his whole life. It wasn't even a possibility to come out of the closet, many people in Hollywood knew that Rock was a homosexual, but it was a complete different thing to tell it to the audience. When he first started acting, his agent told him what to wear, how to act and to change his name - Roy Fitzgerald, I guess it wasn't hot enough for Hollywood. When everyone noticed that Rock was around 30 years old and still wasn't married, he had to find a girl. So he married a lesbian and lived a double life. This brief introduction leads us to his role in Seconds, where he starts a new life, someone else builds an identity for him. This clearly is an autobiographical allegory, or at least an allegory for Hollywood. If you're interested to know more about Rock Hudson and his personal life, I'd suggest a biographical documentary; Rock Hudson Dark and Handsome Stranger (2010).There are several ways to look at Seconds, I think it stands out as a brilliant unusual sci-fi thriller. It was very important to bring up an issue like this to Hollywood in the time. Dissatisfaction and the personal problems that lie deep under the gorgeous American lawns.

But unlike other popular Lean films, this one would have us believe its a romance about anything else. The political and military conflict serves as the backdrop rather than the driving force of the film. Omar Sharif plays an idealistic doctor\/poet orphaned at an early age and we pick up with his story as he is about to begin a general practice in Moscow just before WWI. He is from the upper class yet doesn't seem politically active and initially doesn't take a stance either for or against the Bolsheviks. But we know he's a good man as one night he goes out into the cold and tries to care for some Bolshevik demonstrators who have been run down into the street by a cavalry detachment. We see a kindness in this man when indifference might have been more expected from someone from his class. One Christmas Eve, he witnesses a most beautiful woman walk into a fancy gathering and shoot her lover. The woman, played handsomely by Julie Christie, becomes the object of his desires for the balance of the film....The film lumbers along from one elaborate setting to the next through the span of the next several years. After WWI and the revolution, there is the Russian Civil War to deal with, and one thing after another seems to keep Sharif and Christie apart. So much so, that you wonder where the romance is in this supposed romantic picture. Both are married and have children with other people, and end up sharing little screen time together. One is reminded of the perils of having a romance set during a time of war. The people who are supposedly in love just don't get to spend much time together. Cold Mountain and Atonement would be other examples of the problems with wartime romance films. Characters appear and disappear inexplicably for most of the film. They have changes of heart that are difficult to figure out, and many of their actions defy logic. Why for example does the good doctor fail to follow either of the women he loves, even after being given the chance? Why must he stay in Russia up to his bitter end in the middle of a street? Lots of things to ponder with this script.Despite the problems with the story, Lean does what he did best in other areas. The film is quite beautiful to look at. It also paints a frightening portrait of life in Russia during these times. Hard to imagine Czarist rule was any less just than Bolshevik rule. The sets look real enough. There are many fine performances. Rod Steiger steals every scene he's in, even if we don't often have a clue who's side he's on.

Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I'd call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn't an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There's something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he's often criticized for it. There's no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that's never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It's amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our hero Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I'm sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I'm sure ones own opinion on what's done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we're watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can't help but feel you're in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell's performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell's greatest work here comes once he's cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What's even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story. You'll also never hear Singin' in the Rain the same way again. Some people call the film overindulgent, which is probably is but I see this as a good thing. This just helps create this strange world and in the end it's really unlike any movie ever made and there's just something so unique in its vision that you can't help but feel this is something from the future. Kubrick's vision has never been questioned and fans could debate on which of his features has the greatest look but for my money it's this film. That's not to say this is the director's greatest film but I do think it has the great look and feel. It's certainly a very violent movie but the director gives the violence such a pleasant nature that it just seems normal and rather light. The strange music selection, crazy camera shots and overall strange tone makes it a one of a kind and that's why A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will always be a timeless work of art.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 August 2010","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Clockwork Orange, A (1971) **** (out of 4) Set at some point in the future, British teen Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) spends most of his time hanging with his goon friends, raping women and causing other violent harm but after he's caught he volunteers for an experimental therapy that doesn't quite work as planned. Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I'd call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn't an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There's something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he's often criticized for it. There's no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that's never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It's amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our hero Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I'm sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I'm sure ones own opinion on what's done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we're watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can't help but feel you're in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell's performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell's greatest work here comes once he's cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What's even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story.

Sgt. (R. Lee Ermey) to a final showdown in Vietnam where a group of soldiers are being picked off by a sniper.Kubrick's return to the cinema after a seven year break came with a film genre that has pretty much played itself out in the past eight or nine years considering we got films like THE DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW as well as PLATOON. Many critics panned the film for being too familiar while others called it a masterpiece that showed the war unlike any movie before. I've always had a love-hate relationship with FULL METAL JACKET and it's probably a film I've seen more than any other Kubrick even though I think it's one of the director's lesser films. There's no question that the first hour is a masterpiece but I've never warmed up to the second half for several reasons but as any Kubrick fan knows, the more you watch his films the more you notice different things.This latest viewing of the film had me enjoying the second half of the picture a lot more than any previous time. I think one reason was that I got to see it theatrically on a very large screen and it brought out certain elements that I had never really picked up on before including the incredible cinematography. The camera-work has always been a strong point to every Kubrick film and I really loved the way that the camera pretty much just floats around during the second half picking up the action as it moves along. This really gives the viewer a first-hand look at everything that's going on and it really does put you in the middle of the action and this is especially true during the final portion where the marines are going up against a sniper.I still have some problems with this sequence including the interviews that are done by the film crew. I can understand why Kubrick would include these scenes but to me they really don't add enough to warrant their inclusion in the film but who knows... Perhaps my next viewing I'll see them in a different manor.The first half of the film is probably the most unoriginal as the training camp sequence has been seen in dozens of films going all the way back to the silent era yet Kubrick shows it in a way that makes it an unnerving thrill that will wreck each of your emotions. Kubrick paints some very dark humor in the film and most of it at the expense of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight idiot who gets tortured not only by the drill Sergent but also the men in his group. I've always seen the first half of the film as a portrait of how much a man can take before finally cracking up. The picture shown here certainly needs to give credit to D'Onofrio but the main credit goes to Kubrick and that amazing vision.The way the camera glides around much like it did in THE SHINING brings the same claustrophobic sense of dread and one can't help but get caught up in the story. This portion of the film has some very funny moments but it's also incredibly disturbing simply because of the abuse Pyle takes and you can't help but feel sorry for him but at the same time you too want to hate him because of how stupid he is. The scenes are quite shocking in a way because of how raw Kubrick makes them and its this rawness that really makes this stuff seem fresh even though we've seen it before. Kubrick was a master with the camera and it's just amazing to see how quickly our emotions can change as one second we'll be laughing only to have that quickly go away as something darker happens.This first hour can easily be called a masterpiece because of how raw and powerful it is and in the end there's really not another basic training sequence that can compare. The second half has certainly grown on me with this latest viewing but I still think there are just a few too many flaws here for me to call the film a masterpiece or even a great movie.

Guess so much time away chipping at rocks doesn't slow a man's natural Green Beret ability to kill. After all, he's just going to take photographs of POW camps behind (former) enemy lines, right?This movie should be total BS, but somehow it is entertaining, at least some of the time. I liked how ultimately it became a reel almost, unintentionally, commenting on itself. The explosions are fantastic and out of this world, but believable in the comic-book\/cartoon aspect of it. Rambo becomes such an action figure that one wonders where Skeletor is. I smiled whenever a character would fire at Rambo oh so poorly (the look on one's face looking like oh, damn, why am I firing so much?) only to be blown away by a missile on the end of an arrow. I laughed incredibly when I got to watch the money shots of stuff blowing up so good that it nearly made Stallone's recent blow-stuff-up-real-good outing the Expendables like the retreading it is. Characters come on screen with the life of GI Joe, and why not after a while?The movie knows what it is, at least it does once one is acclimated to the style that Stallone is after. Ironically what Stallone is after in his portion of the script, the politics of it, is just silly and outdated 'hell-with-the-commies' stuff (it should also go without saying that he also made Rocky IV the same year). It's James Cameron's contributions, of the action and suspense, that make the movie so worthwhile, in spite of the face of logic that should be present. One can either go with the flow of it, or they can't. I mostly did. I ended up enjoying the spectacle of how fearless the macho jingoism became. What little dialog is in the movie is cut out of steroids. A character may die just the way you might expect - which in its own way makes it more surprising how expected it is ironically enough (you'll see what I mean when it comes). And by the time Rambo comes to his great conclusion, he may be more heroic, but in such a way that leaves no impact whatsoever. Rambo First Blood Part II is mindless entertainment for a time of mindless action fans in the middle of a mindless but much touted Presidency like Regan's. It's up to Rambo? Does he have a choice? America for the WIN!

To reference an earlier Lee joint's title, it explores the respective dazes of two African-American brothers - Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes), who's mesmerized by a white woman's lure, and Gator Purify (Samuel L. Jackson), a crack addict. Lee's thorough investigation of the drugs and race issues is undercut by his inability to write a truly satisfying narrative featuring Flipper and Gator's plot lines.To return to the film's central issue of delusion, its most problematic viewpoint is that of extensive judgment of architect Flipper's affair with his Italian-American secretary, Angie (Annabella Sciorra). Lee's title, Jungle Fever, slyly refers to a psychological haze experienced by some people in interracial relationships. The rub comes in Lee's obvious statement on what Flipper - and perhaps all black men who are involved with white women - want, in the character's name Flipper Purify. Could a more ham-fisted summary be presented in film? In addition, Snipes' character is rebuked for his taste in women repeatedly in the film's diegesis by his father the Good Reverend Doctor Purify (Ossie Davis), by his wife Drew (Lonette McKee), and by a nosy, grating, black waitress played by Queen Latifah, to name a few. So condemning is Lee's treatment of Flipper and Angie's desire for one another, by the film's end, it's rendered as a drug like Gator's crack cocaine. No intrinsic, long-lasting value can be drawn from it.This moral is the film's worst flaw. Technically, it is very accomplished, even if the central romance is empty and unfulfilling. There are several great acting performances, among them Ossie Davis' turn as the Good Reverend; John Turturro as a store clerk who is jilted by Angie and looks for love with an African-American woman; the great Anthony Quinn as the clerk's father who holds onto bigotry as a source of personal identity; Wesley Snipes, towering as he navigates Lee's elaborate story realm; and Samuel L. Jackson as the witty crackhead brother Gator. While on the subject of Jackson, he has revealed that he was actually addicted to crack when he learned he got the role of Gator. The judges at the Cannes Film Festival created a new award specifically to honor Jackson's vivacious acting. Ernest Dickerson functioned well as the film's director of photography, bringing vivid colors to the story. The film's music stays interesting, being a collage of mainly Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson and Frank Sinatra, with a bit of vintage Public Enemy thrown in for good measure.Some words should be allotted to mentioning the film's centerpiece, a subplot sequence wherein Flipper goes looking for his brother and ventures into a den of iniquity called the Taj Mahal. This is a building where hundreds of crackheads go to enjoy crack, trade sex for drugs, etc. Snipes gives a singular effort with the search scenes, backed by a very well-planned soundtrack pick of Stevie Wonder's Livin' For the City. Gator explains to Flipper that the television set Flipper's mother wants has been smoked away. Afterward, Jackson does a superb job of portraying the damned while Flipper treads away, and Halle Berry could be said to do a good job in her first movie role as a crack addict, if a good job constitutes growling lines like Eat me, mother*$#@er! Lee's drug expose should move many - a cinematic uppercut just as sobering as when Drew suggests to Flipper during an argument that white people hate black people because they're not black. Drew's harrowing narrative of being a mixed, light-skinned black woman in a race that is obsessed with color is a tear-jerker. But Lee has no problem summoning powerful scenes. Rather, it's his inability or unwillingness to link his plot lines more cohesively that pulls down the work. As a whole, Jungle Fever remains much less captivating than the sum of its parts.

It's easy to sneer after all of these years; and however clichéd the lyrics may be, no-one could reasonably refute that the songs and their melodies are absolutely first-rate. Old-hat, yes; but definitely first-rate. And I think 'South Pacific' is probably R&H's magnum opus. I was watching it yesterday and thought the musical arrangements were note-perfect, the singing choreographed beyond fault. You may hate it; but if you're honest you have to admit it is bloody good. In its day, on the big, wide screen, it was a jaw-dropping experience.The stars of the movie are pretty diminutive. Brazzi plays the hero, whilst Mitzi Gaynor turns for the heroine. Both are more than equal to the task - at least in their acting roles, but I suspect that there was some miming during one or two of their numbers, particularly Brazzi's basso-profundo. The rest of the cast were, again, capable B-movie also-rans. Filming is lavish in every way. It's pretty obvious that they've gone somewhere tropical at times, though the long-shots of Bali Hai itself look so painted you can almost see the brush-strokes. At some stages filming has employed coloured filters. I cannot see the purpose of this. Perhaps it imbued a sense of mystery in the 1950's, but today it looks strange and contrived. I thought there was actually something wrong with the print.Perhaps the most telling aspect of this movie is the modern-day loss of innocence, obligation and responsibility that it underscores. The 'grande-romance' was popular in the 1950's because people really did imagine that they were realising a life-changing destiny in marriage, and that sex (never more than hinted at) was secondary to emotional commitment and family-planning. Today, In the western world, such social mores are passe. Now, sexual gratification is all important, children just an incidental by-product that can be disposed of or abandoned if needs be, and commitment has almost become a cliché. Perhaps not all change is progress...If you like old - and more important, old fashioned - movies, if you like big, roistering songs with an orchestra blazing away full-tilt, then you can't fail to be knocked sideways by this over-long over-blown Rogers and Hammerstien's epic. But if you got hauled-off to the cinema too often, to endure people wailing about emotions you were too young to possess, then it may not hit the spot.

Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. Be Prepared is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's Hakuna Matata, the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. The Circle of Life set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me.

Leo's main competition is Johnny Caspar (brilliantly played by Jon Polito, his best ever role), angling to take over as top gangster.

In addition to the aforementioned actors, J.E. Freeman is imposing as Caspar's right hand Eddie Dane and Steve Buscemi is a scene-stealer in a cameo role as fast-talking Monk.

The movie, in a subtle way, highlights the plight of the working class who are often exploited by the capitalists. The movie was made after the great depression during which thousands of people were unemployed and many families starved to death. The movie was light years ahead of its time and delivered strong thoughts in the form of humor; the movie has a lot memorable scenes which make us laugh and think at the same time. This movie is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made; made by a genius who was not only a great film maker but also a greet visionary. This piece of art has stood the test of time and has been appreciated by people of all ages. This movie serves as a testimonial to the artistic and creative genius of one of the greatest entertainers to have graced the celluloid screen.

It is the story of an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the various social and economic changes; generated with the advent of industrialization. It portrays how capitalism can push an individual to the periphery of the society. The first shot transforms from a flock of sheep to a crowd of people .Idea associative montage has been used to portray that human beings have lost their individuality and their lives are dictated by a social dogma. The movie was made when the world was going under an economic crisis and the political undertones employed, in this movie, are very conspicuous. Charlie Chaplin is shown as an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the industrial and social changes.

I am a huge fan of their movies - and it surprised me a lot reading their names on IMDb after watching the movie. This movie is one of their less funny movies (even though it still has the typical absurd humor). It's nonetheless one of their greatest movies. It's pretty much flawless. Great story, intelligent conversations (might have been too artificial sometimes), great atmosphere, great music, great characters and perfectly fitting actors.****Spoileralert****Still, I am not sure if I want to rate this movie with 9 or 10 points. It's somewhere in between for me. While everything in this movie was pretty much perfect, I was missing some sort of sympathetic figure. There was no single good guy in this movie. It shouldn't make a movie worse, but it's sort of hard for me to evoke feelings of tense excitement if I barely care for the actors. This movie is far from good and evil. If you like that, this movie might become one of your favorite. If not, you might have a foul aftertaste in your mouth after watching this one.****Spoileralert ending****I have decided to rate this movie with 9 points. Simply because I find that there are better Coen Brothers movies out there. Especially more wicked ones.

Insomnia is about two cops who go to a small town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. While chasing a suspect officer Will Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shoots and kills his partner Hap (Martin Donavan). Distraught at what this could do to his already dwindling reputation, which is explained in some very important back story, Dormer lies about the accident and tells everybody that it was the man they were chasing that shot Hap. This event leads to a dark series of twists and turns that go deep into the psychological nature of an emotionally provoked cop and a psychopathic killer.Insomnia is a very dark film, yet only in figurative terms. The film is never physically dark and this is for an extremely important reason that is also where the title of the film stems from. It takes place in an Alaskan town far up north and in many places like that it never gets dark for certain periods of the year. Dormer, a cop from Los Angeles, is investigating this murder during one of those periods. Because of the complete lack of darkness Dormer develops sleep problems and is hit hard by insomnia. It is this that spurs on a thrilling chain of events that lead up to an incredible climax that comes very unexpectedly. This setting creates for a compelling juxtaposition of psychological themes that branch out towards the sleep depraved nether regions of the human mind, to the dark and twisted mind of an unconventional killer, who Robin Williams portrays with absolute disturbing perfection. Robin Williams, despite being as hilarious as he is, always amazes in his more serious roles and Insomnia is a fantastic exposè of his dramatic talent.Dark and brooding films are not something that are far and few between in this day and age of cynicism, yet Insomnia is able to stand out as one of the better portrayals of the dark side of the human mind. And not only is Insomnia a good example of a dark thriller, it is just an all around well made film. Pacino and Williams are incredible together and their counteracting roles balance each other out in such an immaculate and harrowing way. They are both given a fantastic script to work off of that weaves a captivating story that will leave you thinking, while also entertained. And of course it is a Christopher Nolan film so the stylistic direction is of course great. The jumpy and claustrophobic way in which it is shot provides a fuller experience of the psychological thriller story. Nolan keeps the technical grandeur toned down greatly for this picture, but his visual stamp is still there.My only real complaint with this film is that it is not as big as what you would expect from a Nolan film. It is much smaller in scale and doesn't blow your mind out of proportion like his other films do. However, this is hardly a legitimate complaint because an individual movies quality should not be compared alongside another. Each film is its own and should be critiqued as such. Thus saying that Insomnia lacks the pizzaz of other Nolan films is not so much a criticism so much as a personal observation.Insomnia is a great addition to the psychological thriller genre. Its a great story that keeps you wanting more and Pacino and Williams absolutely amaze. Don't expect anything huge but definitely check this one out for visual and psychological aesthetic.
