Director John Dahl may be famous for his love of noir with The Last Seduction springing to mind; a sort of cross between a typical 1990s heist film and the classic that is Double Indemnity but with Rounders Dahl doesn't stick to what he loves most enough to make the film anything too fantastic. Let's be honest Rounders is a sports film and no, it's not about the sport\/baseball hybrid 'rounders'; it's about poker which in itself sparks some debate surrounding whether or not it's actually a sport or just a mere form of gambling. In my book, it's a sport since it takes brains and skill to win at the game whereas something like wrestling, which is fake for the best part, can be considered of the sporting variety.So there you have it a sports film directed by a man in love with noir which is still evident in this film and revolving around an engaging plot whilst at the same time containing good acting. What's clever here is that the director is challenging us and poker as a whole into contemplating whether Poker is a sport. The film follows a familiar sports narrative, ie; it has the hero with nothing to loose; the disgraced mentor who is able to pick the hero back up onto his feet; a winning and\/or training montage and of course 'the final showdown with the villain' only in these stories it takes place on a sports field (or a Poker table, in this case).During the film, my mind kept harking back to Paul Newman's 1961 sports film The Hustler, revolving around another popular American sport 9 ball pool, since although both films are decades apart in terms of film-making; the way the story is told and the way events play out remain the same. I'll never forget Newman's character playing frame after frame with Minnesota Fats and then leaving the hall a dejected and tired man after loosing so heavily; the same sort of way Mike McDermott (Damon) does so in Rounders. What follows is painful and eventful uphill struggle involving loved ones becoming detached, hard times coming to the surface and lots and lots of the respective sport being played &#150; in Rounders, this aids McDermott since it enables to get him closer to the powers that be (Abe Petrovsky &#150; Landau) regarding his education. This not only gives us the feeling that time is passing and relationships are developing but is a great way to not only introduce a character but to also demonstrate what a skilled Poker player McDermott is &#150; needless to say, it happens early on in the film.Although a sports film as such, the essence of noir can't help but worm its way into the frame. What I couldn't see was the point of it all There are gangsters of the Russian kind; lots of people smoking; voice-overs; gambling and a dystopian urban setting. Fine you think, but the femme fatale character of Petra (Janssen) appears and then disappears without too much of an incident and without too much evidence to suggest she's even a femme fatale in the first place, there is no real conflict for the middle period of about forty minutes apart from the usual montages of poker games being won although sometimes we'll be shown the games; often when they go wrong (the match with the sheriffs is a good example). I'm not sure if Rounders was supposed to be a neo-noir of sorts because although it has the basis to be one, it doesn't utilise enough conventions of the genre to be considered one and if it's not a noir then it is most definitely a sports film; albeit a rather average one. I liked the way we are supposed to feel for McDermott; I liked the way Edward Norton does some 'acting within acting' or playing a 'character within a character' and the way characters and incident float in and out of McDermott's life was sometimes effective but Rounders is a film that relies too heavily on generic substance and star power to be truly memorable even if it does raise the debate about whether poker should be a sport or not.

With several familiar characters and a storyline that eventually ties into some of the twisted events of the first film, The Two Jakes still manages to be horribly bland and excruciatingly boring. Originally a third chapter to the Gittes story was intended, but The Two Jakes was so overwhelmingly disappointing that the franchise was stopped dead in its tracks.It's fifteen years since the events of Chinatown and Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is still haunted by his encounter with Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel) hires Gittes to protect him after he shoots his wife's lover during a recording of evidence being conducted by Gittes in the adjacent room. More suspicious, perhaps wiser, and definitely fatter, Gittes struggles to get to the heart of the murder, which leads him headlong into a torrid affair with Lillian Bodine (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the murdered man. During his investigation, the bitterer private eye runs into a plot to obtain mineral rights from property that might be rich in oil and a trail of deceit that could reunite him with Katherine Mulwray, Evelyn's daughter.Also written by Robert Towne, The Two Jakes has lost just about every aspect that made Chinatown sensational. It ultimately no longer resembles film noir. A courtroom drama blended with a complex murder mystery, this halfhearted follow-up leaves much to be desired in almost every department. Jake's office has grown bigger, and he now owns the entire building. But the adulterous scum, two-timers, double-dealers and lowlifes still frequent his profession, and show no signs of slowing down as he immediately picks up another equally dirty case. This time however, Gittes appears to fearlessly interfere with evidence and police matters, beyond the extent that he did in Chinatown. He is a much less likable character, and all of his smarmy, smart-mouthed, smooth-talking sarcasm has been replaced with sour vindictiveness.The story is just as intricate as Chinatown, but the characters are so quickly and poorly developed that we don't care about them and quickly discontinue bothering with figuring out who's who and what's what. This murder mystery is so drawn out and lengthy that we actually don't attempt to solve the crimes before Gittes does. Striking deals with criminals and fist-fighting cops, Gittes has become an antihero we can't easily root for, Stowe is a frenzied, nearly psychotic widow, and Keitel is shrouded by mystery all the way through. As un-involving as the story is, its complexity only serves to annoy the viewer, who halfway through the film has given up trying to sort out the overabundance of characters and events that don't make much sense and don't amount to anything significant.The Two Jakes adopts a monotone narration by Nicholson, which was thankfully absent from Chinatown. Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez) returns, as does Kahn the butler (James Hong), but it couldn't feel less like the fulfilling and disturbing noir Polanski flawlessly crafted 16 years earlier. With flashbacks and unnecessary reused lines of dialogue, including I wouldn't extort my worst enemy - that's where I draw the line, this snail-paced, convoluted excuse for both storytelling and film-making is a pathetic way for the revered Jake Gittes to fade away.- Mike Massie ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2007","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Unquestionably inferior to its predecessor and shockingly mediocre, the Jack Nicholson directed The Two Jakes is the sequel to Roman Polanski's near-perfect film noir, Chinatown.

Jack Nicholson portrays an unforgettable character in a film that demands repeat viewings, earning a remarkable 11 Academy Award nominations in 1974.Lead investigator Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired by Mrs. Mulwray to spy on her husband to determine his marital loyalty.

To make matters worse, the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) stops by with her lawyer to discuss the damaging gossip running through local newspaper headlines. Uncovering a knavish plot to deprive neighboring farmlands of water to force the sale of land at immoderately cheap prices, Gittes becomes determined to root out those responsible, especially after an unfavorable encounter with a switchblade. Digging through the corruption and deceit behind Mulwray's murder and the extreme secrecy behind Mrs. Mulwray and her father Noah Cross (John Houston), Gittes is cast headlong into a world of greed, extortion and violence.Jack Nicholson breathes life into Jake Gittes in an Oscar-worthy tour de force, with amazingly sarcastic quips and commendable perseverance concerning the colossal gravity of the water and power business.

Immersing the viewer in the heart of the film, over-the-shoulder shots and silhouetted faces keep you in the very middle of the action and almost following behind Gittes as he moves from bloodied crime scene to lavish homes.

The characters are either antiheroes or villains and as the plot thickens, those lines are usually continually blurred as the intricate mysteries become less and less clear, giving way to a more astonishingly unexpected conclusion.Instantly recognized for its perfect recreation of classic noir and its infamous nose-slicing scene, performed by Polanski himself, Chinatown demonstrates the chaos and avarice of deceitful men wielding too much power, as it serves up an allegory for water and dishonesty. Every side-story and reference to Chinatown in the film musters up memories of events gone awry, and so its culmination there flawlessly sums up the incalculable and tragic arcs of characters that are doomed by their involvement with the seedy side of politics.

Voted onto AFI's Top 100 Greatest American Films list in both 1998 and 2007, Chinatown is the epitome of film noir, and an overall outstanding piece of entertainment.- Mike Massie ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"14 November 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction.

The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later. &#150; Stanley Kubrick What is more frightening, having to wear a mask or what is indeed under that mask? Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's final and most haunting film is a journey into the mind of a Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, who after hearing his wife's fantasy of being with another man sends him into a journey to cheat on her. He roams the streets to escape from his weakness of possibly being undesirable to his wife and along his path is offered sex by a prostitute whom Bill considers in order to get even. There are masks on the wall of her apartment &#150; maybe to show she is more honest about her sexual exploits than the affairs of married couples. She is shown in full view. Most striking is Tom Cruise's transformation into the classic character Dante as he journeys into hell with the aid of Virgil (Sydney Pollack) from the Inferno. Kubrick's use of lighting and cinematography is impeccable as many of the shots are done with a dolly which is one of the hardest to perfect.What separates this film from so many others is its realistic characters. None are overpoweringly heroic or clear protagonists or antagonists. One might view Cruise's Bill Harford as a protagonist and Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler who represents Virgil as the antagonist but that would deny their developed and rounded characters. No one is particularly virtuous or morally devoid. It is more of a difference of levers of morality than simple on and off switches between who is virtuous and who is immoral. The dialog is pleasantly restrained from pretension and theatrics. No snappy one-liners or eloquent speeches are used here. Instead we get real people who talk like we all do. There problems are much deeper and painful though and they stem from moral decay.Bill Harford although being a successful doctor is bored with routine, his wife and lifestyle. Anything different would open his life up. Alice Harford played by Nicole Kidman goes through this tormentous affair as well; she takes care of the kid, cooks dinner and fixes the house. They are comatose in an existence where they both are successful and suppose to be happy. After meeting an old friend from medical school who is now a pianist Bill sees him write a password for a gig he will play at. Bill, intrigued, gets where the location is being played from his weak friend.The next part has Bill enter a mansion that holds a secret ritualistic orgy to initiate new women and entertain the onlookers. Everyone is masked including the sexual participants. The sex scenes in the film are detached, impersonal, cold and clinical. The famous orgy sequence features all masked guests at their party to protect their identities. These men are powerful including politicians, doctors and elite aristocrats. The guests arrive in limos and gain entry to the giant mansion, the password &#150; Fidelio. This scene can be seen as the second layer of hell designated for the lustful according to Dante's Inferno. Virgil (Sydney Pollack) sees him and a woman escorts him and tries to get him to leave because he is in danger. After leaving by being discovered he is called by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) mysteriously. He tells Bill that he saw him at the party and the whole thing was a charade.Eyes Wide Shut has Christmas trees in almost every scene. This may be since the Illuminati use a symbol similar to it as seen in the dinner party. It is an eight pointed star with a triangle and circle in the middle that is suppose to be an eye. Christmas is hardly mentioned in the film and it really serves no purpose as a plot point so the Christmas tree is most likely occult symbolism.The main conflict that arises in the film is that of intent and action. Harford intends to cheat on his wife and goes as far as entering a prostitute's room to get even but chance strikes as he suddenly gets a phone call from his wife. Does he not go though with it because he genuinely loves his wife or because fear shakes him in this awkward situation? Alice Harford intended to cheat on the marine at the dinner where she and her husband were but didn't. Are they both repulsive for wanting something but not going through with it? That is up to one's own moral compass. The film is about morality and the sex, power and trust are just tests of how strong one's morality is.The ending shows that after Bill confesses to Alice of where he went and his intentions that there relationship was reduced being just sexual after the trust was gone.

Today it is merely reflective of some relationships, whether they be a ladies man\/player in SoCal, or a sports figure for the Oakland Raiders (Beatty played this playboy role as well, in Heaven Can Wait, the remake of Here Comes Mr. Jordan). I imagine at his age, we now have seen the nadir of his 'ladies man' roles.

As well-made as it is hard to stomach, Wilder's film sticks it to journalism, middle-class tourism, rubbernecking, and unfaithful women with equal aplomb to illuminate the moral desensitization of American society in an age of trivial entertainments. (Possibly the most misanthropic shot I've ever seen a locomotive bearing the name of the dying man bringing in hundreds of paying guests, the camera panning to catch them all running towards the carnival setup as a country-western band sings the victim's ballad.) The main character, Chuck Tatum, is observed in the opening shot riding in his car while being towed to the Albuquerque newspaper, his latest job opportunity in a career of burned bridges. The newsroom is presided over by a scrupulous editor whose motto Tell The Truth is embroidered in a deliberately quaint, relic of a portrait. After talking the editor into giving him a job, Douglas walks toward the camera, and in a brilliant touch his figure creates a momentary black screen that gives way to his re-emerging into frame exactly a year later, wearing the same unfashionable belt-suspenders combo for which he teased his boss&#151;an inventive jump-cut not only for its artistic skill, but also for defining a professional nadir that impels Tatum to exploit the cave-in for personal notoriety. The way that Tatum's careful scheme comes crashing down around his ears is akin to Walter Neff reaching for ill-gotten gains and being doubly rebuffed for his efforts. However, Tatum's pathetic end is more demonstrative than resigned in his fall from prestige, he conjures up one of cinema's unforgettable closing lines. This is a devastating satire, blunt and unsparing.

The story is basically that an ex-soldier or something comes to visit the family of a passed away soldier friend in Florida. The widower and the soldier starts having feelings for each other, but then they find out that a gangster sort type boss has taken over the hotel the family owns and that with the help of his men they take the family hostage.

As silly and outrageous as the humor is, I think that's just what I needed to put me in a good mood. The cast in Rat Race is absolutely perfect, they couldn't have picked a more comedic cast, not only that, but they all clicked so well together and made the film just an absolute blast to watch. Not to mention, cows are just getting a reputation as the perfect comedic relief, just look at not only Rat Race, but Twister, lol. The story is extremely clever, just how far most people would go to get money in their pockets.Donald P. Sinclair is a huge millionaire, he's so rich in fact, that he and his other rich buddies place the most obscene bets and they've just come up with the most cruel one of all. In a Las Vegas casino, several people have won a coin saying that they've won something. Donald has place two million dollars in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico. At first the group just laughs at him feeling like they've been scammed, but they think about it, and decide to just go for it. They all have to travel over two hundred miles while being watched by the rich group is watching them and betting on who is going to win the cash.Rat Race is incredibly clever and just a whole lot of fun to watch. Another great thing about this film is that it puts you in a great mood, you gotta love the comedies that can't stop make you laughing out loud. I think my favorite team was without a doubt Seth Green and his brother, they were just classic.

Just as Cooper had done A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls, Peck had previously starred in The Macomber Affair. This was also his second film with both Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner. It's a pity that the film did not call for the two of them to be sharing any scenes, that would have made it a better film.Peck is novelist Harry Street, a man modeled by Ernest Hemingway on the character of Ernest Hemingway. Or at least some of the less attractive aspects of him. He's at a safari camp at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Kenya and slowly dying of blood poisoning while his second wife, Susan Hayward attends him and awaits for a plane that can do a medical evacuation, hopefully in time.Hayward knows that she's always come up second best in Peck's eyes to his first wife Ava Gardner. In his feverish delirium Peck's mind starts wandering back over his life and especially to his early days in Paris as part of Hemingway's lost generation. And the relationship with his first wife.The problem I find with this film is that Peck's character is so self involved that I can't see why these two beautiful women are falling all over for him. Maybe that's an occupational hazard with authors or artists of any kind, but it prevents The Snows of Kilimanjaro from being a first rate film or first rate Hemingway. Nevertheless the stars are just fine in their parts and another part you should look for is that of Leo G. Carroll who is Peck's uncle and mentor. It's a kinder, gentler version of Elliott Templeton from The Razor's Edge. For that reason I'm sure it must have been offered to Clifton Webb.There are some gorgeous sets and terrific color cinematography and not surprising that The Snows of Kilimanjaro was nominated for Oscars in both categories.If you want to see Gregory Peck as a Hemingway hero, check out The Macomber Affair before this one.

Just as Cooper had done A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls, Peck had previously starred in The Macomber Affair. This was also his second film with both Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner. It's a pity that the film did not call for the two of them to be sharing any scenes, that would have made it a better film.Peck is novelist Harry Street, a man modeled by Ernest Hemingway on the character of Ernest Hemingway. Or at least some of the less attractive aspects of him. He's at a safari camp at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Kenya and slowly dying of blood poisoning while his second wife, Susan Hayward attends him and awaits for a plane that can do a medical evacuation, hopefully in time.Hayward knows that she's always come up second best in Peck's eyes to his first wife Ava Gardner. In his feverish delirium Peck's mind starts wandering back over his life and especially to his early days in Paris as part of Hemingway's lost generation. And the relationship with his first wife.The problem I find with this film is that Peck's character is so self involved that I can't see why these two beautiful women are falling all over for him. Maybe that's an occupational hazard with authors or artists of any kind, but it prevents The Snows of Kilimanjaro from being a first rate film or first rate Hemingway. Nevertheless the stars are just fine in their parts and another part you should look for is that of Leo G. Carroll who is Peck's uncle and mentor. It's a kinder, gentler version of Elliott Templeton from The Razor's Edge. For that reason I'm sure it must have been offered to Clifton Webb.There are some gorgeous sets and terrific color cinematography and not surprising that The Snows of Kilimanjaro was nominated for Oscars in both categories.If you want to see Gregory Peck as a Hemingway hero, check out The Macomber Affair before this one. And if you want to see Ava Gardner as a Hemingway heroine, check out The Sun Also Rises. As for Susan, this was her one and only shot with Papa.

What an entertaining, fun movie. I did not realize that it was Robin Wright's first major film. No wonder everyone fell in love with her. Her facial expressions were priceless. I would have to say, however that Mandy Patinkin stole the show. His acting skills are so brilliant. I believe he could portray any role however its difficulty. Also, I love it when he says, Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. I dedicate this comment to Andre the Giant whom I loved as a kid growing up. I watched his fake wrestling matches with my friends, and we always were very supportive of him. I thought it was great that he got to make a film with such good actors. The Princess Bride is a timeless piece and has its humor as well as its intense moments. Now that's pure genius. Thank you to the writer of this great film. It will be a classic like The Wizard of Oz, Oliver and The Sound of Music, the musicals. Also, who can resist Cary Elwes? How easily he made his character come to life. He portrayed his character effortlessly. (You really went from bad to good, Sean Penn, when you left Madonna for Robin. Well done! She's a true beauty.

Indeed she goes further and punishes the whole village population, complicit in her father's death by their silence and non - intervention, by blocking the source of the vital water supply. Like its predecessor, the film evokes Thomas Hardy, in its depiction of rural lives mixed with tragedy and cosmic coincidences as well as Greek Tragedy - it can't be coincidence that Papet learns his true relationship with Jean whom he treated so callously from a blind woman named Delphine, recalling of course the Delphic Oracle of ancient Greece. Again like its predecessor, the film is engrossing, beautifully shot and acted, transporting the viewer into the less than idyllic everyday existence of village folk in the early part of last century. There's no doubt that Ugolin and Papet deserve their come-uppances and there's no attempt to paint them as deserving of the viewer's sympathies. That's partly to the credit of the two actors, who give rounded performances covering a variety of emotions. With Ugolin, we get the humorous sight of him chasing Manon throughout the hillside dressed up for a safari, proclaiming his hopeless love which turns to the pathetic scene where he declares his love for her in front of the townsfolk where her natural rejection tips him over the edge to his suicide. As for Papet, the schemer of the two and idol of Ugolin, he too gives up on life after the death of his nephew and again we see his decline beautifully acted by Montand in his beggar at the feast walk past Manon's wedding group to put flowers at Ugolin's grave before the lengthy scene with Delphine where the awful truth causes him to give up on life albeit in a less dramatic way than Ugolin. Beart as Manon says very little apart from a couple of emotional outbursts of love (for the young teacher she later marries) and hate (when denouncing the Soubreyers), playing up her silent avenger part in proceedings. The rest of the cast are vivid with strong comic turns by many. The direction is sure, the scenery caught masterfully in a variety of different shades of light.

I agree with the majority that Jackson's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of Tolkien's work, but that does not prevent me from enjoying Bakshi's ambitious pioneering effort. Jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing Bakshi's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations.The film's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable. I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters. The pairs of Pippin and Merry and Eowyn and Galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually, the Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive, but these points didn't bother me very much. However, the Nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie. The only character representation I was bothered by was Sam's; he was made to look unbecomingly silly.This film is novel for its animation techniques. In addition to hand-drawn characters, live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping. It is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped, but none the less I found that the film's style was a novelty. The use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well.The voice acting was generally of high quality. Particularly good was John Hurt, who provided an authoritative voice for Aragorn. Aragorn isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories, but backed by John Hurt's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation. My other favorite was William Squire, whose voice is appropriately strong for Gandalf. The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam, whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sam's unfortunately silly image. The only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names. Particularly strange was the decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as Aruman.In producing this film, Ralph Bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films. Hence, this film contains about half the story, from the start of The Fellowship of the Ring to the end of the battle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. The obvious implication of this is that the film's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books. I enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations, but the liberties taken to compress the story didn't bother me, even the choice to leave Arwen out of the story. Enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the Lord of the Rings story in 132 minutes. The battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at Helm's Deep were tremendous.Ralph Bakshi's version of The Lord of the Rings isn't perfect and no doubt a number of Lord of the Rings readers lament the cuts to the story. However, for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy. My only strong lament is that I am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of The Lord of the Rings since Bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel.

If you're attempting to work through the entire horror section of your local Blockbuster, feel free to give this one a pass. Even if you're a big fan of werewolf movies (as I am), there are better ones to be had, such as American Werewolf in Paris, or even Cursed with Christina Ricci.On to the movie! For starters, the acting in this is horrible - I didn't care a whit for anyone in it, and was puzzling throughout the whole thing why it took them so long to suspect the brother. He acted odd as soon as he reached their house to stay, and by the time they were sitting down to dinner after Thor (the German Sheperd) was taken away, he was acting like a serial killer, only minus the charisma. The lines the kid had were trite and pathetic, and perhaps it was just me, but I found the mother's eyebrows to be quite distracting - they were abnormally dark for the hair color, and screamed Bad dye job! Bleach me please!. One would think that was a small thing, but watch and see - the camera seems to focus on them throughout the movie, and it was truly distracting. To sum up the acting, perhaps it was the screen writer's fault, but one could pretty much predict what they were going to say a mile off, and I was pretty much hoping for a 'rocks fall, everyone dies' ending by say, the middle of the movie. Best actor was the dog who played Thor, hands down.Scare factor for this movie? 2\/10. I tend to jump during scary movies, and though I felt a small bit of unease throughout the thing, there was no point where I even flinched. It's just Oh, there's the werewolf again, whoopee. And when I say 'unease', don't think the feeling of overwhelming malice in awesome Japanese horror movies, it was a very tiny fraction of that. Personally, there were a small handful of scenes where body parts\/gore were seen, and there was a stupid and pointless sex scene in the first 10 minutes (And wow, you get to see a NIPPLE, dude! Booobs!) - thus, I fail to see why this wasn't given a PG-13 rating. If a kid over 10 or 11 sees this, they're not going to be scarred for life, trust.F\/X? Well, definitely not as bad as The Howling, but not really anything to write home about, either. The initial werewolf we see in the Amazon looks HORRIBLE.

I felt bad for none of the people who were killed - there was a logger doing a survey that got whacked before we found anything about him (after ignoring the alarming sounds of a large predator nearby, Darwin at work here), and a pointless fraud who provoked Thor in an attempt to sue the family who was killed later off-screen. Apparently there were 5 or 6 hikers\/logging people who were also killed when the brother was out at the lake in his Airstream. The most horrible point in the movie was where Thor was being taken away by animal control, I really felt for his attempts to get back to his family and protect him from the Bad Person among them.

He acted odd as soon as he reached their house to stay, and by the time they were sitting down to dinner after Thor (the German Sheperd) was taken away, he was acting like a serial killer, only minus the charisma. The lines the kid had were trite and pathetic, and perhaps it was just me, but I found the mother's eyebrows to be quite distracting - they were abnormally dark for the hair color, and screamed Bad dye job! Bleach me please!. One would think that was a small thing, but watch and see - the camera seems to focus on them throughout the movie, and it was truly distracting. To sum up the acting, perhaps it was the screen writer's fault, but one could pretty much predict what they were going to say a mile off, and I was pretty much hoping for a 'rocks fall, everyone dies' ending by say, the middle of the movie. Best actor was the dog who played Thor, hands down.Scare factor for this movie? 2\/10. I tend to jump during scary movies, and though I felt a small bit of unease throughout the thing, there was no point where I even flinched. It's just Oh, there's the werewolf again, whoopee. And when I say 'unease', don't think the feeling of overwhelming malice in awesome Japanese horror movies, it was a very tiny fraction of that. Personally, there were a small handful of scenes where body parts\/gore were seen, and there was a stupid and pointless sex scene in the first 10 minutes (And wow, you get to see a NIPPLE, dude! Booobs!) - thus, I fail to see why this wasn't given a PG-13 rating. If a kid over 10 or 11 sees this, they're not going to be scarred for life, trust.F\/X? Well, definitely not as bad as The Howling, but not really anything to write home about, either. The initial werewolf we see in the Amazon looks HORRIBLE. I'd expect to see something like that in a b-movie 70's flick. I will give a bit more credit to the transformation scene much later in the movie, (where the sister discovers her brother is the werewolf) which at least made me stop and examine it, and finally give a nod of faint approval. Definitely not the most realistic thing I've ever seen, but there was a part close to the end of it where his head is all misshapen that made me raise my eyebrows in surprise.I also had to add a more personal bit about the emotional impact of this movie, or the lack thereof. I felt bad for none of the people who were killed - there was a logger doing a survey that got whacked before we found anything about him (after ignoring the alarming sounds of a large predator nearby, Darwin at work here), and a pointless fraud who provoked Thor in an attempt to sue the family who was killed later off-screen. Apparently there were 5 or 6 hikers\/logging people who were also killed when the brother was out at the lake in his Airstream. The most horrible point in the movie was where Thor was being taken away by animal control, I really felt for his attempts to get back to his family and protect him from the Bad Person among them. Everybody acts in a manner that screams Stop doing stupid things!, and wow, am I tired of seeing that in horror movies!I found out this movie was (loosely) based on a book, so perhaps that explains why it's so bad. Apparently, most of the family was cut out (2 kids, a cat, and a father, the latter of which I was wondering the story behind throughout the movie), and the book was from the viewpoint of Thor. Sounds like this is another one where you should read the book, and skip the movie - I know I'll be hunting down the book, myself, though it may be a small chore, since it appears to be out of print. I read a short summary for it, and it positively screams to me that all the interesting bits were hacked out for no particular reason.

Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a film which introduces the American public to the pejorative intricacies of the political process!! Jimmy Stewart's performance in this movie is considered one of the best acting performances ever in the history of the American silver screen!! Back in 1939, even with the Great Depression, Americans conceptualized politicians as icons of altruism who epitomized moral and socially ideological beliefs that people in this country could adhere to!! By attrition, more and more Americans have accepted the fact that politicians are the masters of one precarious preoccupation..it is called graft!! The complacency of pork barreling was something that the political spectrum wanted to keep covert... Here is where the very wet behind the ears Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) becomes astounded by the ulterior motives of the actual Washington DC, and not the one which he revered all his young adult life!! The film Mr Smith Goes to Washington makes filibustering a form of heroics, and translates the desires of the American people to the dogged tenacity of Jimmy Stewart to overcome graft!! Such a resilient assertion of democracy garnered an auspicious reaction from the American moviegoer!! Mr Smith Goes To Washington has become a legend in the movie world!! Such a charisma is largely due in part to the acting, and the directing in this movie!! At the same time, this film's strongest feature is the overall premise that graft can be overcome by a freshman senator, this powerful element to this movie ultimately cultivated a camaraderie with the American people!! If you have never seen this film before, I strongly recommend that you do!! When the phenomena of the White House and stars and stripes forever become relegated to a citadel of disillusionment, it takes the vigor of a magnanimous maverick politician like Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) to set things right!! Jimmy Stewart has always been the Mr squeaky clean baseball, apple pie, and mom type anyway!! He is perfectly cast for this movie!! Frank Capra, who has a virtual myriad of accolades in the world of Hollywood, does a tremendous job at directing this movie!! All in all, I think that Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a definite American movie legend!!
