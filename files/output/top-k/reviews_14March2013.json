[{"date":"14 March 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a Dream serves up a trippy experience for the viewers. The use of rapid cuts was impressive and kept me captivated. It is a movie meant to shock in order to get its point through. Addiction in different forms is explored through parallel story lines of the main characters. Through their individual narratives, one can experience their fears, their angst and their pain. The cinematography is excellent in capturing the rather intense thoughts of the characters as they face the horrors of their addiction. But the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the soundtrack and how perfectly fitting it was. It kept me at the edge of my seat, heavily engrossed in the movie. The soundtrack reflected an array of emotions as the characters suffer from pangs of distress and abjectly surrender to their addictions.
