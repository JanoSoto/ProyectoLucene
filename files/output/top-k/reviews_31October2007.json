On their tour the band finds out who they are, what the music is really about, and how to come together to achieve their dream. Though the film earned numerous nominations and awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress (Kate Hudson), I feel them film is anything but greatness. It was supposed to be a story of comedy, tears and rock and roll though I saw little of this throughout the entire film. The only line that I found remotely funny was by William's mother, Rock stars have kidnapped my son. For such a minor character to say the punch line of the whole movie is sad and boring. Also, I never felt any connection with the characters so their typical rock style drama meant nothing but fifteen more minutes of wasted film. One would think that a movie about music would be filled with music but instead alcohol and drugs filled the screen. Of course drugs and alcohol are all major parts of rock and roll but music is what the film is supposed to the film's true message, just like Russell Hammond, played by Billy Crudup, explained during the film. Overall I don't see what the big hype about this movie is with its undeveloped characters and poorly concluded story lines. If you want to see a movie with a bunch of grungy, stereotypical rock and roll hippies getting high and ruining their lives, Almost Famous is the perfect film for you.

Father Lamont finds Regan now living in New York & under the supervision of psychiatrist Dr. Gene Tuskin (Lousie Fletcher), using a device called a synchroniser Dr. Tuskin can enter Regan's mind & share her thoughts, feelings & memories. Father Lamont thinks this may be a good way of finding out the truth, he hooks himself up & enters Regan's mind as they are both attached to the synchroniser. Father Lamont discovers that the demon Pazuzu is still within Regan, Lamont also sees an African witchdoctor named Kokumo (Joey Green) who has the natural ability to defeat Pazuzu...Co-written, produced & directed by John Boorman this was the follow up to William Friedkin's controversial & successful classic The Exorcist (1973) & what a complete total & utter mess it is too. Upon it's initial release The Exorcist II The Heretic was absolutely trashed by critics & audiences alike, Warner Bros. & Boorman pulled the film from theatres at least twice to reedit it & it exists in a few different versions including the original studio cut that was released to theatres & on video in the early 80's which ran for about 100 minutes, the 120 odd minute director's cut which is the one most commonly available now on DVD & the one I will be basing my comments on along with further different versions aired on TV & released in Japan which are significantly different enough to warrant a mention. Anyway, the script by William Goodhart & an uncredited Boorman with Rospo Pallenberg is a real mess from start to finish, it's incredible how a big budget major Hollywood studio financed film could turn out to be such a disaster but the Exorcist II The Heretic is living proof. Apparently the film underwent several major rewrites which obviously didn't help things & the film feels like a mixed bag of unrelated ideas which were all thrown together without any regard for continuity or the audiences enjoyment. To be honest I don't really understand the story as it is, I don't know why the makers just didn't give us more of the same, more of what made the original Exorcist such an effective horror flick. The whole notion of the synchroniser machine which lets people share thoughts & feelings is just ridiculous & is taken so seriously it becomes unintentionally funny & don't even start me on the whole 'good locust' thing, the dialogue is awful, the story is bizarre & makes little sense & the makers just disregard everything that made the original such a success. For me Exorcist II The Heretic was like a car crash, I know I shouldn't look at it but I couldn't help myself in a morbid masochistic sort of way.Director Boorman has made a real mess of this, there's nothing scary in it at all & at times it doesn't even feel like a horror film that much. At almost 2 hours (the widely available director's cut that has been released on DVD) it felt like it went on forever, nothing of any real interest happens & it has absolutely zero momentum as it randomly shifts back & forwards between America & Africa. Some of the special effects are reasonably impressive, the scenes where the camera seems to follow a single locust in close-up are very, very impressive as is some of the African cinematography. Unfortunately flying locusts just aren't that scary or interesting & there's no blood or gore apart from a ripped out heart & Regan only appears possessed for a very short period at the end. Apparently actress Linda Blair refused to wear Dick Smith's possessed make-up again so a double was used, who the hell does she think she is Joan Collins?!With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 this was the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made to that point, it's well made I suppose but a bit lifeless & bland.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"31 October 2007","score":"","review":" This is the film, for me, that cements my opinion on Steven Soderbergh. I saw where he was coming from when he made Traffic, even if it wasn't that great to me and really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven not for what the story was but for the way it was told. Here, Soderbergh has made a film and a debut film it must be said that shows he not only understands film but also how to unwind a story, give us characters who are believable and how to present the action on screen through the compositions; that is that he knows how to use the camera.Sex, Lies, and Videotape is an example of how to utilise a basic domestic problem with a relationship in a film but give it a voyeuristic twist, artistic camera-work and how to manipulated time and space. There are people who study voyeurism in film like it's a religion and camcorders in a film is a sure fire way to get those sorts of people excited but that's just the beginning of Sex, Lies, & Videotape. The film uses a straightforward problem as its drive for the narrative; that problem is a married man having an affair. What follows is a reunion with a friend called Graham Dalton (Spader) that the husband will really wish he hadn't set up as Dalton brings not only voyeurism but a threat to the exposure of the affair. Ann Mullany (MacDowell), whose husband John (Gallagher) is having the affair is presented as a shy and straightforward woman perhaps living an American Dream of her own nice house, money, food on the table, etc. but despite these humane and friendly traits, she is in a position she doesn't know about &#150; she may not like sex that much but John does and with people other than herself. This means these two people are sort of binary opposites to one another and yet they are joined by marriage &#150; an accident waiting to happen so already; Sex, Lies, and Videotape is creating a pressure cooker of events and characters who look set to explode once the dirty gets out.I mentioned that I thought Soderbergh's camera-work was really impressive in this film and that is a true statement. So often camera-work can go unnoticed or without acclaim but the way it's utilised in the film oozes of class. Take the scene in which some characters are arguing at a dinner table; the argument ends with a long take showing us the climax of it. One character is in the kitchen and we see this thanks to a shot in the corner of the room where the ceiling meets the wall; almost from the stairs if there were any there. This is the sort of angle you'd get from a close circuit television (CCTV) camera or a surveillance camera you get in security rooms we are watching the argument from on high, surveying the area as if we have a link with the world in which the film is being set; we are observant through the most voyeuristic shot possible the security camera shot since when you're watching someone through one of those, you can see them but they can't see you.Another incident occurs when John is on the phone to the girl he's having an affair with and yet the camera is set up to just include a photograph of Ann who's staring at John the whole time he's on the phone organising an illegal get-together. Not only does this tell us that John's wrong doing seemingly leaves him with a clear conscience as he talks to his mistress but also gives us enough information to have us form a very negative opinion of the character. Sex, Lies, and Videotape is also very good at combining genres since its brief pauses for scenes with the therapist and the barfly character act as pit stops away from the home and away from the lust and distrust. Not only this but they act as a good reason for humour and for Ann to tell us as well as the therapist what's she's thinking.

I saw where he was coming from when he made Traffic, even if it wasn't that great to me and really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven not for what the story was but for the way it was told. Here, Soderbergh has made a film and a debut film it must be said that shows he not only understands film but also how to unwind a story, give us characters who are believable and how to present the action on screen through the compositions; that is that he knows how to use the camera.Sex, Lies, and Videotape is an example of how to utilise a basic domestic problem with a relationship in a film but give it a voyeuristic twist, artistic camera-work and how to manipulated time and space. There are people who study voyeurism in film like it's a religion and camcorders in a film is a sure fire way to get those sorts of people excited but that's just the beginning of Sex, Lies, & Videotape. The film uses a straightforward problem as its drive for the narrative; that problem is a married man having an affair. What follows is a reunion with a friend called Graham Dalton (Spader) that the husband will really wish he hadn't set up as Dalton brings not only voyeurism but a threat to the exposure of the affair. Ann Mullany (MacDowell), whose husband John (Gallagher) is having the affair is presented as a shy and straightforward woman perhaps living an American Dream of her own nice house, money, food on the table, etc. but despite these humane and friendly traits, she is in a position she doesn't know about &#150; she may not like sex that much but John does and with people other than herself. This means these two people are sort of binary opposites to one another and yet they are joined by marriage &#150; an accident waiting to happen so already; Sex, Lies, and Videotape is creating a pressure cooker of events and characters who look set to explode once the dirty gets out.I mentioned that I thought Soderbergh's camera-work was really impressive in this film and that is a true statement. So often camera-work can go unnoticed or without acclaim but the way it's utilised in the film oozes of class. Take the scene in which some characters are arguing at a dinner table; the argument ends with a long take showing us the climax of it. One character is in the kitchen and we see this thanks to a shot in the corner of the room where the ceiling meets the wall; almost from the stairs if there were any there. This is the sort of angle you'd get from a close circuit television (CCTV) camera or a surveillance camera you get in security rooms we are watching the argument from on high, surveying the area as if we have a link with the world in which the film is being set; we are observant through the most voyeuristic shot possible the security camera shot since when you're watching someone through one of those, you can see them but they can't see you.Another incident occurs when John is on the phone to the girl he's having an affair with and yet the camera is set up to just include a photograph of Ann who's staring at John the whole time he's on the phone organising an illegal get-together. Not only does this tell us that John's wrong doing seemingly leaves him with a clear conscience as he talks to his mistress but also gives us enough information to have us form a very negative opinion of the character. Sex, Lies, and Videotape is also very good at combining genres since its brief pauses for scenes with the therapist and the barfly character act as pit stops away from the home and away from the lust and distrust. Not only this but they act as a good reason for humour and for Ann to tell us as well as the therapist what's she's thinking.

'Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)' sits as a fascinating anomaly among Capra's cinematic output, since I would have never associated him with black comedy, and yet this one is about as black as a deserted street on Halloween night. A spoof of the horrors and thrillers of the 1930s and early 1940s, 'Arsenic and Old Lace' casually blends murder, dead bodies, criminals and mental illness into a frantic, madcap black comedy with uproariously over-the-top performances and highly-amusing slapstick. The film opens normally enough, with famous dramatic critic and outspoken anti-marriage bachelor Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) quietly getting married to his sweetheart Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). The mere irony of this situation would undoubtedly have resulted in an excellent screwball comedy, but then the screenplay pulls its first twist.Mortimer's dear aunts &#150; purportedly the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever walked the earth &#150; have just poisoned their twelfth gentleman friend, an act of charity they extend to every lonely old man who comes their way! 'Arsenic and Old Lace' was based upon Joseph Kesselring's successful Broadway play of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. This cinematic farce of a film is undoubtedly one of the funniest comedies to emerge from the 1940s, featuring terrific quotable lines and a selection of the most absurd characters imaginable there is the understandably befuddled Mortimer, the two loving aunts with a dark secret (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair), a sinister Boris Karloff-lookalike (Raymond Massey), a creepy German surgeon (Peter Lorre), the lunatic brother who believes himself to be Theodore Roosevelt (John Alexander) and a collection of completely-clueless law-enforcement officers. With most of the story unfolding place in the one room, the film stays very much true to its theatrical roots, and, indeed, several of the performers from Kesselring's play Hull, Adair, Alexander reprised their roles for this film. As the tale unfolds, the circumstances slowly become more and more ridiculous, with poor Mortimer darting feverishly about town in an attempt to restrain a situation that has already expanded well beyond his control. Cary Grant is excellent in the main role, delivering a wide-eyed, frenzied, constantly-bewildered performance, doing more double-takes than Stanley Kubrick on the set of 'The Shining (1980).' Everybody else brings just the right amount of hyperactive exaggeration to their roles, and I particularly liked the character of Teddy; I laughed every time he ascended the stairs by blowing his bugle and screaming CHARGE!!! as though he was back at the Battle of San Juan Hill.

When I had slotted the disc of 'Arsenic and Old Lace' into my DVD player last night, I had absolutely no idea that it was a Halloween movie.

Though he turns the ear over to the local police, he can't resist getting involved, and with the police chiefs daughter Sandy (played by Laura Dern of Jurassic Park fame) in tow as his accomplice he lets his inquisitiveness get the better of him. When he links a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini of Wild At Heart and Immortal Beloved) to the mysterious crime, he's quickly pulled into her perverse world and hopes to be able to rescue her from the mentally unstable rapist Frank Booth (in his most recognized role since Apocalypse Now) A brief synopsis, to be sure, but to say anything more about the film is a injustice to those few who have yet to see it. Some things are better left to be evaluated, especially when dealing with a David Lynch film, which is more of a visual experience than anything else, similar to the work of Stanley Kubrick. Full of rich, dark and beautiful colours.At times fiercely satirical, yet horrifying and beautiful at others, Blue Velvet is considered by many to be Lynch's best film to date, and with a very good reason. Highlighted by brilliant performances from both Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini, this twisted take on small town secrets remains one of the most influential and original films of its kind, and unquestionably the most distinctive, and well recognized films of the 1980s (alongside Steven Spielberg's amazing E.T.). It has inspired countless movies and television series, even Lynch's own Twin Peaks, as well as the widely acclaimed American Beauty.Though some feel MacLachlan and Dern are at times dull and lifeless in their roles, I feel that they accurately capture the naivety and innocence that Lynch was striving for when he wrote the screenplay, well Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rossellini balance perfectly as too characters ridden with flaws. Lynch's trademark use of colours, metaphors and symbolism perfectly compliments his cynical world-view, presenting a world that is oft times familiar, but never what we expect.A darkly comic look at how twisted humanity can become, it really needs to be seen a few times to fully appreciate how much depth this film has to it. Part film noir, part comedy, part thriller, part crime, part erotic mystery, part psychological drama, and part horror film, Blue Velvet is truly a movie that transcends genres and identifying it into one small category is an exceedingly tough task. Lynch so effectively works perverse sexual kinks and disturbing moments of brutal violence into the framework of the seemingly innocent small town of Lumberton. What is so amazing is that after almost twenty three years, it steel has the power to scare and shock audiences witless, perhaps in the manner that the Exorcist did in the 1970s. A artistic masterpiece, no doubt.

Just tonight I was looking at a list of scariest move, and--surprise, surprise!--I found my long-lost mystery soul movie.

It was probably almost halfway when I turned the channel, so I didn't catch the title. It was way past my bedtime on a school night, but I couldn't pry myself away. I didn't realize it wasn't for kids because it was animated and there were rabbits. I remember feeling disturbed afterward. And years later I would still recall vivid images from the movie. The title remained a mystery for the longest time. I had no access to the Internet until the mid-90s (after college) so I couldn't dig it up. I also had no lead except that sad song.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"31 October 2007","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The main problem of this movie is that its subject was the murder of Reinhardt Heydrich, and that the treatment was nowhere near strong enough. The only time we see Heydrich he is presented as a petty, chubby, swaggering fool. In actual fact he was an unchained Satan, a key ideologue and architect of Holocaust. He was a handsome man, and a very capable one, having flown nearly 100 missions in a Messerschmitt fighter, and an excellent fencer, swimmer, and violinist. His bloodthirstiness was unrivalled, clearly outstripping Heinrich Himmler. He was the organiser and chair of the Wannsee conference where the plans for the extermination of European Jewry were finalised.At the start of this movie I wondered whether the action was taking place in some obscure American suburb of Prague, such was the reliance on American idiom and drawl. Brian Donlevy as the assassin, usually a great noir player, is acting below himself so much so that one can't help be confused by him. The Gestapo inspector Alois Gruber is a total cardboard cutout.The movie consists almost entirely of the efforts of the Germans to uncover the assassin of Heydrich. The efforts of the Germans are so toned down that I stared in disbelief. The truth is that the Gestapo's main technique for forcing women to talk was group rape. Miss Novotny suffers not even so much as a Chinese burn. The reprisals are also sanitised, in reality the Germans as well as murdering or imprisoning over 10,000 hostages, killed every male over the age of 16 in the two villages of Lidice and Le&#158;áky, burned the villages down and levelled the ruins.We must never forget the sheer vitriol of Nazism, to its credit the film did at least pay some lip service towards their efforts to Germanize the world. We must remember that their object was multi-genocidal, also the obliteration of all non-Germanic cultures, the obliteration of democracy, the obliteration of the family, the obliteration of the individual. They were not sausage-eating bullies, they were lucid death-worshipping fascists.
