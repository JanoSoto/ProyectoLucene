I say for most part because it somehow assumes that the public does not know about fingerprint identification or the fact that strangulation leaves marks on a victims neck. The murder in this movie is handled rather poorly from a technical perspective. Everything else around it is sharp and interesting. The movie is smart on an emotional level more than on a technical level.The main character dictates the story into a recorder, explaining what happened before each scene. He also explains straight from the start that he kills someone. You would think that this spoils the plot and any tension, but it does not, as the narrator only gives a brief description.In fact, the movie become quite tense towards the second half. At the beginning you are shown the situation of the main character being wounded and all the way until the end of the film you have a but a faint idea of how it may have happened. The story is quite good at keeping you sucked in.There are a couple of very good acting jobs here and a couple not so good ones. There is a gentleman, Richard Gaines, who plays the head of the insurance company. You do not see him for long but he had a very strange delivery of lines. Among the more well known actors is Edward Robinson (Little Caesar, Key Largo) as the claims adjuster and it is a delight to watch this sharp observant character. Barbara Stanwyck is the next strongest character as the main dame of the film, while the main male character played by Fred MacMurray is probably one of the weakest, with his typical film-noir delivery and saying baby all the time (quickly as if the word accidentally falls out of his mouth, like he is a Tourette's patient).There is nothing particularly outstanding about the music or visuals, other than it is all competent. The movie is well paced; the tension is good and the writing is fine as long as you do not mind a little bit of 40s stylization, like when the lady stares up at the guy with teary eyes and the screen is blurry as the dramatic violins play. I am not a big fan of that, but there is no denying that Double Indemnity is one of the strongest femme fatale movies.

Sadly, it seems to have become accepted more in the collective conscious of society, and I think that's a very bad development. Drugs and drug addiction continue to pull unwitting people into their web, often permanently. This movie, Christane F., is an exceptional movie on the horrors of drug addiction. A key part of that is having the human side of the issue in clear focus all the time.Christiane is a bored, aimless teenager in West Berlin in the 70s. I remember what it was like being a teenager. Suddenly, the comfort of being a kid was taken from you, and you were exposed to the real world and all of its difficult realities. That's enough to make anyone jaded, and there is nothing for Christiane to do in the boring apartment neighbourhood where she lives. She escapes her day-to-day life through the music of her idol, David Bowie. Desperate to feel alive, she has her eye on a new disco called The Sound. Even though too young to enter, she gets her friend to take her. But this new disco turns out to be a seedy teen hangout full of drugs and dealers. Christiane meets a guy there and falls in love with him. She'll do anything to keep this positive new influence in her life - even if that means sink into the world of drugs that he's slowly sinking into.This film hits close to home because of how utterly real it feels. You even come to understand, if not agree with, why Christiane chooses her path. After she falls in with her new clique of friends, there is an exhilarating scene of them running around Berlin, aimlessly and high on their freedom. David Bowie's Heroes plays throughout. These kids desperately want to escape their dark and dreary realities. Too bad that they end up choosing a means of escape that plunges them into an even darker reality. Frighteningly, and humanly, the characters are fully aware of their addictions. They just can't find the spirit to do anything about it.One particular scene is terrifying. Christiane and her boyfriend are locked in her mother's bedroom while cold turkey floods through them. The agony they project is quite hard to stomach, even when they're not coughing up blood. This drug destroys their lives, if not just their bodies, and while they know and want to escape their heroin addiction, their human insecurities make it difficult to do so. Slowly, indeed, they become less and less human in their constant search for the next fix.The actors were astonishing, so utterly believable, showing talent way beyond their years. Christiane F. is a frightening, sadly relevant movie about one of the darkest side-effects of society, and the deeply human turmoil that lands people there - often permanently. Fortunately, Christiane ultimately managed to escape her drug addiction, and hopefully this autobiographical story will keep other wayward kids from following her path.

The story is rather complex and one that you have to pay close attention to, but it is handled really well and doesn't become messy. With movies like this, it's easy for the story to become too confusing and muddled (like Looper, for example), but that, thankfully, isn't the case with Minority Report.

The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.This movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.Liam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.Some may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian.

The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.This movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.Liam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.Some may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian.

Sayer takes a particular interest in the catatonic patients and soon discovers patterns in their behaviour - they all have excellent reflexes. Sayer soon deduces that the catatonic victims were all victims of encephalitis which the patients had contracted several years earlier. Sayer discovers through various tests and experiments that these 'catatonic' patients are of sound mind, but their bodies are effectively paralysed. When Sayer learns of a new drug called L-DOPA he believes that this drug could give the catatonic patients a much better quality of life. Sayer is given permission to test this new drug on his test subject Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro). With the test on Lowe being a resounding success, Sayer eventually gets enough funding to administer the drug to all the 'catatonic' patients which essentially gives them a new lease of life...I personally thought that this was a wonderful film which gives the audience an excellent insight into the lives of patients that are catatonic. I believe that the modern interpretation of the illness depicted by Lowe and the others is now known as Locked In Syndrome - whereby the mind functions, but the rest of the body doesn't. Of all the disabilities out there, I suspect that this is one of the worst as it gives you such a low quality of life - being in a wheelchair or being blind doesn't restrict you quite as much as you think (the Paralympics have paved the way for many disabled athletes), but Locked In Syndrome is an entirely different kettle of fish.Lowe and Sayer form a tight bond throughout this film. Once Lowe has received several doses of L-DOPA, he starts to get his life back and understandably wants to take full advantage of the fact that his mind is no longer locked in his body. His new lease of life leads to some touching moments and a few funny moments (the scene where Lowe picks up the electric razor and doesn't know how to use it did make me laugh). It was also interesting to get an insight into the other catatonic patients thoughts once they have received the medication - when they're talking we get to see their various personalities which as I say was both interesting and funny. This also lead to one of the doctors uttering the line 'I preferred them the way they were' which did get a chuckle out of me.De Niro for me is the star of the show. I've always found him to be a good actor, but he very much plays against type here and for me this is probably his best performance. For De Niro to play so against type and to make it work this well means that he deserves extra credit for this role. Williams was OK as well, but he wasn't given as much to do (acting wise). This really was the De Niro and Williams show where the rest of the cast are given little else to do.There are several tender moments in this film (most notably the scene where Paula dances with Lowe in the hospital) - that scene was so touching and moving and was probably one of the best scenes in the film. The film ends strongly, although it is slightly more downbeat than I was expecting.Awakenings is a very good film that is funny, touching, heart-warming, sad & incredibly moved and well-acted. Recommended for fans of moving drama, although I do think that it is a film that everyone should watch.

However, despite being a much smaller sort of film, it has gained a cult-like following--and many folks think it's among the best films of the 1970s as well.

The answer, according to this film, is that you get a girl who looks like Kelly LeBrock! And that was in 1985. Just think what you might get today when computers are so much more powerful.Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly are two nerdish Chicago high school students. They are also unpopular with their male classmates and are picked on by the school bullies. Wyatt is also picked on by his unpleasant older brother Chet. Although they are only fifteen, however, their main obsession is their inability to find girlfriends. Inspired by an old Frankenstein movie, they try to remedy this problem by performing the aforementioned experiment and are greeted by the emergence from the bathroom of a beautiful young woman clad only in a T-shirt and pair of panties. Despite being only a few seconds old, the young lady, whom they name Lisa, is much more worldly-wise than Gary and Wyatt, and also has magical powers.Now the film doesn't simply end at this point with Lisa becoming Gary and Wyatt's girlfriend. Quite apart from the jealousy that such a ménage-a-trois would be likely to give rise to, there is also the problem that, despite her extreme youth, Lisa has the appearance of a woman in her mid-twenties, and even in the eighties a plot in which Kelly LeBrock becomes the lover of a pair of underage teenagers would not have found favour with the moral majority. (Today it would probably be banned as kiddie porn). So she becomes a fairy godmother who uses her powers to help the boys with their struggling love lives. By the end of the film, they have managed to lure away the former girlfriends of the two class bullies. (Unfortunately, neither girl is as attractive as Lisa, and the film does not really delve into whether their appalling taste in men actually makes them worth having).Actually, there seems to be a perfectly simple explanation for the duo's lack of success with girls. Gary, as played by Anthony Michael Hall, is so wet you could shoot ducks off him. As for Ilan Mitchell-Smith's Wyatt, shall I just say that the girls are probably looking for someone a bit more manly than a boy whose voice still hasn't broken in his mid- teens and who has a penchant for wandering round the house in women's underwear? The film might prefer the alternative explanation that the boys simply lack confidence, but to me they just came across as a pair of dreary wimps.The one really good performance comes from Bill Paxton as the obnoxious Chet, and LeBrock, a model who had previously only appeared in one feature film (The Woman in Red), does more than merely rely upon her good looks. (If only I could say the same of all models who have tried their hand at acting!) Overall, however, the film struck me as a failure, for two main reasons apart from the wimpishness of its male leads. The first has to do with the way the character of Lisa was conceived. She came across as far too self-assured and omnipotent, and did far too much to help the boys. If the intention was to help them gain confidence, making them so dependent upon an all-powerful fairy godmother seems like a weird way of doing it. It might have been more interesting if she had been fallible with fewer magical powers, initially confused and bewildered at having suddenly been conjured into existence with the body and mind of an adult, and then growing in confidence into a sort of loving big sister, being helped by the boys as well as helping them. At the same time the boys would also grow in confidence as they came to realise that this beautiful woman needed them as much as they needed her. Such a concept, however, might have been a bit too subtle for a movie, like this, subtlety being a concept largely alien to John Hughes who acted as both writer and director.The film's other drawback is that, like a lot of teen comedies, it relies too heavily on puerile or tasteless adolescent humour, with little if any genuine wit. (This was characteristic of eighties teen comedies, Drop Dead Fred being another classic example, although plenty have been made in a similar vein since). Some of Lisa's tricks seemed very mean-spirited cause and the plot at time seemed bizarre and inexplicable. (Hughes evidently thought that he needed to stress the weird element in the title). I understand that a remake of Weird Science is currently under consideration. If that is so, there is a lot of room for improvement on the original. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What do you get if you use a computer to design a perfect woman, taking your inspiration from old Playboy magazines, and then connect your computer up to a Barbie doll during an electric storm?

Despite being only a few seconds old, the young lady, whom they name Lisa, is much more worldly-wise than Gary and Wyatt, and also has magical powers.Now the film doesn't simply end at this point with Lisa becoming Gary and Wyatt's girlfriend. Quite apart from the jealousy that such a ménage-a-trois would be likely to give rise to, there is also the problem that, despite her extreme youth, Lisa has the appearance of a woman in her mid-twenties, and even in the eighties a plot in which Kelly LeBrock becomes the lover of a pair of underage teenagers would not have found favour with the moral majority. (Today it would probably be banned as kiddie porn). So she becomes a fairy godmother who uses her powers to help the boys with their struggling love lives. By the end of the film, they have managed to lure away the former girlfriends of the two class bullies. (Unfortunately, neither girl is as attractive as Lisa, and the film does not really delve into whether their appalling taste in men actually makes them worth having).Actually, there seems to be a perfectly simple explanation for the duo's lack of success with girls. Gary, as played by Anthony Michael Hall, is so wet you could shoot ducks off him. As for Ilan Mitchell-Smith's Wyatt, shall I just say that the girls are probably looking for someone a bit more manly than a boy whose voice still hasn't broken in his mid- teens and who has a penchant for wandering round the house in women's underwear? The film might prefer the alternative explanation that the boys simply lack confidence, but to me they just came across as a pair of dreary wimps.The one really good performance comes from Bill Paxton as the obnoxious Chet, and LeBrock, a model who had previously only appeared in one feature film (The Woman in Red), does more than merely rely upon her good looks. (If only I could say the same of all models who have tried their hand at acting!) Overall, however, the film struck me as a failure, for two main reasons apart from the wimpishness of its male leads. The first has to do with the way the character of Lisa was conceived. She came across as far too self-assured and omnipotent, and did far too much to help the boys. If the intention was to help them gain confidence, making them so dependent upon an all-powerful fairy godmother seems like a weird way of doing it. It might have been more interesting if she had been fallible with fewer magical powers, initially confused and bewildered at having suddenly been conjured into existence with the body and mind of an adult, and then growing in confidence into a sort of loving big sister, being helped by the boys as well as helping them. At the same time the boys would also grow in confidence as they came to realise that this beautiful woman needed them as much as they needed her. Such a concept, however, might have been a bit too subtle for a movie, like this, subtlety being a concept largely alien to John Hughes who acted as both writer and director.The film's other drawback is that, like a lot of teen comedies, it relies too heavily on puerile or tasteless adolescent humour, with little if any genuine wit. (This was characteristic of eighties teen comedies, Drop Dead Fred being another classic example, although plenty have been made in a similar vein since). Some of Lisa's tricks seemed very mean-spirited cause and the plot at time seemed bizarre and inexplicable. (Hughes evidently thought that he needed to stress the weird element in the title). I understand that a remake of Weird Science is currently under consideration.

The answer, according to this film, is that you get a girl who looks like Kelly LeBrock! And that was in 1985.

The Spy Who Loved Me improves on its predecessor in almost way bigger battles, more elaborate sets and effects shots, prettier scenery, and a more beautiful- and much more assertive female lead. If only Christopher Lee had been in this movie, instead of Golden Gun, we'd have a film to rival Goldfinger.The storyline is suitably over the top. After an alpine ski chase which ends in one of the most spectacular stunts ever performed on film, Bond (Roger Moore) is called back to London on urgent business. One of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines has been hijacked! A microfilm in Cairo may hold the key to solving the mystery, so it's off to Egypt. But Bond soon discovers that those connected to the microfilm have an alarmingly low life expectancy, and that he's not the only one seeking it. His rival is KGB major Anya Amasova (the stunning Barbara Bach.) Before long, the two have joined into an uneasy partnership, which is made tenser for the viewer by the knowledge that he's killed someone close to her, with neither one yet realizing it. The clues eventually lead to shipping baron Karl Stromberg (Curd Jurgens), who is planning nothing less than global domination.Besides being absolutely gorgeous, Anya is one of the toughest women Bond has ever come across. More than just a sidekick to drag along, she can hold her own in a fight, and even gets the better of Bond on occasion. Of course it wouldn't be a Bond movie if he didn't have to save her at least once, but we never get the feeling that this is going to become a pattern. The subplot about Bond having killed Anya's boyfriend adds an extra dimension to their relationship, and we tensely wait for them to put two and two together. The confrontation is well handled when it comes, and opens the possibility that she may kill Bond if the bad guys don't.Speaking of bad guys, TSWLM introduces one of the series' best villains yet, Jaws. Played by the massive Richard Kiel, Jaws is by far Bond's most physically powerful opponent, and practically indestructible to boot. No matter what happens to him, he just keeps coming back like the lead in a mad slasher, and indeed, during his early scenes he provides a real feeling of horror. Jurgens also does well with his role, coming across as intelligent, ruthless, and deeply insane. He's no Blofeld, but he comes fairly close.This movie is also very well made from a technical standpoint. The battle sequences towards the end are quite impressive, as are the effects shots, including the now-legendary scene in which the car turns into a submarine. The visuals are excellent as well, with wonderful location shots, especially in Egypt, and top-notch set pieces.One of the biggest problems with Golden Gun was the use of comic relief. The attempts to get laughs were laid on to heavy, and instead of providing a few chuckles they slowed down what should have been exciting scenes. Fortunately, the filmmakers have learned their lesson this time around, and deliver laughs without overdoing it. Most of the film's humor comes from Bond's quips and one-liners, although the funniest moment relies on a bit of automotive trouble that puts our hero completely out of his usual element. And I challenge you to keep a straight face when the closing theme rolls.There are of course ancient clichés and plenty of improbabilities, but we knew that coming in. The Spy Who Loved Me may not be high cinema, or the kind of masterpiece that filmmakers will seek to emulate for generations to come, but if it's entertainment you're looking for, count on it to deliver.

Although it does not contain the elements that traditionally compose a horror movie (blood, sudden shock-moments, etc.) this film is a masterpiece of its genre because it does not depend on these same elements to create a truly frightening and unsettling atmosphere.Guy (John Cassavetes) and Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) are a young couple facing a promising life together. Guy is an actor looking for his big break and Rosemary longs to be a mother. The two just moved into an apartment in the heart of Manhattan where they have as neighbors Roman (Sydney Blackmer) and Minnie Castavet (Ruth Gordon), a caring but nosy elderly couple. Guy develops a close relationship to his neighbors while his wife does not feel very comfortable around them. Finally, Rosemary's much desired pregnancy happens but brings unexpected complications the young woman begins to lose weight and to feel excruciating pains in her stomach. A series of unusual events, strange noises coming from the apartment next door and a strange obsession revealed by Minnie for her pregnancy, lead Rosemary to a state of complete distrust on those around her and fear for the baby that she's carrying.This whole storyline is framed perfectly by Polanski. The unsettling and gloomy atmosphere present throughout the film is immediately introduced by the strange lullaby sung by Mia Farrow during the opening credits. The architecture, decoration and lightning of the settings create in the viewer a constant sense of claustrophobia and the confusing succession of screenshots in some moments - particularly during the odd nightmare of Rosemary - implement in the public an almost asphyxiating feeling of anxiety that lasts for several hours after the end of the movie. In general, all the actors are very convincing in their roles and contribute a lot in creating a great familiarity between the viewer and the scene. However, there are two representations that stand out Mia Farrow is brilliant in the role of the innocent young pregnant woman, fragile and submissive, personality to which his avant-garde pixie hair cut offers an interesting counterpoint, and Ruth Gordon offers a sublime interpretation of the comic yet sinister Minnie Castavet. Roman Polanski leads the suspense masterfully, revealing the whole plot progressively, creating a very intimate connection between the viewer and the main character. This turns to be particularly brilliant when, instead of ending the film with some unexpected and shocking happening, he chooses a predictable but inevitable conclusion, as if we all knew bad things were meant to happen and there was no way out. This makes the story even scarier.Personally, I don't like to feel anxious and scared, so to say that I have suffered every second of this film is the best thing I can say about it.

Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a senior executive at Sea World, where Sean (John Putch) visits after college. No Brody family reunion would be complete without a big ole shark to remind the boys and us of their glory days. Forcing its way into Sea World though an unsecured gate, the shark snacks on staff and coral poachers while the Brodies and their babes frolic in temporary ignorance, until it all hits the fan at the park's big opening.The concept isn't that terrible. It's what the writers and director Joe Alves do with it that boggles the mind with sheer stupidity. Watching Quaid and the other actors utter weird inanities that supposedly pass for normal conversation is odd enough, without the wince-inducing performance by Bess Armstrong as the park's whale and dolphin manager and Mike's girlfriend. She seems to have raided Sandy Duncan's medicine cabinet and taken all her peppy pills. Then there's Lea Thompson as Sean's sudden new girlfriend, who thinks nothing of stripping down and enticing her new man to take a swim.I bet I can overcome your childhood fears, she says, wading into the water in just her bra and panties.OK, I admit, that does sound pretty good. But take it from me, it's not. All you do is watch these cutesy scenes and wait like Captain Ahab for that big fish to show up. When it comes, it's not worth the wait.The shark attacks are filmed in such a ridiculous fakey way you feel insulted rather than scared. You get a rush of bubbles, someone ducking their head underwater, stock footage of some shark filmed in Australia, and that's it. Oh, yeah, and a detached arm, pointing out at the screen to take advantage of something called Arrivision 3D. The compositions are so stiff it hardly matters.The big stiff is the shark itself, alternately a matte shot of a still image moving with glacial slowness toward the camera, or a rubberized model so fake it actually folds when it rams into something. At one point, we see Armstrong's character wading in a pool with the shark, pretending to nurse it while she actually pushes it around the water like Bela Legosi did that rubber octopus. Would anyone with any ocean sense get in a pool with a Great White? Well, I guess yes if it's more likely to capsize than bite someone, as the case is here.I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Simon MacCorkindale, who plays a roguish English adventurer and gives Jaws 3 its one source of true charm. He spends a lot of time bouncing around acting cocky and trading quips with Louis Gossett, Jr.'s park-owner character, but he is undeniable fun when he's on screen working his proto-Aaron Eckhart vibe so engagingly. He and Craig T. Nelson in The Osterman Weekend are my 1983 Doe Avedon nominees for giving the best performance in a bad film. But, oh, the thanks poor Simon gets&#x85;After devouring several people and 90 precious minutes of your life, the shark concludes matters by smashing into the viewscreen of an underwater control room. It's the most ridiculous shot in a movie full of bad shots, more so as Alves for some reason plays it in slow motion.I think it was slow motion; it was hard to be sure. Everything in this movie runs so slow time loses all meaning after a while. Jaws 3 is such a bad movie it becomes kind of fun in a warped way to see what nutty tricks they pull next, something you can't say of a lot of halfway-decent films held down by competent directors and logical plots. I guess Jaws The Revenge is actually worse than this, based as it is on the idea of an actual vengeance-seeking shark seeking out the Brody clan. The silly fish needn't have bothered; Jaws 3 did a better job finishing them off than he ever could.
