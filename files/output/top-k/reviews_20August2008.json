It could've been the kind of corny 'this is what I learned and now I'm blah blah' kind of storytelling that gets excruciating after a while in Hollywood movies. Apparently, thankfully, Ridley Scott knew this and took on White Squall as a challenge take a character ensemble, the kind of 'male camaraderie' picture that with a few alterations (i.e. reduce some sexual content) could have been produced in the 50s or 60s with a Burt Lancaster or other as the lead, and make it mostly tough and sentimental only in that rugged John Ford sort of sensibility. He succeeded admirably as his film is what it wants to be, which is surprising considering the it's Dead Poets Society at sea criticisms I had read online. It's fairly old-fashioned in some ways, but its presented in all the ways that matter.What's also impressive is seeing Scott attempt an ensemble based around character and, up until the last quarter of the picture, not really based on plot. He's done other pictures that have been ensembles, in fact a lot of them, but mostly they're wrapped around the story as it unfolds. In White Squall a lot of things happen, and characters come and go and lessons are learned and there are even a few tears, but it's based around character and it's fascinating to see Scott work with this nearly loose structure. Certainly his cast is a big help, as Jeff Bridges makes an equally formidable lead as the Skipper of the Albatross, the ship for a group of young men going for many months out to sea to become men, or rather take the SATs and become a stronger community on a ship. While we only see snippets of how excellent he can be as an actor throughout until the final agonizing scenes during and after the ship wreck, the rest of the cast holds up just as well (Scott Wolf, Balthazar Getty, Ethan Embry, a really good Jeremy Sisto in an unpredictable 'rich kid' role, and John Savage as the older 'intellectual' type).It goes without saying sometimes White Squall does run into some hokey or just some territory that is almost put in as an intentional INSPIRATION scene (in caps), like when the boys are at the remote island and run around up the hill to sign that buried book. Yet it's not what doesn't work but what does that makes the film impressive, and it holds up extremely well against its counterparts that don't have a keen eye for the facts in the story as well as making the characters not simply cardboard cut-outs. It's pretty conventional, but in the finest way imaginable, and has a pretty amazing climax out at sea with the title event (maybe not Perfect Storm but without computers all the more impressive).

I can almost remember seeing Jurassic Park as a kid in the movie theatre for the first time and if you asked me then if I liked it I probably would have told you that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen and meant it. Years later, seeing it again, it has perhaps some of that youthful exuberance I once felt for it but that doesn't make it any less powerful and brilliant and wonderfully created. I think just seeing the film outside of a movie theatre takes away some of the magic because the dinosaurs just aren't as enormous and terrifying and jaw dropping as they are on a 200 foot movie screen. Still I did pick Jurassic Park to be the first movie I watched on my beloved new 42 Inch Plasma which helped a great deal. The characters are intricately created and you become enthralled in their adventure. Spielberg has always had a way of making characters come to life and you become completely attached to them which makes the story even better. On top of that Jurassic Park coins the thrill a minute phrase giving you a non stop jaw dropping riveting story about action and danger and of course dinosaurs of all kinds. The film is just quite simply a modern day classic. One of my favourite scenes in movie history is the scene with the Tyrannasaurus Rex attacking the jeep for the first time with Tim trapped inside. That scene has stayed with me for years along with the Raptors in the kitchen later on in the film. The movie is not soft enough for really little kids but it's not too edgy for the pre-teen\/teen crowd but definitely edgy and intelligent enough for any adult or movie lover to watch again and again.Jurassic Park started me on a brief love affair with Sam Neill. His dry and often snarly performance as Dino genius Dr. Allan Grant was perfect. I think his performances in other films as well as this one could be interpreted as an acquired taste but there is something just perfect about the way he interacts with the cast and the script for the movie. Laura Dern is also good as Ellie Sattler. Although she wasn't my favourite character she added a tone of emotion and a strong female lead and had good chemistry with Neill. Jeff Goldblum was just terrific, possibly one of his best roles as he too tends to be an acquired taste, as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician who warns right from the beginning of playing God. Goldblum is level headed and definitely delivers some of the best lines in the film as the comic relief in a serious deadpan kind of way. Legendary actor Richard Attenborough returned to acting after fifteen years away to portray Billionaire John Hammond, the creator and mastermind of Jurassic Park. He is terrific in many ways and just really captures the character and his conflict with what he's created. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lexi Murphy, Hammond's grandkids. Both are terrific and really capture the teen audience very well and have some really hair raising scenes. Neither of them unfortunately went on to much else but they were terrific in this film. One of the most under used characters that I really thought could have also been a leading role was Bob Peck who played Robert Muldoon. He had a mysterious hero quality about him and I really wanted to see more of him as he ended up facing his greatest fears in the raptors when they escape. He was terrific in the small role he was given. The top notch supporting cast is also amazing including the legendary Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong, and Martin Ferrero as the blood sucking lawyer as Hammond refers to him.This is just one of those films, especially by Spielberg that was destined to be a classic and it is one you can watch over and over again which I have done frequently. The movie has an amazing story, riveting action and everything that makes an epic film amazing. Perhaps they dropped the ball by serializing the films (although the second book by Creighton was amazing) and I will get to reviewing the sequels too but no matter how you look at it, the first Jurassic Park is a movie that every single person must see period. 10 out of 10***Update*** Had the amazing opportunity to see Jurassic Park in its (unfortunately 3D) Re-release. While the 3D changed nothing and wasn't even that impressive, seeing the movie on the big screen was amazing...again. I even got a little bit emotional seeing a few of the scenes again that shaped my movie going as a youngster. This movie is still a modern day epic classic.

His first two, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, are polarizing with Bond fans, but I was reasonably impressed with them, and knowing that The Spy Who Loved Me, Moore's third, was generally thought of as superior to its two predecessors, I had higher expectations before watching it, not that I was exactly expecting Goldfinger. After watching it, I think I can say my expectations were met.A Royal Navy Polaris submarine containing sixteen nuclear warheads vanishes while on patrol, and the same happens to a Soviet submarine! So, it is time for James Bond to once again set out on a mission, and this time, the culprit is Karl Stromberg, the successful owner of a shipping firm who lives a secluded life in an underwater palace and has plans to destroy the world! On the mission, Bond meets Major Anya Amasova (a.k.a. Agent XXX), a Russian agent who has also been sent on a mission after the abduction of these submarines. At first, they are against each other, fighting over the microfilm that contains Stromberg's tracking system, but eventually, they are assigned to work together to try and foil Stromberg's evil plans. More than once, they will have to face Jaws, Stromberg's giant henchman who is very strong and can kill people with his metal teeth!While Moore's third Bond film is no shorter than the first two, it is a tad more consistent. Personally, I think I found less tedious moments in this one (even if some sequences are quite long, they usually kept me intrigued). As one would hope for in a James Bond flick, The Spy Who Loved Me has a good amount of action and some delightfully suspenseful moments, obviously including some fights, as well as some other memorable ways Bond risks his life in his attempts to save people! In addition to that, there's also quite a bit of humour, including the part where Jaws tries to destroy the van as Bond and Amasova attempt to get away in it, as well as many other scenes, some very funny and some just mildly amusing. Bond also goes to a number of different places on his mission in this movie, from Egypt to the ocean, so some parts have a different feel to them than others, which I would say is a good thing.Now, I will admit this film does have its downsides, such as a slightly disappointing and maybe a tad lazy ending, but overall, the fine combination of suspense and humour for much of the film makes up for the flaws. Apparently, Richard Kiel, who played Jaws in this film (a memorable Bond villain, also featured in Moonraker), got to play the character again in the lacklustre 1999 Disney film, Inspector Gadget (based on the cartoon show of the same name from the eighties), this time referred to as the Famous Big Guy with Silver Teeth, but even though I've seen the movie, I can't remember that.

Loosely based on the French science fiction comic book by Jean-Claude Forest, it was director by French director Roger Vadim, at the time married to American actress Jane Fonda. Why she did this role we'll never know; it appears to have been made to please her husband, whose views of American and French\/European sexuality is clearly stamped into the film while at the same time selling out to American 1960's pop culture. But free love and pop art aren't things that really form part of Barbarella which is ultimately a silly erotic adventure that classifies as soft-core pornography. Barbarella (Fonda) is an American government agent in the far-out future as only the wild 1960's could conjure up. War has become a thing of the past, and the planets are aligned in peace. Free love reigns. But the ambitious and demented scientist Dr. Durand Durand has left earth with a newly invented planet and escaped into another planet. The French Earth President (Claude Dauphine) assigns Barbarella to find the missing scientist. Off she goes on her adventure. Throughout the film, she encounters a variety of bizarre, mysterious and exotic characters from a blind angel (John Phillip Law) who, after a sexual encounter, inspires him to fly once more, a Catch-Man who makes love the old-fashioned way, lost souls entrapped in a labyrinth, leather-made, souless soldiers and the Black Queen, a bisexual and wicked tyrant who rules the decadent Soddom-and-Gomorrah type City of Night. Upon her arrival into the city, the angel is crucified and taken prisoner of the Black Queen who uses him for sex, and Barbarella is subject to Durand Durand's orgasm machine, whose powerful keys can trigger a fatal orgasm.If all these elements sound like the plot to a 1970's porno-theater movie, this is exactly what Barbarella is like, only without the graphic sex scenes. While there is nudity (such as the opening scene in which Barbarella strips in zero gravity) it's done in the softest of soft-core manner, worthy of the images in 1960's Playboy magazines. The sex is implied but never shown, but while Barbarella engages in sex with men to thank them for assisting a government agent, the sex is worthy of soft-core porn set to really good music. The script is as lousy as a porno and attempts to be very comical. The problem is the British, French and Italian actors in the movie are not trained in comedy (neither is Fonda who mostly spews one-liners like I'm not tube kind of girl) so the result is mostly dry comedy without any real ha-ha-ha moments. But the best parts of the film the 1960's signature. It's a time capsule of late 60's pop culture, from references to the pill to the easy sexuality and free love to the total irreverence (i.e. an angel, always associated with holy love and God\/religion, succumbs to sex by both Barbarella and the evil Black Queen). The Matmos, a primal force of nature looks like the inside of a lava lamp waiting to break through the glass. While there is not much drug use, there is a scene in which men and women are getting high on essence of man and resembles smoking pot or weed. It's also a very campy, kitschy, surreal film designed to look like some hippie's drug trip. The colorful sets and imagery is unlike anything audiences had seen before, like some sprawling work of graphic novel art. The music by Michel Magne and James Campbell is absolutely wonderful, dramatic and yet fun, loose, light jazzy melodies, a terrific composition of film music. The cinematography by Claude Renoir is a combination of Flash Gordon type of sci-fi imagery (bizarre spaceships, rock formations, planets) and the costumes by Jacques Fonteray and Paco Rabane are delicious 1960's camp and very sexy. The film is meant to be a lot of fun, despite the slight longeur and slow pace. Be warned this film is hardly feminist, despite the female heroine looking like a space warrior. She is the figure of Roger Vadim's fantasies about seductive women using sex as their only form of power over men. Barbarella never once really uses her brains or brawns. It's all sex. The movie influenced space warrior girl movies found in pornography of later years like the 1980's and 1990's as well as comedies like Austin Powers (Duran Duran and Dr. Evil are very similar). Barbarella is a movie of it's era.

There are many factors which works wonder in favor of this movie. Among them1. The biggest plus point for this movie to be what it is, is the casting of Newman, Redford and Ross. Apart from the obvious declaration that screen chemistry between Newman-Redford is one of the best of all times, chemistry between Newman-Ross and Redford-Ross are some of the other highlights of the movie. Especially, Newman-Ross scene where they ride in a bicycle is pure joy to watch with the background musical score. Not to mention each scene where Newman and Redford share together are some of the finest moment's cinema lover could ask for.2.The other major selling point of this movie is that it doesn't have the usual elements of most other westerns which are there all the times i.e., needless bloodshed\/ revenge plot\/ gun tricks and so on. So this way it was a complete different viewing experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot. Hero here is not interested in taking revenges, he is not very thrilled by the prospect of killing, and he knows the odds against him when there are many villains involved. And yet he does the things westerners do, like robbing trains, loving women, and killing when utmost necessary.3. Other major factor is the Cinematography. I won't be exaggerating when I suggest that this is the foremost beautiful movie to be photographed, ever! The picturesque landscapes, the white flowing river and everything from day-night to train to houses to people are all so meticulously captured on the camera and with such beautiful, smooth colors that I am totally amazed by this work. Hats off to Conrad Hall for his marvelous efforts.4. Background music is really good, especially in the bicycle scene and in general throughout the movie. It is very different from music so often related to westerns. 5. Direction is superb, dialogs are smart and witty.I have tried to cover all the pluses that came to my mind, but still feel I missed some although some on purpose because if I start writing on those it will take more time for me to finish this comment.

It's just as well that he turned it down on account of something rather stupid (He wanted top billing over arch-rival Paul Newman). This is Bobby Redford's best role. It would be unimaginable for anyone else to play the Sundance Kid. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a non-stop thrill ride and a good old fashioned zany comedy along with being the best movie ever in my humble opinion.

After all, this was at the height of the counter-culture. Regardless, this is the one film you must see before you die. As a matter of fact, to call it a mere Western or a Comedy or a 60's flick is to do this movie a grave injustice. This movie lies within the range of Most Under-appreciated Movie Ever to Greatest Film of All Time. If you disagree, seek immediate psychiatric help! You've been gauged as mentally disturbed.

Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film. In this film we are introduced to one of the most well-known and most-imitated characters of the saga (and movies in general), Yoda. This character brings about not only some of the most humorous bits of the movie, but also some of the most important and challenging ones. It has a bit of a slow start, which is really the only reason I rate it less than the original. I'm not really sure why I prefer the original, but there are few circumstances when I like a sequel almost as much as the first film. The lightsaber battle at the end is probably the most intense one in the entire saga, and if you are unaware of how it turns out, watch it now and find out.

Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake.

There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school. I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent.

First off let me start by saying that the Special Effects still hold up well today, so I could only imagine how in awe people must have been at them back in 1933. King Kong also manages to do what few movies do - and that is it manages to never have a single dull moment in it's entire 104 minute length. Unlike the Jackson remake, this one moves at a brisk pace, never leaving you with a single moment of boredom. The performances are all solid, though some of it can be a bit hammy, but that's more of a product of the times than anything else. I can tell you that the Kong Vs T-Rex fight is far more realistic in this one than the Jackson version. I for one wasn't buying Kong defeating three T-Rex's at once, while falling at the same time. This one shows Kong having a tough time defeating the T-Rex, but of-course ultimately defeating him after a lengthy but entertaining fight. I also liked the relationship between the girl and Kong better in the 33 version as it didn't feel as sappy or as contrived as Jackson remakes did. Anyway, I give this movie a 10\/10, and it falls somewhere in my top ten horror movies. Of the three King Kong Movies made, this one is by far the best, with Jackson's remake coming in a distant second, and the 1976 remake in dead last.

I was prepared to accept this film would be mostly background and story development, and that I wouldn't fully appreciate it until I'd seen Episodes II and III. All fair enough.But Lucas made the problem worse by starting too far back, to the point where the movie feels almost disconnected from the Star Wars story. The political crisis at the centre of the plot is supposed to highlight the beginning of the Republic's downfall, but is too mundane and obscure to be engaging. Some trade companies are protesting- big deal. And it's impossible to make any connection between the obnoxious boy Anakin and the greatest villain ever seen. Perhaps Lucas was trying to highlight from little things big things grow- how Anakin's bratty cockiness foreshadows Darth Vader's evil? It might have worked if the child Anakin was an interesting character, but he's just plain annoying and adds nothing to the story. There's no real reason the prequels couldn't have started as Episode II did, with Anakin already a young Jedi, which makes this whole movie a waste of time.There's also a very leaden feeling to the production, a problem which plagues all three prequels. The spontaneous fun of the originals is missing, and the acting and dialogs is often predictable and wooden. Jar Jar was the one attempt at injecting some humour, and fails horribly. And Darth Maul, the most interesting character of the lot, is largely sidelined. In fact, pretty much everything ends up sidelined by the complicated political posturings that clog up most of the film. Even the battle scenes have a very sterile and forced nature to them, probably because you're so bored by that stage you don't care anymore.The only thing I really liked about this movie was watching Palpatine skilfully manipulate the trade crisis as his first step to becoming Emperor.

Clues begin popping up that eventually affirm his suspicion that all is not right, and for the rest of the film he sets about trying to fix that.Jim Carrey isn't usually my favourite guy, but in this movie, he was simply amazing. Likable, funny, and easy to empathise with, this is easily one of the best performances of his acting career. All of his main supporting actors are great too, and you'll recognise all of them.No matter what kind of person you are, no matter what kind of movies you like, The Truman Show will be enjoyable to you. I promise.

Once there Susan sees another student named Pat Hingle (Eva Axén) running from the academy, some time later at her friends apartment Pat is viciously murdered. The next morning & the police question various students & teachers at the academy & Susan realise that she was the last person to see Pat alive the night before. Thinking about the chance meeting Susan remembers that Pat actually spoke to her when they passed each other but the loud thunder masked her words, deciding to investigate Pat's death & several other mysterious incidents at the academy Susan discovers that the academy was founded by an evil nineteenth century Witch named Elena Markos who may still be alive in the building doing evil Witch type things...This Italian produced fantasy horror film was co-written & directed by Dario Argento & stands out as one of his most visually impressive works, in fact Suspiria is one of the most sumptuous & best looking horror films out there in my humble opinion. Unfortunately while few could reasonably argue about Argento's style, imagination & competence as a filmmaker I personally think that few could argue successfully that Argento knows how to write films, construct plots that aren't ridiculous & flesh out character's beyond simplistic stereotypes. After an almost imperious start that oozes style, atmosphere, gore & an Argento trademark terrific set-piece murder it all goes downhill with a story & plot that really doesn't go anywhere or draw you in or engage in any satisfying way. In fact once the first impressive murder set-piece is out of the way little actually happens for what seems like an eternity, in fact it's around the hour mark before the next murder takes place & between the first & second murders not a lot happens. Then there's the Witchcraft exposition scene which has all the subtly of a sledgehammer, towards the end Susan visits some Witchcraft expert guy & in a scene which is there purely to get some exposition across & set up the instantly predictable twist ending this guy gives a long very forced sounding speech on Witchcraft & the academy in general. From that moment on you know, you just know how Suspiria is going to end. I appreciate that Aegento was trying to create some sort of abstract & weird environment & world in Suspiria but a lot of things from earlier in the film aren't addressed satisfactorily at the end, in particular the reason why so many character's act so oddly & weirdly is never really explained & the whole film ends up feeling silly & strange which is maybe what Argento wanted but I can't say I like it.The one area where Suspiria scores big points is in the style & cinematography departments. Suspiria quite simply looks fabulous from start to finish, the rich colour schemes, the precise framing of the shot & the silky camera movements all add up to make Suspiria a visual treat but whatever you do make sure you at least watch the full 2351 widescreen version & if you can manage it an anamorphic DVD on a good widescreen telly since it really does look stunning at times. Symetery seems to play a big part in Argento's shots here, lots of shots are every symmetrical with panelling & wooden beams being repeated on both sides of the frame, big arch ways with exactly the same pot plant decorations either side & even the swimming pool featured has a perfectly symmetrical tile pattern at it's bottom. The colours are extremely rich consisting of neon reds & blues, there were times when I thought the wallpaper in certain rooms were made of velvet they look so textured. There's not too much gore here & relatively few death's, there's a stabbing & a close-up of a beating heart in a cut open chest being stabbed, a hanging, there's a brief slit throat, a guide dog bites his masters throat out & a large pin is stuck in someones neck. Special effects are good but why do filmmakers insist on using rubber bats? They always look awful!Shot on location in Germany & in the studio in Italy the film has good production values & looks fabulous but the story & plot are far less satisfying which is a shame. The film was completely dubbed (according to an interview with star Jessica Harper the film was shot like a silent film & only a couple of scenes had live sound shot) so the original performances are hard to judge & I found it very odd listening to Udo Kier in this, I instantly recognised his face but his voice is dubbed by someone who doesn't sound a bit like him.Suspiria is one of those films where style wins out over substance, I think it's a great film to sit down & watch on a purely visual level but the story & plot are noticeably weak & surely if Suspiria didn't look as good as it does & it wasn't directed by Argento no-one would ever have heard of it today. The Hollywood remake Suspiria (2010) is currently in development.
