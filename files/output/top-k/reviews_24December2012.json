It will certainly not be to everyone's taste. The principal character, well played by Billy Bob Thornton, is a taciturn barber in a small California town. He's intentionally a nobody in a nobody setting who gets caught up in a spider's web of interlocking crimes. I won't say anything about the plot, which is a variation on the scenarios of other noir films. It's strength lies in the odd, often humorous perspective that the Coen brothers bring to all their films. This one is different than some of their previous work because the humor is, for the most part, subtler and the principal characters are intended to be ordinary people living ordinary, uninteresting lives in a mostly uninteresting way. But the acting is excellent, drawing on the talents of actors like Frances McDormand who are regulars in Coen films, newcomers to their stable (James Galdofini) and the young Scarlette Johanssen. My wife and I are Coen devotees, so we liked it. Others may find it slow-moving before it finally gets going. There's no one in the movie to like, not even Johanssen in the end. It's in black and white, which many film-goers don't care for. And film noir is film noir -- a passion for some, not so for others. See it or don't accordingly.

I have just watched the film this evening on Christmas Eve 2012, and every time I watch the movie, it just gets more powerful and grander each year. The film is on top of thousands of peoples lists around the world as the greatest film ever made. It is definitely my favourite film. I am seventeen years old, and you would think the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life' would die out in the older generations, but no, it gets more magical through every generation that comes.Have you ever herd the expression, They don't make films like that anymore. Well, the thing is, they don't. And really, there is never going to be anything in the whole history of motion pictures that will be greater than this masterpiece classic. The moral to this film is that no man is a failure who has friends (as written by Clarence inside the 'Tom Sawyer' book in the film).The film is brilliantly casted with exceptional roles from James Stewart (who should have won an Oscar for the role, never mind just getting a nomination), Donna Reed (the smart and beautiful actress who every man would love to be an ideal wife or mother), and Lionel Barrymore (for his exceptional role as the wicked Scrooge like character, Mr. Potter). The film was nominated for five Oscars without winning any, you can thank 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946) and the film critics for that. Really nowadays, you don't hear anyone talking about that film. A lot of films that are at the top of polls have never won an award anyway, like 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1992). Both 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' topped a poll in the Empire magazine for the greatest film never to win an Oscar (IAWL came second). But gladly, the film did win a Golden Globe for Best Directing (Frank Capra) in 1947.

Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa Cárdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obregón II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama.

Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa Cárdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obregón II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture &#x96; Drama.

Bruce Dern does a fine job as Lowell; playing him in a way that makes the viewer wonder whether he is a good man doing what it takes to save the last plants or whether the realisation that the last eight years may have been for nothing has driven him insane. The three drones; which he dubs Huey, Dewey and Louie are suitably cute without being anthropomorphised. There is nothing unsuitable in the film but I suspect younger viewers may be put off by the relatively slow pace and lack of action... and by the fact that there is only one human character for much of the film.

Basically, set in the time before and during the First World War, 1917, in the central California coastal towns of Monterey and Salinas, Cal Trask (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dean) is the son of modestly successful farmer Adam Trask (Raymond Massey); his father favours his brother Aron (Richard Davalos) more than him and he is bitter and moody because of this. Both Adam and Aron were made to believe that mother\/wife Kate (Oscar winning, and BAFTA nominated Jo Van Fleet) had died, but in fact she is alive and well and running a successful brothel, only Cal visits her knowing this, and he also makes plans to earn back the money that his father lost in unsuccessful business ventures and gain his respect, his mother lends some money to help him do this. We also see Cal gaining the affections of Aron's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris), he is reluctant for a while knowing that she is already seeing his brother, but he gives into his feelings and they share some close moments, and together they plan a surprise birthday party for his father where he will give him the money he has made. It is at the party though that Aron announces he and Abra are to be engaged, Adam is happy but she and Cal are uneasy, and the situation gets worse when Cal gives his father the money he has earned honestly, but he refuses to take it thinking it was earned in some wartime scheme, Cal sees this as another emotional rejection. In a moment of anger Cal goes against the wishes of his mother and takes his brother Aron to see that she is still living, and Adam demanding to know where Aron is gets told about her as well, in drunkenness Cal's brother enlists in the army, Sam the Sheriff (Burl Ives) tells Adam this and he rushes to stop the train, but he is too late. With the incredible strain Adam is paralysed and unable to communicate when he suffers a stroke, Abra is left in a room with him, and he begs her to show some true affection to Cal before it is too late, and Cal finally gets words of acceptance from his father, with the two lovers close by the bedside. Also starring Albert Dekker as Will Hamilton, Lois Smith as Anne, Harold Gordon as Gustav Albrecht, Timothy Carey as Joe, Mario Siletti as Piscora, Lonny Chapman as Roy and Nick Dennis as Rantani. Dean gives a good performance as the frustrated teenager who longs for his father's attention and a meaning in life, Van Fleet with her time on screen gives a deserved award winning performance as the secretive, protective and emotionally suffering mother, and the other supporting cast members do well also, the story I admit was a little short of plot and tiny parts difficult to grasp, but I did like the romantic element, and you can see why Dean has become an icon in the short film career he had, a watchable psychological drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture &#x96; Drama.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"24 December 2012","score":"","review":" Holy Smoke ! is an amazing film by one of the most original directors as Jane Campion(An Angel at my table,The piano,Portrait of a Lady).It tells the story of a young Australian woman,Ruth Barron(Kate Winslet),who in her journey in India is manipulated by a guru and is turned into a proselyte. The family tries to get her back by hiring an eccentric and apparently self-assured American cult exit,P.J. Waters(Harvey Keitel)and isolate the two of them in a lonely hut in the middle of the Australian desert. The fight between Ruth and P.J. take an unexpected turnthe battle field changes from religion to sex;Ruth becomes the master and P.J. surrenders to her overwhelming sexuality. The film manages to reflect on the power of ideas, sex fight and the at first glance self-confidence of west culture and beliefs(Ruth's family lacking of values and coherence,P.J. attitudes)and the subsequent quest for paramount meanings(Ruth's absolutism)in a world that can be dangerous. The direction is wonderful and Jane Campion give us a very absorbing film even though sometimes difficult to catch. After a plodding beginning you can't help but feeling captured by this strange but absorbing film. The acting is superb. Harvey Kaitel is a confirmation and delivers particularly well. Kate Winslet is a revelation. She completely disappears in her difficult and sometimes hateful character and becomes body ans soul Ruth. It's a testament for her great versatile acting. My vote is 10\/10.
