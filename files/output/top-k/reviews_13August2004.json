Let's start with the good parts of this movie the special effects were superb. Godzilla and his\/her children looked flawless, and I especially like the new look. If you look at the pictures of the iguanas (or komodo dragons, whichever they were), you can see a lot of similarities in design, skin patters, everything. For the first time, I can see see exactly how a creature like that would have evolved. Though a lot of people complained about the eggs being useless time-filler, I thought the idea was pretty good; after all, how long can an audience watch the army shoot at Godzilla before they officially get bored?Right here, I think I have to put a positive note on my favorite part of the movie right after the attack on the eggs, when the supposedly destroyed Godzilla shows up and sees the dead babies... and then sees the humans responsible. You can hear the entire audience saying, Oh man, now he's pissed.However, the actors were poorly picked, obviously chosen because no major actor would touch this role with a 10-foot pole. Matthew Broderick is a great actor (he's proves himself on stage and screen), but he just doesn't fit into the action-move leading man, coming off more as a wuss than anything else. Maria Pitillo is in the same situation; even though her character is supposed to be a nice-girl stereotype, even when she is trying to show how tough she can be, we just can't help but laugh. Aww, the sweet little girl wants to be a bitchy reporter! Sorry, just doesn't work. Jean Russo, Kevin Dunn, and Hank Azaria are the best parts of the whole movie, though most of Azaria's lines were put in for comic relief than anything else (mostly good, but often excessive). Unfortunately, the second bad part is the realism of the whole movie (besides the giant lizard walking through downtown trying to catch a cab). Read any other review and it will give you countless reasons why nothing in this movie won't make sense. My main complaints include the stupidity of the army, the needless jab at Siskel and Ebert, and how I couldn't stop comparing the babies to the raptors of Jurrasic Park.

Fair enough. I grabbed Baise-Moi and the tepid if enjoyable, Last Kiss.Let's stay with this pairing. First of all &#133; Comes the premise, 'literature must be larger than life.' So said some dude that my English Prof quoted. I was quick to point out that Steinbeck's works were equal to, or perhaps smaller than life. Anyway, my point Last Kiss is an example of reality being skewed by whatever filter fiction is supposed to place in front of real life whereas Baise-Moi for all its faults and critics, is in some way 'real life,' and as such is worth watching, or &#150; 'worth the ride,' to quote an Ontario, Canada review. Two slutty French women on the fringes of a supposedly non-employing French society are violently raped. Ultimately, the duo goes on a murderous binge of high-octane sex and violent revenge. One dies, the other is going to get life in the slam.These women, true, are far from paragons, but their compassion is evidenced when one risks her neck to try and save a young French Immigrant from a fearful beating. The same girl says to a junkie bartender-friend, that men like him are only satisfied, only 'fully alive' she mocks, when they are hitting someone. Both the comment and the compassionate have been are overlooked, in most reviews. Pity. That the two, post traumatic rape are completely transformed by this event is either overlooked, or rape is dismissed in negative reviews as too inconsequential to justify the ensuing killing spree. Excuse me! How's that? Two young women have just been raped in the most brutal fashion imaginable and it's not possible that they would go on to kill ten or so people, (even if some are women)? There's no possible 1-to-1 correlation? Nah &#150; just as fired post office officials and picked-on high school nerds never react violently. Never happens. Impossible &#150; Run this crap out of town at the end of a bayonet. OF COURSE THERE'S A CORRELATION!As the two gals cast as the victims are themselves, well-known porn stars, it must be said that the sexual emphasis is (duh) almost exclusively on female pleasure. And that the sex is very hot. ( I don't watch porn and was pretty tired when I slapped this puppy in; it fairly arrested my attention.) I notice that even the film's most vehement critics concede that the sex scenes are powerful. The reason I don't watch porn is because what I've seen is boring &#150; this sex is not. Clichéd or otherwise; could this be the reason the film's detractors seem to be mostly male? While it is nonsense to suggest that women aren't often in control bedrooms across the world, it seems as if male film critics &#150; as opposed to males generally, don't dig that? Such is life. As Baise-Moi is so short and so deliberately obvious, let me quickly address the downside and spend a bit more on the good and then you film lover, you must be the judge, jury and executioner.I don't like the look of many of the scenes especially the night scenes; whatever digital rig was used just isn't up to it. I also felt that there was a glaring and not always favorable contrast between the dramatic skills of the protagonists, those of; Mme. Karen Lancaume were so far ahead of Mme. Raffaëla Anderson's, that at times, the latter is purely superfluous. I do agree emphatically with whatever review said that just because the actresses in Baise-Moi don't emote a great deal, (other than murdering and crazed sex, of course) that doesn't equal bad acting. The acting is of a good standard, however, Raffaela Anderson's acting did on several occasions fall on the wrong side of 'natural,' and into the realm of 'apparently very limited.' (Or, untrained, more charitably.) Finally the end was a bit of bust, as I am still not sure that Anderson was saved from suicide by a last possible moment arrest by the gendarmes. I really disliked the fact that while the sex was unbridled, the violence was the toned-down at points, almost to the bloodless levels of Pulp Fiction, which simply doesn't work in this thing. If the intention is to show what some women really want from sex, then in such a vehicle, the monstrous nature of most REAL violence, (I once had a County Coroner for a room mate and I can confirm that in its awfulness real violent death is probably beyond worst imaginings) we need the real deal.What I did like about the film was the nausea, the stink, the fear that only reality can connote. I also found (duh!) the brutal rape quite sufficient to both, launch such a revenge, as well as become the pretext by which losers like these could lose all moral grip. It was also a clever, if obvious touch to show Lancaume trying to stop the beating of an innocent as it 'proves' that, prior to being raped she was a different person. (Folks, from far flimsier grounds was the film industry born and sustained; I mean come on &#150; spare me the mock horrifics, and idiotic, 'unmotivated killing spree,' jazz. Brutal rape is motivation enough.)I liked the depiction of the seedy but undeniably exciting pick-ups beloved of the French. I mean, picking up random strangers to party &#150; and then some - is the French Character, and the movie has xeroxed that character. I loved much of Kern Lancaume's acting- whatever grand critics might have of it. I liked the soundtrack. I liked what I saw as the film's occasional humor; surely the makers of Baise-Moi knew that revenge murder in a 'F**k Club' was going to yes, sound both funny and fishy and I think that strong humorous intent was at play. I mean the proprietor (shortly before being gunned down) said, 'this is a f**k club not a mosque' and it was funny.Finally, however, while it is doubtful that Baise-Moi will ever be what most general audiences pine for, it's unflinching depiction of death, particularly in the final scene was arresting. (Though I wish, in light of their respective skills, the scene was reversed and Ms. Lancaume and not Ms. Anderson honored the other by attempting suicide.) Say what you will about this film, or about the justness of Anderson being forced to end her life in return for innocents slaughtered, this final scene has an incredible, fearsome power. I was recently mis-diagnosed with a potentially fatal illness and Anderson's final stock taking, the resignation to death, a waste of life and the eternal nature of death, was very powerful &#150; and trust me, realistic. &#133; Above all the sadness that follows resignation to &#150; for better or worse &#150; the final fear that haunts us all. Which curiously, is probably this film's raison d'etre.

I also found (duh!) the brutal rape quite sufficient to both, launch such a revenge, as well as become the pretext by which losers like these could lose all moral grip. It was also a clever, if obvious touch to show Lancaume trying to stop the beating of an innocent as it 'proves' that, prior to being raped she was a different person. (Folks, from far flimsier grounds was the film industry born and sustained; I mean come on &#150; spare me the mock horrifics, and idiotic, 'unmotivated killing spree,' jazz. Brutal rape is motivation enough.)I liked the depiction of the seedy but undeniably exciting pick-ups beloved of the French. I mean, picking up random strangers to party &#150; and then some - is the French Character, and the movie has xeroxed that character. I loved much of Kern Lancaume's acting- whatever grand critics might have of it. I liked the soundtrack. I liked what I saw as the film's occasional humor; surely the makers of Baise-Moi knew that revenge murder in a 'F**k Club' was going to yes, sound both funny and fishy and I think that strong humorous intent was at play. I mean the proprietor (shortly before being gunned down) said, 'this is a f**k club not a mosque' and it was funny.Finally, however, while it is doubtful that Baise-Moi will ever be what most general audiences pine for, it's unflinching depiction of death, particularly in the final scene was arresting. (Though I wish, in light of their respective skills, the scene was reversed and Ms. Lancaume and not Ms. Anderson honored the other by attempting suicide.) Say what you will about this film, or about the justness of Anderson being forced to end her life in return for innocents slaughtered, this final scene has an incredible, fearsome power. I was recently mis-diagnosed with a potentially fatal illness and Anderson's final stock taking, the resignation to death, a waste of life and the eternal nature of death, was very powerful &#150; and trust me, realistic. &#133; Above all the sadness that follows resignation to &#150; for better or worse &#150; the final fear that haunts us all.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"13 August 2004","score":"","review":"  Baise-MoiI rented this film because my local said, 'you no use ATM unless total purchase eight dollar or more.' Fair enough. I grabbed Baise-Moi and the tepid if enjoyable, Last Kiss.Let's stay with this pairing. First of all &#133; Comes the premise, 'literature must be larger than life.' So said some dude that my English Prof quoted. I was quick to point out that Steinbeck's works were equal to, or perhaps smaller than life. Anyway, my point Last Kiss is an example of reality being skewed by whatever filter fiction is supposed to place in front of real life whereas Baise-Moi for all its faults and critics, is in some way 'real life,' and as such is worth watching, or &#150; 'worth the ride,' to quote an Ontario, Canada review. Two slutty French women on the fringes of a supposedly non-employing French society are violently raped. Ultimately, the duo goes on a murderous binge of high-octane sex and violent revenge. One dies, the other is going to get life in the slam.These women, true, are far from paragons, but their compassion is evidenced when one risks her neck to try and save a young French Immigrant from a fearful beating. The same girl says to a junkie bartender-friend, that men like him are only satisfied, only 'fully alive' she mocks, when they are hitting someone. Both the comment and the compassionate have been are overlooked, in most reviews. Pity. That the two, post traumatic rape are completely transformed by this event is either overlooked, or rape is dismissed in negative reviews as too inconsequential to justify the ensuing killing spree. Excuse me! How's that? Two young women have just been raped in the most brutal fashion imaginable and it's not possible that they would go on to kill ten or so people, (even if some are women)? There's no possible 1-to-1 correlation? Nah &#150; just as fired post office officials and picked-on high school nerds never react violently. Never happens. Impossible &#150; Run this crap out of town at the end of a bayonet. OF COURSE THERE'S A CORRELATION!As the two gals cast as the victims are themselves, well-known porn stars, it must be said that the sexual emphasis is (duh) almost exclusively on female pleasure. And that the sex is very hot. ( I don't watch porn and was pretty tired when I slapped this puppy in; it fairly arrested my attention.) I notice that even the film's most vehement critics concede that the sex scenes are powerful. The reason I don't watch porn is because what I've seen is boring &#150; this sex is not. Clichéd or otherwise; could this be the reason the film's detractors seem to be mostly male? While it is nonsense to suggest that women aren't often in control bedrooms across the world, it seems as if male film critics &#150; as opposed to males generally, don't dig that? Such is life. As Baise-Moi is so short and so deliberately obvious, let me quickly address the downside and spend a bit more on the good and then you film lover, you must be the judge, jury and executioner.I don't like the look of many of the scenes especially the night scenes; whatever digital rig was used just isn't up to it. I also felt that there was a glaring and not always favorable contrast between the dramatic skills of the protagonists, those of; Mme. Karen Lancaume were so far ahead of Mme. Raffaëla Anderson's, that at times, the latter is purely superfluous. I do agree emphatically with whatever review said that just because the actresses in Baise-Moi don't emote a great deal, (other than murdering and crazed sex, of course) that doesn't equal bad acting. The acting is of a good standard, however, Raffaela Anderson's acting did on several occasions fall on the wrong side of 'natural,' and into the realm of 'apparently very limited.' (Or, untrained, more charitably.) Finally the end was a bit of bust, as I am still not sure that Anderson was saved from suicide by a last possible moment arrest by the gendarmes. I really disliked the fact that while the sex was unbridled, the violence was the toned-down at points, almost to the bloodless levels of Pulp Fiction, which simply doesn't work in this thing.

Instead, the convoy was carrying dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs attack and kill the squad of terrorists. A military recovery team learns the convoy is stopped in a warehouse on the local waterfront, and immediately goes out to retrieve it. The dinosaurs attack the squad, leaving only three soldiers. Back at their headquaters, their captain (Scott Valentine) refuses to go back unless they kill the dinos, but the scientist in charge of the operation (Janet Gunn) orders them to merely capture the dinos. Heading back out to the warehouse, the team gets additional help with a Marine Task Force. Together, they still can't control the dinosaurs. They finally find a way to get them under control luring them out to a ship, sailing them out to see and blowing the ship up.    The Good News While this film won't win any awards for its FX, the dinos are still pretty realistic. It's still pretty better than the first one, but the second one is the most realistic of the movies. This film isn't as gory as some would believe, but only a few scenes are actually gory. There is the traditional limb ripped off and even some bloodsplatter, but this is the driest of the three films. The locale of the movie is a nice change, making the switch to a warehouse instead of in an open area like the first one. It was also very good in designing suspense. There was a lot of scenes were you were waiting for a dinosaur to pop out of somewhere and take a bite out of someone, and more often than not, that did happen. I have to give a film some recommendation when it delivers on suspense that it sets up.  The Bad News For some reason, this had some scenes that could've been taken out of the movie, despite the fact that it's barely over 1 hr. and 20 mins. The scenes showing the Soldiers and the Marines getting to know each other could've been trimmed, and several other small scenes could've been cut out. Also, there are a lot of shots of very obvious puppet dinosaurs shown. The T-Rex at the end is a very good example. It looked real in only a few seconds in the whole film. In fact, the dinos are only in a few minutes of the movie. They were missing for most of the movie. I counted only about a half-hour worth of screen time for the dinos. This should've been dragged out far longer for a film about dinosaurs, and it being so short in the first place, would've only made the film that much better. The recasting of Rick Dean, who was Monk in part two as Polcheck in this one, was a nice touch but confusing, as he seems to play the same role in both movies a wise-cracking soldier who doesn't seem too interested in the rules of the situation.The Final Verdict If you don't mind watching about a half-hours' worth of dinosaurs in an 1hr. and 20 min movie, this isn't that bad of a movie. It may leave you confused why it's so long with so many scenes that could've been cut out, but it is still a worthwhile edition to the series.Rated R Graphic Violence, Adult Language.

Before i saw Spider-Man i was surprised (In a good way) of the actor-set. Especielly with J.K Simmons (Also actor as Schillinger in one of my favorite shows, Oz.) as Jameson, Tobey Maguire from The cider house rules and Wonder boys), and, of course - Kirsten Dunst (Remember her from the one year earlier movie Crazy\/Beautiful and early years Jumanji).I've always had an appeal for long movies, and this movie is about 2 hours, (as you probably already know) and i wasn't surprised over the choosing of Villain - Green Goblin. Even tho the connection between Spider-Man the Movie and Spider-Man the Comics is very thin, its still was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen, actually.The thing i'm missing in it was the humor that Spider-Man showed in the comics, - Now, i know that increased in Spider-Man 2 - But that's not the point. Where's the jokes? A big minus for that part.I also read that Tobey didn't even read a glimpse of any Spider-Man comic before, so i'm very, very surprised that he could act Peter Parker without even knowing his style. The 2 of them are the same (in some restrictions, that is.)Well, That's all i have to say, plus i rated the movie 9 out of 10.Cheers!

The Shawshank Redemption may very likely be the best movie i have ever seen. Not only because of the mentioned fact, but because it has the every basics a good film needs. No movie making mistakes really are found through my eyes. This movie is rough, sad or even happy at moments. It makes you feel like you were there experiencing what the characters do. Superb acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's direction too. The Screenplay is not really by any way too predictable and from the first two minutes you know you are watching something special. I really can't of any movie that beats this one...
