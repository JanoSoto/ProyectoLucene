It may be too long for most people but hey; the Vietnam war was a 15 years long ordeal,so there, & besides;anybody been stuck in traffic lately.....?the film is flawless but it is when we arrive at the Kurtz compound that it gets hacked a bit in my opinion.the additional scenes from the Redux are not needed & changes an epic maddening war film into a loose rock n roll war film. The french plantation scenes give justice to the french life styles for it is typically french to argue about politics at the diner table & run away screaming.... In the love scene between Willard & the french chick; she can t even pronounce the word love. love as in all you need is love or i want to love your leg. If any beautiful woman can t pronounce the word love adequately then she should not be in an American film...I know she is french,i m french too. Additional scenes have been released in the new DVD apocalypse now the complete dossier. These lost scenes are far more impressive than the ones of the Redux. There is the monkey sampan scene,very art gore, & very reminiscent of Aguirre the wrath of God with Philips saying to Willard that s coming from where we re going captain.....& i saywe are back in business boys! The booby trap scene.......very nice! Additional scene with Dennis hopper this is the war man; you kiss it right on the mouth if you can stand it.........some well deserved comic relief diatribes from the man himself. Additional scene of the tiger cage with the first appearance of Kurtz giving orders in french & first dialogue between Kurtz & Willard its right to win,its wrong to lose....a much much better scene than the one in Redux where Kurtz reads life mag to Willard.Additional scene with Colby who had so eloquently send a letter to his wife back in the state telling her to sell house,car & kids; in both original apocalypse now & Redux his character is a mute zombie but in the lost scene he kills Dennis Hopper & when he is asked by Willard what he feels when he sees all the killing around him, Colby answers i feel,i feel the recoil of my shotgun.......now that is keeping with what is expected God damned it! What has always been weak in apocalypse now is Kurtz rambling monologues & it is my belief that Brando did enough material for his millions but that the director maybe was too annoyed or to burned out to deal with it. In both apocalypse now & Redux, Kurtz talks about gardenias & reading from the hallow men which is lost on me, but other parts of his 45 minutes death monologue could of been used. Marlon Brando said it was probably the closest i have ever come closeto getting lost in a part, and ones of the best scene i have ever played.... That footage has still yet to be released.Maybe apocalypse now will never be a complete completed work & that s fine.It makes it more interactive & the viewers can finish it from themselves.If apocalypse now is about war & madness,& apocalypse now Redux is too rock n roll for my own taste then the lost scenes at the compound makes it more like a chaotic existentialist western on its last leg which i like.Its the end of the river all right, what did you expect?

I have not come across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages, when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story, the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again and again. It is a film that doesn't need brains to figure out, just watch and you'll enjoy it.Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean) breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents and find a way to get 'back to the future'. Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of the jokes, though they don't come from his mouth. His inability to realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back to the Future so often.Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His eccentricity and his random proclamation of Great Scott! makes his character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran actor of Lloyd's background was needed to make the film work. If a serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked. His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the funniest bit of all in the film.The portrayal of 50's life is right on par. Marty's interaction with it is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives a solid performance as Marty's father back in the 50's. What I find great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to get back to the 80's and you want Biff to get decked the whole film. The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.4\/5 Stars ","genre":null},{"date":"16 May 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages.

Offering some of that same unique aesthetic which made his Secret of NIMH so appealing, Bluth takes this rowdy kids feature and blends it with dark atmospherics that help create the memorable surroundings where a criminal canine world is thriving.The animation is obviously not as fluid as modern eyes are used to, though the painstakingly detailed, hand drawn backgrounds retain more charm then anything created by computer in the last 15 years. There is a certain warmth emitted from this style that hearkens back to a day when cartoons actually used to be pure, and had none of the compromising marketing techniques thrown in to gather wider audiences, as mega-budgeted cartoon franchises pander today.The small but heartfelt supernatural story which explores the doggy afterlife of one street dog Charlie will remain a classic animated film for years to come. Overshadowed by some of his other work, Bluth still manages to prove why he is so highly respected in the business with nearly every concentrated frame. What does tarnish the film a bit however, is All Dogs Go to Heaven's insistence on breaking out into song every so often. The original music, and the voices who sing it (particualrly Burt Reynolds in the lead) are pretty awful, and noticeably sinks the film from being uniformly well received. The entire pacing may as well feel alien to young kids brought up on today's animated features, but for those willing to appreciate a time when hand drawn art was approached with more sensitivity in the American animated world, All Dogs Go to Heaven is a nostalgic treat.

His first production, THE SECRET OF NIMH, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day. This was followed by AN American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful. Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups. But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID.Considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare. Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children. On the other hand, it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN. In short, it's a movie with a major identity crisis.Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin, a rough-and-tumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, Carface. Before you know it, Charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default. Here a whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind. This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.Upon realizing that he's been murdered, Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface. With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie rescues Carface's prize, AnneMarie, a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races). Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down. Although he refuses to admit it, Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie...The concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution. Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of Ken Page), none of the other characters emerge as likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. Unfortunately, that also applies to Charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable. As such, the audience feels no empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing. (Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds.) Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story. The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time. The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza. The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Page's mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast. As mentioned, Burt Reynolds' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end). Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger in AN American TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH. Ken Page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best. Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson (as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie), Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly. Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation. Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluth's team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon. If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment. Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth's better efforts.

The film had a superb lead cast of Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, and Anne Archer. Add to this rundown the leadership of '9 ½ Weeks' director Adrian Lyne and a screenplay not only brimming with tension but also willing to pluck a sexual nerve in the AIDS-ridden landscape of 1980s America. Over $400 million in box office and video sales later, this film easily ranks as one of the most influential of its time and has spawned many clones in the erotic thriller genre.'Fatal Attraction,' which was nominated for six Oscars, does just about everything right to create a thriller that stays in the mind long after being watched. James Dearden's screenplay (expanded from a BBC film short) is a concentrated effort on the lives of four people attorney Dan Gallagher (Douglas), his wife Beth (Archer), his daughter Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), and publishing adviser Alex Forrest (Close), who meets Dan at a party and joins him for a weekend fling. Minor characters brush with the storyline, but Dearden limits key happenings to this quartet and shows how the briefest infidelity can lead to disaster. In 'Fatal Attraction,' Alex Forrest is every cheating husband's worst nightmare, a psychotic woman who will terrorize an entire family to get what she wants.Adrian Lyne's thriller is very much of its time, dealing with a middle class family whose husband earns his pay in a changing workforce. Alex Forrest, played superbly by Close, is akin to the many (sane) women who enjoyed career advancement during the 1980s, when reactions built up against feminism of the previous decade. Beth Gallagher represents the traditional housewife, who shuns career to provide at home. These points are understated, however, and 'Fatal Attraction' is driven mostly by its character development, the absolute must for a successful thriller. As Alex wobbles out of control and Dan grows in desperation to stop her, 'Fatal Attraction' reaches unexpected levels of tension that rival any other such film in history. And it's unafraid to be repugnant and brutal, making use of attempted suicide, kidnapping, and a cooked rabbit.I have not lately seen a film that produced so many conflicting emotions as 'Fatal Attraction.' In the opening 80 minutes, it has the gloss of a feminist tale; Alex is (supposedly) left pregnant by Dan, who considers his extramarital dealings over with and retreats into family life. But just as Alex gains your sympathy, she intrudes upon Dan's wife and daughter, making the film take on a completely different attitude. And here rests one of the movie's biggest flaws, in that James Dearden's screenplay doesn't reach its absolute potential; it stops short of an irreversible punishment for Dan's affair and heads toward a more conventional ending, albeit a very effective one. There are also considerable plot gaps (how does Alex take Ellen to an amusement park directly from school, without parents or teachers questioning?), but these problems are smoothed over by the fine performances, which come to embody outright good and evil.'Fatal Attraction' was originally filmed with a quiet ending that went belly-up at preview screenings. A more approachable (and violent) finale was shot months after production had wrapped. Both endings are included on Paramount Pictures' 2002 DVD release, which bears a 'special collector's edition' label. The disc (a volume of Paramount's 'widescreen collection') is worth every nickel, containing a pristine feature and several extras. Helped by its newness, 'Fatal' is in excellent visual condition with a choice of 5.1 surround sound or Dolby surround. Also supplied are French 'dubbing' and English subtitles. A commentary track with Adrian Lyne makes up one of the special features, along with three featurettes on production of the film 'Forever Fatal Remembering Fatal Attraction,' 'Social Attraction,' and 'Visual Attraction.' Topping it off are VHS rehearsal clips of Douglas, Close, and Anne Archer before 'Fatal' entered production, the original (and in my opinion weaker) ending, and the theatrical trailer.Adrian Lyne's commentary is both pleasant and informative, relating to the goings-on in his quiet, casual manner. The three featurettes shed new light on this film, allowing cast members and crew to reflect on its artistic and social impact over the last twenty years. 'Visual Attraction' is most interesting, giving due credit to the people whose attire (costume designer Ellen Mirojnick), facial work (makeup artist Richard Dean), photography (cinematographer Howard Atherton), and sets (production designer Mel Bourne) are easily forgotten in a movie without huge special effects or epic scenes.

And it's unafraid to be repugnant and brutal, making use of attempted suicide, kidnapping, and a cooked rabbit.I have not lately seen a film that produced so many conflicting emotions as 'Fatal Attraction.' In the opening 80 minutes, it has the gloss of a feminist tale; Alex is (supposedly) left pregnant by Dan, who considers his extramarital dealings over with and retreats into family life. But just as Alex gains your sympathy, she intrudes upon Dan's wife and daughter, making the film take on a completely different attitude. And here rests one of the movie's biggest flaws, in that James Dearden's screenplay doesn't reach its absolute potential; it stops short of an irreversible punishment for Dan's affair and heads toward a more conventional ending, albeit a very effective one. There are also considerable plot gaps (how does Alex take Ellen to an amusement park directly from school, without parents or teachers questioning?), but these problems are smoothed over by the fine performances, which come to embody outright good and evil.'Fatal Attraction' was originally filmed with a quiet ending that went belly-up at preview screenings. A more approachable (and violent) finale was shot months after production had wrapped. Both endings are included on Paramount Pictures' 2002 DVD release, which bears a 'special collector's edition' label. The disc (a volume of Paramount's 'widescreen collection') is worth every nickel, containing a pristine feature and several extras. Helped by its newness, 'Fatal' is in excellent visual condition with a choice of 5.1 surround sound or Dolby surround. Also supplied are French 'dubbing' and English subtitles. A commentary track with Adrian Lyne makes up one of the special features, along with three featurettes on production of the film 'Forever Fatal Remembering Fatal Attraction,' 'Social Attraction,' and 'Visual Attraction.' Topping it off are VHS rehearsal clips of Douglas, Close, and Anne Archer before 'Fatal' entered production, the original (and in my opinion weaker) ending, and the theatrical trailer.Adrian Lyne's commentary is both pleasant and informative, relating to the goings-on in his quiet, casual manner. The three featurettes shed new light on this film, allowing cast members and crew to reflect on its artistic and social impact over the last twenty years. 'Visual Attraction' is most interesting, giving due credit to the people whose attire (costume designer Ellen Mirojnick), facial work (makeup artist Richard Dean), photography (cinematographer Howard Atherton), and sets (production designer Mel Bourne) are easily forgotten in a movie without huge special effects or epic scenes. Always hard-hitting and almost guaranteed to keep married men in line (*wink*), 'Fatal' remains a diamond in the rough and a standard of 1980s film-making.*** out of 4 ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"16 May 2007","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't know why, but I originally thought this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, directed by the great Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock, was rubbish, thank God I gave it a third and maybe even final chance. Basically Dr. Anthony Edwards (Gregory Peck) has to come to Green Manors mental hospital to replace Dr. Murchison (Stangers on a Train's Leo G. Carroll) as the head. He is instantly attracted to Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman), but very quickly he is revealing his true identity as an impostor with a dark past changed by paranoia and amnesia. Eventually his real name is revealed as John Ballantine, and when the police are called he and Constance go on the run, and in the process try to determine the reasons for his visions. He and Dr. Alexander 'Alex' Brulov (Oscar nominated Michael Chekhov) work out that he is afraid of the colour white and dark lines because of snow and ski trails (although it could be the bars, which I'll explain in a minute). It is after the description of the recent dreams he has been having, that John and Constance go skiing to unearth more of the past, and it is near the edge of the cliff he remembers the horrific accidentally death of his brother impaled on an iron fence with parallel bars, not the death of the real Dr. Edwards. After John is arrested, Constance works out the identity of the blank face in John's dream as Dr. Murchison, and he reveals himself as the real killer of Dr. Edwards, and after committing suicide (shooting himself), John is released to live happily with Constance. Also starring Rhonda Fleming as Mary Carmichael, John Emery as Dr. Fleurot, Norman Lloyd as Mr. Garmes, Steven Geray as Dr. Graff, Donald Curtis as Harry, Paul Harvey as Dr. Hanish, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man coming out of an elevator at the Empire Hotel, carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette. I will admit I agree that Peck is a little robotic, compared to the much sympathetic and well cast shrink Bergman, but they do well together. Hitchcock mixes really good psychoanalysis themes, with some good dark paranoia moments, and there is that very interesting dream sequence designed by artist Salvador Dalí, making this a most watchable psychological thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Miklós Rózsa, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects. Good!
