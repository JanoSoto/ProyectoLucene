[{"date":"27 June 2013","score":"","review":" ELECTIONI saw the trailer for this and thought it looked terrible. I only recorded it from the TV because a friend of mine said it was good. He was right... it really was quite good.The film is about 1 teachers hatred for a know all student who is trying to become school president.The acting is not brilliant, but the comedy is quite funny in places. There were moments in the movie when I was laughing out loud. I like any film that can make me do that. )The movie stars Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Matthew does a good job. I like him as an actor. I think he is really good, but he has no range. Every movie I have seen him in, he is the same. He doesn't know how to change his character. Reese does an alright job... but she is so annoying in this movie. She irritated me from the start of the movie. Reese is a bit hit and miss. She can be really good in some movies and really bad in others. In this one she was average. Bad at some points, but good in others. But she was funny. The only other notable performances were from Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell. Chris was OK... he seems to play a dumb jock really well. He did make me laugh in this movie for just being a little bit stupid. He reminded me of Keanu Reeves in his early days of Parenthood or Bill & Ted.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It was an entertaining comedy and was funnier than I thought it was going to be.For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2013","score":"","review":" ELECTIONI saw the trailer for this and thought it looked terrible.
