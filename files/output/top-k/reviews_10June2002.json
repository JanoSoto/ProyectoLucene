It was her first time, and I was excited to show it off for her.  She fell in love with it, and, since I hadn't seen it in a while, my adoration of it was re-ignited.   I'll be honest  you're not going to enjoy this movie if you don't like animated features.  While there ARE a couple cheesy phrases in this movie, if you watch it with good humor, you're sure to enjoy it.  This movie wasn't made for adults, but it wasn't made for little children, either.  I think that it's best viewed with an open mind and a friend.   First, I'll start with the animation.  The characters' movements and appearances are very reminiscent of other Don Bluth films, such as An American Tail and Anastasia, which is definitely a good thing.  Not only are all of the major movements very flowing, but smaller things are perfect, like the twirl of Thumbelina's skirt and the characters' hair.  In fact, if one looks hard enough, it's noticeable in every aspect  characters have little facial expressions, little movements, little changes in their eyes that fully represent real life.  I'll admit that some of the non-human characters are a little annoying in appearance and don't fit in perfectly with Thumbelina, in particular hero, the dog; but on average, they blend in pretty well.  One of the things I enjoy the most about the animation is that when a character holds on to something, it actually looks like they're touching it, unlike in most animated features (in particular, Spirit, but I'll not hold a grudge against it).   Secondly, I'd like to point out the scenery.  It's a bit simplistic in some parts, but it always alludes to something more, and it really makes you feel as if you were there.   The storyline, while a little silly, is very entertaining, and I really tended to feel the ups and downs of Thumbelina.  In some parts, it gets a little tedious, but in general, it's wonderful.  The movie, in my opinion, was very romantic, and, in a couple scenes, very, very sad.  There's also just enough humor to keep the story flowing without so much that it becomes the main focus of the plot.   Finally, the sounds are exquisite.  The characters' voices are all perfect, especially the mother frog.  Always Follow Your Heart, the main theme song, is horrible and extremely annoying, but all of the rest of the songs are great.  Soon, is very sad and simple, and it fits Thumbelina's mood perfectly.  Let Me Be Your Wings, is beautiful and is a perfect song to reprise.  The first time that Thumbelina and Cornelius sing it, it's very romantic.  *SPOILER* When she sings it to the mole after Cornelius, dies, it's one of the most tragic and beautiful parts of the movie, and my favorite.  Finally, at the end, when she sings it in the Veil of the Fairies, it's haunting, and when Cornelius cuts in and proves that he's not dead, it's uplifting. *END SPOILER*  On the Road is a cute song with a Latin beat, and is fun to watch.  The song that the beetles sing is a little annoying, but it's bearable.  Marry the Mole, is funny and well-placed.   Now, my friend is 14, and I'll be turning that age this month, so I can't honestly recommend it for adults, unless they're young-at-heart and enjoy cartoons (which, I've noticed, often have a lot deeper themes than most real-life movies).  If you're about my age, and you don't think that you're too cool to enjoy an animated film, give it a try.  Oh, and if you're bilingual, like me, rent the DVD and watch it in French.

The dialogue is horrendous, the characters are woefully under-developed and nothing was believable about the entire movie. The best way to describe this movie is that it is movie with cars upon which someone tried to add a plot. However, they failed miserably. The ending is absolutely implausible, for there are no reasons to justify it. We have no reason to accept the behavior of the main characters or their reactions\/bonds with each other.

I now own it on DVD and consider it in my top 5 movie list. The War is set in the summer of 1970 in Mississippi. Steven Simmons (Kevin Costner) has recently returned from Vietnam and is trying to fit back into life as he once knew it. However his time in Vietnam has left its scars (both physically and emotionally), and has placed strain on his relationship with wife Lois (Mare Winningham), and his children Lydia (Lexi Randall) and Stu (Elijah Wood), who are 12 year old twins. While Steven is trying to re-build his own life, Stu and Lydia are spending the summer building a tree house with the help of their friends, while trying to avoid the Lipnicki children, who take on the local bullies role.I won't go into anymore detail concerning plot, as it may spoil parts of the movie for some. The length of The War, at just on 2 hours, is sufficient for the plot and all its happenings to unfold, but any longer may have proved to be a little drawn out.The performances put in by all the main actors and actresses (as well as many of the minor parts) are quite good. Elijah Wood's portrayal of the angry but likeable Stu is very well done. With his angry outbursts, expressive face, and naturalness in front of the camera, Wood creates a very believable Stu. This is one of his best performances, except maybe for his portrayal of Mikey in The Ice StormKevin Costner, in what must be one of his best (yet lesser known) roles, is very understated but brilliantly cast as Steve. The uncertainty that he expresses within own life, but also the wisdom that he imparts to his children in various parts throughout the movie, are  very touching indeed. Many people are critical in their assessment of Costner's acting, but I beg to differ. This is because, a few months back, I rented (and subsequently bought) 3000 Miles to Graceland, in which Costner plays a mad, mean and sinister robber. His performance in this particular movie could not have been further from his role as Steven in The War, but again he plays the part with ease. After watching these two movies, his acting talent and the range of characters that he can effectively bring to life is obvious.Mare Winningham is perfectly cast as Lois, the hard-working, determined and supportive wife and mother. She  breezes through this role, one which is similar in nature to her part in Everything That Rises.Lexi Randall, as Lydia, also does well, although is almost overshadowed by the performance of by her best friend Elvadine, played by the brilliant Latoya Chisholm. Elvadine's scene in the classroom (you will know what scene i mean when you see it) is one of the best parts of the movie.This movie does has some violent scenes where children are seen punching and kicking each other, so it would probably be best seen by those 12 years and up. Director Jon Avnet creates a fantastic visual experience, very similar in feel to that of his Fried Green Tomatoes. I really love the tree in which the children built their treehouse - so old yet so stable and strong..... This is a movie that really lets you escape from reality, if only for two hours.I have viewed this movie many times, and because of this have picked up a few little flaws. Continuity is a little bit of a problem in some scenes. For example, in one scene, Stu and his friends are soaking wet from driving what looks like a home-mate billy cart into a pond. Straight after this occurs the Lipnickis appear, and as they push Stu and co. away from the billy cart, we see that Stu and co. are practically dry. But this is being picky, I must admit. The accents are a bit off in some parts too - maybe the actors were trying a little too hard.The sound of this movie i must comment on. If you run a surround sound system with Dolby Digital, the movie will give it a work-out in parts. Two scenes in particular1. where Stu goes to wake up his Dad. As Stu shoves his dad to rouse him, the thump of helicopter blades are heard in the background and become progressively louder and louder. The sounds stops abruptly when Steve, who is startled by Stu and presumably woken from a nightmare, grabs Stu and flings him onto the ground (as he might have done in Vietnam when defending himself against an enemy soldier). This is a surprisingly intense scene.2. At the marble quarry - I can't give anymore information than this without spoiling things.So, if you have a surround sound setup, your subwoofer will definitely get a workout in some parts of the movie. The dialogue is presented quite clearly, and the constant buzz of cicadas and crickets really give a sense of a typically hot and humid summer in the South.All in all I would highly recommend this movie. I have read reviews where people have said that this movie is not very interesting and is maybe a bit too preachy. But I watched this movie once with a classroom full of my 17 year old mates and they were glued to the screen for the duration of the movie. The War definitely has a strong message to give about war - those wars we battle inside ourselves and also the wars that are fought by millions. This is also a sad movie, but has a very uplifting conclusion. The War may take some finding in your local video store, but it is highly recommended. 8\/10.

In a very rich looking hotel an old man (William Hickey in a cameo, I mention his name because I can't remember any of the other actors in this film.) is seen painting the face of one of his puppets along with other wooden creatures that he created.  When gazing out his hotel window he notices two men with trenchcoats and fedoras.  The Jester he's painting spins his head in a fearful disjointed look.  The man, identified as Andre Toulon, comforts his creations and hides them in his now infamous trunk. He hides them in a secret passage in the wall and just as the men (nazis) knock on his door, Toulon puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger.

The acting is hollow and emotionless, even during the sex scene.  But the actual puppets play there little hearts out.  So for the cult film lunatics with doll fetish's.  This is a good start to what became a quite marketable franchise.

Anthony Hopkins, as a veteran CIA agent, is unreadable.  But, that's how CIA agents are played in the movies.  They are trained to be secretive and unreadable.  So, Anthony Hopkins plays his role very well.  AS for the other characters, I was quite aware of who they were and what their names were.  I thought this movie was quite entertaining.  I laughed through most of the movie.  The writers gave Chris Rock loads of one liners and other sarcastic remarks, while Anthony Hopkins was also given some less obvious jokes to crack and comments to make.  As for the effects and things like that, I didn't see anything wrong with them.  Not once did I see the bad guys firing machine guns (which fire faster, but are less accurate) directly at the good guys.  There was always something between them or they were moving.  As for the plot, it was a little too close to reality but, I don't think that it was distasteful at all.  It was a terrible thing that happened on 9\/11, but we can't dwell on it forever.  The number 1 movie in the country is The Sum of All Fears, in which a nuclear bomb actually explodes.  If people thought that that was distasteful in the wake of 9\/11, it would no be the number 1 movie in the country.  But, as for Bad Company, I really enjoyed it and would gladly go see it again.

By comparison, Lost in Space was high art full of deep metaphysical dilemmas. MKA is terrible.I loved the Mortal Kombat games, and was pleased to see that MK The Movie was better than Street Fighter II The Movie. Sure, it was a light-on film, but it had some moments and I spent most of my time laughing at the unintentionally bad bits. MKA makes MK The Movie look sophisticated.The first five minutes basically drops a piano on the head of the first movie - new bad guy, Johnny Cage dies, new heroes appear, minimal explanation. From then on you have a sub-standard martial arts film packed full of cheap costumes on cheap actors following a cliched script. I know there's not a lot of narrative you can squeeze out of a fighting computer game, but surely the writers could have tried a little harder to make something work. Having gone to the movie with a guy who didn't play the games, I had to explain what the hell was going on for the first half (like why is that guy fighting him?) and gave up after that.That said, this movie contains the most unintentionally hilarious moment I have ever seen on film. Towards the end of the movie, Raiden moves from having flowing straight white hair to a peroxided flat-top. There's a brief mention of Raiden getting a haircut, and that's it. It makes absolutely no sense, and thinking about it still makes me laugh.

It has a broad appeal, and will draw you in from the opening moment if you give it even the slightest of chances. I loved the book and was wary, like so many others, of how the adaptation would work. Well, they did a brilliant job, beginning with the casting of Hugh Grant.I'm not really a fan of Grant sure he was entertaining in Four Weddings, but his stock, foppish English-upper-class act got stale very quickly. Clearly he allowed himself to be stereotyped too early in his career. Well it seems as though he's turned a corner with the role of Will in `About a Boy.' Gone (or at least muted) are the mannerisms that I used to find annoying. Here he uses his hands, eyes and facial expressions in more subtle ways, and to great effect. He also plays a much more realistic, flawed character &#150; and believably so. From now on I think the name Hugh Grant will draw me to movies rather than put me off them.What can I say about Nicholas Hoult as Marcus except to echo what so many others have said &#150; what an astoundingly convincing performance! He conveys very well the innocent honesty of a boy forced to grow up too fast in a world with which he isn't really in synch. He was aggravating when the plot called for it, tight-lipped at the right times, awkward in the best traditions of early adolescence, winning and off-putting like any youngster (or adult for that matter). He impressed me most in his interactions with his screen mother, in the scene where he explains to Will in a heartbreakingly matter-of-fact tone how he copes with his misfit existence, and in his encounter with Rachel's son Ali. In fact I don't think he puts a foot wrong in the whole movie. In my opinion Nicholas Hoult absolutely nailed the character.Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz do wonders with roles that are, admittedly, under-written. Let's face it, `About a Boy' is the Will (& Marcus) Show. That's just how Hornby wrote it. But both actresses give their characters as much depth as the movie's constraints allow. Collette's Fiona is perhaps an unlikely portrait of the average single mother suffering from mental illness, but she convinces us because she is so sincere &#150; in a movie with so many laughs, you can't help feeling moved by her tears or her expressions of affection for her son. And Weisz, despite having an even smaller part, is no less convincing in her interactions with Hugh Grant's character.Add to the mix Augustus Prew's brief but extraordinary performance as Ali and the sweet and sour character of Ellie so ably performed by Nat Gastiain Tena, then you have perhaps the best ensemble cast in any movie made so far this year, and perhaps the best we're likely to see in all of 2002!
