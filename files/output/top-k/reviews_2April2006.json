He has a talent for basketball, which is popular with his friends and a talent for writing that he tends not to talk up. His test scores bring him to the attention of an exclusive private school with offers of a scholarship, starting immediately. Meanwhile he gives in to his friend's challenges and breaks into the flat of a man known as the window because he never leaves his flat but just stares out at the world passing outside. When he is confronted by the man, Wallace flees but forgets his bag, but it is given back later, with all his note book scribbled on and critiqued. He goes back to the flat and tries to get the man to help him further with his writing.Has it been so many years since Good Will Hunting that Van Sant felt the need to remake it with elements changed? And if so did he feel so insecure about doing it that he delivered with such little originality and blandness so that the audience knows just what they are getting and feels comfortable (if unimpressed)? I guess the answers to both those questions is yes because Finding Forrester is very much a version of Good Will Hunting with the basics kept the same and other bits changed around. Of course this does not mean that it is a bad film because I actually quite enjoyed it; although I knew just where it was going and what it was doing from start to finish. In this way it is a bit annoying that director and writer should be so uninterested in doing anything other than trudging out such obvious material.The story, although familiar is well enough told though to make it worth seeing. What made it much better for me though were the two genuinely engaging performances in the lead. Given fairly obvious characters to work with, I felt that both Brown and Connery took it, worked it and made it more than the sum of the words in the script. Brown is impressive by how much seems to be going on behind his eyes and I was more impressed when I learnt that this was his acting debut. Connery is equally as good in a role that he could have slummed off his famous voice and natural presence; but instead he works with a vulnerability that is convincing and makes his character and the story so much more interesting. Neither of them can make this a wonderful film but they both do a lot of work to make it an enjoyable and engaging one. Support from Abraham is by-the-numbers but effective (although his final scene is unconvincing); I didn't understand why Paquin bothered (or why they bothered to have her character in the story) while Rhymes is just what you expect and only looks weak at the end when he is asked to emote.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable film despite the fact that it seems determined to do just what you expect it to do. That said the story is still interesting but what really does the business are the two great performances from Brown and Connery &#150; both as individuals but also together; they take the obvious material and make it somehow much more convincing and engaging. Not a great film by any stretch of the imaginative and too derivative to really stick in the mind but does enough to entertain.

Urban Legend is paced in a similar fashion to the early slashers from the 80s, with a high bodycount, large cast (who are noticeably less numerous by the end ).) and very little time spent on overbearing witticisms. It's fast, it's punchy and it's one of those films that you enjoy enough that you don't really feel the time passing.It helps that it's also funny and self-deprecating without it getting in the way of the movie. Instead of setting up a 'and here's the funny...' scene like Scream does, Urban Legend builds it into the plot, saving valuable time for horror. In fact, a lot of the humour in the film is built into the horror sequences, again drawing on the movies of the 80s, especially the latter half of the Friday the 13th series.All well and good, it sounds fantastic, so why the 7 and not a 9 or 10?

She heads back to the subway to go home again but a little girl on the stairs in the tube is coming up the stairs towards her, sparking a pivotal moment in the direction her life takes.Built on an interesting concept, this film uses the two paths gimmick to help cover up the fact that it is really only a reasonable romantic comedy\/drama. The plot being split into two means that the narrative is padded out and has plenty to do but I'm afraid I didn't find it as consistent as it should have been &#150; it should have really struggled to fit it all into the short running time but it didn't. It didn't because there isn't that much going on, which is surprisingly really. The got train thread is played out very much as the secondary thread and feels distinctly underdone, consisting mainly of Gerry narrowly managing to keep his affair quiet for the whole film. The missed train thread is clearly the main thrust of the film and, as a romantic drama, Helen's relationship with James is obviously what it relies on for the audience. With a mix of ideas all together I must admit that the stories did feel a bit uneven although I found it interesting enough to do the job.The humour is not as good as the dramatic stuff though and I rarely found it amusing far less funny, although I know that it wasn't trying that hard to be. The cast are mostly pretty good. I normally dislike Paltrow but here she gives two pretty good performances. Her accent is good but more importantly she gave me two similar and convincing characters.

The split life gimmick provides plenty of material but it doesn't make the most of it, too often skimming along the surface actions rather than getting to grips with the characters.

Henry has lost his job but has kept it secret and plans to get a new job in New York. Having had their last child move out of the house the day before, Nancy isn't sure what to do with her time and decides to join Henry on his trip to New York. However a fog-bound city sees them diverted to Boston and struggling to get to their destination. Actually getting into Manhattan is only the first challenge in an eventful 24 hours that could only happen in New York!Nothing about this film suggested that it would be anything special; in fact the presence of Marc Lawrence as writer only promised the sort of safely comic humour that he produced with Two Weeks Notice, Miss Congeniality and similar projects. And from the very start it is obvious that Lawrence has produced his usual standard and that director Weisman has no aspirations to do more than churn out a rather derivative but amusing rom-com. So that is just what we get and if that is OK with you then you should be alright, although hardly impressed. The plot bumbles along from one unlikely scenario to the next; most of them are ho-hum but occasionally it tickled me. Most viewers (myself included) will find it all a bit obvious and weak but the undemanding will maybe find it amusing enough to serve as a distraction.Part of the film working (albeit on this level) is the partnership of Martin and Hawn. Even with the rather obvious material to work with, they do work well together and produce some laughs where they may not have existed on the page. Martin is only ever a hair away from mugging but, although not a shade on his former glory, he fits the lazy tone well. Hawn is a bit less convincing but is still quite amusing; the only problem with her is that she has to carry the more emotionally complex character and she can't get that right and mainly just overplays it for easy laughs, robbing the film of the engaging realism that it needed to have if it really wanted to pull off the emotional ending (which of course it doesn't actually want to do!).

He wins the game but makes very few friends in the process &#150; quick talking his way out of trouble. He falls in with Annabelle, even after he realises that she is just a thief and con artist like him. With an uneasy dislike and distrust of one another they head out of town on the same stagecoach as lawman Marshal Zane Cooper. Maverick ends up stuck with them as he tries to raise the money to enter the game &#150; how hard could it be?Anyone coming to the film should know what to expect because this is not a film that Mel Gibson, full of seriousness, would make now. No, Maverick comes from a period when he was very much the action hero with a naughty glint in his eye and his tongue in his cheek. Thus this film is very much in that vein and as such is rather superficial silly fun that can be enjoyed if you come down to its level for two hours. The plot is nothing more than a series of comic adventures involving Maverick on his way to try and get into a poker game, which makes up the conclusion to the film. In this way it won't make for a great character study or narrative but it slides forward with a slick sense of fun that is suitable for a hollow American summer movie &#150; which is just what this was.

When a fire breaks out in the factory Kane, his friend and a man called Fry run to put it out but when the fire extinguisher Fry provides turned out to be filled with gasoline, Kane's friend dies a horrible death. The factory destroyed, the investigations begins and an emotional Kane tells his story. However with no evidence of any Fry or anyone else who knows him, the authorities suspect that the fire was the work of Kane himself. Unable to convince them otherwise, Kane goes on the run to follow up the few clues he has &#150; knowing that he must get to the Nazi saboteurs before the police get to him.With a wrongly accused innocent man on the run looking to find the real perpetrators in order to clear his own name, this film plays a bit like a remake of 39 Steps crossed with a dry run for North By Northwest. Although the basic plot device is very familiar now the film is still quite a bit of fun. At times the plot is a bit baggy and does have sections that could have been cut back in order to keep the film moving at a quicker pace but generally everything is engaging and enjoyable. As this is a Hitchcock film we have some solid sequences and set pieces such as the party that is impossible to leave and the memorable conclusion on an American landmark (both basically replayed in North by Northwest). These are enough to move it along even though. The script seems to have lots of people trusting Kane, which I didn't totally buy and felt it was a bit simplistic to only have saboteurs on one side and good people on the other.Hitchcock directs with his usual style and uses shadows well to build tension. He has a nice awareness of the comic even in a tense scene and the humour works well at times as a contrast to the building tension. Some reviewers have claimed that Cummings was a dull leading man; I'll give you that he is no Cary Grant in terms of screen presence but he does a good enough job given that all the script requires is a believable everyman. He doesn't have as much chemistry as he could have done with Lane but then, I didn't think she was that good herself. The baddies are not that flamboyant but they are a welcome presence in the film and I enjoyed the turns from Kruger, Baxter and Wolfe to name a few.Overall this is a solidly enjoyable film. Not as pacey and fun as North By Northwest but fans of that film specifically or Hitchcock generally find it worth watching. The cast are not that impressive but they do the job &#150; just don't expect them to stand up to stars in some of Hitchcock's later films.

Harold Abrahams is a Jewish academic, known to be very fast, having become the first to break a long standing University challenge to race around the courtyard in 12 strikes. Eric Liddell is a devout Scottish Christian and rugby star who has been chosen to rise to the top of his field as a way of promoting Christianity. The two men face different obstacles to make it to their goal but both strive towards the Olympics with one thing in target &#150; victory.For years I thought I had seen this film and it was only recently I decided that I had not. I could recall the famous scenes, recognise the music but yet I could not remember much else so I can only assume that I had picked it up from popular culture rather than first hand. However watching it now I must admit that I could easily have watched it and totally forgotten it because it is a totally forgettable film that seems intent on making me proud to be British by reminding me how good it is to be bland. The plot is interesting in theory but the delivery does nothing with it and just stays on the surface of the material with a tale of stiff upper lips and decorum but no character, emotional engagement or excitement. I know that British period films have a reputation for being very folded in on themselves and restrained but the best ones contrast that with what is underneath &#150; Chariots of Fire seems determined to ignore anything occurred between the words in the script.I wonder why it has its reputation as a great film because I see very little outside of a patriotic swell that would make people (far less the award ceremonies) love it so much. Hudson's direction is fine &#150; a bit stiff and obvious but generally good enough to do the job although did he presume the constant use of slow-motion would have us all on the edge of our seats? If so, he was wrong &#150; it gets tired very quickly (although that may be its status in popular culture working against it). The cast do what is asked of them but, because this is not a great deal, they didn't do anything for me despite the number of faces in it. Cross and Charleson are both pretty bland and they easily have scenes stolen from them by small turns from the underperforming likes of Havers, Anderson, Gielgud, Magee and Holm.Overall this is a stiff British film with nothing of interest happening beyond the simplistic piece of patriotism and story telling. The narrative is dull and the characters could easily have been replaced with bricks without losing any depth. The cast try hard to produce a serious British period film but the material gives them nothing to work with whatsoever. Succeeds on the level of looking professional and being very British and I suppose that must be sufficient for some people; unfortunately two hours later I decided that it wasn't enough for me.

The cast do what is asked of them but, because this is not a great deal, they didn't do anything for me despite the number of faces in it. Cross and Charleson are both pretty bland and they easily have scenes stolen from them by small turns from the underperforming likes of Havers, Anderson, Gielgud, Magee and Holm.Overall this is a stiff British film with nothing of interest happening beyond the simplistic piece of patriotism and story telling. The narrative is dull and the characters could easily have been replaced with bricks without losing any depth. The cast try hard to produce a serious British period film but the material gives them nothing to work with whatsoever.

Harold Abrahams is a Jewish academic, known to be very fast, having become the first to break a long standing University challenge to race around the courtyard in 12 strikes. Eric Liddell is a devout Scottish Christian and rugby star who has been chosen to rise to the top of his field as a way of promoting Christianity. The two men face different obstacles to make it to their goal but both strive towards the Olympics with one thing in target &#150; victory.For years I thought I had seen this film and it was only recently I decided that I had not.

An unfulfilled sexual encounter at a party is witnessed by Derrick and they decide that they will spread the rumour that the chaste Naomi really did do the nasty with ladies man Beau. Things go better than they expected and the rumour quickly grows from sex at a party into rumours about multiple partners etc. However when the rumour takes a more serious turn towards rape, tensions start to go between the three friends.Starting out as a glossy, hollow and interesting concept the film gradually becomes a glossy, hollow and so-so affair that isn't as good as the first part appeared. The script doesn't do that well at setting up the interesting idea (opting for a lazy lecture genesis) or even delivering it but it doesn't make the concept any less interesting although it does eventually just start to morph into a standard teen thriller &#150; all style, breaking glass and running. Likewise the characters are very clichéd spoilt student types who worked because I didn't care so much for them as actively look forward to seeing their selfish, rich world implode on them. Dislike is probably not enough to base a film on but it was enough to hold my interest here.Guggenheim can't manage to do much with the idea other than let the silly teen thriller unfold but at least he injects style into it &#150; helped greatly by good sets (even if they just made me dislike the preppy spoilt lives of the students all the more!).

A young Kate Hudson doesn't do much and when Eric Bogosian is the big cameo in any film then you know things aren't up to much.Overall this is an OK teen-style thriller that has an interesting idea at its core but ultimately does nothing with it apart from just what you would expect from the genre. It all looks good, has a pretty young cast and produces a thriller that will not put any pressure on you to get involved or to think things through.

But THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, while certainly very expensive, may be among the best film adaptations and adoptions of a well known fictional classic into a major motion picture. The stories it is based on are Raspe's 1780 collection of tall tales of that great adventurer and lover Baron Hieronymous Von Munchausen. The best known tale is how the Baron travels hundreds of miles back and forth during a battle by riding on top of cannon balls (as he does in the film) and how he visits the King and Queen of the Moon. The book made Baron Von Munchausen's name a synonym for liar (albeit a colorful liar). It was glorified by one edition in the 19th Century with illustrations by the great Gustave Dore, that was used by Terry Gilliam for his inspiration in this filmI might add that this was not the first time the character popped up on film. There was a Czech film THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHASEN that was made in the 1950s by the same creators of THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF JULES VERNE. And in the early 1930s an all star comedy was made in Hollywood called MEET THE BARON, based on a popular radio show of that time called BARON MUNCHAUSEN, with a comic named Jack Pearl as the Baron. Although it had the Three Stooges, Jimmy Durante, and Edna Mae Oliver in it, it also had Pearl. A bit more bearable as a dialog comic and zany than the abominable Joe Penner, Pearl gave a catch line that gained national attention in that period. When his garrulous count was questioned by his suspicious trapped listener the Baron would say, Was you dere Charley?, which would shut-up his questioner. But Gilliam is probing the reason for tall tales. A town in middle Europe is under serious siege in the middle 18th Century by the Turks. It is under constant bombardment. There is only one open theater working, and they intend to put on a dramatization on the career of Baron Munchausen. But they are finding that this dramatization is only being begrudgingly allowed by the local authorities (led by Jonathan Pryce, as an obnoxious diplomat and civil servant). Pryce does not believe in fantasy, and feels that the people should see only reality. Of course, as the film progresses one sees that Pryce's idea of reality is bloody and deadly to most people, and will only glorify the peacemakers (a role he intends for himself).As the play is put on by the father of the film's small heroine, Sally Salt (Sarah Polley), a man appears who denounces the story as false. He is Baron Von Munchausen (John Neville). He dismisses the actors (to the anger of the cast and the audience) but he manages to quell their anger by talking about why it was not a real version of his career. Soon he and Sally take a look at the deteriorating situation on the battlefield. They construct a balloon, and take off. And the film then follows their adventures around the world, and on the moon, and even with Vulcan (Oliver Reed) and his wife (Uma Thurmond). I refrain from going into detail but the part dealing with the King and Queen of the Moon (Robin Williams and Valentina Cortese) is very funny and exciting. In the end Munchausen finds his four old servants (Eric Idle, Charley McKeown, Winston Dennis, Jack Purvis)and returns to the town to save it.The film has a Chinese box type of construction. Surprise ending follows surprise ending building to the climax - a peaceful one but one that is shattering none the less. For after watching the destruction of the Turkis forces we learn that the Baron has been simply telling his tales to the audience, and they have been spellbound. Pryce shows up with a military bodyguard, berating the old windbag for wasting the audience's time with all this romantic claptrap. Munchausen points out the firing has stopped. Everyone notices (including an amazed and troubled Pryce - he has missed his chance of gaining fame by ending the war himself). The audience rushes to the gates, and finds the enemy has abandoned the siege. Romanticism, and it's calming effects - it's powers of giving our dreams and wishes wing to soar, has defeated the reality that Pryce offered. And the film ends.I like it. It is saying that in this rotten world there is a seriously place for imagination to comfort and sustain our spirits. The film actually was one of the best philosophical lessons in movie history. Being by Gilliam there are numerous Monty Python touches in it (including his pal Idle's appearances as the fastest man in the world - trying to outrun a bullet). Note too the artistic Turkish Sultan, who is composing an opera called The Torturer's Apprentice, which includes a device torturing a half dozen prisoners to yell Ow and Ooh in time. The performances were good, including Pryce's priggish bureaucrat, but best of all was Neville. Aside from his appearance as Sherlock Holmes in the film A STUDY IN TERROR, and his John Churchill in the television series THE FIRST CHURCHILLS, Neville never had a major lead role (though plenty of good supporting parts Lord Alfred Bosie Douglas to Robert Morley's Oscar Wilde in the film of that name, for example).

Lee Thompson's black-and-white revenge thriller is still effective after its debut 45 years ago, perhaps even more so today with a growing awareness of sexual predators and child abductions. 'Cape Fear' was a very risqué film for its time, receiving numerous edits from the American and British censorship boards and nearly being slapped with an 'X' rating in the United Kingdom. But when all was said and done, the material for a good film was there, coming down to us with nail-biting suspense for which 'Cape Fear' is known.The adaptation by James Webb of John MacDonald's novel 'The Executioners' was a perfect vehicle for all involved. J. Lee Thompson, recently off an Oscar nomination for 'The Guns of Navarone,' was still very much within his element after a series of British realist dramas that included 'North West Frontier' and 'Tiger Bay.' Robert Mitchum, one of the more underrated strongmen in film history, was physically and temperamentally ideal as Max Cady and Gregory Peck eased into the Sam Bowden mix of family man and protector. Peck actually teamed with Universal Pictures to make 'Cape Fear'; the entire cast and crew was hand-picked, resulting in this vintage gem.'Cape Fear' boasts a plot that was extraordinary for its time and has been copied repeatedly. The story follows a Savannah layer named Sam Bowden (Peck) who is visited by Max Cady (Mitchum), an imposing man whom Bowden testified against in a Baltimore trial. Cady was sent to jail for raping a woman and, eight years removed from entering prison, he vows to make Bowden pay for his civic duty. He turns the Bowden family's life into Hell on Earth, following Sam, his wife Peg (Polly Bergen), and adolescent daughter Nancy (Lori Martin) around town. Along the way, he fatally poisons their dog and rapes a newcomer to Savannah, Diane Taylor (Barrie Chase).Sam Bowden, a man of law and order, uses every legal tactic within his reach to drive Cady out of town. With help from police chief Mark Dutton (Martin Balsam) and a private detective named Charlie Seavers (Telly Savalas), he tries to drum up pretentious charges. Cady, however, has learned a great deal about the justice system while in prison, rambling off statute effortlessly. Bowden grows desperate, soon offering Cady hard dollars in exchange for leaving his family alone, hiring a band of enforcers to rough him up, and even considering murder. To make matters worse, Sam discovers that Cady is the lowest of all sexual predators, targeting his young daughter.Shocking in 1962, 'Cape Fear' is no less effective today, in an age of Megan's Law and Amber Alerts. The social landscape has changed since this film was made - laws have been passed in an effort to restrict the movement of sex offenders - but the Bowdens, an ordinary family in an extraordinary situation a la Hitchcock, are still easy to associate with. The danger that Cady brings is excruciating and he also reveals the failures of law enforcement with his own disgusting brand of irony.As J. Lee Thompson has said, Max Cady is the focal character, a sarcastic man with visibly bad intentions. Robert Mitchum, who is listed as 6' 1 in height, is such a dominant force both physically and emotionally, that he seems closer to 6' 5 or 6' 6. Because of this, Sam Bowden comes across as quite ordinary, although Gregory Peck's character takes on a bold dimension in the final half-hour. The film could not have managed without an excellent supporting cast and everyone delivers. Martin Balsam is quietly superb as usual, Telly Savalas does well as a slick private eye, and the portrayals of Bowden's family by Polly Bergan and Lori Martin fit like neat pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Jack Kruschen (as Dave Grafton, Cady's lawyer) and Barrie Chase are not asked for very much, but help in spurring the plot.Cinematographer Samuel Leavitt ('Anatomy of a Murder,' 'Exodus') uses black and white filming techniques that give 'Cape Fear' a sinister edge not attainable in color. Part of what makes 'Cape' such an effective story is its use of shadow and the 'bare bones' feeling that is common in film noir. In the early 21st century, this film takes on an added gloominess, seeming to come from an innocent, bygone world and yet shattering our illusions. George Tomasini, an editor for several of Hitchcock's films including 'North by Northwest' and 'Psycho,' is a major complement to Thompson's well-paced direction. 'Cape Fear' is also not complete without the score of Bernard Herrmann, another Hitchcock regular. Writing on the orchestral scale of 50 years ago, Herrmann's music is notable for its use of ponderous strings and explosive brass. The score, in fact, was used almost verbatim in Martin Scorcese's 1991 remake.Largely a potboiler, 'Cape Fear' has its flaws. There are plot holes, such as the willingness of Dutton to bend laws for Bowden's sake, and implausibility, such as how easily Cady pushes around the band of enforcers hired by Sam. The final scene taking place between a swamp house and houseboat is confusing at first and Sam swims downstream rather quickly to catch up with the villain. The circa-1960 attitudes towards violence against women are also painfully outdated. But none of this takes away from the core storyline, a twisted one for all times.Universal has given 'Cape Fear' elite treatment on its DVD, offering anamorphic widescreen presentation with English captioning for the hearing impaired and subtitles in Spanish and French. The disc is chock full of bonus material that includes interviews with Peck and Thompson, photographs, posters, and the theatrical trailer. Peck and Thompson offer some fascinating insights, including censorship of the film and the original plan to cast Hayley Mills as Nancy. Bernard Herrmann's music is used throughout. The film itself is presented with clean visuals and Dolby-enhanced sound. *** out of 4 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2006","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" J.
