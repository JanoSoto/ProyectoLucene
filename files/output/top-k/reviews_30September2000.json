[{"date":"30 September 2000","score":"","review":"  Cate Blanchette was robbed of an Oscar for her performance as Elizabeth.. she was strong and compelling. HOWEVER, the liberties with which the writers and director of this film took on historical points was appalling.  Never, once, anywhere, have I read that she had sex with anyone!!!!!!  I'm so tired of Hollywood thinking that every film has to have a sex scene in it, even if learned minds already know that it is a lie to place it in the film.She lost her hair as a result of a fever as a young woman, not because she was going to present herself as a virgin queen...  she did not cut her hair off--it fell out.  Her skin was rendered with pock marks as a result of the fever--perhaps she contracted scarlet fever?  Therefore she used heavy white makeup base to hide the imperfections.Nonetheless, the historical inaccuracies are what kept this movie from being as monumental in its scope as Anne of the Thousand Days...  but no matter--Cate Blanchette should have won the Oscar for her portrayal--certainly not Gwenneth Paltrow and Judy Dench for a 6 minute blurb on screen.. yes, she may have turned in a powerful 6 minutes, but it's not enough in my mind, to blot out an hour plus movie on the same character.
