[{"date":"16 January 2009","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Popular, but frustrated high school civics teacher Jim McAllister (an excellent performance by Matthew Broderick) locks horns with ruthlessly driven and ambitious overachiever Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon in peak aggressively obnoxious form), who's determined to become president of Carver High's student body. McAllister convinces amiable dumb jock Paul Metzler (played with endearingly goofy charm by Chris Klein) to run for class president. Complications ensue when Paul's sassy lesbian sister Tammy (the adorable Jessica Campbell) decides to join the presidential race. Plus McAllister's personal life is starting to unravel. Director\/co-writer Alexander Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor concoct a hilariously savage, cynical and unsentimental no-holds-barred satire on American society as a general whole which ingeniously uses high school as an apt microcosm of the world at large we've got fiercely barbed commentary on such worthy topics as morals, politics, teen sexuality, marital infidelity, the lonely price of success, how all actions beget consequences that can change the rest of your life, jealousy, and blind ambition run totally amok. Kudos are also in order for the uniformly fine acting from a sound cast Broderick and Witherspoon spar with each other beautifully well; they receive top-notch support from Klein, Campbell, Phil Reeves as ramrod principal Walt Hendricks, Molly Hagan as Jim's loving wife Diane, Delaney Driscoll as Jim's sweet and attractive lady best friend Linda Novotny, Mark Harelik as disgraced ex-teacher Dave Novotny, Colleen Camp as Tracy's supportive mother Judith R. Flick, and Frankie Ingrassia as the saucy Lisa Flannagan. James Glennon's slick, agile cinematography makes neat occasional use of freeze frames and superimpositions. Rolfe Kent's jaunty full-bore orchestral score likewise does the trick. An absolute hoot.

During a carefully planned burglary at the home of wealthy Walter Sullivan, Whitney is disturbed to hear voices coming from outside the room he is in. Hiding in a secret room he observes from behind a two-way mirror the cheating wife of Sullivan with her lover for the night. Whitney is further startled to find that the man in the company of Mrs Sullivan is none other than the current president of the United States, Allen Richmond. He is then horrified to witness the couples union getting out of control, Richmond starting to get far too heavy handed with the lady in question. Things spiral out of control and during the fight Mrs Sullivan goes to stab the President with a paper knife, thus giving the entering secret service agents no choice but to gun her down. Sensing a political scandal, the agents and Richmond's Chief Of Staff, Gloria Russell decide to cover the incident up. Whitney, after making his escape, doesn't know what to do, who's going to believe a renowned thief, but crucially, will he be allowed to live if he comes forward? Dastardly goings on and government cover ups are merely part of what is going on in the search for Absolute Power.Absolute Power is a fine film, but I'm a little biased because I really like the pacing of the picture and more importantly, I like the plot. It's true that the film fails to capitalise on its first hour set up, we are brought into Whitney's world and given reminders of dodgy doings that blight so many countries political machinations, but then director Clint Eastwood and his team fall in to the trap of adding strands that merely alter the viewers attention span, thus taking us away from what was a concrete and wholly engrossing plot arc. But with a truly diamond cast of professionals in the piece, the film manages to stay the good side of good, tho the ending is one that is sure to be a divisive one for any prospective first time viewers. Eastwood stars as Whitney and is joined by Gene Hackman (President Allen Richmond), Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, Judy Davis and E.G. Marshall. William Goldman adapts from David Baldacci's popular novel, and Eastwood's direction is the usual steady professional job that he would further enhance down the line with the likes of Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby.Should have been a truly great political based thriller\/drama, but as it is, I settle for it being a way above average one that has far too many good points to ever see it as being below average or bad. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2009","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Luther Whitney is a professional thief, he also happens to be exceptional at it.
