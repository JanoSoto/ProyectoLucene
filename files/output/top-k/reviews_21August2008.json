For the second time in less than a week I watch a film with David Hemmings playing the main role (the other was Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso), here he plays Thomas. He is a strange character, not very likable, he seems to be sort of a prestigious photographer and he seems to be tired of his job in the fashion business. Here everything happens in only one day, a strange one. This film is classified by some here as a study of obsession. Having watched Brian De Palma's Blow Out before this one and knowing that it was a sort of reinterpretation Blowup made me think that this was more focused on that, I mean in the obsession for the truth like De Palma's. The first part of this film is centred just on Thomas' strange personality, how he makes his work. Of course is just for causality that he took some pictures of a woman who later seems to be very worry about that. Thanks to that Thomas began to look closer to why that woman was so worry in get the negative. After this event everything is quite strange since is pretty obvious that Thomas feels a lot of curiosity but this is not any kind of straight murder-mystery of search for the truth film. In this case Thomas' perception relies just in his photographs, is a new perception of how things were but when this perfection is lost everything seems to change.If like me you saw first Blow Out and you found memorable the theme Sally and Jack by Pino Donaggio (last year used in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof) here the score by Herbie Hancock is quite accurate so is really great. Also there's a really great appearance of The Yardbirds. That's also a very strange scene, I mean everyone at the club was like statues, except for a couple, and we have a really funny moment with Jeff Beck. Sort of ironically is when Beck has some problems and destroys his guitar when the audience gets a little move. That delivers another moment to see the personality of Thomas with a part of Beck's guitar. Also we see Jimmy Page before creating many masterpieces. Stoll On is such a great song.This film is unique and even hard to rate on the 1-10 scale. I do like it and a lot and for me is quite interesting to see the reviews on this site. As many users really loved it many others not just find it as a bad film but really hated it.

I was totally intrigued; the opera was beautiful, the lighting and color consolidated the mood, and the main character, recording secretly with teary eyes, seemed like a creepy, artistically sensitive but also somewhat fanatic protagonist. I developed the delusion then that 'Diva' must be some sort of psychological, dramatic type of film, a little like Taxi Driver but not so insane, about yearning and obsession, the mystery about another human, admiration from a distance, and the...elite, or elect, or beautiful, or celebrity--the Diva--whatever you want to call it else. Instead, after the first few good minutes, which end after the main character steals the singer's dress, I was unpleasantly introduced to the actuality of this movie as a thriller. And what a poorly written, shot, acted and edited thriller it is. It includes all sorts of bad TV show thriller clichés multiple and switched tapes, chases, foreign mafia type of people (except this time they were having a hard on for a bootlegged cassette-- now this is interesting the two taiwanese guys (apparently the ENTIRE world in this movie has a real hard on for Italian opera) WERE actually present during the first scene when the main character was recording...and yet, even though they are chasing people right and left, with sunglasses on, for the recording, they did not record it themselves!!--anyways, back to my list...) drug and prostitution dealers, inept and corrupt cops, an utter lack of understanding (or perhaps concern) of the function of a human body and how people die (or not) when stabbed, and magically and quickly faint when they are exposed to some sort of mist-spray, and REALLY REALLY REALLY awful deux ex machina. Of course, they had to cater to the majority of the critic population, so they jammed in other irrelevant artistic stuff. There is an artistic type who sits on a large bare floor while putting together a puzzle, and these slow mo shots of a wave machine keep repeatedly appearing with bad new age music in the background. Then there is a completely out of place (well, so is nearly everything else in here) and very long discussion on buttering a baguette. Everything is shot in blue to give yet another out-of-place melancholy noir feeling to a cheesy TV show plot. There are also tedious scenes involving metafiction on the medium of film with reel shapes rotating in various places. I've never liked this type of self-conscious self-reflexivity because I think art should do as a drug and kidnap its audience into its own world, not nag about its form or dress. Anyways. There is also this extremely annoying and stupid technique of panning or zooming at something peripheral during or at the end or a scene. The most stupid of these moments were when, after the main character had walked off screen, the camera takes several seconds to move towards a shot of an ordinary small pool of water. Another time, while bad guys are mishandling a character, the camera moves to a wallpainting of a little girl in a bus (??). For a movie which involves music a great deal the background music is awful. It is absent at certain moments where I think it could have benefited, but it is plenty and repetitious at certain moments when it is utterly superfluous and inappropriate. In fact, the whole recording is really botched, I'm not sure if it was lost in the transfer or what, but the ambiance and environmental sounds and totally lacking...it was as if they just recorded the dialog in an empty and bare studio. This kills any potential thrill considerably. Anyways, when the predictable ending played out (apparently elite sopranos are easily seduced by blank, fawning postmen) I had already lost all my reservoir for caring about the movie.

Although I wanted to see the movie because I liked Redford I truly had no idea what it was about, and I also didn't realize how based in truth it actually was until the movie prompted me to look into the fact behind it which was a lot and very interesting. It's even interesting and pertinent now seeing as how Game Shows have once again become so popular and makes you think a lot about that sort of thing. This is the key to Quiz Show, there are some really terrific, powerful performances and the direction and writing is simple and yet brilliant. The film is intellectually well done and still very entertaining to watch mostly because of the terrific cast and characters. It doesn't necessarily point fingers or tell you who was wrong and who was right but really takes this scandal and draws it out for you piece by piece and shows you everyones side and how it effects them. Anyone who enjoys a good strong movie could sit down and watch Quiz Show and be entertained by it, or thought provoked by it, and can get a variety of reactions out of it which is one of the things that makes it so intelligent. It's not action packed but character driven and the cast is so well picked that they make the characters come to life and seem completely intriguing to carry this story.John Turturro, who is a first rate terrific actor plays Herbert Stempel, an every day blue collar guy who finds great success on the famous game show 21. Unfortunately his revenge antics gets the better of him when he is set up to take a dive and replaced by an intellectual ratings grabber. Turturro is brilliant in the role, case closed. You hate him and yet feel sorry for him all at once. Ralph Fiennes is absolutely amazing as new intellectual champ Charles Van Doren who literally as Eye of The Tiger says trades his passion for glory. His character is very conflicted, and a true anti hero in every sense of the word. He is amazing in this role and I've never seen him in anything much that impressed me like this. Rob Morrow is just amazing as the investigator in the Oversights committee Dick Goodwin who becomes attached to Fienne's character as a friend and tries to protect him while still doing his job to the very end. These three actors make this film everything that it is. While there are some impressive and strong supporting characters including the terrific and multi talented Hank Azaria and the subtle but well played performance by David Paymer, Morrow, Fiennes, and Turturro steal the show...no pun intended. Clearly they found a niche in each other because they have great chemistry together and tell a story that leaves you enthralled in such a simple scandal.So far I have only seen two of Redford's direction projects...the other being last years panned Lions for Lambs which on the contrary I thought was downright brilliant (see my review.) Redford seems to want to tell a story regardless of what anyone else thinks because he is passionate about the content. Sounds silly in reference to a story about a rigged game show but somehow the passion for the content comes through loud and clear and while I wasn't quite blown away by the whole film, the performances, and the delicate re-creation of the time period and the entire world behind the scenes of the game show was brilliant. As I said earlier anyone can watch this and take something away from it even if it's as simple as saying...well that a good movie.

No, really, I do. If I were rating it solely on my fondness for it, I would easily give it a 9 or a 10. On the other hand, if I were going to judge this movie solely on its merits as worthy cinema--story, acting, technical prowess--it would rate a 1 or 2 stars at best.So, what the hell, I split the difference.First, let me tell you why I hate this movie. It doesn't work as soft-core porn--the sex scenes are either disturbing, degrading, or just plain silly (or even all three at once). It doesn't work as social commentary--we already knew show business was full of back-stabbing bitches and controlling bastards, so what's new here? It certainly doesn't work as a cautionary tale, though God knows it does its best in places. Indeed, this movie is so full damn of itself it's in danger of exploding like Mr. Creosote in The Meaning of Life. Either that, or it feels ready to spontaneously condense into a microscopic black hole of sheer pretentiousness.So what does this movie work as? ENTERTAINMENT! All it takes to love this movie is to know, going in, that none of the characters are likable, you're going to be subjected to a lot of oh-my-gosh-my-golly nudity and naughtiness, and that--most importantly--none of this has any bearing on anything remotely resembling reality. Showgirls takes place in its own little universe of sheer, joyous exploitation for its own sake. And this it does admirably well.And, after all, isn't entertainment what movies are for? This is a great movie to watch with your friends. Google for a Showgirls drinking game and do tequila shots. You'll be hammered before you know it.

Most of them borrow from the previous hits and that's usually okay as long as they have their own spin to things and a solid cast, a kick ass hero, and bad ass villain. But there is the danger if you release an action flick in the ocean of action movies and it bares just too much resemblance to the some of the others, perhaps superior ones that are out there and I think that might be the one faux pas that befalls Executive Decision. The movie has a solid story, a decent cast, decent action, decent villain, decent hero...but that's just it...decent. It doesn't aim to really blow you away in the likes of Die Hard, or Air Force One (which Executive Decision bore some striking resemblance too besides just being on a plane even though Air Force One was released two years later.) It's also up against and comparable to Action hits like Con Air, The Rock, and the aforementioned Die Hard. Still there is plenty of good old fashion action to be had in the movie but they seem to focus very heavily on the fish out of water heroes. They also tend to pack a lot of heroes into one movie with a bunch of really great characters that all seem to want to be the one to lead the movie which confuses the viewer away from the main hero. I mean who doesn't watch Lethal Weapon and say Riggs and Murtaugh are wicked or Beverly Hills Cop Axel is the main man but you watch Executive Decision and say Wow all those guys are going to save this plane. You can't root for any one guy despite some big names. Kurt Russell mostly headlines the cast as terrorism expert Dr. Phil. David Grant. Russell's character isn't the field agent type but he inadvertently gets caught up in the action aboard the plane. I like Russell a lot and he's done a lot of great films, some of them amazing action flicks but this performance was a little toned down as his character wasn't supposed to be the hero type but because of that it took away from his role a little bit. John Leguizamo plays a great role as sudden leader of the SWAT team Captain Rat. His role is unfortunately small considering how many characters they had to juggle because he alone could have been a great action hero and he has never really carried a movie that I've ever seen and this could have been his chance but he's still great and the relationship between his character and Russell's is terrific if not a little under developed. Terrific character actor Oliver Platt plays a good role as another fish out of water as Engineer Dennis Cahill who also happens to end up on board. Platt's character is left mostly under developed as well when it could have been a lot more but he does a solid job. Joe Morton and B.D. Wong round out the team as good strong characters but again under developed. Halle Berry plays the head flight attendant Jean and does a decent job but as the case in so many of Berry's roles she doesn't look REAL. She looks like a barbie doll and even if she gives a half decent performance it never really fits? David Suchet could have been one of those kick ass villains I mentioned previously and he does a good job of being terrifying but is left as under developed...see the pattern. Finally it should be mentioned that action great (I've never cared much for him) Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the first leader of the team but is mercifully killed off very early in the movie. I wonder what made him take what is literally a cameo performance.Although director Stuart Baird was no stranger to action having worked on the crew of greats like Lethal Weapon and Demolition Man this was his first job as director. He does a decent job but as you can probably guess from my previous description of the cast he doesn't capture any personality with the characters and has so much going on with them that it loses something. Under the hands of a much more experienced director and maybe a better re-write and cutting out some of the multiple heroes this could have been a top notch action movie. There certainly isn't plenty of moments of intense thrills and it almost goes for suspense more than action if not for the multiple gun fights and terrorists and an edge of your seat ending. Overall Executive Decision sadly comes across as a little bland and it hurts even more because it could have been something great.

Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's Léon. Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.Taking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after Léon, all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director. Léon is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though Le grand bleu takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man Léon (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job. The style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from Nikita) putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character. You see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and\/or psychological disorders he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like Singing in the rain. His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie Danny the Dog, shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.The other relationship Besson writes and details in Léon is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in The Piano) that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being. I want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so Léon can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then Léon does John Wayne. This is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's Léon is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living. In that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer\/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves. The movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like Le grand bleu) and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his.

I can only say that the movie is not intended to be a true comedy, it is a satire, in which human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, the purpose of satire is not primarily humor in itself so much as an attack on something of which the author strongly disapproves, using the weapon of wit. Maybe, before you see this movie you should read something about the time it was made, about the cold war and the real fear people had about nuclear destruction.

Calling it a political thriller(the good kind, where no side is favored over the other and preaching does not take place) is accurate. Realism is impressive in this. The Russians do switch to English for the audience's convenience, albeit they do at least start out speaking their mother tongue. The acting and characters are marvelous. The plot is interesting, nicely developed and keeps moving. This is paced remarkably well, and is never boring. The writing is fantastic and never lets you down. The score is beautifully written and compliments the piece well. The dialog holds cleverness, and memorable lines, without it(with a possible exception or two) ever being silly or out of place.

The only other movie to have so visceral a reaction on me was Saving Private Ryan,for some similar reasons but more frequently for dissimilar ones. The impact of the incredibly orchesterated gladiatorial skirmishes tested my seat repeatedly but they were shot with such photographic skill and framed with such directorial insight that my body didn't go into total meltdown....unlike Private Ryans visions of carnage that ate away like acid at my very soul. Aside from the incredible photography, the intensity of the meld between storyboarding incredible angles and images that created such a sumptuous visual feast, and impeccable acting by a fine and long to be remembered cast... what stands out Most about this film are two things...The betrayal of devotion and Russell Crowe as Maximus whose will to decency and sense of honor made him a victim of the times he lived in. Good God almighty....there are few actors these days that could have brought this kind of raw masculinity to such resonance on the screen....but it is not just this that makes Crowe shine but his incredibly sensitive portrayal of Maximus as a man of the sword by his sense of duty, but a man of the soil in his heart. Crowes physicality and ability to translate Maximus to the screen is a performance worthy of an academy award...but it is Maximus who steals the show!!! His heart,his strength, his determination,his unfailing love for his family, his need for justice,...his Values are the Star of this film. He reminds me of Cyrano DE Bergerac in many ways....and I can give him no better accolade than that. There are so few role models for this age....characters like Maximus are what civilization is all about. He lived up to the heritage and meaning of his name...there is no more...there is no better...than to strive for decency, to uphold honor,to value family, to recognise duty to high ideals, to love the earth,to defend civilization at its best, and oppose tyranny,to cherish life...other lives as well as your own. Maximus was a product of his time, an honored soldier ultimately betrayed. This betrayal cost him the values he lived by for a while to pursue survival...ultimately his values were the victors...and it is they that made him a Hero. Ridley Scott has given the big screen some of its most important and enduring images from Blade Runner to Alien..on and on...he continues to amaze with his ingeniuty at getting his vision transfixed in our minds...no less so here...his use of digital imagery to create Rome and the Colloseum alive with spectators is riveting. Joachin Phoenix is a wonderfully tormented Commodus with his deep and unrequited cravings for love and approval from his sister and his father to his vicious malevolance towards Maximus...what a contrast. He is showing talent far beyond the youth of his years. And the appearance of several of my personal favorites added all the extra spice to a film I was already in love with from the first battle scenes in Germania. These additional screen luminaries and legends were Richard Harris, duly sincere and remorseful as Marcus Aurelius, Derek Jacoby as a Senator hopeful of a new Rome,and the wonderful Oliver Reed, in his last role,as an ex-Gladiator turned provider of human fodder for THE GAMES.

The only other movie to have so visceral a reaction on me was Saving Private Ryan,for some similar reasons but more frequently for dissimilar ones. The impact of the incredibly orchesterated gladiatorial skirmishes tested my seat repeatedly but they were shot with such photographic skill and framed with such directorial insight that my body didn't go into total meltdown....unlike Private Ryans visions of carnage that ate away like acid at my very soul. Aside from the incredible photography, the intensity of the meld between storyboarding incredible angles and images that created such a sumptuous visual feast, and impeccable acting by a fine and long to be remembered cast... what stands out Most about this film are two things...The betrayal of devotion and Russell Crowe as Maximus whose will to decency and sense of honor made him a victim of the times he lived in. Good God almighty....there are few actors these days that could have brought this kind of raw masculinity to such resonance on the screen....but it is not just this that makes Crowe shine but his incredibly sensitive portrayal of Maximus as a man of the sword by his sense of duty, but a man of the soil in his heart. Crowes physicality and ability to translate Maximus to the screen is a performance worthy of an academy award...but it is Maximus who steals the show!!! His heart,his strength, his determination,his unfailing love for his family, his need for justice,...his Values are the Star of this film. He reminds me of Cyrano DE Bergerac in many ways....and I can give him no better accolade than that. There are so few role models for this age....characters like Maximus are what civilization is all about. He lived up to the heritage and meaning of his name...there is no more...there is no better...than to strive for decency, to uphold honor,to value family, to recognise duty to high ideals, to love the earth,to defend civilization at its best, and oppose tyranny,to cherish life...other lives as well as your own. Maximus was a product of his time, an honored soldier ultimately betrayed. This betrayal cost him the values he lived by for a while to pursue survival...ultimately his values were the victors...and it is they that made him a Hero. Ridley Scott has given the big screen some of its most important and enduring images from Blade Runner to Alien..on and on...he continues to amaze with his ingeniuty at getting his vision transfixed in our minds...no less so here...his use of digital imagery to create Rome and the Colloseum alive with spectators is riveting. Joachin Phoenix is a wonderfully tormented Commodus with his deep and unrequited cravings for love and approval from his sister and his father to his vicious malevolance towards Maximus...what a contrast. He is showing talent far beyond the youth of his years.

Really, I can't quite work out what the attraction of this movie is. It's an odd and meandering look at the life and loves of Holly Golightly (played by Audrey Hepburn). Her principle love interest is Paul Varjak (played by George Peppard). Early in the movie, and throughout, you have one of the most appalling performances\/caricatures by Mickey Rooney, who plays Holly's neighbour Mr. Yunioshi. I'm assuming that this character is meant to be amusing, but it's the kind of caricature you'd find in The Bulletin's racist cartoons from decades ago and when their motto was Australia for the white man. Rooney is hopelessly miscast as a Japanese man and way too stereotypical to be taken in good faith.The circumstances of Paul and Holly's initial meeting seem rather pat and established too quickly. I'd often think to myself That's odd at some revelation about Holly...and there are a few such revelations. Reading a couple of reviews in books after I'd made my notes on this film reveal why I was so obtuse the movie is quite coy on what exactly Holly does for a living. I didn't pick it.The opening credits reveal that a US literary lion wrote the book this film was based on (Truman Capote). I surmised that either Hepburn's performance made the book seem more important than it was or that the book was never that good to start with.

Both movies stand or fall on how you take to the lead actresses' characters. I found Holly profoundly superficial and showing only glimpses of the charm that seems to have worked on people who like this film.

The truth is, I'm a sucker for Batman movies. I doubt I'll ever buy this movie, but I do tend to watch it when it comes on TV now and then.I loath the old 60s television series, but I'm aware that it had a strong following, and like it or not, it has left a mark on the history of this franchise. So, I can sort of respect this film's attempt at reverting back to those good ol' days. The only problem is, it also tries to follow the Tim Burton films to a small extent, and the combination isn't a healthy one. We have a surreal, colorful world of pure childlike imagination combined with the adage of Bruce Wayne's more human inner conflicted self and villains with rather violent tendencies, and as a result, it feels like the movie can't decide which direction it wants to go in.Honestly, I think the worst part about this movie was the direction. The script itself isn't all bad. If the style had simply been altered and a few decisions changed, would have radically made a difference, in my mind. The villains are actually more or less faithful to the comics as well as the animated series that was also popular at the time. As opposed to Batman Forever, in which Riddler and Two-Face bare little resemblance to their comic book counterparts, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze are much more true to their characters.George Clooney is an appealing actor to watch on screen. As Bruce Wayne, he's okay, and perhaps the best scenes in the movie are with him and Michael Gough, as Alfred. Here we get something a bit more genuine and a break from the outrageous world that surrounds this film. As Batman, he's not quite as convincing, and plays the character more for laughs rather than the harsh, serious tone of Michael Keaton or Christian Bale. Still, his style works at times, I guess in the same way that Adam West's did for him.What tends to kill this movie is that so many aspects about it are unjustifiably over-the-top. Why does Batman need a silver costume with nipples? Why does the batmobile have to glow in the dark? Why does their need to be a witty line delivered every 5 minutes? All in all, I can't say that this is a must for Batman fans. Again, the lack of direction tends to hurt this movie more than anything. If not for the violence inherited from the Burton films, this movie could've at least had an appeal to little kids, much like the 60s television show.
