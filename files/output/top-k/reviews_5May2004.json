It is about an obsessive boy who attends an elitist school but is expelled due to his eccentric behaviour; however, he continues to pursue his love for his teacher with dramatic consequences.The main character, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), is different to the other pupils at Rushmore. His dad is a barber, yet Max tells people he is a neurosurgeon. He appears to be ashamed of his family life. He wears a blazer and a tie out of choice and he throws all his energy in creating clubs for pupils to join. He is suffering from poor grades and these do not improve when his love blossoms. He befriends fellow outcast, Mr Blume (Bill Murray). Mr Blume finds that he connects with Max as they are both social misfits. He hates his life as a husband to a cheating wife and a father of two sons who he despises. They bond and plan to build an aquarium together. However, the pair find difficulty keeping their friendship civil when they both discover they are in love with first grade teacher, Miss Cross. Max decides to take revenge on Mr Blume with very drastic and hilarious measures but the retaliation is just as radical.Sometimes 'Rushmore' appears to have no clear direction but this is the beauty of the film. The audience is constantly surprised and enthralled by Max's outstanding character and Mr Blume's hilarious comic role. At Mr Blume's son's birthday party when he jumps into the pool with a cigarette in his mouth the music used aids in making the scene tragic but comic at the same time.Although the film is at times radical and unrealistic, it can be suggested that this is what makes the film so unique and interesting. However, it can also be quite tedious when taking into consideration that a middle age man is arguing with a fifteen year old boy.The character, Max, was an enjoyment to watch. Considering Jason Schwartzman was not actually an actor when he was picked for the role he portrayed the character successfully. Bill Murray was hilarious as Mr Blume and really added an edge to the film as the characters play off each other. Both characters were needed to really create this unique comedy.This film is definitely worth seeing. It will have you laughing from beginning to end at both the plot and the characters. Even if the plot does not make it enjoyable, Bill Murray's character definitely will! I would give this film 4 out of 5, with its only downfall being a bit too radical.By Sophie Cupman  ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Rushmore' is funny and quirky from the start.

Faced with exclusion and the pressure of maintaining an infinite array of outside interests, Max is a consistent under achiever who tips the scales of sanity when he becomes obsessed with Rushmore Academy's beautiful young teacher Miss Cross.In a bid to secure Miss Cross's love, Max intends to build a giant aquarium in her honour, with the help of his middle-aged millionaire friend Mr. Blume. However, the innocence and charm that Miss Cross exudes becomes too much for Blume to resist, and soon the testosterone levels reach fever pitch as man and boy desperately vie for her attention. What follows is an hilarious and often moving journey that takes us through the dreams, desires and vulnerabilities of each unique character.Director, Wes Anderson delivers a highly stylistic and colourful film, perfectly paced and complemented by a catchy classic soundtrack that makes for pleasant viewing. Rushmore is very much a film that subtly achieves its aims; in one breath it is funny or sad, in another it can be dark and sinister; particularly with regards to Max's advances to Miss Cross and Andersons' depiction of teenage angst.A well-placed cast provide excellent performances that bring Anderson's creation to life. The characters are warm and intriguing; blending and contrasting perfectly on screen to produce an eccentric and engaging chemistry. The unique and larger than life characters such as Mr. Blume (Murray) and Max Fischer (Schwartzmann) are played with such compassion that you genuinely care for them, despite their obvious imperfections. Murray's depiction of the lonely Mr. Blume is particularly poignant at times, whilst Schwartzmann's energetic performance as Fischer shifts from menacing to affectionate in a heartbeat. Rushmore also sports an assortment of hilarious and interesting characters that aid the films gentle pace, Stephen McCole's humorous addition to the cast with his portrayal of Magnus Buchan, the angry Scot whose talent with swear words is worthy of an Oscar, is one such example.If you like film with depth as opposed to effects, and you remember the moment you discovered your hormones, then Rushmore is the film for you. Rushmore moves from a light-hearted romantic comedy to a darker more complex narrative effortlessly. Overall, it's an absorbing, witty piece that stands alone from the mainstream manufactured Hollywood narratives, delivering a satisfying and pleasurable movie experience.Rating 5 stars  ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is the humorous love triangle between quirky teenager Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzmann), graceful teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) and lonely tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray).

Wes Anderson himself has directed two other comic movies that are very funny they are `Bottle Rocket' and `The Royal Tenenbaums.' The plot revolves around a young adolescent teenage called Max Fisher (Jason Schwartzman) who constantly ignores the real reason why he is at school, and instead takes it upon himself to engage with outside curricular activities like that of being the head of the beekeeping club, and the founder of the fencing club and so on and so fourth. This intense focus upon the unessential in life threatens his future at Rushmore Academy, which could result in his expulsion by the headmaster Dr Guggenheim played by (Brian Cox). But before this happens Max accidentally comes across a 1st Year teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) who he becomes obsessed and falls in love with. One of Max's friends Mr Blume played by (Bill Murray) has also seen Miss Cross and he to falls for her in the same way, resulting in a wonderfully hilarious fight between the two to win her affections. All of the performances within the film were solid and well cast. There was a surprising depth to each character involved, for instance Bill Murray's character was not so much a main character but he was able to express the character's emotions exceptionally well. One of the best scenes was during the pool party where Mr Blume is acting like a bum throwing golf balls aimlessly into the water whilst smoking a cigarette, he then goes across to the diving pool and dives in half heartedly. Bill Murray is able to draw out a character's deepest depressive emotions with comic genius reminiscent within `Groundhog Day' and `Scrooge'. Jason Schwartzman gives a strong bold performance as Max Fisher he is able to pull off with ease a difficult role to do. The comedy is of a very dry wit, but not dark. It is very different to many of those gross out teenage comedies like American Pie, and Road Trip. For this reason it breathes a new freshness to the teenage comedy genre. But it does air a comparison to the film `The Graduate' where the student falls for an older woman Mrs Robinson.  A really great film that just doesn't tire and is able to keep the comedy flowing nicely right up to the end credits. This film just goes to show that you don't need computer generated special effects to make a great film. I really recommend this film to anybody. 5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore (directed by Wes Anderson)Rushmore is a romantic teen comedy which is written by the collaboration of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson the star of `Zoolander' and `Starsky and Hutch.'

It is an endearing tale of a private school boy, Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman, who loves his school, Rushmore Academy. Max only got into Rushmore Academy because of his talents as a playwright rather than excelling at other academic studies. He heads almost all out of school activities from fencing to French, he dreams of being the perfect student but is far from this. In fact all these out of school activities are to the detriment of his grades, but it shows the perseverance of Max's character. When a new teacher arrives, Miss Cross, played by Olivia Williams, Max is immediately infatuated and sets upon impressing her by building the town an aquarium. To fund this aquarium Max enlists the help of local steel magnate Herman, the brilliant Bill Murray. When Herman falls for Miss Cross a hilarious love triangle ensues in which Max and Herman try to out do each other for the attention of Miss Cross.Miss Cross forms the moral centre to the story to which Max and Herman strive to achieve, their affections for her merely glossing over the problems in their own lives from which they run. Through the course of Rushmore we see Max eventually grow into a responsible young man. Bill Murray excels in one of the best performances of his career similar to his performance in recent film, Lost in Translation, he plays a man who is in mid-life crisis. Fed up of his boring job and predictable family life, Herman sees Max as the perfect son, rather than the troublesome twins he is the butt of every practical joke with. Murray plays this character in a typical dead-pan manner. Max runs away from his academic problems and creates a sort of double life, he pretends his dad is a brain surgeon, he is a hairdresser. Max then learns to tell the truth and be unashamed of his true life and heritage. He begins as an arrogant child but by the end of Rushmore becomes a more unassuming young man.Rushmore is a brilliant coming of age comedy which combines a funny story with a strong moral undertone, Schwartzman and Murray are excellent in their roles.

He heads almost all out of school activities from fencing to French, he dreams of being the perfect student but is far from this. In fact all these out of school activities are to the detriment of his grades, but it shows the perseverance of Max's character. When a new teacher arrives, Miss Cross, played by Olivia Williams, Max is immediately infatuated and sets upon impressing her by building the town an aquarium. To fund this aquarium Max enlists the help of local steel magnate Herman, the brilliant Bill Murray. When Herman falls for Miss Cross a hilarious love triangle ensues in which Max and Herman try to out do each other for the attention of Miss Cross.Miss Cross forms the moral centre to the story to which Max and Herman strive to achieve, their affections for her merely glossing over the problems in their own lives from which they run. Through the course of Rushmore we see Max eventually grow into a responsible young man. Bill Murray excels in one of the best performances of his career similar to his performance in recent film, Lost in Translation, he plays a man who is in mid-life crisis. Fed up of his boring job and predictable family life, Herman sees Max as the perfect son, rather than the troublesome twins he is the butt of every practical joke with. Murray plays this character in a typical dead-pan manner. Max runs away from his academic problems and creates a sort of double life, he pretends his dad is a brain surgeon, he is a hairdresser. Max then learns to tell the truth and be unashamed of his true life and heritage. He begins as an arrogant child but by the end of Rushmore becomes a more unassuming young man.Rushmore is a brilliant coming of age comedy which combines a funny story with a strong moral undertone, Schwartzman and Murray are excellent in their roles. Max and Herman both accept new lives and shed past preconceived notions of the perfect life. (*SPOILERS*)Adding to this a perfect Vietnam war play finale we can assume Max will finally settle on this as his sole out of school activity.Score 8\/10.

This coming-of-age comedy had me pondering why, like the lyric in the Faces (Ooh La La) song, I had not seen, or heard, of this film sooner.Newcomer Jason Schwartman plays Max Fischer, the self-made pupil at the elite Rushmore Academy, to perfection. Fischer's exuberance for being president or founder of every extra-curricular activity, from the Calligraphy club to Drama Group, causes him to flunk academically leading to threats of expulsion from the place he adores Rushmore is my life. His unique friendship with Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), a discontent steel tycoon, is shaken when they both fall in love and childishly compete for Miss Cross, a first-grade teacher.Murray's ability to steal many scenes with ease, for example knocking a basketball out of a child's hand or running away from Miss Cross (Olivia Williams) after giving her a note from Max, aptly bring Herman Blume to life and delivers multiple levels of comedy to Rushmore. He excels as the self-loathing industrialist, ditching his renowned sarcasm for a more credible character based role that surely gains our sympathy. With no dialogue, Murray effortlessly conveys Blume's inner turmoil in just one small scene. Having seen his wife flirt with the tennis pro and his kids acting like brats, Herman jumps off the high diving board, wearing Budweiser shorts and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. At the bottom of the pool the camera observes his detachment from his family and his loneliness as even a young boy swims away from him. Accompanied by a Kinks song, this scene highly exemplifies Murray's distinct talent as a flexible actor.Williams' character provides a sense of grounding to the film and genuinely comes across as innocent and someone still in love with the past and her dead husband. You'll just love when Max is quick to point out his mother died so they have something in common So we both have dead people in our families.Not only are the adult actors brilliant but also Schwartman gives a remarkable portrayal of Max, who could easily become annoying if played differently. You like Max even when he lies e.g. getting a hand job from his chapel partner's mother, and when he seems too obsessive. You sympathise with his character for not being like your run-of-the-mill adolescent and respect and laugh at him for his over-confident, optimistic approach to life. Also great performances by the supporting cast, especially Stephen McCole who provides many laughs as the uncouth Scot.Rushmore is full of unique but realistic characters and a superb, witty script with unforgettable scenes like the post-Serpico dinner e.g. Miss Cross brings a date (co-screenwriter's brother Luke Wilson) who explains his attire These are OR scrubs to which Max retorts O R they? Simple one-liners like this enrich the characters and the quirky undertone of Rushmore.The music - the Faces, the Who, Cat Stevens - is used effectively to aid rather than hinder the film's progression but also gives a sentimental, old-fashioned feel that reflects the mood and setting of the academy, the surrounding area and the film itself.Not a traditional happy ending but Rushmore's distinctive blend of adolescent romance and comedy will present plenty of laughs and if nothing else the nostalgic British soundtrack will invoke memories of being a teenager - painful as they may seem.

He develops an obsession for a Rushmore teacher Mrs. Calloway, which leads to his ultimate expulsion from the school he loves so much. It also starts a comical feud between him and his good friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who starts an affair with Mrs. Calloway. The film reminds us all of the emotions we suffered during adolescence, such as jealousy, rejection and loneliness. These are taken to the extreme for comic purposes and amusingly these emotions are also experienced by the adults in the film and not just the teenagers, which is a frightening thought. The film focuses on the importance of friendship and the loneliness that being an outsider can bring. The majority of the characters have suffered a loss or are considered to be outcasts, all they have is each other. It will leave you appreciating the value of friendship and the danger of letting emotions such as jealousy or bitterness come between you and the people you love. This is by no means a film to be taken seriously but there are moments, such as when Max realises what his revenge has done to Herman that will make you think about how you treat those around you. The comic moments in the film are provided by Max and Herman whose strange antics are guaranteed to put a smirk on your face. There are, however, no real moments of hilarity that will bring tears to your eyes. You come away feeling that the comical situations the characters find themselves in have not been exploited to there full potential. It leaves you with a feeling that it could have been so much more. The quality of performance that Murray brings to the screen makes this a film worth watching alone. The lack of wit and sarcasm that is has been his trademark throughout the years means, however, that this is could never be a vintage Murray film. The site of him jumping of a diving board with a cigarette hanging from his mouth is one you can't help but smile at. The plot does tend to become tedious at times, with the characters constantly going around in circles, and the ending is predictable. It is, however, a quirky film that you can not help but like. If you get the chance to see Rushmore it is worth watching, but it is definitely not one you need to rush out and see. Not a classic but I would give it a 6\/10 rating.

Though not physically the ugly duckling story normally dealt with, Rushmore could be said to share the mental journey that is sometimes deeply hidden in the subtext of teen movies. Rushmore is the second collaborative work of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, more often known for his acting. Bottle rocket, their first film, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums more recently, seem to be set in a strange world which seems dulled down at some points and at others it is a spectacle of colour, Max's plays for instance. The 60's style pop music used to underscore the film doesn't seem to quite fit in with the period of the film and although fun I found it intrusive at times. Jason Schwartzman plays Max Fischer, a teenage boy who won a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore academy because of his playwriting skills. Rather than concentrating on his academic studies he prefers to take part in numerous extra curricular activities, particularly the drama group. His character seems to have an overwhelming sense of self- assurance and he manipulates teachers and friends for his own good. Indeed he is blasé about the threat of expulsion saying to his chapel partner he'll 'pull some strings with administration'. Like modern counterparts in teen movies today he isn't really a bad guy and his reasons for manipulation don't appear to have any deeper purpose. His confidence is shaken when he falls for young teacher, Ms Cross, who of course rejects him but agrees they can be friends. Like most men Max seems to consider this playing hard to get.

Max's cringe worthy, advances towards Ms Cross make you want to slap him sometimes, but in the end I can relate and think Schwartzman is enjoyable to watch. I enjoy the way theatre curtains opening and closing are used to link the film to Max's plays and map the passage of time. Herman Blume's character was especially written with Bill Murray in mind and for me it's clear to see. As always he is enjoyable to watch and his character typically seems to be suffering from some sort of mid life crisis and finds it hard to interact with the opposite sex, his wife is cheating and his meetings with Ms Cross are awkward to say the least, but Murray still seems to maintain his sense of comedy despite these issues. Blume is a self made millionaire who hates his family. His isolation from them is obviously depicted through clever use of directorial techniques, particularly when he is sat at the bottom of the grubby looking pool.Rushmore is an enjoyable film which for me requires little effort to watch and although not strictly a laugh out loud romp is definitely a very funny film.

Herman also wishes to woo Ms Cross and there is bitter rivalry between the two suitors. Max's cringe worthy, advances towards Ms Cross make you want to slap him sometimes, but in the end I can relate and think Schwartzman is enjoyable to watch. I enjoy the way theatre curtains opening and closing are used to link the film to Max's plays and map the passage of time. Herman Blume's character was especially written with Bill Murray in mind and for me it's clear to see. As always he is enjoyable to watch and his character typically seems to be suffering from some sort of mid life crisis and finds it hard to interact with the opposite sex, his wife is cheating and his meetings with Ms Cross are awkward to say the least, but Murray still seems to maintain his sense of comedy despite these issues. Blume is a self made millionaire who hates his family. His isolation from them is obviously depicted through clever use of directorial techniques, particularly when he is sat at the bottom of the grubby looking pool.Rushmore is an enjoyable film which for me requires little effort to watch and although not strictly a laugh out loud romp is definitely a very funny film. This film is a must for people who want a change from the normal teen movie.  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
