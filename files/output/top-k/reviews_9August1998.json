As a member of generation X,  I have to agree with all those who have said that younger people need to  see this. Before I saw this movie, I have to admit, war was merely a  concept I learned in history, and the realism of SPR opened my eyes wide  (not to mention my mouth in that first half hour or so). And I also agree  the message was to us. I have yet to experience a loss  or a sacrifice that even comes close to what those families went through,  and of course I hope I never have to experience anything remotely  resembling it, especially after seeing this movie. Before I end this  message, I would just like to clear something up. The meaning of sending  eight guys after one guy, besides the figurative meaning,  the reason given in the movie, is addressed in the first half of the movie.  General Marshall read a very poignant letter that had been written by  Abraham Lincoln to a woman who had lost all of her children in the Civil  War. The brothers had been put in the army together so they would be with  people they knew. Putting family members together in the armed services was  a common practice up to and including WWII. The reason General Marshall  sent those eight men after Private Ryan was so that he could send Ryan home,  instead of his body in a box, like he would have to do for so many men  from so many families. This movie is not entirely fiction based. There were  many incidents during WWI and II in which whole families were killed all at  once. After WWII, it was declared that members of the same family had to be  split up, so that the chances of that family having sons left after the war  were greater than before. Besides all that, if more families lost more sons,  they'd have more contempt for the government for sending their men into a  no-win situation, which makes it a good thing we won! But all of that  speculation aside, I choose to ignore all those who complain about the  *shaking camera*! What's that about? Take some Dramamine for pete's sake!

John Hurt is astounding as an English author who discovers beauty the last  place he'd expect to find it - in an American B movie actor's  performances.  Hurt's character, Dr. De'Ath, is a true original, totally  out of step with the 20th century.  He simply had no need nor interest in  modernizing his ways.  He stumbles upon the work of Ronnie Bostock (Jason  Priestley, in a heckuva good, self-effacing performance) and sees in him  talent and passion.  That's about all I can say without going too far into  plot - but if I were able to physically compel people to see it, I  certainly would.  It's a lovely piece of work.

Jake Kasdan is in his early 20's and has written and directed a wonderful film that belies his age and relative inexperience. I take my hat off to him.  On this evidence he is a major talent and I can't wait to see what he does next.When I heard about the plot of ZERO EFFECT, the story of an eccentric and reclusive, private detective and that this part would be played by Bill Pullman, I was sold on the film immediately.  Bill  Pullman is a wonderful actor who I admire greatly and is always a joy to watch on screen.  The part of Daryl Zero is a very tricky one and very few actors could pull it off, but  Bill was simply brilliant. The scene where we hear Daryl playing his guitar and singing a song but don't actually see him  for about three minutes was perhaps the most wonderful introduction of a character I've seen in any film.Ben Stiller provides sterling support as Daryl's right hand man and Ryan O'Neal (nice to see him again) and Kim Dickens are also terrific.There are so many great lines in the film, particularly those where Daryl is explaining his methods of deduction and surveillance.

As good as Schindlers List was (and it was very, very good),  its impact seemed at times forced. All this aside, nothing could prepare me  for Saving Private Ryan. The film is not the work of a great director, it is  the work of a world-class artist. It is stunning. It is devastating. It  works where it should not work. It works where you do not want it to work.  It is a simple war film. It is an intellectual challenge. It is cold and  distant.  It is raw and emotional. I have never seen or experienced anything quite  like it before. The only film I can remember reacting to in such a way is  Pasolinis great (and repugnant) film Salo. Both are kicks in the gut. Both  (and I'm sure there are not many admirers of Salo out there) are cries from  the depths that eventually by their ends not only expose human evils, but  also depict hope and dignity.
