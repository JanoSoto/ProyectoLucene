The trailer made it look cheesy and awful. But, after watching it at least ten times, I can honestly say this was one of the funniest movies that's come out in a while. The dialogue is so spontaneous (you can tell he was just having fun doing the voices) and it's silly and stream of consciousness, and clever in the use of old and new footage and dialogue. So much of Oedekirk himself went into this movie. Rent the DVD and watch it with the audio book audio track, listen to what the actors are actually saying on the other track, watch the cut scenes and special features. Once you do that I think you'll begin to understand the style and humor of this great little flick. And it seems that 20th Century Fox (the distributor) doesn't understand the movie either. It seems to be their fault the movie didn't do so well in the theatres. Why do the independents always get jerked around? (See Monkeybone for another example of how Fox can ruin a perfectly good idea.) Those unfamiliar with Steve Oedekirks' personal sense of humor would be well advised to rent High Strung. But, there's no accounting for taste. One last note it seems that when you're in the entertainment industry (as opposed to Joe Blow off the street in a theatre)the way you watch movies starts to change. Once you have done it yourself and seen how much work goes into creating anything for video, you begin to see a little clearer where the director was coming from, therefore ruining any kind of pure movie experience for yourself FOREVER. That's not to say you can't appreciate movies once you've involved yourself in the background, just different things appeal to you and the defining features of a quality movie may be different than if you weren't involved in the industry.

It felt so real to up close and personal with them. It was scary real. There was rockets flying around and chunks of warm body parts spewing up, it made my stomach REALLY hurt. Just like everyone says it's a 90 minute version of the OMAHA BEACH scene from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.It has REALLY good sound in it, so if you haven't seen this yet, go to someone's house who has huge speakers and a really big TV. There's just so much to this movie that you can't be satisfied with a dinky TV and little bitty speakers. You'll miss the spooky details if you do watch it the watered down way, and you won't fully appreciate it. It really does matter. It's really thrilling if you watch it like that. I just don't give a 10 to any movie. This one is really that good. I was a little dissapointed with the DVD cuz it didn't have that scary feeling I had that i was in a desperate situation, dodging bullets, rpgs, and my own team (friendly fire). What makes this movie so good is that it's a true story that people really don't know much about(like teenagers). It happened in 1993, so I was only 5. My mom didnt let me watch dead soldiers getting dragged through the streets(related to black hawk down), I wouldn't remember anyway. So when I walked into that theater, I didn't know what to expect, I didn't read the book anyway. There was a blue-ish scene in the beggining that had to do with the hummanitarian missions the UN went through that used really disturbing and upsetting imagery. It grabbed my attention lots. After that it went to October 2nd (the day before the big incident oct 3), to give an idea what Somalis were like. It was disturbing too. Never mind. I wont go any further but to say if you haven't read the book...please see this movie. You won't know what will happen. If you have read the book, see this movie anyway and don't gripe about mess ups since this a story of a battle that went on for 19 HOURS. You'll get to greet thousands of angry, heavily armed somalis with nothing to loose but their arms, legs, and heads. Check this movie out. It's very authentic and it's made by Ridley Scott (director of gladiator).

Don't get me wrong, it was good, but that is not exactly true.  Now, for my possible explanations for and questions about the unexplained aspects of this film.SPOILERSThis is going to be very confusing,First of all, to the people who are confused about the ambulance.  Adam used the ambulance as a story to lure the FBI agent into his plan.  We know that this is the case by referencing the murder of the old man earlier in the movie, when Bill Paxton forces Fenton to cooperate by telling the man that his dog is under the car.  My problem with all of this deceit is that if they are using the hand of God to kill demons, are all of the lies really necessary?  They seem to add an evil element to their actions, which I think contradicts their motives.  Also, just to throw this in there, the angel that Bill Paxton sees under the car was not necessary, either.  It just looked fake and out of place, especially with the out-of-place flames behind him.  Now for the mixup concerning Adam and Fenton.  Obviously, Adam is the real narrator of the story.  Unfortunately, he tells Fenton's story with such detail that it is hard to believe that he made all of it up at the end of the movie.  I feel that this could have been prevented if the movie were filmed through more of Adam's and Bill Paxton's point of view instead of Fenton's.  The reason I feel this way is because the audience relates to Fenton far too much during the movie and then we find out that the story about him is probably not even true, seeing how Adam used it just to fool the FBI agent.  Now for the scene where Adam does not touch the FBI agent. I completely understand this scene, however, I don't understand later why the FBI agent does not put the handcuffs on him.  It seems to me that if you are going to let the prisoner put on their own handcuffs, you do it out of sight.  That is not the case in this scene, though, and if that is not enough, Adam almost puts himself in a situation where the FBI agent is going to put the handcuffs on him, even though he knows this would be disastrous. Now, to a totally different subject, is the list we see at the end of the movie the original list or is it new?  That is not discussed, nor is the amount of people that Adam has killed discussed.  This lack of information is accentuated by the box for the movie, which states that the God's Hand Killer is back, but since when.  Was the killing of Fenton his first resurgence or were there more, we're never told.  This is just bad writing, because it is hard for the viewer to understand the evil contained within Adam if we do not know how many people, if any, he has killed.  Also, why is Fenton considered a demon, because he killed his dad?  If this is the case, why was he not put on the list earlier?  All of the other victims were of a similar age at the time they sinned as when they were killed but not Fenton. On another note, at the end of the movie, we see Adam's accomplice, maybe it's his wife, but we are never really introduced to her, so the question posed, is did she just come under Adam's influence or is she one of God's Hands as well?  This is not explained.  There are many more questions that I have, such as why would the Sheriff not believe Fenton and why would he go into the basement of the shed by himself?  And if Adam was a serial killer, why didn't Fenton kill him as well?  And why would the FBI agent take Adam into the woods at night, even when he thinks that he is Fenton, is this really smart?  I don't think so.  Anyway, all of the problems with this movie could be cleaned up with some tighter writing but since they were not it will remain as a weak thriller.  I can't understand the people who say that the movie is creepy.  The only way it could be creepy is if it were like Usual Suspects in that you really don't believe the ending.  Unlike Usual Suspects, however, we can easily believe the ending.  The main difference occurs when in Usual Suspects a person can draw conclusions at the end of the film relating the surprise to actions during the film such as with the wanted poster and the bottom of the coffee cup.  There are no connections like this in Frailty, which causes the viewer to believe that the writers simply slapped the ending onto the movie without any understanding of the negative consequences.

Russell Crowe won the Oscar, in my opinion, on the opening scene and when he found his family dead. The Shorow scene must be classified as one of the most touching and emotional moments ever seen. Commodus was exceptional as well as all the other supporting actors. The music of the film is a clasical masterpiece. One of the finest orchestrations, despite the fact that many sounds were known to the experienced audience. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard (from The Dead Can Dance) completed a fully tensioned and emotional soundrack. The screenplay based on a historical fantasy idea had some gaps but the dialoges between the characters were very good like the one in the end of the movie between Gladator and Commodus Glad I had a friend once who said to me, when death smiles at you the only thing you can do is to smile back at him Commo And what did your friend do when he died? Dlad You should know, he was your father. Now to the directing of Ridley Scott. He is a very talanted director who knows in perfection what it means to create vision out of a text. Even in Hanniball his directing was strong, solid and thick. Here in Gladiator he shows as a perfect age illustration, he uses all the means (camera music photography) at their extremes in order to create a solid appearence of his film. The usage of visuall effects are effective. The best part of his job is the characters. Everyone that appeared there did everything with a reason based on real or close to real people.

Jacob's Ladder was a film made 11 years ago and it's the only scary movie that really made me jump out of my seat.

SPOILERS...This is the first film to use that shaky head technique you see in other horror films and music videos. This is the only movie that does it right by presenting it in the most unexpected fashion possible. You see alot of upsetting things that only this movie can scare you with. Faces, weird looking, deformed looking faces. EYES suddenly changing color. I don't want to spoil everything for you but if you ever played the first Silent Hill game, you'll know what this movie is like. Kind of anyway.The movie is really difficult to understand the first time you see it, so if you like to know story, DARE I SAY WATCH IT AGAIN UNTIL YOU DO. You know why? This is the only movie that scares the living crap out of you the second time you watch it. Or third. Or Fifth. It all depends if you're scared of other scary movies besides this one. I'm not, and that's saying alot. The first time I watched this, I kept my closet light on for three nights. I asked if I could sleep in my parents room, but they wouldn't let me. When I went to bed, all I could think of was the disturbing images that stuck in my head. I'm not kidding. I felt like there was someone in my room that would show up in my face any minute I opened my eyes up...but it was all in my head. What I'm trying to say is, everything you see in this film affects you psychologically. It really messes with your head. It may take a week for you to recover. Even if you've never in your life been scared of movies. It might even take longer to repair the brain wounds you recieve, if you're scared of some movies. Or even longer if you're scared of all horror, suspense, thriller movies you've seen. That's what makes this film so special. You won't expect to have nighmarish things bouncing back and forth in your head when you go to sleep. That's something that I think most people will remember this film for. Also it's deep, find-it-out-your-self-story, that's sure to intrigue you for years to come, just like books like The Giver. There so many different ways to view or understand this movie, I guess it all depends on what you think.Also the acting and mood is swell. It is completely orignal, it has a good sense of realism, even if the things you see in it is impossible. I recommend this movie to anyone, and I do mean ANYONE. Like I said, if you've never been scared of a movie your whole life, this one will change that. If you like to read books, and are a very open minded person, this is a great title to figure out at the end. Even if it means sleeping with a something figure in your thoughts, screwing up your brain functions...any cost, you must see this movie. Or just go on ahead and buy it. Period.

M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, I have seen his last 3 movies, and I loved every one of them. Signs is a very hard movie to understand. Its seems to be sci-fi, but with a little bit of horror\/suspense on it. It's like Close Encounters meets Sixth Sense.My favorite scene in the movie is the basement one. It was shot almost entirely in the dark, and we can only see fragments of sounds and images. And, amazingly, just like Blair Witch Project, it works. Why? Well, because the whole suspense is in the audiences minds.I think you might find that interesting as I was watching the movie, I kept trying to solve the movie's puzzle, the final surprise. I mean it's there, in every M. Night movie. And I thought that those were not aliens, but DEMONS or DEVILS or something. And what would make the demons go away would him getting back to his faith. I mean, watch the scene where he refuses to pray with his children when he is about to eat... And you'll see that my point of view could be right. What made the demons go away the first time? Mel Gibson's character, praying silently when his son is fighting to breath. And what made the demons go away the second time? Water. Why? I dunno, maybe because they live in hell or something, and just like fire would burn us, they get hurt by water...Anyway... I can only think of two persons who could try to film such a movie, Hitchcock and Kubrick. Hitchcock would probably not use some camera elements (as the in the ground shots), and would not use SFX as it is needed to create the mood, so it wouldn't work. Kubrick would probably use his parallel to the wall shots, and his face close-ups, and would NOT end the movie like that... So... maybe it wouldn't work. Maybe. Kubrick would surprise us in some other creepy way.Only M. Night could direct this movie. So... Let's just wait for his next one.

M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, I have seen his last 3 movies, and I loved every one of them. Signs is a very hard movie to understand. Its seems to be sci-fi, but with a little bit of horror\/suspense on it. It's like Close Encounters meets Sixth Sense.My favorite scene in the movie is the basement one. It was shot almost entirely in the dark, and we can only see fragments of sounds and images. And, amazingly, just like Blair Witch Project, it works. Why? Well, because the whole suspense is in the audiences minds.I think you might find that interesting as I was watching the movie, I kept trying to solve the movie's puzzle, the final surprise. I mean it's there, in every M. Night movie. And I thought that those were not aliens, but DEMONS or DEVILS or something. And what would make the demons go away would him getting back to his faith. I mean, watch the scene where he refuses to pray with his children when he is about to eat... And you'll see that my point of view could be right. What made the demons go away the first time? Mel Gibson's character, praying silently when his son is fighting to breath. And what made the demons go away the second time? Water. Why? I dunno, maybe because they live in hell or something, and just like fire would burn us, they get hurt by water...Anyway...

The first one is Bram Stoker's Dracula, from Coppola, and the second one is The Vampire Chronicles, from Neil Jordan.  But I'd like you to pay a particular attention to the second title I mentioned...It is written by a woman named Anne Rice.Now, the point I'm trying to make is the following Knowing that Queen of The Damned is an adaptation of an Anne Rice novel, just like Vampire Chronicles was, there was some kind of...how could I say that...very high expectations around this film.  Well, let's simply say I was deceived in every way.Now, if I was such an evil and mean guy, I would compare both films based on Anne Rice's novels....but Queen of The Damned is so awful, if I compared it to a masterpiece like Vampire Chronicles, it would be like comparing Stanley Kubrick and Ed Wood...But, when I think about it, I'm not such a nice guy, and this film really deserves a bash!Where do I start, because every point of the film is a flaw?  But, I'll have to start with something, so let's go with the acting.  With a protagonist that is as spooky as a stupid eleven year-old kid with a vampire costume on Halloween night.  He really sucks.  Trying to look like a goth with his leather pants and transparent shirt...wow!  You only look like a fashion show robot!  That's the image of American goths...wannabes!  And thanks for keeping it alive, you idiot!  I just can't believe this guy and Tom Cruise are supposed to play the same role!  What a shame!  And there's Aaliyah...who plays the least sensual and scary vampire I've seen in a long time.  She also has a very limited talent in this film.  There is Vincent Perez, who has a very cheap role, and whose performance is consequently ruined.The directing has nothing impressive, it is very basic, it doesn't create any mood (now I'd like SOOOOO much to compare it to Neil Jordan's film!!!!!), and it is the most simple thing you can see, it still shows how lazy some Hollywood directors get for summer or blockbuster movies.  As much as Neil Jordan's film is moody, intense, beautiful, well shot, well acted, interesting, somptuous, and great, as much Queen of The Damned is a pure piece of scum!And, even though that may sound bizarre, there's the vampires.  You know, in movies, there are several kinds of vampires there are primitive, aggressive, black-blooded vampires (see John Carpenter's Vampires), there's classy vampires (Bram Stoker's Dracula and Vampire Chronicles), funny vampires (Fearless Vampire Killers, and the parody with Leslie Nielsen), classic vampires (Nosferatu, earlier versions of Dracula), and high-tech and criminal vampires (see Blade and Blade 2), disgusting vampires (From Dusk Till Dawn trilogy)...and, now, I'd like to add a new breed in the list, especially designed to describe the blood thirsty creatures in this movie cheap vampires!  They don't have the charm of classy vampires, they don't have the jokes of funny vampires, they don't have the make up of the disgusting vampires, they don't have the velocity and ferocity of aggressive and strong vampires....they simply got nothing!  NOTHING!Another element that some might find meaningless, but that I think is important in this kind of film, especially when everything else is bad...the gore!  NONE!!!  NONE NONE NONE!  No gore!  One brief decapitation, and that's it!  That's it!  Really deceiving.  Even the bestThe scenario is not that bad, but it is served on a plate that would completely ruin any good script.So, I know my review is pretty short, but there is not much to say about an empty film.  Again, this is today's version of vampire flicks...and it smells a lot like MTV crap.  Now, I simply imagine the director crying because he got a big R rating for his movie...I'm sure this was meant to be rated PG-13...but now Michael Rymer can go cry with his friends Paul Anderson (Another kick in the face of your Resident Evil!) and Renny Harlin (the arm being ripped out in Deep Blue Sea was too much...Renny!) who live in the desperate world of harder selling main stream scum, because of the very mean MPAA who refused to give them a PG-13 rating when they truly deserved one.

The grand feel and grasping richness of this film is so in evidence you can not help but be swept in. It would be a lie to say the theme of the movie is a completely new one and as the viewer you can guess where this story will lead. But you cannot tear your eyes away from the stunning Cinematography, for a second of the time. The performances from all concerned are faultless, Tom Hanks is completely and utterly believable in the role of Michael Sullivan, it will take some performance from a leading man this year to better his.

This is the first movie in long time that actually managed to freak me out (and others I know as well), so at least the horror genre isn't totally dead...With that being said, I think one of the best parts of the movie is the original premise, where a secret faster-than-light ship that travels through black holes to reach vast distances in a short amount of time disappears on route to the nearest star... and comes back, albeit sans crew.  This may appear to be a copy of old stories about ghost ships and the Flying Dutchman and such, but in terms of science fiction it breathes new life.The thriller aspects do borrow from some established sci-fi\/horror movies, but it works in this case, and director Anderson does a good job of keeping the suspense going.All in all, I believe this film is rated worse than it deserves.

Absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the original film, being simply an antipodean tale of lycanthropic maladjustment!Way better now than upon its release, the full low-budgetry inanity of Mora's little pet works quite well if you can get on its wavelength, that is, down to a primordial level. Beautiful redhead, Miss Annesley (shame she can't speak as well as she looks) is the aptly named Jerboa, a girl with a rare secret. Biologically er, different, she has the cutest little pouch just above her more R rated parts, which following a night of passion, soon gains the tiniest of new inhabitants in a scene one can only describe as different!A subject of extreme interest to the medical profession, trivia buffs may notice none other than film historian and TV presenter Bill Collins making his rather pedestrian debut here as a hospital doctor, somewhat enamoured with Jerboa's never-seen-before physiology.Played strictly for laughs and non-conformist fun, the budget constraints were such that at the point of anyone actually being attacked by a werewolf, all the viewer ever gets to see is a back-pedalling actor with varying expressions of laugh-out-loud fright. In hindsight I think this adds to the quirkiness rather than detracts!Ever reliable Barry Otto (first up on anyone's list with a fully left-field flick in the offing) is Professor Harry Beckmeyer who takes it upon himself ultimately to protect Jerboa from those who would harm her. Michael Pate and son Christopher make a suitably stilted (as in  What the hell am I doing in a film like this?) contribution and Australia's grandest thespian Frank Thring, camps it up shamefully as a Z-Grade horror-movie director.  Pontius Pilate (In Ben Hur) to THIS????    Hmmm, its a worry!IN the wash-up, what we have here a one-off film experience, one anyone can miss and be none the worse off for! If you ARE unavoidably entrapped one night, well at least you can say, Yeah I've seen HOWLING III, my life is now fulfilled!

The direction and cinematography are flawless, the script is brilliant (seemingly never wasting a word, with every scene moving crisply), and the casting is extraordinary (note the excellent performances by Elizabeth Berridge, the priest who takes Salieri's confession, and of course Tom Hulce).  However, for me, what sets Amadeus apart from many other very good movies is the incredible performance of F. Murray Abraham.  I can think of a number of great individual performances (Brando in On the Waterfront, Paccino in Godfather I & II, Di Nero in Raging Bull, Nicholson in Chinatown, off the top of my head), but none that moved me as much as the Salieri Abraham created.  The emotion, and wit he imbued the character with are just amazing.  I don't wish to spoil anyone's experience with specifics but the creation of a man who, I feel, has an ocean of bitterness covering up his genuine guilt and desire for repentance is something to see.  Often we get to see emotions like rage, desperation, and love portraid brilliantly in films.  Rarely do we get such a showcase for the far more subtle feelings (frustration, pettiness, repression, etc.) that Abraham so deftly displays. The blackness of Salieri's soul is not the normal kind of evil that movies throw at us to the point of exhaustion, but, when revealed, it is no less chilling to the audience (or to his confessor, who's facial expressions in one particular scene of revelation are also masterful).  There are a lot of people responsible for this fantastic film, but what keeps me coming back is the desire to see Abraham's once in a lifetime performance again and again.
