His life is in a constant state of flux, leaving Danny to find solace in music.Empty opens with an atmospheric sequence in which the Pope family evade the FBI. We then watch as they settle into a new town and enrol their kids in a new school.In one cute scene, Danny arrives late to his first music lesson, and is asked by the teacher to explain the difference between Beethoven and Madonna. Danny's answer (You can't dance to Beethoven!), and his teacher's later explanation, sums up the central theme of the film. Pop songs, we learn, are largely comprised of a series of predictable rifts and choruses. Beethoven, in contrast, constantly thwarts expectations. He sets up a predictable route, then veers off in different directions. The point is, the young need a familiar beat. And so Danny, who is constantly on the move, constantly out of synch with the world, is never given the time or space to develop a dance of his own. Ironically, it is being out of sync which leads to great art. Being out of sync creates a kind of artistic objectivity. An outsiders view, which Danny embodies.As the film progresses, Danny clashes several times with his father, a hippie and anti-authoritarian activist who insists that Danny must give up his music (he's been offered a place at a prestigious university) and stay with the family. What makes the film interesting, however, is that Danny is so soft-spoken and loyal to his family that he agrees with his father. This leads to a sort of internal conflict only recognised by Danny's mother. She senses the pain in her own son, and tries to persuade her husband to set him free.But no, Arthur refuses. If Danny enrols to the prestigious music school he will have to give his real name and real birth details. When he does so, the FBI will track and monitor him, which of course means that Arthur and Annie will never get to see their boy again. It's not a simple matter of forbidding one's son from pursuing art (a common theme in films), but of holding a family together. By setting Danny free, Arthur and Annie effectively prevent themselves from ever seeing him again.And of course, both Arthur and Annie know all to well how painful it is to be separated from family; they were young when they committed their crime and so have not seen their own mothers and fathers in decades. It is thus an act of profound love which makes the family's decision so difficult. Lumet has always been an actor's director, so its no surprise that Running on Empty features a number of powerful conversations. One of the best involves Danny confessing his identity to a girl he's fallen in love with. Another involves Annie's conversation with her father, a man she hasn't seen since she was a child. Danny's final words to his father are likewise powerful.Another interesting theme is the film's treatment of art and political activism. Annie and Arthur both tried to change the world, but in wanting to make the world safer for their kids, they've effectively cut their own children off from society. The film then looks at the way the hippies, radicals and political activists of the 1960s and 70s were enveloped and assimilated into a more dour, suburban life, rendered invisible, not by choice, but by what is essentially a complex blend of fear and threat of violence. For Lumet, art (in this case music) thus becomes a form of neo-activism. A form of potent protestation and personal freedom. Danny, in playing his music, does not cut himself off from his family, rather, he reinvigorates the spirit and ideals they once fought for.8.9\/10 &#x96; A love letter to artists, sensitively directed by Sidney Lumet.

The State Governor therefore decides to re-create the Texas Rangers, who had been disbanded after the Civil War, to uphold the law. The film follows the exploits of a company of Rangers led by Leander McNelly. The villain of the story is John King Fisher, the leader of a gang of outlaws who specialise in stealing cattle and then fleeing into Mexico, where the stolen cattle are sold to the Mexican army. The gang are ruthless killers, who have no compunction about murdering unarmed civilians in cold blood. It came as no surprise to discover that the film is loosely based on fact and that McNelly and King Fisher were real historical figures; Leander McNelly did not sound like the sort of name any scriptwriter would invent for a fictitious character. The film allegedly takes some liberties with the historical record, but these are unlikely to upset anyone other than experts on Texan history.Although the Texas Rangers are, strictly speaking, a law enforcement agency rather than a military unit, the film bears more resemblance to a war movie than to a cop film. The plot is that old staple of war movies, the one about the tough, experienced commander who takes a group of raw recruits (most of them are young men with little or no experience of guns or policing crime) and turns them into a crack fighting unit. In their initial battle with the bandits, the Rangers fall into a trap, and many of the young and ill-trained men are killed. Nevertheless they regroup, attract new recruits and face off against Fisher and his men in a final showdown.The film is directed by Steve Miner, previously known to me only as the man who made Lake Placid, a dreadful horror-comedy unlikely to appeal to anyone other than those who feel that there is something inherently hilarious about someone getting their head bitten off by a gigantic crocodile. Fortunately, Miner makes no attempt to inject comedy elements into Texas Rangers, and it is a better film than Lake Placid, although that is not really saying much.The past few years have seen something of a revival of the Western genre. Many recent Westerns (Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, Wyatt Earp, 3.10 to Yuma) have been grand films made on an epic scale, but Texas Rangers is a much more modest, small-scale effort, more reminiscent of the old Western B-movies. Its total running time is very short for a twenty-first century film- the version I saw on British television recently only ran to eighty minutes. It is essentially a good-guys-versus-bad-guys Western of the old school with plenty of action and gunplay but without any deep significance. There are occasional attempts to inject a note of moral ambiguity- McNelly can be uncompromising in his methods- but there is little doubt that he and his men wear the metaphorical white hats and the Fisher gang the black ones.

KEVIN We come to it at last. Not surprisingly the most expensive movie of its day by far, William Wellman's inaugural Best Picture-winning tale of love-and-friendship-through-war Wings holds up surprisingly well after 80 years of bigger, badder, and brutaller depictions of war on film. The battle scenes, both ground and aerial, are exciting and energetic even by today's standards. But like most silent films, the sentimental character stuff gets about as much screen time (if not more) as the explosions and gunfire. At first I expected the main characters Jack (Buddy Rogers) and David (Richard Arlen) to be lifelong rivals, but instead they quickly resolve their differences and become BFFs after beating the snot out of each other in the first act. Class separation goes out the window when you're all part of the same war. The very drawn-out scene where Jack gets drunk off his ass yields some of the strangest visuals I've ever seen in a war movie, not to mention the most egregious lull in the film's action. *SPOILER* David's big death scene has got to be, and I say this with a great deal of affection, the gayest thing I've seen in a silent film. I'm certain that scene wouldn't have made it past the censors a decade later. *END SPOILER* The biggest blow against the movie is, I guess not surprisingly, the female characters. The character of Sylvia (Jobyna Ralston!) is grossly underused even at the end when Jack returns home and meets David's parents, but Sylvia, the true love of David's life, is nowhere to be seen. As for Mary (top-billed Clara Bow), her role as an ambulance driver in the war seems mainly there to reduce the geography in the love story, and she is rather unceremoniously written out of the war before long. Her gee-whiz disposition towards the action doesn't seem to go away even after she narrowly survives a horrific bombing raid. At the end of the day, it seems like only the male characters are allowed to be changed by the war. It's too bad we had to wait sooo long to see this film. It was a long movie, yes, but definitely worth the time.DOUG I had wanted to check out this movie for a long time, not least because it's the first winner for Best Picture at the Oscars, but also because the cast includes Clara Bow and Jobyna Ralston (Harold Lloyd's most frequent muse), and was directed by the guy who did The Public Enemy. It is, in a historical sense, one of the great war movies of the silent era, along with 'The Big Parade' (which is better). Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen play the two leads, Rogers as the naïve, boyish Jack, and Arlen as the stern, square-jawed David. Clara Bow gets top billing surprisingly, since she doesn't have as much screen time as the guys, but was still the biggest marquee name. Ralston, alas, is underused as Sylvia, the woman Jack wants even though she loves David; she vanishes after the first act when the boys enlist.

KEVIN We come to it at last. Not surprisingly the most expensive movie of its day by far, William Wellman's inaugural Best Picture-winning tale of love-and-friendship-through-war Wings holds up surprisingly well after 80 years of bigger, badder, and brutaller depictions of war on film. The battle scenes, both ground and aerial, are exciting and energetic even by today's standards. But like most silent films, the sentimental character stuff gets about as much screen time (if not more) as the explosions and gunfire. At first I expected the main characters Jack (Buddy Rogers) and David (Richard Arlen) to be lifelong rivals, but instead they quickly resolve their differences and become BFFs after beating the snot out of each other in the first act. Class separation goes out the window when you're all part of the same war. The very drawn-out scene where Jack gets drunk off his ass yields some of the strangest visuals I've ever seen in a war movie, not to mention the most egregious lull in the film's action. *SPOILER* David's big death scene has got to be, and I say this with a great deal of affection, the gayest thing I've seen in a silent film. I'm certain that scene wouldn't have made it past the censors a decade later. *END SPOILER* The biggest blow against the movie is, I guess not surprisingly, the female characters. The character of Sylvia (Jobyna Ralston!) is grossly underused even at the end when Jack returns home and meets David's parents, but Sylvia, the true love of David's life, is nowhere to be seen. As for Mary (top-billed Clara Bow), her role as an ambulance driver in the war seems mainly there to reduce the geography in the love story, and she is rather unceremoniously written out of the war before long. Her gee-whiz disposition towards the action doesn't seem to go away even after she narrowly survives a horrific bombing raid. At the end of the day, it seems like only the male characters are allowed to be changed by the war. It's too bad we had to wait sooo long to see this film. It was a long movie, yes, but definitely worth the time.DOUG I had wanted to check out this movie for a long time, not least because it's the first winner for Best Picture at the Oscars, but also because the cast includes Clara Bow and Jobyna Ralston (Harold Lloyd's most frequent muse), and was directed by the guy who did The Public Enemy. It is, in a historical sense, one of the great war movies of the silent era, along with 'The Big Parade' (which is better). Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen play the two leads, Rogers as the naïve, boyish Jack, and Arlen as the stern, square-jawed David. Clara Bow gets top billing surprisingly, since she doesn't have as much screen time as the guys, but was still the biggest marquee name. Ralston, alas, is underused as Sylvia, the woman Jack wants even though she loves David; she vanishes after the first act when the boys enlist. I was afraid that the guys' bitter rivalry would drag through the whole movie, but fortunately they don't they deal with it in basic training with a Fight Club-esquire initiation, at the end of which they're best friends.

Needless to say, this caught my attention, and I was expecting a mix of My Boyfriend's Back, and Night of the Living Dead. Though it didn't pan out quite like that, Night of the Creeps was an effective, B movie that really wasn't a waste of time, but not pure cinematic gold either.As you can most likely read synopsis, I will spare the details of rehashing the plot.First and foremost the movie contains several positive features that help to elevate it above being mediocre. The movie flows between two time periods that flesh out a much more layered story than originally planned. I was impressed at the directors choice to take a story above zombies and weave in a tapestry of side stories that interconnect. Also the special effects were decent at providing gore hounds with what they want. Blood, guts,and gunshots were all really well done.Unfortunately the movie did suffer. It seems as if the director didn't know what he wanted his zombies to do. Some acted in unique ways, and others didn't. Then the final onslaught, the zombies were much more menacing than before. Also the pacing seemed off at times. Originally it moves lighting fast, and I was surprised that an hour flew by with little to no effort. Afterwards the last twenty minutes seemed to drag on for too long.In the end, Night of the Creeps was a fun romp. The comedy, clearly 80's style, and mix of horror was well worth a look.

Cunningham sought to cash in on the formula and release a holiday themed slasher all his own Friday The 13th. A whodunit with a fresh young cast (including a then unknown Kevin Bacon) and a score of ground-breaking make-up effects, Cunningham's little creation not only inspired a flood of sequels (10 to date, with an impending remake) but a generation of slasher films that owe their existence to it. And to this day, it still holds up.What makes the film so effective? It could be the setting, a very realistic, sometimes spooky camp that gives way to loads of atmosphere. It helps, of course, that the bulk of the characters in the film look and feel real. Even for all of their little flaws, you can't help but feel for the unfortunate kids, regardless of how many times you've seen the movie. You could perhaps chalk part of it up to the outrageous death scenes, and -- more importantly -- the effects that drive them home. Ground-breaking for their time and besting the lazier CGI work of today, Tom Savini's career-making work is still a vicious and grisly sight to behold to this day. Whatever it is, one thing is certain Friday The 13th is a time-tested, eternally entertaining and flat-out fun little horror film.The story is pretty basic. Teenagers prepping for a children's camp take part in a little rest and relaxation -- a.k.a. pre-marital sex, pot-smoking and strip-Monopoly (?) -- only to find out the hard way that a brutal killer is terrorizing their isolated neck of the woods, picking off would-be counselors one by one. Obviously the mystery element of the story has been obliterated by pop-culture's grasp of a certain hockey-masked man-child, but the final reveal is still a shocker, driven home by a bold and fearless performance that gives way to the most effective stalk scene in the film. The ending -- interpreted whichever way you please -- is still a jumper to this day and is just one example of the subtle yet admirable cinematography and the chilling score by Harry Manfredini that accompanies it. From front to end, Friday The 13th is a true classic. Like Halloween -- but with less of a film-school vibe -- it's a movie that can be enjoyed again and again and has earned it's status as one of the grand-daddies of the slasher genre. In spite of the up-and-down franchise that followed in it's wake, it's still a gem.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"12 February 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After the success of a little indie horror-film by the name of Halloween, struggling film-maker Sean S. Cunningham sought to cash in on the formula and release a holiday themed slasher all his own Friday The 13th. A whodunit with a fresh young cast (including a then unknown Kevin Bacon) and a score of ground-breaking make-up effects, Cunningham's little creation not only inspired a flood of sequels (10 to date, with an impending remake) but a generation of slasher films that owe their existence to it. And to this day, it still holds up.What makes the film so effective? It could be the setting, a very realistic, sometimes spooky camp that gives way to loads of atmosphere. It helps, of course, that the bulk of the characters in the film look and feel real. Even for all of their little flaws, you can't help but feel for the unfortunate kids, regardless of how many times you've seen the movie. You could perhaps chalk part of it up to the outrageous death scenes, and -- more importantly -- the effects that drive them home. Ground-breaking for their time and besting the lazier CGI work of today, Tom Savini's career-making work is still a vicious and grisly sight to behold to this day. Whatever it is, one thing is certain Friday The 13th is a time-tested, eternally entertaining and flat-out fun little horror film.The story is pretty basic. Teenagers prepping for a children's camp take part in a little rest and relaxation -- a.k.a. pre-marital sex, pot-smoking and strip-Monopoly (?) -- only to find out the hard way that a brutal killer is terrorizing their isolated neck of the woods, picking off would-be counselors one by one. Obviously the mystery element of the story has been obliterated by pop-culture's grasp of a certain hockey-masked man-child, but the final reveal is still a shocker, driven home by a bold and fearless performance that gives way to the most effective stalk scene in the film. The ending -- interpreted whichever way you please -- is still a jumper to this day and is just one example of the subtle yet admirable cinematography and the chilling score by Harry Manfredini that accompanies it. From front to end, Friday The 13th is a true classic. Like Halloween -- but with less of a film-school vibe -- it's a movie that can be enjoyed again and again and has earned it's status as one of the grand-daddies of the slasher genre.

And the music (Mozart, I believe, though I am relatively unschooled in classical music) is wonderful and fits in to the picture perfectly.The story centers around Francois, a carpenter, his wife Claire, his children and his mistress, Emilie. The film begins with a beautiful buildup of an idyllic family life and a perfect marriage-too perfect in fact, and this probably reflects Francois' perception of reality and his delusions which continue throughout the film. They are a happy family with a great home life and frequent family trips to the country. Then Francois meets Emilie, a telegraph worker, with whom he also falls in love. He begins an affair with her, finding her to complement the relationship he has with his wife. And he believes that, because he is so happy with her and his love for his wife also seems to have grown with this affair, his wife will be happy with this state of affairs. And so he tells her, but the tragic results of that are not what he expects..The story in part shows the naivety of people in love-even love where the participants shouldn't expect approval based on social norms. Lovers seem reluctant to believe that their love can hurt anyone or that anyone would wish their love to be otherwise. There is a selfishness about infatuation that throws up blinders around reality. Francois expects his wife to approve of the affair as he's totally wrapped up in his own feelings, a selfishness that is unconscious and unrecognized, so that he doesn't see the effect his betrayal might have on his partner. In fact, he doesn't even see it as betrayal. There is a fundamental inequality in his marriage, and Francois has mistaken his own feelings and desires for the communal feelings and desires that should be part of a truly idyllic marriage. Is such a relationship really possible? I don't know and Varda doesn't give us much hope, but it is clear that it is not possible if there is a fundamental selfishness and lack of respect in the partnership.This film developed a sense of unease within me, even in the early part and that just intensified throughout the movie as the plot and the affair deepened and Francois' apparent delusions of emotional reality became more evident. Though I didn't foresee the climax specifically, it was clear that things couldn't continue as blissfully as they appeared. The ending disturbed me most of all.This is a beautiful film and one that has many messages about relationships, marriage and society.

And so he tells her, but the tragic results of that are not what he expects..The story in part shows the naivety of people in love-even love where the participants shouldn't expect approval based on social norms. Lovers seem reluctant to believe that their love can hurt anyone or that anyone would wish their love to be otherwise. There is a selfishness about infatuation that throws up blinders around reality. Francois expects his wife to approve of the affair as he's totally wrapped up in his own feelings, a selfishness that is unconscious and unrecognized, so that he doesn't see the effect his betrayal might have on his partner. In fact, he doesn't even see it as betrayal. There is a fundamental inequality in his marriage, and Francois has mistaken his own feelings and desires for the communal feelings and desires that should be part of a truly idyllic marriage. Is such a relationship really possible? I don't know and Varda doesn't give us much hope, but it is clear that it is not possible if there is a fundamental selfishness and lack of respect in the partnership.This film developed a sense of unease within me, even in the early part and that just intensified throughout the movie as the plot and the affair deepened and Francois' apparent delusions of emotional reality became more evident. Though I didn't foresee the climax specifically, it was clear that things couldn't continue as blissfully as they appeared. The ending disturbed me most of all.This is a beautiful film and one that has many messages about relationships, marriage and society.

The use of color and the images she uses, how she frames them and the positioning of the camera in just the right spot...all of that create a beautiful picture that is just breathtaking. And the music (Mozart, I believe, though I am relatively unschooled in classical music) is wonderful and fits in to the picture perfectly.The story centers around Francois, a carpenter, his wife Claire, his children and his mistress, Emilie. The film begins with a beautiful buildup of an idyllic family life and a perfect marriage-too perfect in fact, and this probably reflects Francois' perception of reality and his delusions which continue throughout the film. They are a happy family with a great home life and frequent family trips to the country. Then Francois meets Emilie, a telegraph worker, with whom he also falls in love. He begins an affair with her, finding her to complement the relationship he has with his wife.

It parodies a TV show, its actors and the fans of the show yet at the same time the movie is a tribute to them. The TV show in question of course is Star Trek, which is a very easy target. After all the show, to a certain extent, took itself more seriously than it should and and has spawned a couple of generations of followers. The movie itself stands out on its own, it's actually a pretty good action film that at the same time allows the characters to grow on us. Much like the show itself.Tim Allen stars as Jason Nesmith, the egotistic actor who stars as the Captain of an intergalactic spaceship. Since the show has been canceled he and his cast mates has been reduced to making personal appearances to earn a living. I'm not a big fan of Tim Allen's acting but he does a decent job here. He also gets support from two very good actors Sigourney Weaver, who's not playing Ellen Ripley, and Alan Rickman who's playing an ex- Shakesperean actor who has grown to resent the character that has made him famous. Rounding out the cast are Daryl Mithcell and Tony Shalhoub. The Rickman character is very interesting because it shows how being identified with a very popular character can be detrimental to an actor's career no matter how good they are.The story, of course, is that Nesmith is recruited by aliens to lead them in a fight against their enemy and he brings his crew along with them for the fight. The movie have fun with this premise as it takes the actors to a strange and yet familiar situation. They have to operate the gizmos they have been playing with on their TV shows but now it's for real. One particular funny moment is when Mitchell is trying to get the spaceship out of the docking bay and there are many more.The fans of Star Trek and other SCi FI TV shows or Movies are easy targets that gets picked on by stand up comedians, TV and Movie columnists as well as other TV shows. In most situations the fans are basically being sent a message to move on and get a life. Here they get their due as it were the fans with their encyclopedic knowledge of the show that would be instrumental in the defeat of the enemy. I wouldn't say it encourages one to be a craze fanboy but more to have to have fun with it and not take it too seriously, as this movie didGalaxy Quest is a good entertaining movie that works as a comedy, action movie, and as a tribute not just to Star Trek but other TV shows that have a strong cult like following.

I can tell you that the title characters and many others in this fabulous movie were right on the money. There were very few normal folks who were regulars to Times Square at that time. Most visitors and tourists looked right through them but they were all there. Sexual perverts aka chickenhawks, Pimps, and of course the young kids coming off the buses from the heartland by the hundreds, ready to be savaged. The music, drug culture, attitudes of too many parents, and excitement of being a young, all combined to make people think they could make it in an area like TS. So very many never made it to adulthood because of the lifestyle drugs, beatings and assaults were so common. Those who survived were damaged psychologically as well as physically. Personally, I never felt so overwhelmed in my life. While handling one case, you just knew there were dozens more happening at the same moment in time. Midnight Cowboy was just one little slice of life on 42nd Street. An excellent movie.
