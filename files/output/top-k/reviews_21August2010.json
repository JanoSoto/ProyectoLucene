But Forbidden Planet pulls it off superbly. It does not seem old or dated even almost 60 years after it was made. It has an interesting story, a great cast, good use of humour, and features only limited use of what has by now become sci-fi staple (futuristic weapons and monsters) and no space battles - proving that such things aren't really necessary. It's also clear after watching this that while Gene Roddenberry may have created Star Trek he borrowed rather heavily from Forbidden Planet as he did so, and a number of Star Trek episodes seem to have their origins in various aspects of the plot of this movie.The story features Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, the only survivor of the crew of an earth ship that landed on Altaire IV many years before. Leslie Nielsen (who would later be considered for the role of Captain Kirk in Star Trek before losing out to William Shatner) played J.J. Adams - the commander of a ship sent from earth to investigate what's happened. The story is mysterious from the beginning. Morbius explains that some deadly force killed everyone else (he doesn't explain what the force was, and as the movie comes to its climax it becomes clear that he didn't know.) He and his wife (who later died) were the only ones immune to whatever had killed the others, and they had a daughter (played by the very beautiful Anne Francis.) She and Morbius are now alone on the world. Morbius has discovered that the world was once inhabited by a very advanced race of beings called the Krell, and he devotes his life to learning about them. Morbius is a mysterious character who would much rather be left alone than rescued. The great thing about this is that while he is mysterious (and therefore suspicious) he's not a stereotypical bad guy. One of the things I loved about this was that there were, in fact, no real bad guys. Morbius turns out to be responsible for what's happening, but it's out of his control. It's a great story.The sets are very well constructed. They're very futuristic even by today's standards. In fact, they put to shame the very mundane-looking bridge on the first Star Trek pilot The Cage. The creature who's finally introduced near the end is a very imaginative creature and quite scary. I feared that Anne Francis was being used merely as window dressing, and while she does spend a lot of time in short skirts and bare feet, being taught how to hug and kiss by the crew of the rescue ship, in the end she's rather central to the story, as her father becomes increasingly jealous of her growing relationship with the newcomers. Perhaps the greatest addition to the film was Robby the Robot. He seems to be something of a forerunner to the robot later found on Lost in Space. He's got a great personality, he's friendly and helpful and even has a sense of humour.It's perhaps a bit slow off the start, but frankly, this is better than any sci-fi that has been put out in recent decades.

The movies in his Polish\/French trilogy, Blue, White, and Red, are finely tuned, sensitive, imaginative dramas that use mystery, music, psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning movie-making achievement in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements, leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world (or worlds) of the lead characters, both played by Irene Jacob, a classic kind of restrained French (French-Swiss) actress with a limited range, but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving, melancholic aura for the camera, which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangers--they look alike, have similar talents (singing), and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds, with only one seeing the other until later, when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it, but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather, it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits, not giving up a narrative logic, not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics, and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact, the star, first shown as a child, is looking at the stars in pure wonder, and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for her--and this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing, filled with odd and beautiful coincidences, and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent, he is both characters, both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe, splintering under Communism's last few years, have been written about a lot (the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it, trapped somehow, the French Veronique is free to reject her talent, travel, and yet, ultimately, end up a puppet to her personal weakness). But the fact is, Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young (though he didn't expect that I'm sure) for his art, and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe, filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders, infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene (the bus scene with the soldiers) that inserts this with, as usual, elegance. (Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics.) The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic, the Polish version cannot quite do that, though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence, the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel self-important, a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown, happily, in the aesthetics of the film (which would be easy to do), you might find there are little moments made too important, too detailed, too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments, in the marionette scenes, and even in the very last moments, which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy, because they are better movies, especially Blue and Red.

The action sequences of Hard Boiled dominate the action genre. No director in good conscience allows for the gunning down of dozens of helpless hospital patients, and the jumping, diving, rolling, slamming into walls, and frequent defenestration of both heroes and villains alike - all during furious and often close-range gun battles that give Hard Boiled an edge especially over current CGI dominated action films due to its authentic on-scene stunts, and its ultra-violent intensity. Hard Boiled was made in 1992, and the main way one can tell is, besides the costume design and the lack of CGI, is the Beverly Hills Cop-type music that occasional bursts forth.

Tequila (played by veteran actor Chow Yun-Fat) is a rebel detective who plays a significant, though indirect, role in the mayhem and tragedy that is enacted by the sadistic, power hungry gangsters that he is vehemently and single mindedly hellbent on taking down with extreme prejudice. Why is Tequila a crazed and insubordinate cop hero? It has to do with art.The drummer in Tequila's Jazz band, who is also a cop, is killed by gangsterz in the film's first gun fight, in the teahouse scene. It is Tequila's loss of a great jazz drummer that is the primary reason for his single minded thirst for vengeance against the gangsters, and I can prove this. After the tea house massacre, Tequila returns to The Jazz Club (The Jazz Club being the name of the jazz club) and the audience gets to see Tequila's reminiscing his lost drummer, not his lost cop. The deceased friend as artist was more important than he was as a cop, and this may point to the fact that Tequila's friend was killed in a gun fight as a cop, rather than as a drummer. Drummers don't get killed in gun fights. Tequila has a deep love for jazz and for the bond of band members that is created through the playing of music, and this loss of his drummer signals an end to the best part of his life. All that is left is vengeance, but Tequila doesn't give up his human side, even when his life or the lives of others are at stake.Director John Woo draws morbid comedy out of the interplay between action and dialogue, in which excessive dialogue between characters leads to the death or near death of other characters. Woo uses the dialogue\\action interplay to parody the time consuming dialogue that often takes place in action films at the point in such films when the audience is asking, What i\/t\/f are they doing talking and being sentimental in the midst of this obviously dire situation? In a hospital room, after Tequila and Tony kill a few gangsters, they talk sentimentally about themselves while a guy they are supposed to be protecting from yet more gangster, who has hidden in another room, is being murdered the the gangsters' top killer, Bull Dog. After they are talking with each other for a while, they seem to suddenly remember that they are in an action movie, and that their witness is probably dead. A similar event occurs later, near the conclusion of Hard Boiled when Tequila is rescuing a baby from the hospital (that is being blown up by C-4 charges placed throughout the hospital by the gangsters) and stops amidst the onslaught of explosions and flames to offer some sentimental words to the little squirt in his arms. Only when a huge flame-spurting explosion almost incinerates him and the lil' munchkin is he jolted back into the broader diagesis (the reality in the world of the film). What is significant and funny is Tequila's persistent need to stop in the middle of a deadly situation and, shall we say, smell the flowers, to talk of fluffy things and good times, to take time out of the entire madness of the situation and completely forget about it. But Woo, the director, doesn't forget about the surroundings, and he allows the surroundings to sneak up on our all too human hero. Tequila is not a Schwarzeneggerian killing machine, even if he does kill more guys in Hard-Boiled than the Schwarzenegger-as-Terminator does in all of the Terminator movies combined. Tequila is a very human cop - both driven and considerate for the little things in life that matter, even in the midst of death and destruction. This shows the fun Woo had in being realistic with respect to the time-action-dialogue that was happening in certain spaces in time. Woo, in his literalistic humour, outdoes the one-layered absolutist temporality of the storytelling dynamics that tend to dominate the action genre. Whether he intentional or not, in Hard Boiled director John Woo plays with this dramatic element of film fiction, absurdizes it, just as he does with the level of violence.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"21 August 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have yet to make a body count, but estimate the death toll to be just under that of 300. The action sequences of Hard Boiled dominate the action genre. No director in good conscience allows for the gunning down of dozens of helpless hospital patients, and the jumping, diving, rolling, slamming into walls, and frequent defenestration of both heroes and villains alike - all during furious and often close-range gun battles that give Hard Boiled an edge especially over current CGI dominated action films due to its authentic on-scene stunts, and its ultra-violent intensity. Hard Boiled was made in 1992, and the main way one can tell is, besides the costume design and the lack of CGI, is the Beverly Hills Cop-type music that occasional bursts forth. The jazz music that highlights Tequila's few reflective moments create certain sincere suffering in the heart of our rebel detective, and which sets a heavy mood on a light wind on a summer night. Give the guy a gun and he's superman; give him two and he's God! -Superintendent Pang speaking to and a\/b TequilaHard Boiled features a bad cop, Tequila, the film's hero, and the undercover and more morally responsive cop, Tony Leung (played by Tony Leung), as well as many other interesting characters. Tequila (played by veteran actor Chow Yun-Fat) is a rebel detective who plays a significant, though indirect, role in the mayhem and tragedy that is enacted by the sadistic, power hungry gangsters that he is vehemently and single mindedly hellbent on taking down with extreme prejudice. Why is Tequila a crazed and insubordinate cop hero? It has to do with art.The drummer in Tequila's Jazz band, who is also a cop, is killed by gangsterz in the film's first gun fight, in the teahouse scene. It is Tequila's loss of a great jazz drummer that is the primary reason for his single minded thirst for vengeance against the gangsters, and I can prove this. After the tea house massacre, Tequila returns to The Jazz Club (The Jazz Club being the name of the jazz club) and the audience gets to see Tequila's reminiscing his lost drummer, not his lost cop. The deceased friend as artist was more important than he was as a cop, and this may point to the fact that Tequila's friend was killed in a gun fight as a cop, rather than as a drummer. Drummers don't get killed in gun fights. Tequila has a deep love for jazz and for the bond of band members that is created through the playing of music, and this loss of his drummer signals an end to the best part of his life. All that is left is vengeance, but Tequila doesn't give up his human side, even when his life or the lives of others are at stake.Director John Woo draws morbid comedy out of the interplay between action and dialogue, in which excessive dialogue between characters leads to the death or near death of other characters. Woo uses the dialogue\\action interplay to parody the time consuming dialogue that often takes place in action films at the point in such films when the audience is asking, What i\/t\/f are they doing talking and being sentimental in the midst of this obviously dire situation? In a hospital room, after Tequila and Tony kill a few gangsters, they talk sentimentally about themselves while a guy they are supposed to be protecting from yet more gangster, who has hidden in another room, is being murdered the the gangsters' top killer, Bull Dog. After they are talking with each other for a while, they seem to suddenly remember that they are in an action movie, and that their witness is probably dead. A similar event occurs later, near the conclusion of Hard Boiled when Tequila is rescuing a baby from the hospital (that is being blown up by C-4 charges placed throughout the hospital by the gangsters) and stops amidst the onslaught of explosions and flames to offer some sentimental words to the little squirt in his arms. Only when a huge flame-spurting explosion almost incinerates him and the lil' munchkin is he jolted back into the broader diagesis (the reality in the world of the film). What is significant and funny is Tequila's persistent need to stop in the middle of a deadly situation and, shall we say, smell the flowers, to talk of fluffy things and good times, to take time out of the entire madness of the situation and completely forget about it. But Woo, the director, doesn't forget about the surroundings, and he allows the surroundings to sneak up on our all too human hero. Tequila is not a Schwarzeneggerian killing machine, even if he does kill more guys in Hard-Boiled than the Schwarzenegger-as-Terminator does in all of the Terminator movies combined. Tequila is a very human cop - both driven and considerate for the little things in life that matter, even in the midst of death and destruction. This shows the fun Woo had in being realistic with respect to the time-action-dialogue that was happening in certain spaces in time. Woo, in his literalistic humour, outdoes the one-layered absolutist temporality of the storytelling dynamics that tend to dominate the action genre. Whether he intentional or not, in Hard Boiled director John Woo plays with this dramatic element of film fiction, absurdizes it, just as he does with the level of violence.

If I were to describe this movie in two words, the aforementioned ones would be it. Right from the first scene itself, you feel as if you've been sucked into the world of high school student Peter Parker. And you realize that it's not as bright and nice as it should've been.The movie serves as an origin story to Spider-Man. It shows the transition of Peter Parker from a nerdy, butt-of-all-jokes high school student, to a slightly more confident and arrogant personality to, eventually, a responsible superhero in the form of Spider-Man. No point in discussing the plot here as its fairly predictable and spilling the beans here itself would make it more so. Sam Raimi's direction is excellent and the movie is a thrill ride from start to end. The performances are utterly convincing. Hats off to Tobey Maguire, after viewing this movie, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend any alternative for the role of Peter-Parker \/ Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is also convincing as Mary Jane Watson - the next door neighbor and childhood crush of Parker. So is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne - the businessman who later on, after experimenting with a performance enhancing drug in a laboratory, turns into his alter ego, the Green Goblin. And so are the others.The film is great technically as well with its brilliant cinematography which has the camera swooping up and down buildings and New York streets at a breathtaking speed. The art design is also great and has been used appropriately to handle and provide us with some memorable sequences (special mention goes to the Unity Fair sequence at Times Square). The visual effects, while good, are something which I found below par at times (again note some of the shots of the Goblin at the Unity Fair sequence; it's clearly evident that there's some mixing and matching being done here). Maybe this was because of the color schemes of the lead characters because of which they had to be shot separately which may have been responsible for this. Danny Elfman's music is also very good; the best piece being the opening theme.What is so endearing about the movie that it has a heart and soul of its own. It becomes clearly evident while watching the movie that the makers of the movie are extremely passionate about Spider-Man. And that passion is visible in every frame of the movie - be it the action sequences, the characterizations or otherwise. It has become difficult for me to imagine another team behind the future installments of this movie. Before viewing this movie, I only knew about Spider-Man from some of the cartoon shows that used to appear on Television about him. Now, after seeing this movie, not only has my interest in Spider-Man sky-rocketed, but I consider him to be the most intelligent and the best superhero amongst the lot of fictional superheroes.

Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, Good Morning seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses Good Morning. I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening.

Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that's part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we're so drawn into it, it's extremely enjoyable. That's due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what's happening on screen.Number Four The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, Good Morning seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses Good Morning. I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening. I always replied, It's morning somewhere.I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there's plenty more lines I absolutely love Whiskey. And whiskey. I only lied about being a thief and I don't do that anymore. &#x96; Steal? &#x96; Lie. All reds! There's more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I'm not familiar with. Though I can't necessarily follow what an Ella Fitzgerald is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie's intelligence.) It's nice to revisit a movie and either hear\/catch things I haven't before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right &#x96; Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated &#x96; it's 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn't just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you they knew Vegas.Number Six Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean's Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact. SEE IT!

After Red was released Kieslowski announced to retire and quit making films; by which he wanted to get himself some peace. Two years later on March 13th 1996 Kieslowski passed away, during an operation. Many have said that the stress caused by actually making three films at once may have been the reason for his heart failure. All the three films, Blue, White and Red, dealt with the paradox of freedom and love (which was a leading theme throughout Kieslowski's career). How they could never fit into the same relation; one couldn't be free when in love. But the films went much more deeper. All the films had their own main theme from the ideals of the French Revolutionary (Blue \/ Freedom, White \/ Equality and Red \/ Fraternity) often portraying it in a complex ambiguous way. Red was about fraternity, about a bond between all of us, it was a psychological drama against disregard.A young model Valentine (Irene Jacob) hits a dog with her car and because the dog's collar has a name on it she goes to return the dog to its owner. The owner of the dog is a retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who spends his time listening to other people's phone calls. First Valentine doesn't care about what he is doing but over time a psychological tension build between them.An important motive in Red is a phone. In the beginning we get to follow the wires from one phone to another for which no one answers. Valentine takes care of her love affairs and family relations by phone, the judge listens to other people's phones and Auguste dates a girl who offers daily weather reports by phone. The phone means both connection and separation. By repeating several times the motive tells us about a world where people desperately want connection to each other.Red can be watched from many different perspectives and there are several interpretations for it. In the end it summarizes the most important themes and characters of the trilogy. It's about the collision of youth and old age, optimism and pessimism, positivity and cynicism. But at the same about so much more; coincidence, morality, guiltiness, loneliness, separation and connection. In Red we can see what would happen if a person had noted the presence of another human being and tried to get in contact with the other person. The consequences are vast if you do injustice on other but so if people pass each other without ever meeting. This is what the screenwriter Piesiewicz told that they tried to reach and it reinforces the idea that Red is also a film against disregard and apathy.Red is the top of Kieslowski's production - it's his cinematic legacy. In Red he worked with the writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the composer Zbigniew Preisner with whom he had worked since No End (1984). In Red Valentine comes across with a composer called Van der Budenmajer who, of course, doesn't exist - because he is Zbigniew Preisner. In Kieslowski's interview book, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, he tells that he and Preisner made up Budenmajer and used him in The Decalogue, The Double Life of Veronique and The Three Colors. He even has a date of birth and death.Red builds around the emotional theme that plays throughout the trilogy. All the films are about the yearning of love; in Red Valentine longs for her lover but then meets the vision of distorted emotions in the judge. The love of Valentine makes the judge hatch from his hard shelf. Love doesn't recognize freedom, equality or fraternity, but without it there's nothing - love is above everything. On this emotional level the viewer can see the portrayal of Kieslowski's individualism. The international films by Kieslowski were characterized by aesthetic styling - and Red is amazingly beautiful to every single detail. Unlike in Blue and White; in Red Kieslowski didn't use red shades and screens.

And the color indeed means something - for instance when Valentine sleeps with her boyfriend's red jacket; red means memories and the need for another person.In the early films by Kieslowski he dealt with the society of Poland and the harsh Polish reality. He liked to call his films unpolitical which they were; they usually dealt with so much deeper issues - humanity and morality. In The Decalogue (The Ten Commandments) Kieslowski achieved to bring the eternal moral dilemmas to the modern society but at the same managed to describe Poland of that time; better than anyone else could have. Later, he moved to even more personal and unique subjects; The Three Colors trilogy dealt with equality, freedom and fraternity but not in a conventional, universal, simple way. The way he dealt with these ideals of the French Revolutionary went very deep which offered some very personal views.

Make it a quirky, not very serious, fun kids movie. It seems they picked the two most serious actors for the job though. Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are good in lots of things they have been in, but this is just neither of them at their best. I think the problem was the PG rating. This could have been a great film if it had an R rating. Its almost like Glover and Pesci are struggling to hold back the words they want to use. You can tell Pesci just wants to blow off steam at points in the film. If this was R, it could have been a quirky, funny, and all out Comedy.Glover and Pesci play Gus and Joe, two average guys who want to get away and have a simple, relaxing vacation at the Everglades. They get way more than they ask for after having their car stolen at a restaurant. They realize the man who stole their car is a crook and a killer so Gus and Joe pair up with two girls looking for the man, for a little while, then go off on their own getting into their own trouble. They embark in every which way to try and stop the crook, but they just dig themselves deeper in a hole. Their stupidity doesn't help the situation one bit has both the leads are clueless and naive. But they are dependent on catching the guy and still making it home for Thanksgiving with their family.Once again, sometimes their stupidity tends to drag the film on which I've never been a fan of. Its just like in Dinner for Schmucks and Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd. Stupidity is one thing, overwhelmingly stupid is another. It wears on you and almost makes you believe the actors are as dumb as they appear. But, thankfully, Gone Fishin' knows its limits and doesn't make the characters brainy, smartasses or make them bumbling nitwits. So the film doesn't fail there.While being completely harmless, at the same time, its overly kiddish. We saw Joe Pesci play stupid in Home Alone, but now, after seeing Casino and Goodfellas, I don't want to see him in a PG rated kid movie. Id rather have him be in an R rated Comedy where he can be himself and the same goes with Danny Glover. If this was R, it would probably earn another star, and quite possibly, another star in a half. But at least we get a relaxing opening driving scene with a great Willie Nelson tune in the background and a delightful appearance by him as well.Gone Fishin' was panned at the time, but it should also be taken into mind Janet Wilder was killed during a scene in this movie, so that doesn't give the movie a get-out-of-harsh-words free card, but it should just be said and maybe go easy on the movie. While Im not praising Gone Fishin', Im neither recommending it very far. Keep that in mind.Starring Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Nick Brimble, Rosanna Arquette, Lynn Whitfield, and Willie Nelson.

They get way more than they ask for after having their car stolen at a restaurant. They realize the man who stole their car is a crook and a killer so Gus and Joe pair up with two girls looking for the man, for a little while, then go off on their own getting into their own trouble. They embark in every which way to try and stop the crook, but they just dig themselves deeper in a hole. Their stupidity doesn't help the situation one bit has both the leads are clueless and naive. But they are dependent on catching the guy and still making it home for Thanksgiving with their family.Once again, sometimes their stupidity tends to drag the film on which I've never been a fan of. Its just like in Dinner for Schmucks and Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd. Stupidity is one thing, overwhelmingly stupid is another. It wears on you and almost makes you believe the actors are as dumb as they appear. But, thankfully, Gone Fishin' knows its limits and doesn't make the characters brainy, smartasses or make them bumbling nitwits.

Make it a quirky, not very serious, fun kids movie. It seems they picked the two most serious actors for the job though. Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are good in lots of things they have been in, but this is just neither of them at their best. I think the problem was the PG rating.

It is a tale of fathers, their sons, and the gangster era of Al Capone. It pits hit man Michael Sulivan (Hanks) against a bounty hunter (Jude Law) who has been hired by his boss, and father figure John Rooney (Paul Newman) as Sulivan attempts to kill Rooney's trigger happy son (Daniel Craig). At the same time Sulivan must teach and protect his son (Tyler Hoechlin).Without spoiling anymore plot points of the film I can say that the center of this film is the bonds forged by fatherhood. Sulivan seeing John Rooney as a father figure gives this movie an entirely new depth that wasn't seen in Max Allan Collins' graphic novel. Don't get me wrong, the movie also loses several aspects of its source material; I would have liked them to use the ending from the graphic novel that shows what type of man Michael Sulivan Jr. grows up to be. Road to Perdition is a stylish movie adaption of a great graphic novel that knows what to change without ruining the store. In many ways this makes it similar to 1994's The Crow, where the story is drastically changed, but through visuals and music the film not only feels like the graphic novel, but manages to reach greatness all its own.Acting from Hanks and Newman is absolutely phenomenal. Both actors really give it their best and give off a strong sense of emotional attachment and care. Hanks turns in a great performance as an anti-hero proving that he is one of the greatest actors currently living and Paul Newman makes sure his final performance is a great one. The rest of the cast is good too, but this pair is absolutely dynamite! Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (who would win the Academy award for his work in this film) create an awesome visual experience. Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds. This is a well crafted drama that lets its images do all the talking that is needed to tell the story.The somber score by Thomas Newman captures the mood of this period piece. It doesn't have much excitement in it, but it has a quiet, eerie tune that helps the mood. A song entitled 'Ghosts' which appears in one of the climatic scenes is one of the most beautiful, haunting pieces of music I've ever heard.Road to Perdition's father and son element is probably the main hook for me as a viewer, and there are imperfections in the film, but for the emotional response it received from me I can't help but give it high-marks. It is stylish, taught, emotional, and a blast to watch as Tom Hanks finds his inner-gangster!

Sean Connery is so ideally cast as James Bond that he literally made the role his own and made it very difficult, if not impossible, for his successors (George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timophy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig) to match his achievement. The various adjectives that critics and audience members attribute to James Bond - cool, charismatic, womanizing, intellectually gifted, and handsome - are due almost solely to Sean Connery's fine work in the 1960s as James Bond.Yet Dr. No has a lot more going for it than just a winning lead. Director Terence Young and the screen writers Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather construct big scenes for the lead actor, Sean Connery. Some of these big scenes, which go far in making this film incredibly entertaining, have become iconic. For example, the scene where James Bond introduces himself to Sylvia Trench (Eunice Gayson), while gambling at cards for high stakes and smoking a cigarette, has become perhaps the most memorable scene in a James Bond picture along with the simple, but catchy phrase, Bond... James Bond. But there are many other big scenes - Bond's flirtation with the secretary Miss Moneypenny, the attempted assassinations (one involving a killer spider), and the meeting with Dr. No (who is played very effectively by Joseph Wiseman) - that are just as thrilling as the first one.While watching Dr. No yet again, I was also reminded by how well James Bond films were made back in the 1960s. Today Bond films and other action pictures contain so many special effects that they end up crowding out the film's human characters. Yet director Terence Young and his crew choose to focus most of their attention on the film's plot and characters and the result, not surprisingly, is a much better film. The scenes that show James Bond's detective work (which are mercifully not interrupted by explosions and other loud special effects) in finding who killed Professor Strangways are as good as they come. This film also has the distinction of creating memorable characters for the actors who have small parts. Zena Marshall, for example, had a relatively small role as the secretary Miss Taro. But Miss Taro is memorable not only for the diabolical way she tries to lure James Bond to his death (usually the long route to her home as bait), but also for using her charms and sexuality to keep the hero in her bed for the next two hours so that he could be gunned down by an assassin. An actor with a small part could hardly expect a more interesting than that. Joseph Wiseman's Dr. No similarly had few scenes throughout this picture, but his appearance was so striking and his performance so chilling that he is fondly remembered as one of the great Bond villains. Lastly Terence Young and his assistants have set the standard for quality control that the Bond pictures have largely followed ever since. The Bond girls are all stunning, which often makes them as memorable as James Bond. Honey Rider (Ursula Andress) may not have the most memorable lines (though the one about the praying mantis remains in my mind), but who can forget that scene where she emerges on the beach with her shells and goggles? Finally the locations are wisely chosen. The reason why Dr. No and other Bond movies are so effective as escapist entertainment is largely because they take James Bond to exotic locations like Jamaica with its palm trees, gorgeous beaches, and cheerful Latin American music. The only possible flaw in Dr. No, which has become a hallmark in James Bond films ever since, is the fallacy of the talking killer. Dr. No had plenty of opportunities towards the end of the movie to put a bullet through James Bond's head and end the whole series right then and there, but for one reason or the other he never gets around to doing it. The chief villain's scheme to kill James Bond (it appears) always has to be elaborate and complex; so complex, in fact, that James Bond is able to escape imminent destruction and live another day.

Yet, Allen shows his most gentle side here; by giving us two terrific and engaging characters, we are deeply engrossed in this fictional tale about a Depression-era jazz player who considers himself to be the best in the world, or at least the best next to Django Reinhardt.Emmet Ray is a fictional creation from Woody Allen's mind, but I find it fascinating how penetrating he is able to go in order to explore every facet of his character. Sean Penn is also able to bring forth the true feelings, or lack of feelings, Ray exhibits to nearly everyone he encounters. It is a great performance in a great career for Penn, and the same can be said for Samantha Morton who is brilliant as the mute Hattie who loves Emmet but is continually rejected by his lofty ideas of remaining completely detached.This film is a loose reworking of Fellini's classic film La Strada, which also tells the tale of a great artist (in this case a circus strongman) and his relationship with a mute girl who loves him unconditionally. Both films end similarly, and I think it isn't too far of a stretch to say that Allen's ending may hit even harder the emotions than Fellini. What Allen does here is gives us a very powerful and sad love story, effectively recreate the era of a time in America when resources were low but joy was high and plant a little sweetness and niceness into us for 90 minutes. The film looks great in its photography, sets and costumes and also has two enamoring performances by Penn and Morton. Whether a fan of Woody Allen or not, this is a film to see.

Sean Penn is also able to bring forth the true feelings, or lack of feelings, Ray exhibits to nearly everyone he encounters.

I can understand why it is a milestone in the history of film and why film students study it and all. The camera work and montage editing is pretty impressive. There is a lot of epic spectacle captured on film. And I will even grant that some of the scenes work pretty well. For these reasons, I gave the film the four stars that I gave it.But for me, the negatives still significantly outweigh the positives. On the whole I did not enjoy the film, and I even found some of its technical aspects very poorly done, even for the day.The big problem here is that what we have is a propaganda piece. As such, the film is ridiculously heavy-handed and obvious, to the point of bathos. The evil officers and soldiers are so over the top that they lack credibility. We're supposed to feel this great sympathy for the downtrodden sailors and workers, but I felt precious little, mainly because I was so aware and irritated at the overt and clumsy way I was being manipulated. And let's get real here these men are serving on a major *warship*, which means they potentially face a life of war and death and destruction and pain and suffering... having to eat soup made of bad meat should be the worst hardship they ever have to endure! The nadir, when I was supposed to feel the most empathy and I actually felt the least, was when the guy's corpse was on display, with the sign about him having been killed for a plate of soup. Puh-lease. He was killed for inciting a mutiny.While we're discussing overbearing, heavy-handed propagandizing, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the priest. Now let's set some personal context here I am a devout atheist, I despise religion in all forms, and certainly have no love for Christianity. Yet even *I* was offended by the crude characterization of the ship's priest, as some kind of wild-haired, wild-eyed hermit type, by crackey! When a Nazi propaganda film depicts a Jew in an over-the-top slandering caricature, we're all properly offended; so why is it suddenly OK when a soviet propaganda film does the same thing to a priest?But propaganda here isn't the only problem. There is also the problem of pace. By modern standards, this is a short film; the version I saw was only 74 minutes. Yet it felt like an eternity, because in many scenes the pacing was just leaden. For instance, the scene where all of Odessa comes out to mourn the death of the sailor (and I wholly agree with another commenter here about how preposterous it is that these giant throngs of people are weeping tears, consumed with grief, over this one dead sailor that not one of them knew or had ever heard of; again, we reach the stage of bathos), this scene seems to run for a decade.And the nadir of bad pacing the scene preliminary to the mutiny, when the captain is ordering up punishment. The scene is so slow it actually induces physical pain. It's so slow that it actually becomes surreal. We have to sit there and actually watch as these officers rather clumsily and ineptly unfold the tarp. Let me say that again we have to sit there and watch them actually unfold the whole tarp. Nobody thought that having the captain say Bring out the tarp! and then cutting to a scene with the men holding an open tarp would be good enough. No, that would ruin the whole film! We must watch them *unfold* the tarp! That's where all the meaning is (I guess)! The result of all this is that the scene is so slow that it becomes ridiculous, as *everyone else is just standing around*. When the targeted victims have the tarp thrown over them, they proceed to just stand around for what feels like 10 minutes, just standing there under a tarp. Remember, these were the men who were supposed to be at the breaking-point of mutiny, but they're just meekly, dumbly standing there, with a tarp on their head. For 10 minutes. The whole thing is so ridiculously paced, it comes off as amateurish. Like a 4th grade play, where the kids aren't entirely sure where exactly they're supposed to be and what exactly they're supposed to be doing. Everybody's just kind of standing around.Frankly, I just don't see how any thinking person can consider this a great film (let alone the greatest of all time!)
