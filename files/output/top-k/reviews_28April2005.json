The trailer was quite funny and I though, what the hell, Drew Barrymore looks cute in it! My first reaction was Wow! Where have I seen this before? Note the hint of sarcasm in that sentence. Does it mean I dislike the movie? NO! I thought this was an okay movie that took too long to get better.What do I mean? Check it out, Drew Barrymore is an up and coming reporter with an assignment to review the high schools of modern day. Of course, her high school past catches up to her and the geekiness comes into play. As she goes undercover, we have to writhe in horror as Drew tries to re-connect with her peers and just falls flat on her face all the way.For nearly an hour into the film, we watch Drew crumble before us and it is a BIG pain to watch. It isn't until her brother (David Arquette) joins the fray that the movie starts becoming watchable and fun. David practically steals Drew's thunder and basically scorches his way through every scene he's in. Whether he's dressing up as Tom Cruise's character from Risky Business for a costume ball (you know, the sunglasses, white shirt, and underwear), spreading good lies about Drew, or even talking about Drew being an heir to the Ex-Lax company, you can't help but thinking that the movie can't get any better.Here's a good example of one of David's scene stealers After David tricks the school into accepting him as a Senior, the first thing he does is win a coleslaw-eating contest in the cafeteria. All the cool kids in the school immediately chant his name and fully accept him as their own. Just watch as Drew watches in horror as David steal the entire scene from her (which took nearly an hour to get to)!Again, Drew plays the geeky part so bad that she tries to make you sympathize with her as she finds peace with her past. On top of that, you've got Michael Vartan playing her almost-turning-to-a-pedophile-without-knowing-it Shakespearean teacher. He plays the straight role pretty well but then again, he ain't no David Arquette.Same goes to Drew's co-stars John C. Reilly (always great to watch, saw him in the local mall once which was cool), Molly Shannon (looking much sexier than she does in Saturday Night Live), and my favorite, Jessica Alba.Speaking of Jessica Alba, let's discuss about her and her role. She, Marley Shelton, and Jordan Ladd are the original Mean Girls. Before Lindsay Lohan came about, Jessica, Jordan, and Marley just scorch the screen with their steely-eyed hatred for anything geek-related. Watch Jessica get her mean streak going and HATE her (I say that in a good way). This is Jessica's only other flick I've seen (besides Idle Hands) where she gets to flaunt her stuff both physically or mentally. You'll hate her feisty bitch character (and her crew) and you can't take your eyes off her finger-lickin' badness! She sticks like glue!All in all, Never Been Kissed is a fun flick AFTER David Arquette kicks in the door. Jessica Alba just simmers in her feisty bitch role and Molly Shannon and John C. Reilly kill! Rent this flick if your sick of watching dumb Drew stuff like Fever Pitch or 50 First Dates.
