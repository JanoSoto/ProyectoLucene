It takes me back to when I was a kid and the summers were warm and lasted forever, and the days seemed endless.The film is not only a beautifully acted piece, with one hell of a narrative, it's also the epitome of childhood, and really makes you appreciate ow easy we all had it when we were kids.The conversations were pointless, but fruitful, and we were all adults, just misunderstood, which I'm sure most of us will experience the other end of the spectrum when our children are teens.The four leads are so advanced for their time, and having someone so homely and secure like Dreyfuss doing the narration, is something that makes the film that little bit more genius.Even thought he film is a very heart warming experience, it has a very somber and melancholic streak running through the film. Don't forget the four are looking for a body, one has lost his brother, his idol and ignored by his parents.One is abused by his father, and one has a a father who is locked up.And the films narrator wouldn't have even done this story if he hadn't learnt of his then best friend getting killed.So it's all pretty somber stuff, uplifted by the four kids doing exactly what we all did when we were young.

Suddenly, under a blinding spotlight, a tall and thin silhouette prolonged by a gigantic gun, makes an unforgettable apparition. This is Harry Callahan, and it's only a matter of minutes, before justice is done.Clint Eastwood directed the film and it shows all through the film. No one but Eastwood could be so aware of Harry's iconic status and provide viewers such a heart-pounding confrontation with the villains. It's obvious that the climactic scene and this defining shot were designed to have that impact on the audience but no matter how deliberate the effect is, how late in the film it comes, it makes the whole movie work. Eastwood handles the material of the original movie with much more confidence than the directors of the second and third opus, because he grabs the essence of the series the plot hardly matters, it's all about the confrontation, it's all about Harry and the villains, and if we take the last sequence of the film, it's exactly the same caliber of the first film violent, dark and gripping.For example, it's obvious that Clint Eastwood didn't embarrass himself with comedy like in The Enforcer or some political statements explicitly exposed like in Magnum Force, not that they undermined the enjoyment of the other films but they were necessary to compensate the lack of charismatic and memorable villains. But Sudden Impact goes back to the roots of the series, to the very ingredients that makes it so enthralling. At the end, the only ways it indulges itself to some social commentary about the judicial system occurs in the trial scene, and the only elements of comedy are familiar to the fans, through the good old meetings with the superiors, when he can't help throwing a wisecracking comment between his clenched teeth.There is another moment rarely discussed, when he confronts a Mafia boss on the day of his daughter's wedding. Michael V. Gazzo (who played Frank Pentangeli in The Godfather Part II) plays a sort of Vito Corleone-like character, and after a brief exchange full of verbal acidity, Harry causes him to suffer from a lethal heart attack. We ought to believe that the guy was a dirty man who molested an innocent prostitute, but all we see is Harry literally killing someone with words, and it's done in a way that doesn't necessarily help us to root for him. His cruelty exceeds his good intentions and never since the first Dirty Harry, had he deserved his nickname. I insist on that scene, because it's a masterstroke of writing, it reminds of how borderline can Harry get in the name of justice, and how he's indeed one of the greatest antiheroes that ever graced the screen.And that's it, the more I feel that Sudden Impact ends in a terrific way, the more bothered I am by some little flaws that don't actually ruin the film but give it a sort of 'could have been better' flavor. And my principal issue with the film is the villain. Harry Callahan investigates a series of murders following the same modus operandi; a mysterious woman, played by Sondra Locke, shoots men in the groin and the head. The film goes on deeply on the trauma that affected Locke and her sister, they were lead by a friend, a lesbian played by a scene- stealing Audrie Neenan, to a party where they were they brutally assaulted by a bunch of thugs. Locke's character is a lesbian, although it doesn't affect the story but it emphasizes the perversity of the act. Ironically, Neenan's character, the only woman, who didn't took part to the rape strikes as the most twisted, and villainously charismatic of the bunch.Anyways, Locke's sister ended up in a catatonic state, and as we'd have expected, justice has failed because one of the rapist was 'covered'. Justice had to be done, fine. The problem with that subplot, although well-made and well-developed, but it provides some extenuating circumstances to the character who was supposed to be the villain. It's an interesting twist that for the first time, we empathize with the villain, but it weakens the kind of confrontation we expect in a Dirty Harry film. As much as I loved the climactic shootout, there's a constant feeling that the rapists became the film's last-minute antagonists, but in no way could match Harry Callahan, not the way he was magnificently played by Eastwood. The 'Callahan' of Sudden Impact needed a villain, in the same vein of psychopathy as Scorpio. Damn, would there ever be another Scorpio?Maybe the film took its inspiration from Abel Ferrara's Ms. 45, the last vigilante masterpiece, when a young woman was avenging her rape by killing every man who could be a potential rapist. It could have been better if Locke's character was more of a character blindly applying her vengeance on innocent men. But well, it could have been worse imagine a romantic subplot between Eastwood and Locke. But it was more of a philosophical affinity, for the first time he met a woman who had the same opinion about the way justice should be applied. It's not as far-fetched as William Munny who had tot kill two guys because one of them beat a whore, but I'm sure, there was a premonition of Unforgiven in Sudden Impact.Sudden Impact is the best Harry film since the original, and on its own, a great thriller. Calling it a sequel is almost belittling, seriously, which sequel could have provided an iconic line like Go ahead. Make my day? Creating a national catchphrase after three movies, this says a lot about how iconic Harry Callahan is and how damn right Eastwood was to make a fourth film.

Nothing wrong with liking that series, it was funny and did not take itself seriously. It is not how I want my Batman movie to be though! The seeds were planted in the previous film, Batman Forever which had the good fortune to cast Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey when both were flying high. Carey alone was huge and this is most likely why the film was such a success. This led to the misfortune of Schumacher believing the success of the film was due to the fact he made it all colorful and more cheerful so he was going to up the ante and he did and we were all left to suffer the most dismal Batman film to date. Granted, the second film was a bit odd too which is what left to Burton leaving the director's chair as that one was considered a bit of a disappointment too, but it is nothing compared to this.The story once again thrusts us right in the middle of the action as Batman and Robin go to stop Mr. Freeze. During this opening battle one groans at the many one liners, but the action was not to bad. You also notice that most of what you see during this sequence was featured in the trailers. Yes, sadly this is the highlight of the film, and the only decent action sequence in the movie. The rest has Batman and Robin arguing while trying to capture Freeze while we also witness Pamela Isely become Poison Ivy, much like the previous film had Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face right from the get go and we watched the Riddler come to be. Somehow Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze become allies which is one of the worst pairings of Batman villains I have ever seen. I mean you are pairing a villain who loves plants with a guy who shoots an ice beam...ice beam would be very harmful to plants wouldn't you say? George Clooney takes Val Kilmer's place as Batman for this film, and I am not going to say I loved Michael Keaton in the role of Batman, but I am going to say he was a lot better than the two who tried to replace him. Kilmer was better than Clooney, as Clooney did not look the part of Bruce Wayne or Batman. Chris O'Donnell is absolutely horrid as Robin in this one and Batgirl is a pointless add on whose character was butchered! When I first heard of Arnold being Mr. Freeze I thought he had to big a physique for the good doctor seeing as how it is the armor that Freeze wears that gives him his strength. I did think that Arnold could play Freeze well as Freeze is nearly emotionless at times. Joel Schumacher though decides that Mr. Freeze is going to constantly tell jokes about the fact he is cold, make his minions sing and wear polar bear house shoes. It is an embarrassment! To watch a much better portrayal of Mr. Freeze, just watch the animated series. Then there is Poison Ivy, actually she was alright, a nice sexy villainous whose main fault is the bad pairing with Freeze. She was also in one of the few good scenes that did not appear in the opening...the auction scene. Sexy and funny, then Freeze crashes the party and the lameness is once again in full effect. Finally is the odd inclusion of Bane as a dimwitted servant to Poison Ivy. I did not understand why they added him, at this point he was a terror in the comics a mixture of brawn and brains reduced to just the brawn. Granted, Jeep Swenson who played him did look the part.Many have claimed this to be the worst film of all time. That is a claim I just do not see. It is bad, the worst Batman film I have seen. Just does not seem to be the worst film to me, it is not even the worst comic book film as both the Punisher with Dolph and the 1990 Captain America were both worse than this one to me. I guess you can say both those came out directly on video and bypassed the theater and this is the worst movie to come to the big screen, but once again there is another comic film that was far worse in Superman IV as you had many visible strings and normal humans flying into space with the villain and Superman. So this is bad, just not the worst film or even comic film. There was work put into it and it was almost a breath of air after I had to sit through Forever so many times.So there you have it, is it a good movie? No...no way, no how. Is it bad...YES! I do not give it the title of worst film though. It had some moments in it I enjoyed to much. Granted most of these moments occurred right at the beginning. Still, I think Joel Schumacher meant well and I heard that he planned to make the next film darker, but he did pretty much kill off the first series of movies. Though in the grand scheme of things this did some good as the Nolan trilogy was made and Batman stopped being a set of films for celebrities to try to get the parts and just act like idiots. I heard Julie Roberts was trying to be the Joker's wife in the next film...um, when did the Joker have a wife? I only remember Harley Quinn from the animated series and she is not the Joker's wife. So thankfully Joel only got two movies in, things could have gotten worse, and thanks to him in an indirect way they got better.

Nothing wrong with liking that series, it was funny and did not take itself seriously. It is not how I want my Batman movie to be though! The seeds were planted in the previous film, Batman Forever which had the good fortune to cast Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey when both were flying high. Carey alone was huge and this is most likely why the film was such a success. This led to the misfortune of Schumacher believing the success of the film was due to the fact he made it all colorful and more cheerful so he was going to up the ante and he did and we were all left to suffer the most dismal Batman film to date. Granted, the second film was a bit odd too which is what left to Burton leaving the director's chair as that one was considered a bit of a disappointment too, but it is nothing compared to this.The story once again thrusts us right in the middle of the action as Batman and Robin go to stop Mr. Freeze. During this opening battle one groans at the many one liners, but the action was not to bad. You also notice that most of what you see during this sequence was featured in the trailers. Yes, sadly this is the highlight of the film, and the only decent action sequence in the movie. The rest has Batman and Robin arguing while trying to capture Freeze while we also witness Pamela Isely become Poison Ivy, much like the previous film had Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face right from the get go and we watched the Riddler come to be. Somehow Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze become allies which is one of the worst pairings of Batman villains I have ever seen. I mean you are pairing a villain who loves plants with a guy who shoots an ice beam...ice beam would be very harmful to plants wouldn't you say? George Clooney takes Val Kilmer's place as Batman for this film, and I am not going to say I loved Michael Keaton in the role of Batman, but I am going to say he was a lot better than the two who tried to replace him. Kilmer was better than Clooney, as Clooney did not look the part of Bruce Wayne or Batman. Chris O'Donnell is absolutely horrid as Robin in this one and Batgirl is a pointless add on whose character was butchered! When I first heard of Arnold being Mr. Freeze I thought he had to big a physique for the good doctor seeing as how it is the armor that Freeze wears that gives him his strength. I did think that Arnold could play Freeze well as Freeze is nearly emotionless at times. Joel Schumacher though decides that Mr. Freeze is going to constantly tell jokes about the fact he is cold, make his minions sing and wear polar bear house shoes. It is an embarrassment!

The story is instantly familiar from classic Westerns and adventure stories, the drama is mundane and domestic, and there's lots of action. Don't look too closely, or pull too hard on any loose threads, or the whole thing will unravel.Nicholas Meyer took over the franchise with this movie and decided that the whole exploring space thing was too hard to get a handle on. Instead, he brought back a villain from the old TV show and had him chase Captain Kirk around in circles for the better part of two hours. Along the way there's a bit of melodrama Kirk's midlife crisis, an old flame, and an estranged offspring, as if his life weren't complicated enough already. The old gang comes along for the ride, even though few of them have any excuse for being there. (It's a delightful irony that Meyer, who never served in any military, also introduced the silly space-navy look to the franchise in this film, while Gene Roddenberry, the notorious peacenik, was a decorated bomber pilot in WWII.)I won't dwell on plot holes, because there are too many of them. If you like Wrath of Khan's blend of action and soap opera, those little inconsistencies and mistakes will hardly matter to you. Other mistakes are bigger and more bothersome the Genesis Device that Khan wants to get hold of is no more than a MacGuffin, whose duty it is to drive the plot and explode when necessary. (Khan's quest for revenge fulfills similar requirements). The terraforming angle pops up as an obligatory piece of science fiction paraphernalia, mostly so that Doctor McCoy can compare science to playing God, as if that hadn't been done a million times before. The dialogue is stilted and cluttered with shout-outs to Charles Dickens and Herman Melville, perhaps to lend an air of dignity, and the acting veers woozily back and forth between hammy and wooden.The music is superb, and does most of the film's hard work. Without James Horner's nautical score, there would hardly be any suspense or excitement during the many space battles in the final act. The special effects are quite decent, even the ones that aren't nicked from the previous movie. If it weren't for those two things The Wrath of Khan would feel too much like a TV film -- above average, but not nearly as good as the show it was based on.

For instance, what is the intend of that scene where Alex lies in bed and talks to a guy (his brother maybe) with underwear only. What's the point? Actually, most scenes are random and made only to show director's skills-- oh, I found a point for that scenes! I can surely eulogize the good directing of this picture; even thought some scenes aren't important, director make them in a fabulous way that entertains the spectator. I don't know which is better, the colors and scenario or background sound-- all are great. The question involving prison and human re-education is very creative, even more if you imagine it's been thought more than forty years ago. Also, most of the cast is very professional, of course praising Malcolm McDowell's extremely well done job-- I actually can't look at him normally anymore. The same thing that happened with Jack Nicholson thirty two years ago. All in all, it's an indeed good movie, but I unfortunately felt something was missing.

Anyway, this is a very well done movie--and I mean technically--and that's all I'll say of positive about it as, beneath a beautiful, slick, apparency there is precious little to behold, enjoy. Just an empty, if attractive, shell. Why I say it see, the greatness of a film--or of any other piece of art--can be measured in its capacity to cross cultural lines. Classics like Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Fistful of Dollars, Rashmon, Apocalypses Now, Jaws, can be enjoyed by everyone in any corner of the world and audiences will be touched by their atmosphere, cinematography, characters, plot, no matter where the live, what their lifestyle or culture is. That's the main reason why they are classics because its creators were capable of taking a particular subject, story, character, and make it universal, for all to enjoy They finished them like mirrors in which everyone can go take a look at themselves. Annie Hall, a puerile exercise in intellectual onanism, a rather vacuous self-promotional vehicle, is far from being that kind of artwork, as it gradually loses its effect when leaving behind the artsy circles of North America and Europe--and as less and less people can relate to it. That's the reason why it isn't nearly the masterpiece its fans pretend it is.Frankly, how many people in this world can relate to a self-hating, self-absorbed, Jew from Brooklyn who's constantly feeling the urge to react with snappy one-liners to each possible banal situation in his everyday life and who seems incapable of enjoying life? Precious few people indeed, even in NYC. Now, if this particular Jew was living in Prague in the 1920s instead of NYC in the 1970s we'd probably call him Kafka. The difference being that Kafka forgot himself for a while, his phobias, his personal beefs, and set to cast a lucid, ice cold, clinical stare on the world he was living in, giving us so three of the greatest literary works of the XX century. And those are masterpieces, because all of us can watch ourselves in them our existential angst face to our mortality, our uncertainty face to life, are there, in The Trial, The Castle, The Metamorphosis. Annie Hall shows us instead that Allen was still very far from crossing that line when he made it.To be clear, I don't hate Allen. In fact I loved his comedies Sleeper, Love & Death, Take the Money & Run, Play It Again Sam, All I wanted to know about sex, etc, but that's all. Annie Hall entertained me to a certain point but didn't leave me anything as an impression, idea or challenge. I think I even forgot it hours after the viewing. Later, once Allen started doing serious stuff I casted him out of my life, as I knew all he had to show in that genre was his neurosis just seen from different angles. The only difference between those flicks and AH being that he used this last, consciously or not, to entrap a willing audience to whom he'd inflict later those heavies, using the mix of the proved ingredients he had at hand. But at that point I had already left the building.AH fans rave about the supposed novel technical features used in the movie but even that is inaccurate. The fourth wall was already being broken before it; one ex. I can mention is that of characters in Amacord (1973) looking at the camera and reacting to it. Also, the use of cartoons appears in Clockwork Orange (1973). Now, I can't recall characters interacting between frames in movies, but I can certainly do it in cartoons, specifically in Jiggs, where the frames themselves act like rooms of a house--for ex., in one frame someone will be playing the trumpet while in the frame below someone is knocking on its top with a club. Characters interacting with their young selves was nothing new by that time either, it had already been used in the TV series Time Tunnel--episode The Day The Sky fell In&#x97;when one character goes back in time and meets himself as a kid. Characters engaging with total strangers in dialogs about their own personal lives was standard in musicals, as I recall.But as I said this is a movie very aptly done. There's a sure hand behind the camera and in the director's chair. About acting...wait, what acting? They are just playing themselves! how hard that can be? Anyway, the pacing is smooth and the editing close to perfection. The problems is, all that work has being done with something that totally lacks soul, feeling. It's like watching fireworks lots of light, colors, but absolutely no warmth. A film like Dr. Caligari leaves you in psychological discomfort; Apocalypses Now, in awe; Jaws, Alien, drawn out, emptied of your emotions. Instead, after you have finished watching Annie Hall you don't feel anything at all if not the uncomfortable feeling you have wasted your last 93 min.--unless of course you are crazy about self centered, neurotic, navel gazing Newyorkers. And that's because Allen didn't care for what you felt while watching it; all he cared about was for you to know the extent of his neurosis, to admire his skill at making movies and to appreciate his snappy one-liners.

However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable.

It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be.Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

Being a person that watched quite a few titles throughout his life I must say I was seldom more irritated by a movie like this one that managed to make me turn it off after as little as thirty minutes.I don't really know why Godard didn't manage to pull this off, I suppose that he wasn't entirely aware of what he should be doing in order to create a Orwellian, dictatorship driven, anti utopian movie. It starts off extremely unpromising, as the environment is a patchwork of symbols that were not by any means used in place, not to mention the sound used for the movie was the most inappropriate thriller - like type of sound that they could possibly pick up from just any half - decent crime movie made by the same time.If you manage to neglect the messed up environment that is a patchwork of this and that but never manages to make it up to the full picture that it should represent, there is no possible way you won't get extremely irritated by the computer - generated - Big brother - type of voice that brags nonsense that tries to sound as if it's brainwashing the listener. Beware that this is light-years behind 1984 - a movie, based on a great novel crafted to perfection - a dystopian masterpiece, that I can only praise.After wanting to smash my sound system and after trying to adjust it well enough so the inadequate sound effects won't damage the proper functions of my nerves, I started thinking how this movie would have been a masterpiece if created by Pasolini. I remember how he managed to pull out the entire Theorema using the sound of a church bell, which by no means sounded anywhere that inappropriate as the sound effects found here. Apart from that I do believe he would have done great job in implementing the political meaning into the movie. Godard failed in his attempt to be overly artsy in an environment that was probably chosen by himself - one that managed to fail his movie even more.As a conclusion, with a little bit of sadness I should admit that at least the cover art looks somehow acceptable and pleasant, and that is why I bother to give one star to this hour and a half tape of lost meanings.

It's the reanimated corpse of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, stitched together with various horror-movie conventions that didn't exist yet in Shelley's time, partly because we've come to know them from other film versions of Frankenstein. For instance, early in the novel, the 17-year-old Victor Frankenstein begins university and has a couple of quiet office conversations with Professors Krempe and Waldman, neither of whom are medical doctors. He then skips Krempe's lectures and attends only the more inspiring Waldman's. Here, we get the thirty-something (!) Branagh confronting Krempe in a lecture \/ operating theater, loudly demanding instruction in the ancient theories of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus -- theories that the novel's Victor had already given up on. It's a flashier scene, it's very Hollywood, and it may be inspired by Shelley's version, but it nearly reverses the novel's point, scrambling its analysis of how Victor ends up going wrong.The portrayal of the Creature also messes with the story's moral. Yes, he's played for sympathy in a way that's in line with the novel; this may be how Branagh and Coppola convinced themselves that they were doing Shelley's version. But as others here have noted, DeNiro, even with a Bronx accent, is not frightening enough. OK, so he's got some facial scars -- he's not eight feet tall, he doesn't look overpowering, and he seems too obviously decent to suddenly start killing people. Granted, it would be hard even for a great actor to capture the eloquent and well- read yet savage beast that Shelley imagines, but you at least need to make him look frightening enough that we can understand people attacking him and fleeing in terror. The fact that he's ugly, as he puts it, isn't enough to explain the tragedy. In that regard, a more traditional Halloween or horror-movie Frankenstein might actually have served the story better.There are other very big changes, especially late in the story, but I won't give them away. If you leave Shelley out of it -- and in fairness, the producers should have left her out of the title -- and if you overlook a number of things that don't make much sense, then it's a glossy and reasonably entertaining version of Frankenstein. But it's not Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, it's another in a long line of loose adaptations.

On that note as well, expect that sort of humor. If you thought that sounded like crap or too corny for your taste I suggest watching the show.If you watch this THEN the show(or for most people, the other way around), you will find many inconsistencies with the source material. For example the ending is that Buffy defeats the Vampires, dances with Pike in the school hall and they both ride away on a motorcycle together. In the show Buffy apparently burned the school hall down in an effort to stop the vampires (which is why she got expelled) and she moves to Sunnydale with her mom only. The main reason this happens is because of Whedon's last draft, he apparently left the project midway through production and never came back.
