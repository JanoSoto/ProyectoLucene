This is more art than movie, in that, most people go to movies to escape the real world for a while, not get caught up in it like a moth in a-- oh, I said that already.

I think it usually works great for Christopher Guest, but when it comes to serious, tragic stories like this one, it does distract from the story line since I find myself looking for each performer.

I did like Boogie Nights better but that's because it gave me lots of laughs to break up the clouds of depression that Magnolia just sort of dumped on my head like a sudden downpour of...frogs?

Through the eyes of the fictional characters, we're shown what a circus of a time gone by was like.The trouble is, maybe we're shown a bit too much. What makes this movie watchable for me is the character driven moments, but just when things are getting interesting and you want to learn more about characters, the story cuts away and we're lumbered with a ridiculously long parade scene that will have you itching to press the fast forward button. Although some of the circus scenes aren't so bad and are to be expected in a movie that's about the circus, there are some that are almost pointlessly long.As for the plot itself, it's hardly complex, but it's a decent enough storyline for a movie of its type and time. Most of the story revolves around Holly, a flying trapeze performer, and Brad, the man who runs the show. Holly is struggling to deal with the fact that Brad's more obsessed with the show than her and when Brad's new headline act, The Great Sebastian, comes along, Holly finds her own attentions drifting, even though Holly and Sebastian try to out-do each other show after show because Holly's desperate for audience attention. There is also rivalry over Sebastian's affections between Holly and Angel, another circus girl, while Brad obviously has feelings Holly even if he doesn't always show it in obvious ways.A lot of the animosity towards this movie appears to stem from the fact that it won a Best Picture award at the Oscars, beating films like High Noon. While I agree with those who don't think it deserved a best picture award, I can't dismiss it as a bad film. Putting it together, filming and setting up those circus scenes, must have been painstaking, and although I moan about the overly long parades and circus moments, it does look grand and impressive. These days a movie like this would probably be bogged down with CGI special effects and stunt people. What I especially like about this film is the actors did a lot of their own stunts. The movie has heart and feels like a very genuine and raw portrayal of old school circuses.If it has a real negative flaw it would be the acting. Most of the performances are treading an extremely thin line from just about watchable to bad. Betty Hutton is near to appalling in most of her scenes and overacts so much it stands out even in a movie like this. Heston is okay, but the character is wooden so his performance could be perceived as that too. One of the better performances comes from Cornel Wilde as the arrogant Sebastian, but the show stealer is undoubtedly James Stewart as Buttons, a clown who is on the run from the police and is using the circus as a means to hide. Stewart's performance is warm and sensitive and quite underplayed, and it works beautifully.As a whole, the movie is worth seeing if you're a circus fan or like movies from this era, but I think to most modern audiences the acting, overly long circus scenes, and the rather corny and dated love story would be a turn off. If you do choose to watch the film, go in with an open mind and don't expect too much. For what it is, it's enjoyable enough. And if you get really bored you could always play Spot The Guest Celebrity Star in the scenes that focus on the circus audience!

I was entertained, though not moved, and staring at Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett for three hours was not at all difficult! Josh Hartnett was new to me, and I think he did a great job in this film. But, this movie had some serious writing flaws. First of all, they broke a major rule in writing, Show, don't tell. If one more character broke into a speech about what heroes and all-around good guys these people were, I would have run screaming from the theater. I KNOW they're heroes, I want to see them BE heroes, I don't want a bunch of other characters TELLING me they are heroes. Good grief. Another flaw in writing was to give the main character the soap opera name of Rafe. Now, if there really WAS a Rafe McCawley who was a fighter pilot in this war, then I will take this back. But, assuming it is just an attempt to make Ben Affleck's character more of a larger than life hero, it was a poor choice. It was distracting, melodramatic, and unbelievable. They should have just named him Ben. Or, if they want a good macho-yet-normal-type name, how about...Pete Mitchell? After all, they took enough other points of this story from Top Gun. About 15 or 20 minutes into the movie, there is a scene that had me biting my tongue so I wouldn't yell out MAAAVVERICK!!! And Alec Baldwin played Doolittle as if he had studied for the part by watching Tom Skerritt in Top Gun. Some of his these guys are heroes speeches were the hardest to sit through without snickering. I was really hoping he would have instead broken into his I AM God speech from Malice. Another writing weak point was the development of Kate Beckinsale's character. I liked her Evelyn much better than her Emma, but Evelyn was a cliché. You could hear the writers saying, Okay, we have lots of pretty girls in this movie, but we need to show that Evelyn is a cut above the rest. Hmmmm.... and so they use all the usual tricks, making her speak in a more cultivated voice, not making her boy-crazy, and making her be the only one who knew how to take any initiative under crisis. Roger Ebert has already given a good critique of her cheesy speeches, so I'll leave that out. Cuba Gooding, Jr., had a good role but again, too many speeches on heroism, and not enough screen time in general. Much like Armageddon, the special effects were wonderful but the writing wasn't given nearly enough effort or attention. The ending is predictably convenient, or conveniently predictable. Take your pick.To summarize, although the acting was decent enough, the writing was not. I felt detached emotionally from the whole film, and sat there looking around the theater at other women my age who were crying, and I was quite surprised and a bit disappointed. I think if the movie HAD been more realistic and based on historical fact, it would have moved me a lot more, just like the real stories of the Titanic disaster affect me much more than Jack and Rose did. Instead of reflecting on the tragedy of the real Pearl Harbor, I found myself wishing I was sitting between Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K. We'd have a great time picking on this one.

It would be wonderful to find a happy medium, but we rarely do.The Arrival is quite entertaining, despite the miscastrophe of Charlie Sheen. At one point, when his character was soberly praising the merits of abstinence, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. Well, at least his bod was nice enough to look at, although his hairdo was a bit scary -- it looked like it would hurt if you touched it, and I was kind of hoping the aliens would shave some crop circles in it -- and I wasn't too thrilled about the goatee. Poor Charlie uses the same face for every emotion look angry, okay, eyes wide and intense. Look scared, okay, eyes wide and intense. INTENSE!

We have some great alien films. Galaxy Quest and the MIBs are great entertainment, but those are comedies, so wouldn't satisfy someone hoping for a good scare. Starman, E.T. and Close Encounters are top-notch, although the aliens in Close Encounters were rather disappointing at the end (a bunch of bald little people surrounding a tall bald anorexic - a benevolent Ann Coulter without the hair).

The more I read books about science and evolution, the less thrilled I am with the lack of imagination when it comes to most aliens, who look like us only with different colors of skin, and a few strange protuberances.This movie does have a few very imaginative elements but they are surrounded by lots more unoriginal sci-fi ideas and tricks so obviously contrived to startle the audience, or develop pseudo-suspense, such as the ol' scorpions in the bedroom trick.But I do wish that some of these directors would get together and give us a movie that DOES have scary, suspenseful, sci-fi effects and elements, AND has some soul-searching substance (but not so much that it overshadows the main event, which is holy sh**, we're being attacked\/visited by ALIENS!!!!!) We have some great alien films. Galaxy Quest and the MIBs are great entertainment, but those are comedies, so wouldn't satisfy someone hoping for a good scare. Starman, E.T. and Close Encounters are top-notch, although the aliens in Close Encounters were rather disappointing at the end (a bunch of bald little people surrounding a tall bald anorexic - a benevolent Ann Coulter without the hair). Like Signs, those films went more for substance. What I would like is a SCARY movie about aliens, such as The Arrival attempts to be, but without using so many of the worn-out tricks of the trade.I didn't really mind The Arrival, but I doubt I'll ever feel the need to rent the sequel.
