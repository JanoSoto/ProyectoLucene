She is horribly bullied at her high school, especially by the sadistic Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), and basically ignored by every person who isn't putting her down. So when token nice girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) decides she wants to build Carrie's confidence by giving up her place at the prom and telling her kind hearted jock boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to invite Carrie, Carrie's mentor Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) smells trouble. Sue promises all is well and Tommy ad Carrie run along to the prom. But when Chris and her dimwitted boyfriend Billy (John Travolta's second role) devise a horrible and humiliating prank, they don't take into account what has manifested inside of Carrie after all those years of torment, and how it will effect them in the films horrifying and very memorable climax.Brian De Palma's famous horror film, adapted from Stephen King's chilling novel, is often noted as the ultimate in teenage revenge films. De Palma used his distinctive style to make a chilling and original horror film that really is the best example of 1970's horror, the style, music, clothes, acting, dialogue and pretty much everything in the film is like a time-warp. The editing very original and you can tell the makers of the film enjoyed creating it.The acting is very fine, some of the best in any horror film out there. Sissy Spacek is great as the sympathetic freak, but at times you wanna slap her, she's so incredibly pathetic. Like when she's screaming about her period, running around nude. I can understand that she didn't realise what was happening, but running around like a lunatic, and bleeding on people through your vagina isn't gonna inspire sympathy from them. But since I read the book, I understand that was the intention. Piper Lurie was absolutely fantastic as the looney mother, and all the other performances were pretty passable. I have to mention PJ Soles. Her character was so awesome, I'd even go as far a to say that she was one of the (many) highlights of the film. Her character added a quirky charm the film that couldn't be matched by anybody else. Some of the themes explored was Carrie's journey into adulthood, shown through the way she learnt to control her powers and discovering different parts of her body and different things she can do, most obviously her first period and her telekinesis.Overall, CARRIE is an outstanding horror\/drama. Any horror fan, or general film fan should check it out. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2007","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a misunderstood young high schooler with a freakishly obsessive Catholic mother (an amazing performance by Piper Laurie) who borders on Neo-Nazi.

To be honest, I'm not the kind of guy who would openly show his feelings when watching a movie. I've never screamed while watching a movie and I didn't with Alien neither. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I wasn't scared.Because I was.Alien is the definitive sci-fi-meets-horror flick. There had been a lot of B-movies produced in the first years of the Cold War which focused on terrifying monsters from outer space but they mostly failed to capture our terror. Alien does, and this is because of many reasons.First, it's important to tell the synopsis. I'll be brief because this is a rather simple one. Somewhere in the future (when exactly, you ask? is it supposed to matter?), the Nostromo heads back to Earth after a mining expedition, somewhere (where exactly, you ask? same answer).They arrive on an exotic planet where they receive an odd signal. They discover a huge... structure, where there's an odd pod containing odd eggs. Kane (John Hurt) wants to examine one of them, but before he could do any scientific comment, an odd creature (with tentacles) hugs to his head.Kane is eventually brought back to the Nostromo. Bad move...The most famous (and hideous) scene in the movie happens when the alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The remaining 90 minutes becomes a non-stop chase aboard the space ship in order to eradicate this extra-terrestrial 'serial killer'.Alien is both minimalist and naturalist. Minimalist because of the simple concept, the small number of characters (nine the seven crew members, Jones the cat and the alien) and the small screen time of the thing itself. In fact, the alien is only portrayed when he's about to attack. When it's already too late... That approach is genius.Naturalism now. Director Ridley Scott and his own crew members from the visual effects, decoration and make-up departments all own a great deal of reality in this sci-fi movie. The Nostromo is not shown as a toy and the crew is divided in classes, exactly like in a capitalistic system. This system is depicted in the way that it supposedly leads to the problems, which could give this movie a pro-socialist or pro-communist mood (you don't have to believe me, you know...).The disgusting scenes of the face-hugging creature dissection, the alien escaping from Kane's chest and Ash (Ian Holm) being stalked are at the same time horrible and realistic, which gives even more power to the movie.Alien is also one of the first movies to have a strong woman as the heroine. Sigourney Weaver became a star with her portrayal of courageous and intelligent officer Ripley. And she rightfully owns that kind of reception. I loved Weaver's performance.I also loved the special effects. The visual effect services are used for the famous and original title sequence and the 2001-inspired explosion of the Nostromo near the end. The silence which precedes the alien's attacks is almost a necessity in that kind of movie but it's used to perfection. It brings thrills when it needs to.Many psychedelic followers would tell you that space is a dream place. Alien shows what happens when it becomes a nightmare.Alien is not only a great sci-fi movie, but it's also a terrifyingly good horror flick. The aspects of both genres are mixed at the point that none of them predominates over the other. And those who like only one of the genres won't be disappointed, even if they don't like the other part.I just can't wait to show the movie to my sister.

Notable gags include like a flower labeled Mount Stupid or a man arrives at a costume party dressed as the Easter Bunny, who comes down the chimney saying Ho ho ho!,; later it is revealed he was, in fact, merely wearing his Sunday best. Not the most intelligent or witty humor, but hilarious in its own right.The movie very much follows in this vein. The humor is, albeit, a little childish, but it can also be droll, absurd, ridiculous and clever, in a way similar to Looney Tunes, or the more slapstick comedies of Mel Brooks. The Stupid Family continues their idiotic antics, while at the same time coming across a very serious enemy--some sort of evil military killing squad whose purpose I can only vaguely remember. The serious people aren't important, really-- it's how the Stupids react to them that is the spirit of the film.

Tom Arnold plays Stanley Stupid, ineffectual patriarch of the Stupid clan, fittingly with cheerfulness, energy and sheer, utter obliviousness. Yes, he did win the Award for Worst Actor this year, but it was for two other films as well as this one. People should keep that in mind before judging the movie and Tom.Granted, I saw this film many, many, years ago, when I was a young child, and since then have relied solely on memory of it. If I were to see it again today, or even if I saw it today for the first time, I might not think so fondly of it. But the world has seen many, more famous comedic films that are not nearly as funny. Does it deserve its condemnation and obscurity? That is something I'll leave you to decide for yourselves. But in order to do that, you have to WATCH IT!!

Brother of 2001 is in my opinion Kitano's weakest film up to date, which does not mean that it's bad. It is just not quite as brilliant as Kitano's other work. Kitano is once again director and leading actor, and he once again delivers a great performance in the lead. Yakuza Aniki Yamamoto (Kitano) flees to America after his death is ordered by a Yakuza clan. Yamamoto goes to LA where his younger brother Ken is supposed to study. Instead of studying, however, Ken deals drugs with some American friends. And it doesn't take Yamamoto long to plan some drastic improvements for his little brother's gang...Takeshi Kitano's performance is once again superb, this guy certainly is one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents who ever lived. I found the Japanese characters great in general, and if it was only for them, Brother would have probably almost reached Kitano's masterpieces in brilliance. I personally didn't like the American characters though. Omar Epps certainly is a good actor, but his character of Denny is just not very deep, simply the very stereotypical African American street gangster seen in two out of three cheesy Hollywood blockbusters. And that counts for the other American characters too. It wasn't actually that bad with Omare Epps, simply because he is a very good actor. Besides the flatness of the American characters, I found the movie very good. It is once again beautifully and imaginatively filmed in typical Kitano style, and it has the typical Kitano humor that I love. The movie is also very violent, so it's probably not for people who are easily offended by brutality in films. What I also really like about Brother is the fact that at least half of the movie is in Japanese. The Japanese characters also talk Japanese when they are in the US.Brother is arguably Kitano's weakest movie, and definitely my least favorite of his movies, but that doesn't mean it's bad. We're talking about a great cinematic genius here, and Brother certainly is a good, suspenseful, entertaining, stylish and interesting film. In case you don't know Kitano yet, i recommend to watch Hana-bi or Violent Cop before watching this, but in case you're already familiar with Kitano Brother is certainly worth watching.

There are intriguing plot points early on involving Starfleet's and the Federation's attitude towards relocation of colonists, an obvious parallel to our 19th century approach towards American Indians. It's another take on the oft-used phrase 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few' (or the one), and points out that the Federation is still far from perfect even in the 24th century, riddled with bureaucracy and policies based on expediency. I'm not sure this is what Roddenberry had in mind when he conceived the whole Trek universe, which seemed a bit more evolved in comparison to our current approach on the political front. There are also brief references to other problems plaguing the Federation of this time frame, related to the Borg threat and the Dominion war. These are nice nods to continuity but, again, creates a very unpleasant picture of what we used to think of as a solid framework for near-utopia and the grand notion of exploration. Even actor Stewart's character Capt. Picard addresses this briefly, when he wonders out-loud on whatever happened to their status as explorers. What, indeed.Instead, we are treated to what amounts to a double-length episode of the TNG series - just another standard mission - and not a very exciting one, at that. The plot revolves around two sets of peoples introduced here the pleasant Ba'ku and the unpleasant Son'a. The Ba'ku, which number about 600, have really lucked out they settled a planet about 300 years ago whose planetary rings have extraordinary properties in terms of halting the aging process. Based on the exposition, these Ba'ku kind of sound to me like people who escaped Earth's 3rd World War in the 21st century. They have knowledge of advanced technology such as holograms but choose to spend their time in pre-industrial farming techniques; it's basically a return-to-nature scenario. The Son'a, on the other hand, indulge in grotesquely extreme plastic surgery to fend off advancing years and are understandably temperamental due to all the skin stretching. Their technology is, in some ways, even more advanced than the Federation's and they covet what the Ba'ku have (naturally nice skin). At least one Starfleet admiral agrees with the Son'a that the benefits of these planetary rings should be spread around more and so, an underhanded plan ensues. There's an unintentional amusing tone to this set-up, dark as it is, slipping nearly into satire, almost as bad as the silliness in the 5th film, The Final Frontier. Of course, when Picard learns of this unscrupulous plot against the Ba'ku, he will have none of it, and this at least puts us all back on track in terms of Federation principles and the well-known honor of the TNG crew. There are some nice bits related to the crew becoming somewhat rejuvenated while on this planet, some of it amusing (Worf), some poignant (LaForge's eyes) and some satisfying (Riker & Troi). Some other stuff is just too silly - the extended scene of Picard & Data singing an old Broadway tune (stop, please, stop). There are also very cliché sequences - Data's developing friendship with a Ba'ku boy; the entire 'boy-goes-back-for-pet' scene, resulting in jeopardy for the adults who follow him. Taken together, these add up to a ho-hum adventure, as if the writers were simply caught without any really new ideas. I really wish these Trek films would've concentrated on something unusual and extraordinary happening to the characters, rather than following the week-to-week pattern of an episodic series. Since way back to The Wrath of Khan, the Trek films had pretty much avoided the central theme of the original and Next Generation series, that being seeking out new lifeforms and civilizations. Unfortunately, though there is a limp attempt at this here, what they found here was nothing new, but more of the same. It's a nice, pleasant revisit with the crew, as well as a retread of the issues presented in the original series episode The Omega Glory from 30 years prior and TNG's own Journey's End in its last season.

I have watched it countless times, yet it continues to enchant me every time, and I never grow tired of it's story.People never cease to amaze me with their cruelty and pettiness--most which stems from that green eyed lady, JEALOUSY. We, as human beings, always seem to resent those who have attributes we have not--whether it's money, power, beauty, etc. Jealousy is why Malena suffers so much through out this film. That is the simple truth. I won't deny that the men in the movie don't help the situation much, (as they get carried away with their story telling and boasting--as they all WISH they could sleep with her). The fact is, the MEN are jealous, too. Not jealous of Malena, but of each other, jealous of her husband--as all of them are competing with each other to be Malena's potential man.However, the women in this movie, (and in real life in many ways), are the main crux of the problem. It seems to me that in every facet of life, whether it is in the workplace or the family, etc., women are always dead set on destroying each other out of jealousy. There seems to be only one or two women in this movie who show any kindness towards Malena, (excepting of course for at then end, when they are all afraid of going to hell for what they did to her)...It's ironic how as soon as her husband returns, and Malena is no longer a sex object, how the women warm up to her and begin to treat her with dignity and respect. While she was alone, she needed their friendship the most, but she was all alone suffering in so many ways. This happens so often in real life, and it actually hit home for me, as I have known women in the past who have been abused because of being attractive.I am a woman, and I am not gay at all, but when I see a beautiful woman, I don't automatically HATE her just because she's beautiful! That behavior and emotion is so primitive and stupid--and it's a shame that we women don't have better control over our jealous minds. We could accomplish so much in this world if we were able to get our heads out of our you know what's and stop being so petty and jealous all the time of women who happen to be prettier than us!!! I admire Malena, or any other beautiful woman as a lovely creation by God, to be admired and liked--not to be hated and victimized. Women need each other, we need each others friendship. But ironically, our competitiveness with each other over men keeps us separated and lonely. This is the case with Malena. She does absolutely NOTHING wrong, yet she is humiliated and abused by the entire society--and yes, all because of her beauty. She is guilty of being beautiful, (GORGEOUS, actually). None of the women in this movie come even CLOSE to her. Even our American Angelina Jolie looks like a plain Jane compared to her...(No offense, but it is true, as pretty as Angelina is--she's TOTALLY overrated)!! Monica Bellucci may truly be the most beautiful woman in the world since Venus.Another point this movie demonstrates is how age has nothing to do with the capacity to experience true love. Renato is only 12 or 13, yet he loves and cares about Malena more than any of the older men in the village. People have prejudices about women dating younger men, but when love is concerned, age should not matter. I am glad she found her husband in the end, but given a few more years to grow up, I think Renato would have been the ideal match for Malena--despite their age difference! (As long as he was legal, of course)!!!In any case, this is truly the best movie I have ever seen, and it has a wide range of emotions that will cater to most people's diverse tastes. The soundtrack is wonderful and emotional. The only people who may NOT like this movie, would be jealous and insecure women, (of any age group), who don't like being reminded of how mediocre they are compared to Monica Bellucci. All women want to be beautiful, but if they were this pretty, they would see how hard it can be. And for all you jealous, petty women out there who have nothing better to do than to gossip and make trouble, I say you should watch this movie, because it may give you an idea of how hard it can be when the grass seems greener on the other side, and show you how being a beautiful women can be a very difficult and lonely thing sometimes...WONDERFUL movie all in all.

I won't deny that the men in the movie don't help the situation much, (as they get carried away with their story telling and boasting--as they all WISH they could sleep with her). The fact is, the MEN are jealous, too. Not jealous of Malena, but of each other, jealous of her husband--as all of them are competing with each other to be Malena's potential man.However, the women in this movie, (and in real life in many ways), are the main crux of the problem. It seems to me that in every facet of life, whether it is in the workplace or the family, etc., women are always dead set on destroying each other out of jealousy. There seems to be only one or two women in this movie who show any kindness towards Malena, (excepting of course for at then end, when they are all afraid of going to hell for what they did to her)...It's ironic how as soon as her husband returns, and Malena is no longer a sex object, how the women warm up to her and begin to treat her with dignity and respect. While she was alone, she needed their friendship the most, but she was all alone suffering in so many ways. This happens so often in real life, and it actually hit home for me, as I have known women in the past who have been abused because of being attractive.I am a woman, and I am not gay at all, but when I see a beautiful woman, I don't automatically HATE her just because she's beautiful! That behavior and emotion is so primitive and stupid--and it's a shame that we women don't have better control over our jealous minds. We could accomplish so much in this world if we were able to get our heads out of our you know what's and stop being so petty and jealous all the time of women who happen to be prettier than us!!! I admire Malena, or any other beautiful woman as a lovely creation by God, to be admired and liked--not to be hated and victimized. Women need each other, we need each others friendship. But ironically, our competitiveness with each other over men keeps us separated and lonely. This is the case with Malena. She does absolutely NOTHING wrong, yet she is humiliated and abused by the entire society--and yes, all because of her beauty. She is guilty of being beautiful, (GORGEOUS, actually). None of the women in this movie come even CLOSE to her. Even our American Angelina Jolie looks like a plain Jane compared to her...(No offense, but it is true, as pretty as Angelina is--she's TOTALLY overrated)!! Monica Bellucci may truly be the most beautiful woman in the world since Venus.Another point this movie demonstrates is how age has nothing to do with the capacity to experience true love. Renato is only 12 or 13, yet he loves and cares about Malena more than any of the older men in the village. People have prejudices about women dating younger men, but when love is concerned, age should not matter. I am glad she found her husband in the end, but given a few more years to grow up, I think Renato would have been the ideal match for Malena--despite their age difference! (As long as he was legal, of course)!!!In any case, this is truly the best movie I have ever seen, and it has a wide range of emotions that will cater to most people's diverse tastes. The soundtrack is wonderful and emotional. The only people who may NOT like this movie, would be jealous and insecure women, (of any age group), who don't like being reminded of how mediocre they are compared to Monica Bellucci. All women want to be beautiful, but if they were this pretty, they would see how hard it can be. And for all you jealous, petty women out there who have nothing better to do than to gossip and make trouble, I say you should watch this movie, because it may give you an idea of how hard it can be when the grass seems greener on the other side, and show you how being a beautiful women can be a very difficult and lonely thing sometimes...WONDERFUL movie all in all. Makes a very good point which applies to every society. ","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"12 April 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Forces of Nature is a very unusual romantic comedy. Unusual in that it seems determined to avoid all the natural conventions you would expect from the genre. In fact as I watch it, there's something about the film that places it just a little outside the mainstream. I don't mean it would be embraced by the indie crowd. Especially with stars like Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck at the helm. But it is not your standard rom-com.Forces of Nature is a film that borrows a few plot lines from the superb Planes, Trains & Automobiles. But instead of a businessman trying to get home for Thanksgiving saddled with an annoying travelling companion, instead we have a man trying to get to his wedding, and meets a free spirited woman along the way who might just be the girl of his dreams.Ben Holmes (Affleck) is an uptight publisher on his way to Savannah to be married to his fiancée Bridget. But the plane he's on never even gets off the ground when a pigeon gets sucked into the engine turbine. Seated next to him is Sarah (Bullock), one of these eccentrics you tend to meet on public transportation.Ben is unwilling to wait for another flight to Savannah, and since she's headed in the same direction, Sarah wants to help Ben get to his wedding on time. But of course, their journey proves to be anything but smooth, filled with detours, jail cells and all night K-Marts.Although Forces of Nature is slightly predictable, I do have a certain affection for the film. Perhaps because it is willing to take the whole romantic comedy genre in strange directions. Sandra Bullock, one of my favourite actresses, is no stranger to rom-coms. But in this film, she plays a slightly more edgier character than what I've seen of her previous work.Sarah is the complete opposite of Ben. Where he is a tense, uncertain man who has to think everything through, Sarah is an impulsive, free-thinking spirit who goes with the flow. But her willingness to be so spontaneous sometimes leads to problems. Like the scene when a train they're on stops in the middle of the track, and she actually climbs on top of one of the carriages and invites Ben up just to feel alive. But the carriages are uncoupled and they end up seriously sidetracked.Forces of Nature does have some unexpected depth. Granted the screenplay is a little contrived the way it keeps throwing up obstacles to prevent Ben from reaching his wedding. Its all designed to keep Ben and Sarah in each others company. But that comes with the territory. And we do find out some surprising things about Sarah over the course of the film.Naturally of course, the more time Ben and Sarah spend with each other, they begin to open up to each other, and a strange sort of attraction develops. But not exactly love. Sarah helps Ben to loosen up, and Ben begins to question whether or not marriage is such a good idea now. But FON raises some fascinating and unexpected left field turns.Ben believes he may be falling in love with Sarah, but she doesn't agree. After all, they've only known each other for inside of two days. How could he possibly love a complete stranger who only just walked into his life a short time ago? She helps Ben to reexamine his feelings for Bridget, and make the right choice in the end.FON is never as outright funny as it should be. But then maybe its not trying to be. It tries to ground the trappings of a romantic comedy in more serious surroundings. Its nowhere near as successful as the wonderful Lost in Translation, but FON does have some pleasant surprises in store. Bullock is terrific, and plays one of her most fascinating characters to date, and although Affleck is as stolid as ever, at least its in keeping with the character he's supposed to be playing.The ending is a little downbeat, especially for Sarah's character. I genuinely did feel real sadness for her in the end. Bullock does such a great job of fleshing out Sarah's character I was left with genuine concern over her future.Forces of Nature is no classic, but it does have some unexpected merits. It would be a shame if it faded into obscurity.

This comment contains extreme spoilers!!! This movie contains some of the absolute worst acting I've ever seen, and some of the absolute best.On one end of the spectrum, we have Sharon Stone portraying a daddy's girl out for revenge against an outlaw gunman who murdered her father when she was a child. Now, that story, perhaps tweaked a bit, could have been good, but Stone absolutely butchered it with her pathetic attempt at playing the role. She plays a young woman with a bad attitude who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. A typical mysterious stranger type character. The problem is, the role was played so horribly, it's comparable to a high school play performed by a bad drama club full of pseudo-emo kids trying to sound deep.This role could have worked so well, or at least the basic story of good guy vs bad guy, but thanks to Stone, not only was the role completely destroyed, but the shockwaves of where her performance crash landed very nearly destroyed the entire movie.Now we come to the middle men. Those in the center of the spectrum.First, we have Russell Crowe. He plays Cort, an ex-outlaw turned preacher. Presumanly, Cort is the best gunman in the movie, though we never see a showdown with a worthy opponent. Not a bad piece of acting, but not particularly good, either. Not much to say.Next, we have Leo cast as Fee The Kid. A big-mouthed youth with a fast gun hand, and an even faster mouth. Again, not particularly great acting, but not bad. Not as good as Crowes, though. I feel this role would have benefited more from another actor.Then we have a bunch of other people that don't matter a whole lot.This brings us to the opposite end of the spectrum, as far as possible from Sharon Stones crap-job. Gene Hackman is cast as John Herod. An ex-outlaw that used to ride with Cort (Russell Crowe). Herod is now the mayor of a small town where his word is absolute. The townspeople live in fear, because Herod is pure evil. Gene Hackman doesn't play the role. He IS the role. This is possibly the best piece of acting I've ever seen in my entire life, and the only thing keeping this movie from sinking into the sludge pit that Sharon Stone set forth. Herod hosts a gunslinger tournament with a cash prize. He is the central pillar tieing together the other 3 main characters.Ellen (Stone) is out to get her revenge on Herod for what he did when she was a kid. She enters the tournament, and ultimately ends up somehow winning, killing Herod in a final showdown at the end.Cort is Herods ex-partner, and has been captured and dragged against his will to the town to take part in the tournament. His fight with Herod is interrupted before it begins, but Herod had one of his toadies beat him up and smash his gun hand before the fight because he knew Cort was too fast for him.Fee is Herods son, who enters to try and win his fathers respect and approval, only to be fatally wounded in the tournament by Herod. He cries and squirms around like a little worm before he dies.These four form the foundation of the movie, but Hackman outclasses them by light years.All in all, this is a decent western dragged down by Stones bad acting, and saved by Hackmans. If you want a deep plot that will suck you in and have you biting your nails, seek elsewhere. If you want a shoot em up and don't care about historical accuracy (which you should be watching documentaries for anyway), go for it.At least, that's my take on the whole thing.

A legendary artwork from the genius of Sam Raimi and beloved of myself. Terrific sight gags, a lean and mean Bruce Campbell as Ash, and soul swallowing demons! Ash and his woman Linda want some time alone so they shack up in a deserted cabin. Unfortunately it was being used by professor Knowby while he translated The Book of the Dead and when Ash plays the recording evil spirits are summoned. Having to chop up your girlfriend makes you a little loco and when demonic forces are screwing with you it just gets worse. About half the film chronicles Ash's struggle against insanity and the unholy terrors. When everyone else arrives they misunderstand the situation of course, heck - there's some maniac with a bloody chainsaw and shotgun in the Knowby's cabin. They learn soon enough Ash isn't perfectly sane but right on track with his assessment of the situation. Unfortunately the newcomers aren't the hardy breed though, and they fall one by one. In the end Annie is able to recite the passages to dispel the evil with her dying breaths but Ash is dragged through the time warp and into the medieval past. I really love this movie, the Hand is a riot! More movies should use the idea of the main character's hand becoming possessed and menacing them. Like... ...Dirty Dancing! Now what if Swayze's hand had become possessed and he was trying to deal with that while doing the Tango or something. Hey, what about Forest Gump? Hehehehe! (Say this in a Gump voice.) And mah hand was acting all funny like, it even tried to stab me. Momma never said nothing bout no hand trying to stab me so that jus didn't seem right. What it boils down to If you have not seen this film you are missing out.

On widescreen DVD it is simply beautiful, but if you ever have the opportunity to see it in a real theatre(not one of those little multiplex cubes), run as fast as you can to get a ticket. Most of this film was shot(by Nestor Almendros) during the breaking of dawn or the glow of dusk, and the vistas and settings are simply breathtaking. What's even more amazing is that Almendros was reportedly going blind while filming this movie.Terrence Malick tells the story of a pre-WWI time in America, when life was simple, people were just as poor in some places as they were during the depression. But they always had hope that tomorrow would turn things around for them. Richard Gere is Bill, an angry young man for whom nothing works out. He travels from Chicago to Amarillo with his sister Linda, and his girlfriend Abby (beautiful Brooke Adams), who must pose as another sister. They work for a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard), who they think is dying. Bill entices Abby to marry the farmer so that they could have a good life for themselves when he dies.The rest of the story is pretty predictable, but the story and dialog don't really matter here. Malick is telling a different type of story. About people, and life in America during this time. He does this by drowning you in the faces of the people that make up America. So many beautiful, interesting faces. You can learn more about the country and it's people by just looking at how they are weathered and drawn and beaten.All of the performances are very good, and the score by Ennio Morricone is one of the best I've ever heard.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Days of Heaven is one of the most visually magnificent films you will ever see.

The story is a lot more enjoyable for me than most of the adaptations of the Three Musketeers. Almost everything is changed and I was surprised this was even considered a musketeer film but I guess you have to if you use their names.The story is set during the reign of King Louis XIV considered one of the greatest rulers of France's old government. However not all is well in France. Constant war with neighboring lands has destroyed the economy and all of Paris is starving and rioting while Louis sits in his estate loving women. The three musketeers (Athos, Aramis, and Porthos) have aged into their late 40's early 50's and are all but useless to the king. Aramis decides it is enough and decides to unleash Louis' dark past. Louis' twin brother was locked in the Bastille and placed in an iron mask so no one would recognize him. Aramis and the other two musketeers plan to break him out and usurp the throne for the kinder Philippe. Meanwhile D'Artagnan questions his allegiance to his King and to his friends and his questionable past.First, what must be recognized is the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on duel roles and completely different personalities brings forth some of his best acting of his career. This role I believe is the one that broke him out of the pretty-boy look he had gained from Romeo+Juliet and Titanic. DiCaprio showed a lot of promise in his duel roles in The Man in the Iron Mask and seems to have paid of with his recent film works (The Departed and Catch Me If You Can). DiCaprio is convincing both as the King and as Philippe. Two of the three musketeers in my opinion were strong. Jeremy Irons is one of the top British actors in the business and proves it again as the Jesuit Musketeer Aramis. French actor Gerard Depardieu brings the comic relief as Porthos but that is when comic relief is needed. He is in no way just their for the laughs, he has in stern moments and his fair share of good acting moments. John Malkovich is not my favorite actor. I believe his performance as Athos is a bit forced and just didn't convince me for the majority of the film. The person that wins me over is the mysterious acting of Gabriel Bryne. Bryne makes me believe he is the true D'Artagnan. His tragic character figure made me watch this film over and over again. Bryne convinces you with his first minute on screen that he is an amazing actor and that he deserves more recognition in Hollywood. I wish Bryne would get more big time roles in movies today. His performance is reason enough to watch this film.The story is not the greatest. The director never gives us the true understanding of how horrible psychologically it must have been for Philippe to be locked in an iron mask for five years. I think this would have added a bit more suspense to the story. The film does also have its dull moments and questionable dialog. Overall I find the story average with solid acting by the majority of the cast. The Man in the Iron Mask is not a great film by any means. More of good acting with mediocre storytelling. The ending sequence is one of my favorite to date. The musical score is exceptional and the performances by DiCaprio and Bryne are among the best I've seen.3\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"12 April 2007","score":"","review":" The Man in the Iron Mask is yet another adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' classic of the Three Musketeers. yet again the story has a different premise revolving around Porthos, Aramis and Athos and their friend D'Artagnan.
