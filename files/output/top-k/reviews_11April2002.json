Performing with all the charm of some of Hollywood's Great leading men, he holds this picture together, so Meg doesn't really have to try. After all, she can do this stuff on auto pilot anyway.

Since it was released in the beginning of the Reagan era, circa 1981, the only film to equal it in its mystery genre is The Usual Suspects, but even that film, with all of its intricacies of plot; fiendishly delightful manipulations; twists; turns; and eccentricities of character, remains a conventional who-done-it, when compared to the import, and mystery, of Cutter's Way.Told within the context of dazed and confused post Vietnam era America, it features a breathtaking performance from the brilliant, and never since better, John Heard as Alex Cutter. A hard drinking Veteran who was crippled by a land mine during the war while walking point, (`Only place to be!'), Alex is the biting conscience of an era trying to numb itself with booze and sex to it's recent past. While his cynical ravings about America and Americans appear to be the drunken ravings of a lunatic when he pronounces them, his alcoholic fugue really just dulls the jagged edge of the brutal truths he speaks enough so they fall just short of a lethal weapon. `Playing' at being a cripple, Alex remains insulated from the threat of getting his head pounded in, and he takes full advantage of his disability, managing to at least appear to hold the higher moral ground during even his more assaultive tirades. He remains clear, truthful, and precise while denouncing the sinister intrigues he observes swirling about him in the mundane world he inhabits, (`The routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy I take straight'), so when his best friend Richard Bone, played by Jeff Bridges, inadvertently stumbles onto a real life crime of the most lurid kind, one that `may' link the most powerful elder in the community of Santa Barbara to the sex attack and murder of a teenaged girl, Alex takes to his trail like a dog to a bone. This is not the kind of Vietnam Vet it is fashionable to play anymore, nor is it considered politically correct to even acknowledge once existed as our primary mythological figure that had returned from the jungles of that strange war. But, this film was released at the beginning of the Regan era folks, before the more cynical memories of the Vietnam era were more or less painted over by that `new feeling in the land' that was gaining momentum back then. But, there is still Alex Cutter, a biting testament to the time, in one of the best performances from an actor you will ever committed to film. Mr. Heard displays the astonishing breadth of character very much evident in the range of work offered by the Jack Nicholson, or the great Gary Oldman, (who has played everything from Dracula to Lee Harvey Oswald), and he fuels Alex's emotional life with the range of King Lear. This guy rocks! He simply chews through the scenery, yet, while going way over the top in his focused and insightful ravings, he always manages to remain within the realm of believability. And, while Jeff Bridges gives us still another chance to see first hand why he is considered one of the great American actors of his generation, it is the beautiful actress Lisa Eichhorn as the doomed, suffering wife of Alex, who is a true revelation here. Her unforgettable portrait of Mo, (Maureen), alcoholic, lonesome, and lost, gives us the quintessential bruised angel for the era. A tragic figure, Mo is the `hippie chick' that met a one-night stand at a sixties party, and got her skirt caught in the door when she tried to get out. She is loyal to Alex, because she truly loves him, but we always know that somewhere down the line she took a wrong turn, and this is not the street she should be living on. Ms. Eichhorns heartbreaking performance has haunted me since 1981 when I first saw this film at the Cannery Cinema in San Francisco, and I have been in love with Mo since that day. If there is anything about the web that I can say `I love', it's that I can encourage other folks out there to finally give this film and this wonderful actress the attention she and it so richly deserve. I still mist over slightly when I think of Mo quietly weeping as Jeff Bridges holds her in his arms and whispers tender secrets, and soft encouragements to her during their love scene. It's one of the most heartrending, moving, and beautiful moments I've ever seen on film. Ms. Eichhorn shows us vividly how much it means for Mo to be held and to be loved, and how desperate her need for kindness is. I ache for that character and her predicament even today when I think about her. This is when acting is a true art form. I haven't seen this film in a long, long time, but this moment is as clear to me now as if I had seen it yesterday. Ms. Eichhorn paints such a moving and humane portrait of Mo's lost yet loving soul in the precious moments when she is on the screen, that it is very clear she would have become a major international film star, as she was once expected to be, had only things happened a little differently for her. And, while it's true that I gave up taking the Oscar race real seriously a long time ago, having decided when John Wayne beat Dustin Hoffman for Best Actor that there was no justice in it, I watch them just to savor the moments when they do get it right, and it is still amazing to me that none of the principles involved in the creation of this great film, neither it's writer; director; composer; nor any of it's magnificent stars, were recognized in any way by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work. Not one nomination went to `Cutter's Way' for anything. This film disappeared from theaters almost as soon as it arrived. Oh, to further peak your interest, I should tell you that there is a dark secret of epic proportions brewing beneath the surface of this story, one that is never openly discussed nor revealed, not even at the end of the film. Yet, we're always strangely aware of something within the narrative teasing us along, well hidden within the action; illuminated only in the subtext of dialogue; and story; keeping us deceptively riveted on the murder mystery, while imperceptively tugging on the coattails of our subconscious, drawing us further down a rabbit hole to peek behind the mask of a killer in that marvelous way only a master director, (Ivan Passer), can. Oh, you have a good old-fashioned who-done-it here too folks, and I can pretty well promise you fans of that genre that they won't be disappointed even if that's all your looking for. It's just that, well, like `Blow Up' and more recently `Eyes Wide Shut',  Cutter's Way is, at its core so much more than just a `murder mystery'. Critics naive enough to have dismissed this storytelling as too simple have missed the secret of this film by a wide five miles, as well as cheated themselves out of the sheer fun of watching it and trying to figure it out. Hey Guys, you seriously need to give this one another chance. `Cutters Way' is a classic, one of a kind murder mystery. (Indeed, it was recently released on DVD as part of the MGM `Classics Series'.) I doubt anyone who sees it will ever forget it. It's darker secret will more than likely elude you as it has so many others on the first viewing, but not to worry. Like all the great films that remind us why we go to movies in the first place, you'll be drawn to watching `Cutters Way' again. Be forewarned though, this film keeps a secret even after the shattering, final blast echoes into the darkness of its last frame; one that will resonate with you for many years to come.

By then I was really looking forward to it, because the overacheiver was going to be the villain! Sweet! (Note you can tell I WASN'T an overachiever in high school). When this unentertaining, God-awful piece of dreck finally came to the end credits, I had never felt more disappointed or P.O'd at a movie. It was a boring, cynical, and exaggerated movie that seemed to scream Look at us, we're proving something!! in every scene. Now let's get down to the REAL griping. Election tells the story of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon, talented as always, but not likable here). Despite her cherubic face, innocent curls and perky demeanor, Tracy is a budding tyrant underneath it all, with a bloodthirsty ambition to lead everything in high school (her list of extracurricular activities is ridiculously long), including being class president. Matthew McBroderick plays Tracy's teacher, Jim McAllister, who's fed up with this compulsive hand-raiser, and decides to have someone run against her in the election to take her down a notch. McAllister seems like the kind of guy Ferris Bueller would grow up to be, but he isn't. McAllister is the most hapless, hypocritical, morally bankrupt loser this side of Seinfeld's George Costanza. He finally finds a competitor for Tracy in Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, who's actually pretty good). Paul isn't the brightest color of the rainbow, but he agrees to do it. Another person who competes is Paul's lesbian kid sister, Tammy. Tammy is supposed to be the voice of wisdom, but she's really nothing more than a self-obsessed, whiny delinquent.Election's biggest problem is that it's a satire that tries too hard to be a satire. It tries to prove too much, but fails miserably. It's short-sighted and vague much too often. For instance, the only character who's blessed with honesty, integrity, and self-discipline is Paul, and yet he's the dumbest character in the movie. Doesn't that imply that moral people are half-witted numbskulls? I thought it was a huge misstep that Tracy won the election. It not only defeats the purpose of the movie, but it also makes no sense because it's very obvious that Tracy isn't popular enough to have won in the first place.

When this unentertaining, God-awful piece of dreck finally came to the end credits, I had never felt more disappointed or P.O'd at a movie. It was a boring, cynical, and exaggerated movie that seemed to scream Look at us, we're proving something!! in every scene. Now let's get down to the REAL griping. Election tells the story of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon, talented as always, but not likable here). Despite her cherubic face, innocent curls and perky demeanor, Tracy is a budding tyrant underneath it all, with a bloodthirsty ambition to lead everything in high school (her list of extracurricular activities is ridiculously long), including being class president. Matthew McBroderick plays Tracy's teacher, Jim McAllister, who's fed up with this compulsive hand-raiser, and decides to have someone run against her in the election to take her down a notch. McAllister seems like the kind of guy Ferris Bueller would grow up to be, but he isn't. McAllister is the most hapless, hypocritical, morally bankrupt loser this side of Seinfeld's George Costanza. He finally finds a competitor for Tracy in Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, who's actually pretty good). Paul isn't the brightest color of the rainbow, but he agrees to do it. Another person who competes is Paul's lesbian kid sister, Tammy. Tammy is supposed to be the voice of wisdom, but she's really nothing more than a self-obsessed, whiny delinquent.Election's biggest problem is that it's a satire that tries too hard to be a satire. It tries to prove too much, but fails miserably. It's short-sighted and vague much too often. For instance, the only character who's blessed with honesty, integrity, and self-discipline is Paul, and yet he's the dumbest character in the movie. Doesn't that imply that moral people are half-witted numbskulls? I thought it was a huge misstep that Tracy won the election. It not only defeats the purpose of the movie, but it also makes no sense because it's very obvious that Tracy isn't popular enough to have won in the first place.

A past of which you've never had so much as a hint or knew existed?  It's a situation that is examined by director Carl Franklin in `High Crimes,' a film that is part courtroom drama, part suspense\/thriller (with emphasis on the latter), and which illustrates the facility with which the black and white definition of someone's life can in a moment be tainted and overwhelmed by shades of gray.  And it becomes, then, a story about courage and commitment, and most importantly, trust and truth, the basic ingredients that make up the mortar that holds our society and our very lives together; and as this film points out, if the mixture of that mortar is not pure, it is a very tentative seal, indeed, that binds us together.Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) seemingly has the perfect life; she's a successful criminal defense attorney (about to become a partner in the firm), has a beautiful home in the San Francisco Bay area and a wonderful husband, Tom (James Caviezel), with whom she is hoping to have a baby soon, which would make her life complete.  Then suddenly, it all comes crashing down around her, when Tom is arrested by the F.B.I. and charged with murder. And, as if that's not bad enough, it's a military case-- Tom is facing a court martial stemming from an incident in 1988 when Tom was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.The incident occurred in El Salvador; after the bombing of a restaurant in which three Americans were killed, a detachment of Marines-- Tom's unit-- was sent to a small village in pursuit of the rebel terrorist responsible for the bombing.  According to the military intelligence that had been gathered, the villagers there would have information about the perpetrator. But as the interrogations began, things went bad somehow, and some of the villagers ended up dead.  And fingers pointed to Tom as the shooter.Claire, of course, believes that Tom is innocent, and decides to take on the case-- and the military-- herself.  She feels confident in her ability to defend him and get to the truth.  After all, she has a strong case-- if only she can uncover the identity of the real shooter, then prove it in a court of law that operates within parameters that extend beyond her personal frame of reference.As can be expected with a film like this, there is much more to it than meets the eye, and director Franklin does a great job of putting his characters (and his audience) through their paces with it.  There are a number of forks in the road along the way to the climax, and he puts them all to good use, building the tension and maintaining it right up to the very end.  He spends just enough time in the courtroom scenes to make them effective; he does not dwell on them nor linger there.  Instead, he keeps most of the story elsewhere, which works well, because that's where the action and the thrills reside.  Most importantly, he keeps it all moving right along and keeps you guessing; he never tips his hand too soon, and it makes for some riveting suspense.Franklin knows how to handle his actors, too, and he gets some first rate performances out of them, especially from Judd and Morgan Freeman, who are great on-screen together (as they were in their previous collaboration, `Kiss the Girls,' in 1997).  Judd is charismatic and has a down-to-earth persona she manages to bring to whatever character she is playing that enables the audience to connect with her.  Her Claire is professional, but well grounded-- which gives something of a fresh face to the usual portrayal of lawyers in film, and she's entirely convincing, which, of course, adds much to the credibility of the story.  As with any good actor, the essence of her character can be found in her eyes, which honestly reflects who this person really is.  Judd gives so much more than a by-the-numbers performance, and she gets results accordingly; Claire is very real, and because of that, you care what happens to her.As Charlie Grimes, the former Marine lawyer (who back in the day had more than some trouble with the system of military justice) now in a less-than-thriving private practice, Morgan Freeman effectively creates a memorable character, bringing that extra something to the part-- as he has in films throughout his career-- with yet another excellent performance. Freeman has a natural quality that comes through so well on screen (as it certainly does here), he always gives his best, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.  A good job from one of the finest actors around.Caviezel also does a convincing turn as Tom, as does Adam Scott, as Lt. Terrence Embry, the young attorney assigned by the Marines to Tom's case, and Amanda Peet, as Jackie Grimaldi, Claire's somewhat irresponsible sister.The supporting cast includes Tom Bower (Agent Mullins), Michael Gaston (Waldron), Juan Carlos Hernandez (Hernandez), Jude Ciccolella (Farrell) and Emilio Rivera (Attacker).  A well crafted and delivered thriller that will get and keep you emotionally involved, `High Crimes' is entertaining, but frustrating, as well.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat while taunting you with the absolutes of a military tribunal that makes the term `Military justice' seem like an oxymoron; there are times, in fact, when you'll want to yell at the screen and plead for someone or other to use some common sense and acknowledge the proof of what's placed right in front of them. But it's all a part of the ride, and it's a good one; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  8\/10.

Jodie Foster does an outstanding job as per usual as Meg Altman. Forest Whitaker also does a great job as the reluctant villian. Sure, the character is a little cliche (bad guy who doesn't want to be bad but has to for someone he cares about), but that didn't matter to me, because he did a great job none the less. Great acting, and some heart stopping intensity makes this the best thriller I've seen in a couple of years.I think that Kristen Stewart did an exceptional job as Jodie Foster's angry and sarcastic daughter Sarah (another a cliche character, but once again, played to perfection), who has to hide out in the panic room with her mom. Dwight Yoakam steals the show as the mysteriously scary robber Raoul, who remains an enigma through the whole movie. Raoul is the violent and mentally unstable (of course!) thief, would have no problem blowing away Meg and her Daughter. This movie takes some pretty scary turns here and there, with a lot of slow motion running and getting away in the nick of time.I have to admit that I went in to the theatre with low expectations (it was a Sunday and I was bored, so I grabbed a friend and went to the movies), but I was pleasantly surprised when I left. There was action, a little comedy, and non stop thrills, which is usually what I like about a movie, besides great acting, but it has that too!

Everyone who wants to study film should see them, because they display quite accurately how not to make a movie, and in particular how not to write a script. I cannot even express how much is wrong is these movies, in every possible respect. Obviously they are cynically manufactured with money in mind (Ewoks!? C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment. What even some of the series' detractors fail to see is how awful the movies would be with or without the hype.Let's start with the acting. I can't believe anyone ever took Mark Hamill seriously; meanwhile, Harrison Ford's attempts at emotion are downright laughable. Carrie Fisher does what she can, but like everyone else, she's saddled with some unspeakable dialogue. Far more offensive is the storyline that runs through the three films (and presumably the three prequels as well). You tell me with a straight face that no loser thirteen year-old who reads sci-fi comics couldn't come up with this tripe, and I will applaud you. George Lucas has created a masturbatory set of films in a remarkably self-indulgent attempt to take advantage of the notoriety he achieved with AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Let's not beat around the bush, these movies have one of the dumbest plots ever transferred to celluloid. The Force? Wow, talk about covering your tracks... to try to avoid plot holes, Lucas creates this invisible dimension that can let people do anything, like pick up out-of-reach objects (as seen in the remarkable Luke retrieves a Kenner toy which you could go buy right now from the snow while he hangs upside down scene, the stuff of great cinema, in the second film). How exciting. I'd like to have a Force in my house so I won't have to get up to change the TV channel when this idiotic movie comes on.The script? Don't even get me started. To be frank, what little plot there is doesn't make much sense. And talk about episodic! It's just one toy commercial after another, from the completely pointless speeder-bike scene to the seemingly endless chunk of partying from the Care Bears or whatever those things were. Any fan page or even the IMDB will hold a nice collection of ludicrous quotes, and the fans will probably shiver with glee, while I sit and gawk at how a screenplay with no trace of talent to be found can gain the respect of millions. Most offensively, you've got a score that screams and manipulates like a sitcom laugh track or a Nazi anthem (but then, John Williams never offered anything but recycled schmaltz to start with).In essence, I remain fascinated by the fact that more people have seen this than will sit through the infinite number of films that have more imagination and emotion in a single second than the entire Star Wars series can muster. The worst part is, if you issue any kind of a dissenting opinion on this boring junk, a million raging fanboys will assault you for not showing the proper degree of worship to a supposed American classic. Jonathan Rosenbaum said in 1997 that destroying every print of the Star Wars films wouldn't solve any of the problems caused by them, but that he wouldn't shed a tear at the loss. I would agree. I don't claim to have any authority over anyone's love of the series, and if you genuinely love these films, that's great.

But, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I DON'T like a film.  Queen of the Damned is one of those films.Anne Rice's popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful An Interview With A Vampire. Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience.  While it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I have never been that enamoured with the Vampire genre in general).Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on to much bigger things. It's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel.  They would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome.  Queen of the Damned typifies the type of cr*p Hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.Needless to say this film is terrible from the start.  Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of Shooting Fish fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, Nu-Metal.  He freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is.  Along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a Vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen King.The film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour.  Anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general!  Watching Townsend is enjoyable.  He knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting.  The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role.  She has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest.  The poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.It is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until Aaliyah's untimely death last year.  With the possibility for people to see her final film, Warner Bros put this out to a general release.  Otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.No doubt films like this will continue to be made.  Look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like Not Another Teen Movie.

A film which, to be enjoyed thoroughly has to be watched at least 3 times. Are you gonna stand there and bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?Rating 9\/10.

I am more into horror myself but this combines so much that it's hard to take in all in one sitting. Dark black humour, thrills, spills, drama, what else could you want??!!.

Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case.  The boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and cleaned up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act.  But Sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be.This movie could have been a great little Hitchcock-style thriller, but the movie spends too much time on getting to know Sandra's character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself.  You see, something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film.  And we get to know all about it...ALL about it.  It just gets rather tedious after a while, especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past.Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners in this movie.  They play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice.  If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters, and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs, this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller.  With the way it is, most of the thrill is lost. They should have cut out all the stuff with Sandra's character and made that a separate TV movie for the Lifetime channel.  But, I digress.  It's still an entertaining movie, nonetheless.  I do recommend this movie...but wait for the video\/DVD.

Many people who watch movies like this wonder how someone can see art in chaos.  I know I will have to see it many more times to `catch' everything.  I think many people get different things from a David Lynch movie.  I'd love to share a few of the thoughts I had.  The first time I felt that warm, `ah yes &#150; this is a David Lynch movie' is when the two detectives are talking to each other.  If you close your eyes and just listen to their dialogue, you can hear David Lynch's direction.  The deliberateness of the words - words like Pearl Earing.  No one can make you picture a pearl earing like David Lynch can.  On the flip side; had he decided to shoot a pearl earing.  No words would have been needed. The Rita character bears a striking resemblance to Sherilyn Fenn, doesn't she?Did you notice that the Michael Anderson character sat in a room in which the walls were covered with curtains? I couldn't help but think that Lynch just sees him in that room.  He sees him in curtained rooms and simply has to put that image on film.  One of the greatest feelings I got during this movie was what seemed to be Mr. Lynch's ability to predict what I was thinking while I was trying to dissect what was going on.  I can imagine him laughing about all the thought people try to put into dissecting this movie, but...Near the end when the character roles have changed and I was trying to decide who Betty really was, I found myself leaning toward her &#150; being a figment of Rita's guilt ridden imagination.  I had it all figured out.  Betty was really Diane who offed herself because she could not have Camille's love.

No matter where brilliance like that comes from, it's exactly those types of incidents that make a David Lynch movie a true, masterful work of art.

Firstly a remake of, hardly a classic, Get Carter, that was followed by this little number, Driven. While both films were not all that bad, they did not merit the amount of money spent on them or the talent Sly possesses, and like his former rival Ah-nuld, often wastes. Of course Sly is by far the better actor but we all know that a lot of Arnie flicks could and should have been better. Of Stallones two recent fares, Get Carter is probably the better film but Driven is far more enjoyable to watch than the overly dark and at times dull remake of the cult hit with Mickey Caine in the 70's. \tAnyway, Driven is basically half music video and half soap opera with the odd break for an exciting race sequence. The direction in the film is a little shoddy at times and there are moments that ooze with pure cheese of the stinkiest variety. Slys script is pretty poor it has elements he has written before and to explain to you what I mean just think Rocky 5 on wheels without the twist of Rocky's student betraying Rocky. What Stallones script does do well is the amount of characters given good roles, with depth. This film is definitely a character based film but poor dialogue and lame direction outside of the race scenes make you feel as if your watching an episode of neighbours.  The bad points of the script? Well these are the plot and the dialogue. The plot is wafer thin and old and the dialogue is so tacky at times, admittedly some of it is good though but only the odd inspired moment.\tAlthough the film features a lacklustre screenplay and cheesy direction I have to say that the acting is top notch. Sly in particular is in good form, he has definitely given himself a role with some challenge. The others are good too, Til Schweiger as the German race driver who is the main rival to young hotshot Jimmy Bly played well by Kip Pardue. Also on her studio debut the gorgeous Estella Warren does a credible job. Burt Reynolds ranges from the top of his game to slighting hamming but he has some of the better scenes including  a good one with Sly. \tThe selling point of the film, which didn't sell it very well, are the exceptional racing sequences which make a boring sport seem extremely exciting. The special effects are some of the best around, with exceptional crashes such as a car flying through the air in bullet time as other racers fly by underneath. While some effects are dazzling some seem to lack effort such as a digital coin and sewer lid. While these scenes don't quite save the rest of the film they do build up the excitement levels at just the right time so you never become too bored watching the uninteresting relationships and double dealings. Overall this film has its plus points but they are outweighed by negatives. Renny Harlin has proven himself as a great action director but a drama like this and he looks lost outside of the race sequences.
