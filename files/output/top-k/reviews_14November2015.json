The call starts off innocent enough, until the man on the phone has kidnapped her boyfriend and tells her that she has to answer horror movie trivia if she wants to live. This man is revealed to be none other than.... another random guy in a mask, who (surprise, surprise) kills her.This may sound like almost all slasher films, but I assure you that there is something different about this film. The Scream series is most well-known for its self-awareness. Since all the classic horror films exist in Scream, the characters makes a lot of references to horror films. A character name Randy (Jaime Kennedy) who works at a video store, only exists to point out all the clichés in horror films for some laughs.Neve Campbell gives the best performance as Sidney. Sidney has been a depressed teen ever since her mother died a year ago and so she is not the most cheerful character around. When her mother was murdered, Sidney got Cotton Weary arrested.Now that a killer is going after her, she is beginning to think she might have made a mistake. The anger and is Campbell's performance gives Sidney an intensity that is good for a final girl archetype. The Scream Series is about Sidney and not the killer, which makes the Scream series unique in that way. Sidney is also smart when it comes to running from Ghostface and uses her brain in the chase scene. Most of the time...Ghostface himself has two different sides to him. Phone Ghostface (Roger Jackson) sounds like a genuinely threating character. However once you see him in action, he is really clumsy. I guess you can't have that great of vision with a mask like that, so not being perfect adds a sense of realism to the film. It is just disappointing when you hear this menacing voice and then there is this guy in a cheap Halloween costume that is just not good at killing. Ghostface wears a black cloak with a hood and a white ghost mask. He also does this really cool knife cleaning trick.The other characters are pretty good. Randy is the best supporting character, being the movie geek of the group and all his movie references really make the movie. Matthew Lillard plays Stu, the goofy class clown and Skeet Ulrich plays Billy Loomis (Sidney Prescott's boyfriend) who seems like he just wants to do it with Sidney. There is also Sidney's close friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) who really is just there so Sidney has someone to talk to.Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) have a romance going on in this film, but it is not explored much until the sequels. Dewey is not very good at his job and does not really protect anyone from the killer. Gale Weathers is a pushy news reporter, who is always trying to get a news story out of Sidney and just comes off as annoying.Craven does a good job imitating Carpenters style, making the ordinary seem sinister and mysterious. This tactic however makes some shots look lazy, like when Sidney is in a car and Ghostface tries to strangle her from the backseat. This shot is exactly the same as the car strangling scene in Halloween, and although some people would call this homage, I think that it is just a rip-off.The music score by Marco Beltrami does its job in making the viewer uneasy and has a mystical quality to it. The score is not nearly as iconic as other horror themes like Halloween or Friday the 13th, but it sound really good.The movie does not have that big of a body count like other slasher films. Only 6 characters die and there roles are very minor, this is because Scream was written to be a trilogy, so only certain characters are expendable. Unfortunately, because of so few kills in the movie, there is a lack of interesting kills. The only kill that is particularly memorable is the garage door kill. The movie ends with a party at Stu's house, and there the killer kills and injures some people. Sidney is chased around a bit, ending with the killer being revealed as Billy AND Stu. It turns out that Sidney's mother had a thing going on with Billy's dad and when Billy's mother found out, she moved away, leaving Billy behind. So Billy and Stu killed Sidney's mother and pinned it on Cotton Weary, and now they are planning on blaming these new murders on Sidney's father. The mess up this plan and get themselves killed, ending the movie.Billy has a pretty simple but good motive, but Stu has no real reason for going along with this plan. It is stated that he dated Drew Barrymore's character, but why would he have killed Sidney's mother in the first place? Or why would he stake out in a bathroom, hoping that Sidney would go in there, when there plan hinged on her death being on the next day? No matter the flaws that this movie has, it is still a great film. It makes the characters self-aware AND still stays true to the slasher genre ( unlike Scary Movie ). It also introduced a new generation to classic horror films, something it still does today.

However, this A View to a Kill made me realize that a fantastic main villain isn't enough in order to guarantee a great James Bond flick. Christopher Walken also depicts a terrific Bond villain in this movie, but the film as a whole nevertheless remains one of weaker and least memorable entries in the entire franchise. The plot is largely uninteresting, the supportive cast is wooden and many of the traditional James Bond ingredients are missing, like a nice variety of Q's hi-tech gadgets and obligatory quotes. That being said, A View to a Kill still provides nearly two full hours of campy entertainment and a handful of impressively staged stunt sequences, including a grotesque chase on skis at the beginning, a crazy parachute pursuit through the crowded streets of Paris and a climax high on top of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Oh, and of course this particular film also features one of the catchiest and recognizable title songs, courtesy of Duran Duran. The plot deals with microchips-technology. The deranged industrialist Max Zorin implants chips in his racing horses in order to give them electrical impulses when reaching the finish line and win the races.

The sub plot that I personally found the most fascinating sadly isn't elaborated properly, namely that Max Zorin himself is, in fact, the psychopathic result of controversial genetic experiments on pregnant women by a Nazi-scientist during World War II. It becomes quite clear in this film that the regular players are getting pathetically too old for their roles, not just Roger Moore as Bond but also Miss Moneypenny and even Q, and this has a noticeably negative impact on the chemistry between them and the supportive cast members. For instance, there isn't any plausible chemistry between James Bond and the four women that he sleeps with in A View to a Kill and most of the time he actually just resembles a sad old playboy. The most remarkable character, next to Max Zorin, is undoubtedly his eerie and super-flexible black female accomplice May Day, depicted by the natural born frightening Grace Jones.

To make matters worse, when Claire finds out what has happened she gets angry with both brothers which throws Beverly into an emotional tailspin that results in dramatic consequences for everyone involved. Now from what I understand this movie has apparently garnered both critical and popular approval. That's fine.

Admittedly, Jeremy Irons performed in an excellent manner and he deserves whatever praise is offered. But even so I still thought the movie was too slow and boring and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.

To make matters worse, when Claire finds out what has happened she gets angry with both brothers which throws Beverly into an emotional tailspin that results in dramatic consequences for everyone involved. Now from what I understand this movie has apparently garnered both critical and popular approval. That's fine. However, rather than following the proverbial crowd I happen to demur from the overall consensus as I found this movie to be a bit too dark and dreary for my tastes. Admittedly, Jeremy Irons performed in an excellent manner and he deserves whatever praise is offered. But even so I still thought the movie was too slow and boring and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.

But that's not all they share as the slightly older twin, Elliott, is less shy and typically initiates a sexual relationship with a woman and then when he gets tired of her passes her off to Beverly who takes it from there. Although this has worked like a charm for years, one day Elliott just so happens to hand a woman named Claire Niveau (Genevieve Bujold) to Beverly who then falls deeply in love with her.
