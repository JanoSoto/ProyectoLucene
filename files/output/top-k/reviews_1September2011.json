if Titanic can get 13 why can't this?as mentioned in the very first line, this is my most favorite movie of all time right now among the movies i have seen. definitely one of the most well known, discussed and groundbreaking movie of all time. a phenomenal movie that is so much ahead of its time. i was a bit not sure how will i take this movie since many movie lovers think its boring and lame with no dialogues and plot. but non of these things bothered me at all. i am so surprised i wen't through this movie without a slightest hesitation. there have been times when i saw a movie while forcing myself to like it but nothing like that happened here. it had this profound effect on me, i was really drawn into this movie, it was like a greatest adventure for me to watch this movie. i can watch this movie over and over and love it every time.for a movie of 1968 to show such things with such greatness is shocking and a miracle to me, unbelievable. this is an epic Sci Fi film of all time, the very best. it laid the foundation of modern Sci Fi movies with everything so perfect and outstanding that it can put a modern Sci Fi special effect movie to shame. this movie deals with elements of technology, artificial intelligence and extra terrestrial life but more importantly human evolution. the scientific accuracy and the visual imagery is so open that it looks very surreal, unique narration with minimum use of dialogues.this movie has a very less use of dialogues but enough to be understand. the best thing about this movie is it does not depend on dialogues, you have the visuals that is more than enough to make you understand whats going on in the movie while even more than that, your imagination, your vision is put to test here. i even for once wasn't puzzled or confused with anything. it was easily understandable for me, don't know why people think opposite of it. for 25 minutes or so it has no dialogues, then in many other places you will hear no human voice. it begins with a rather not so necessary scene that lasts almost 20 minutes. apes like early humans are shown as the slowly learns to use bones as a tool for killing others. while many viewers thing it is unnecessary scene, i think it is one of the most important and best explaining scene in the history.i am not gonna go into details of this movie because it would make my review very long, just minor story details. we see the monolith that was earlier seen in the apes scene after the scientists arrives to see the TMA-1. the monolith has to be one of the most scary and mysteriously creepy thing i have ever seen in a movie. then there is Jupiter mission where we meet the famous genius computer HAL 9000 who as we all know is a famous figure. i think that part wasn't develop well, i mean i didn't felt much connection with HAL, that is the only place in the whole movie where the lack of dialogues should have been avoided. he should have been develop more. as he turns villainous against the 2 scientists, those has to be one of the best scenes of villainy i have ever seen. towards the end, the part is called Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite which is were the movie finally ends as the Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA pod and finds another monolith in orbit around the planet, that scared me like hell as i knew the worst is about to happen know. we then see unusual colors and patterns as he passes through the vast never ending space. that is a very crazy scene. the ending was very weird and quite effective for me, though i still don't understand the actual meaning of it or the philosophy behind i but i found it shockingly interesting and jaw dropping.one of the best special effects and visuals ever. extremely well done and quite ahead of its time. art direction was brilliantly done. everything else like sounds and other technical things were brilliant too. nice editing and a great screenplay which stands as one of the best screenplay ever written for a sci fi movie. great story and plot though many people think it lacks a plot but i think it has many plots. great score and music. the score has to be one of the most scariest music i have ever heard in my life. it made such a haunting, lonely and creepy effect effect on the movie. i was literally scared. nice performances though nothing great as human characters weren't the primarily focus. superb direction.i was thrilled by this movie and scared too. my heart was pounding so hard even after the movie, i am still thinking about it and i will for the rest of my life. one of the best time i had watching a movie, never boring for me. a MUST WATCH for the art movies lovers like me, though general popcorn sci fi fans will hate it, but a general GOOD movies fan like me will love it.

I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.I love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them.

The absurd comparisons that are constantly made reveal the fact that most of the viewers have forgotten almost everything about this great movie, remembering only the basic premise of it. Which is a shame, because this is an excellent film, with a great story and many beautiful scenes.

Phil, I mean the man, is obnoxious, sarcastic and hardly inspires the sympathy of his team  the cameraman and Rita, his assistant. But for some strange reason, Phil is suddenly stuck in a time loop and live the same day over and over again, with the same situations and the same encounters.

SHADOW OF A DOUBT is my favourite of these so far, a gripping and intelligent mystery in which a bright young girl's kindly Uncle Charlie may in fact be much more than he at first seems.The script is pitch perfect and the pacing exact. Some have noted the thematic parallels to the story of Dracula, but these are too subtle to make much of.

It's a subtle film that emphasises realism for the most part, so there are no murder or chase scenes, just quietly building tension that closes with a still-thrilling climax.Teresa Wright is an unfamiliar actress to me, but she's given more screen time than most Hitchcock actresses and she shines as the fresh-faced innocent.

Capote who wanted Marilyn Monroe cast as Holly Golightly lived to see Audrey Hepburn make his literary creation one of her best cinematic creations. I think given Marilyn's track record for behavioral problems on film sets, Capote, Blake Edwards the director, and everyone else concerned with Breakfast At Tiffany's probably dodged a bullet. Capote's story is set in the Forties and the film is contemporary 1961 when it was filmed. There's no real plot to it, Capote did a character study and so is this. It's about two people and the fascination that George Peppard's character develops for the unconventionality of Holly Golightly as Hepburn essays her.Hepburn is the kept woman of a cross section of the male species and Peppard is the boy toy of another woman who rents in their apartment, Patricia Neal. Neal who would win her Oscar the following year for Hud has her character as curiously underdeveloped. It's the main weakness of Breakfast At Tiffany's.The strength is of course Audrey Hepburn who took Capote's character completely over and it's her vision of the story that we see when the film is broadcast. She's an amoral minx who in the end realizes that her life is really meaningless. Breakfast At Tiffany's won two Oscars both for Henry Mancini for Best Musical Scoring and Best Original Song for Moon River. That song is best known for Andy Williams's rendition, but there are also superb recordings by Frank Sinatra and Tony Martin. Hepburn got a nomination for Best Actress and the film was also nominated for Best Art&Set Decoration for a color film and Best Screenplay adapted from another medium, in this case Capote's novella. Considering all the changes made, maybe the credit should have read inspired by Truman Capote's work. In any event this film belongs in the top rank of the works of Audrey Hepburn.

The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

While More never publicly opposed Henry on this matter (at least as presented here) his silence was ultimately such an irritant to the King that More was ultimately convicted of treason on trumped up charges.One of the early scenes sets the tone for this sumptuous, highly literate production. The scene is a verbal duel between More (Paul Scofield) and Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles). Wolsey, for political reasons, was on the King's side. The scene illustrates the movie's sharp dialog and artfully sets up the basic conflict at the heart of the story. Here is a sample of the exchangeWolsey If you could just see facts flat on without that horrible moral squint. Are you going to help me?More If your grace will be specific.Wolsey My effort is to secure a divorce. Have I your support or not?More The Pope gave a dispensation so that the King might marry his brother's widow for state reasons. Now we are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons? No your grace, I am not going to help you.Wolsey Explain how you can obstruct these measures for the sake of your own private conscience.More I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties they lead their country by a short route to chaos.This scene has Welles in red robes against a red background, his great girth augmenting his imposing demeanor. More is lighted in contrast to a dark background. The scene cuts back and forth between Wolsey and More using medium shots and close ups. Brilliantly done.Scofield is exceptional as More, but I found the rest of the cast less impressive (excepting Welles' brief appearance). Robert Shaw as Henry VIII did not work for me, he did not project the commanding presence that Henry must have had. What we see from his Henry is mainly stagy, hysterical ranting making him look like a petty, weak man. Even though the sets and costumes are lavish and the English countryside and castles make for an elegant background, the human interactions smack of the stage play upon which the movie was based.The questions one is left with are what manner of man was this Thomas More and what is to be made of his actions. Clearly he was bright, being able to think on his feet and come up with cogent arguments and quick retorts. Such talents must have made him a good lawyer. He was a man of principle--not many are willing to martyr themselves for a belief, as evidenced by the fact that More was the only public person to go against the King. But men who believe, as More did, that the laws of God trump the laws of man, can be scary. The terrorists who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 believed in martyring themselves in the cause of belief in their God. Some of the greatest tragedies in history have been perpetrated by those with an unwavering belief, usually in some God. Contrary to More's quote about forsaking private conscious for the sake of public duty, it is just as likely that intransigence can lead to chaos. Was More's rejection of the Protestant Reformation a good thing? I suppose that each person has to decide what principles to uphold and what ones to compromise, but adherence to a principle is not always an admirable thing. In spite of this movie's apparent intention to present More in the most positive light possible, I am not sure I would trust the man in a public position of authority.This movie is worth seeing for its beautiful filming, Scofield's acting, its literate dialog, and its easily digested history lesson.

No your grace, I am not going to help you.Wolsey Explain how you can obstruct these measures for the sake of your own private conscience.More I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties they lead their country by a short route to chaos.This scene has Welles in red robes against a red background, his great girth augmenting his imposing demeanor. More is lighted in contrast to a dark background. The scene cuts back and forth between Wolsey and More using medium shots and close ups. Brilliantly done.Scofield is exceptional as More, but I found the rest of the cast less impressive (excepting Welles' brief appearance). Robert Shaw as Henry VIII did not work for me, he did not project the commanding presence that Henry must have had. What we see from his Henry is mainly stagy, hysterical ranting making him look like a petty, weak man. Even though the sets and costumes are lavish and the English countryside and castles make for an elegant background, the human interactions smack of the stage play upon which the movie was based.The questions one is left with are what manner of man was this Thomas More and what is to be made of his actions. Clearly he was bright, being able to think on his feet and come up with cogent arguments and quick retorts. Such talents must have made him a good lawyer. He was a man of principle--not many are willing to martyr themselves for a belief, as evidenced by the fact that More was the only public person to go against the King. But men who believe, as More did, that the laws of God trump the laws of man, can be scary. The terrorists who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 believed in martyring themselves in the cause of belief in their God. Some of the greatest tragedies in history have been perpetrated by those with an unwavering belief, usually in some God. Contrary to More's quote about forsaking private conscious for the sake of public duty, it is just as likely that intransigence can lead to chaos. Was More's rejection of the Protestant Reformation a good thing? I suppose that each person has to decide what principles to uphold and what ones to compromise, but adherence to a principle is not always an admirable thing. In spite of this movie's apparent intention to present More in the most positive light possible, I am not sure I would trust the man in a public position of authority.This movie is worth seeing for its beautiful filming, Scofield's acting, its literate dialog, and its easily digested history lesson.

I also liked how the film didn't have a typical Hollywood slushy ending, but actually ended humanly and realistically with a hint of tear being placed in the audiences eye. It's fantastic.Rain Man is quite simply an ray of sunshine, a truly heart-warming and moving experience that everyone should experience.
