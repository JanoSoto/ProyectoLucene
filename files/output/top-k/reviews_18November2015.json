In the midst of this revolution came Pocahontas, a rousing animated musical, directed by Eric Goldberg and Mike Gabriel.Pocahontas, in typical Disney style, takes a well-known tale and molds it into an easy-to-digest story set to music. In this case, for the first time at Disney, the story was true. Here's where some people come down on Pocahontas. No, it didn't stay completely true to what really happened with John Smith and the real story of Pocahontas, but it shouldn't have. Pocahontas, the movie, is based on the myth of Pocahontas rather than the reality. The story goes that English settlers come to Virginia in search of gold. However, one settler, John Smith (voiced by Mel Gibson), is out for more than that. John Smith came in search of adventure. On the other side, Pocahontas, a young Algonquin princess voiced by Irene Bedard, is set to be married to the tribe's Gaston named Kocoum. It's all very predictable Disney stuff. The settlers are mostly just evil, gold-mongering, brutes, The princess is weary of getting together with the jock character, and there's only one man who understands her. We've heard it before. Even so, the story starts off great and the familiar elements are welcome for the most part. The latter half of the film is where things really pick up. We get a mature and complex love story between John Smith and Pocahontas as well as a dramatic story of betrayal and acceptance when Pocahontas decides to sacrifice herself for Smith.As great as it is, the story is not exactly what separates Pocahontas from other films of the Disney Renaissance. That would go to the animation and music. From the opening shot, it's clear. Pocahontas is a breathtaking piece of animation. The characters feel real, yet they're idealized, with simple faces that convey much more than most other cartoons. And that's the thing. This movie doesn't look like a cartoon. It really represents the height of what animation can do. The backgrounds are like paintings, conveying a sense of place as well as any of Disney's best films. It's doubly noteworthy considering the whole film takes place in real-world locations, not enchanted kingdoms or underwater palaces. The Colors of the Wind scene in particular is a jaw-dropping showcase of the enormous talent of all the Disney animators. There is not enough I can say about the animation in Pocahontas. It is phenomenal!The same goes for the music. Almost every song in Pocahontas is a rousing, bombastic, and sweeping piece of music. From the fast-moving Just Around the Riverbend to the wonderfully wicked Mine, Mine, Mine to the grand spectacle that is Colors of the Wind. The songs are up to the quality of the very best Broadway musicals. Again, Pocahontas is so much more than a children's cartoon. It is truly a piece of art.When all the pieces come together, the story, the animation, and the music, Pocahontas is remarkable. It's a film of craftsmanship and quality. While kids will no doubt enjoy it, it's not made for kids. In fact, I'd say the one thing Pocahontas is lacking is the humor of some of the other Disney movies. Still, Pocahontas is a major achievement in animation and it has a timeless message of acceptance to boot. Show this movie to your kids, watch it yourself, just see it. Pocahontas is in a word...

The film was made on a budget of a mere $27,575, probably less than the catering costs on most Hollywood films, but you don't need a big budget if you have a great comic imagination and a gift for writing wonderful dialogue, both of which Smith has in spades. I have been aware of Smith and his films for years now but I decided to check them out when he and Jason Mewes guest starred as themselves on the Canadian teen drama Degrassi The Next Generation, to which I am addicted, and I thought that they were both very funny. Smith is a huge fan of the series' predecessor Degrassi Junior High and Caitlin Bree is named after one of its main characters Caitlin Ryan.The film charts a particularly eventful day in the lives of two clerks named Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, played to perfection by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson respectively. Dante is a dogged nice guy who is torn between his current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, and his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree. Veronica wants him to pull his socks up and go to college so that he make something of himself but Dante takes her for granted and spends most of his time pinning over Caitlin, whom he learns has just gotten engaged to an Asian design major. His relationship with Veronica is stable but his relationship with Caitlin was marked - well, defined - by frequent infidelity on her part so it was not exactly a match made in Heaven in spite of the fact that he seems to devote most of his life to reminiscing about it. Veronica and Caitlin are played very well by Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonhauer, who was later briefly married to Anderson incidentally. As the film progresses, however, things go a bit pear-shaped for all concerned. Dante means well but he has a tendency to screw up, though much of this can be attributed to the less than helpful efforts of his best friend Randal.Randal is the archetypal apathetic Generation X slacker and pop philosopher who works at a video store and makes no effort to hide his disdain for the customers. He spends most of his time at the convenience store Quick Stop where Dante works so he leaves the video store unattended for about 45 minutes out of every hour. Randal regularly insults the Quick Stop costumers as well, leaving Dante to try and salvage the situation. He devotes a great deal of his energy to pointless gossip, causing trouble for Dante and thinking about things such as the politically neutral independent contractors who were more than likely killed in the destruction of the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi. Randal is without a doubt the best character in the film and gets all the best lines, which may have something to do with the fact that Smith originally intended the role for himself.The first 20 minutes of the film are certainly very funny with the biased anti-cigarette gum enthusiast and Dante and Veronica's discussion of their respective sexual exploits but it reaches another level of hilarity when Randal makes his first appearance. O'Halloran and Anderson have great chemistry and they deliver their exquisite dialogue in a very natural fashion, particularly when they're together. Like Dante, Randal means well. He is very protective of Dante but he royally screws things up for him without meaning to at the end of the film. He's is basically the best friend from Hell but he and Dante nevertheless have a great brotherly relationship.Over the course of the day, Dante and Randal have to deal with numerous odd and\/or difficult customers and these interactions are likewise hilarious. Smith worked at a convenience store at the time that the film was made so I am guessing that some of them were based on people that he met in his day job. My favourite customer is certainly the old man, played by Al Berkowitz, who needs to use the terlet at the not very aptly named Quick Stop and comes back to haunt Dante (and Caitlin!) later in the film. Most of the cast members in the films were friends of Smith's or family members such as his mother Grace who played the milkmaid and his sister Virginia who played the, uh, animal artificial insemination specialist. Jason Mewes and Smith himself are very funny as Jay and Silent Bob, two of the most colourful characters in the film.Several actors such as the film's producer Scott Mosier and Walt Flanagan play multiple characters. While this was probably done mostly to save money, it serves to emphasise the fact that Dante and Randal's jobs are extremely repetitive. It is not often that an entire film concerns the lives of people with ordinary, boring jobs and that makes the film stand out. The characters are of course exaggerated but I know people who remind me of Dante and Randal and I'm sure that that is true of many others. I can't imagine Randal's work ethic doing much for his employment prospects in a recession though.Overall, this is an absolutely hilarious film which is a testament to what a filmmaker can achieve if he has a very small budget and a first-rate script. It is without a doubt the best ultra low budget film that I have seen, putting even The Blair Witch Project to shame. I shall be looking for ways to work I'm not even supposed to be here today! into conversation from now on. I would try with other lines from the film but sadly many of the best ones cannot be repeated in polite society! Impolite society is another matter entirely.

The way in which his investigation leads him to these findings and the formulation of a highly unconventional plan to end the killings, provides Fallen with its extremely offbeat plot. This well-written story begins very colourfully in a way that raises a lot of questions and then proceeds through the investigation stage before reaching it brilliantly twisted conclusion.Having been responsible for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas), Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) visits him on death row immediately prior to his execution. Reese's behaviour at this time is rather strange as he thrusts his hand out strongly to shake hands with Hobbes and sets him a riddle to solve. He then talks loudly in ancient Syrian Aramaic and later, in the gas chamber, loudly sings Time Is On My Side until he can't anymore.A little while later, Hobbes has to investigate a further series of murders which are carried out in the same style as those committed by Reese and a clue he finds at one of the crime scenes leads him to research the case of a well-respected detective from his department who, 30 years earlier, had committed suicide at a remote woodland cabin after being accused of crimes he didn't commit. Hobbes' research leads him to the detective's daughter, Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) who's a theology professor. She's initially very reluctant to talk but confirms that her father took his own life because of incriminating evidence against him which he felt he wouldn't be able to disprove.When Hobbes visits the cabin where Milano had killed himself, he finds the name Azazel written on one of the walls and Gretta later confirms that it refers to a fallen angel who, after being cast out of heaven, had been made formless as a punishment and could only continue to exist in the bodies of others. The demon's ability to pass from body to body simply by touch made it extremely dangerous and impossible to stop. Hobbes begins to realise that he's actually in a dual against a very formidable adversary who's determined to destroy him and so, when evidence starts to appear which implicates Hobbes in the murders he's investigating, he knows that he's rapidly being put in the same situation that detective Milano had been in and so devises a scheme to outwit the demon and bring a permanent end to the havoc he wreaks.Denzel Washington is very natural and believable as the decent detective who has never taken a bribe in his career and believes that cops are the chosen people. This extremely rational man remains typically methodical and professional as he pursues what turns out to be a supernatural serial killer and is confident that his approach will eventually enable him to put a stop to the demon's killing spree. John Goodman, James Gandolfini and Donald Sutherland all do well as Hobbes' police colleagues and Elias Koteas makes a powerful impression in his role which gives him tremendous scope to display his abilities.Thrillers which include the type of subject matter featured in Fallen often resort to sensationalism, gratuitous violence and endings that use some previously unknown piece of information to bring matters to a close.

At least not in a long shot. But, his films are very good, if not, great or good. Frequently, most of his movies are focus on some of the concepts that were conceived from the films of Alfred Hitchcock. In the film Obsession, De Palma takes on Hitchcock once again after making his third feature film, Sisters, which was released three years ago.In 1959, Michael Courtland, (Cliff Robertson), an wealthy New Orleans businessman, is celebrating his 10th wedding anniversary with his beautiful wife, Elizabeth, (Genevieve Bujold). But, as the night ends, his life is about to turn upside down. Kidnappers have took his wife and his daughter, Amy. The kidnappers demanded Michael to pay the ransom. He does come up with the money. But, the kidnapping ends in tragedy when his wife and daughter are killed in a car explosion.Fast forward to 1975. Courtland and his business partner, (John Lithgow), travel to Florence to look at a job. Courtland is still grieving about the loss of his dead wife and daughter. At Florence, he visits the same church that he and Elizabeth got married. Inside the church, he finds out that the person working inside the church is his dead wife! But, how did she survived the explosion in 1959?A lot of critics complained that Obsession is a complete rip off of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, Vertigo. But, there's a catch. Rip offs are done in a poor taste to be failure. Obsession is not a rip off of Hitchcock's Vertigo. But certainly, Brian De Palma does know how to shoot a well made mystery thriller. This is a man who loves movie-making. And like his other movies such as Dressed to Kill and Blow Out, he knows how to shoot certain scenes that build suspense or create tension between characters. Characters that we are interested in watching.The movie isn't a great one, but it is worth seeing if you are a fan of De Palma or fans of Hitchcockian thrillers. Cliff Robertson does a good job of playing the grief stricken Michael as well as a man infatuated by his wife. There even several good scenes where Michael seems to follow his wife around Florence. What makes those scenes work and maybe the entire movie work is that the music score by Bernard Herrmann is very appropriate to empathizes the sorrow and mystery of Michael's obsession. He is a man of certainty and will follow his mind and especially his heart by solving this complicated mystery that ends in a unexpected manner. I won't reveal to you how it all ends. See it for yourself.Another person who should receive credit and someone who I really think stole the movie from Robertson and Lithgow is Genevieve Bujold. I really like her in this movie as Robertson's wife. She is not like any other movie actress I saw. Her character is played as a smart and intelligent woman who uses her wit and her charm to move the movie's story along. She also have a way of bringing the movie to life and propelling us into this mystery. This is a good stylish thriller that does have some double crosses and twists. De Palma uses his style of filmmaking to make the movie works on a technical level. On a storytelling level, it does have little plot holes. But, De Palma is able to deliver a strong thriller that does works so beautifully and mysteriously. ★★★ 3 stars.

Like the Count Bullingdon says in the movie, he's a common opportunist, and it's kind of amazing he succeeded as well as he did. Barry gave little to the world&#x97; only took. He lied when convenient, and abandoned when the going got tough. Even when he might have righted his course and made something of himself, Barry ducked out to chase more exciting (though less legitimate) prospects. As I get older, it becomes impossible to sympathize with the character, and yet the film about him seems no less great, no less significant.Stanley Kubrick's directorial follow-up to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (after a failed attempt to make a feature based on Napoleon) offers little of the visceral excitement of the previous movie, and even less of the cosmic significance of the one before that (1968's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY), but is nevertheless one of the legendary director's great films. BARRY LYNDON is based on an 1844 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, charting the development (and eventual demise) of a young upstart originally known as Redmond Barry&#x97; from his humble beginnings as a dim-witted Irish country boy, to his misadventures in English high society. How Barry gets from one place to the other is the plot of the movie, and as much as I cringe at the character's various life decisions, Kubrick's pacing (and gorgeous period imagery) keeps me glued into this movie throughout its generous duration.Since the movie is so well made, it's easier to forgive the fact that the title character is basically a scourge to society. Ryan O'Neal's Barry is a mildly charming parasite, offering no real concession to endearment to the audience (or his fictional peers), other than a vague, naive charisma, and occasional personal victories along the way to ruin. I don't feel particularly bad spoiling that Barry's end is a tragic one, because Kubrick's arc for the movie is almost precisely 50% rise and 50% fall, which means a brutal, extended descent for viewers. Maybe you have to be a misanthrope to really love this movie, or maybe it's just fun to watch people fail so spectacularly. Either way, the film succeeds in spite of its downwardly spiraling story.Big wins for this movie include - Good acting. O'Neal has sometimes been criticized for his performance (including suspect Irish accent), but in my view, he plays Barry very well, right down to the s**t-eating, vacant charm. Hardy Kruger (as the Prussian Captain Potsdorf) is also great, and in the scenes between his character and O'Neal's, comes off as both very intelligent, and equally open to ambiguous corruption. Very Kubrick, really, and the entire cast serves its purpose to a tee. - Great cinematography. Famously, Kubrick used only lighting that would have been possible in the late 18th Century, which means candle-lit shots and gorgeous, widescreen landscapes of England and Ireland. - Great period score, including pieces by Handel, Vivaldi and traditional Irish folk music played by the Chieftans. Handel's Sarabande in particular features so heavily in the film as to seem a supporting characterThings about BARRY LYNDON that *might* make it hard to love - Not only is O'Neal's Barry not smart or particularly interesting, he's also not well-liked. Most of the movie finds him succeeding through sheer dumb luck or opportunism, while his observers notice and (justifiably) resent his fate. Barry's not even a good underdog, because he gets MANY chances to right his way, but manages to screw them all up. - It's a long movie, 3 Hours, 4 minutes. And it's a slow one too, though that could be considered one of its strengths, if you consider how close to period Kubrick tried to make this movie. Still, as a viewer, you need to be in this for the long haul if you want to extract its charms.All of that said, I've loved BARRY LYNDON from the first time I saw it. Of course, I'm a Kubrick fan, and his senses of pacing and sly, black humor are all over the film. His movies (discounting anything starring Kirk Douglas) don't typically offer heroic protagonists, and this one's no different. The magic is in the exquisitely dark story, and of course, the beauty of the visuals and music. I rank this movie behind only 2001 and PATHS OF GLORY in Kubrick's canon, and recommend it whole-heartedly to neophyte Kubrick fans, or anyone into great black comedy.

Like the Count Bullingdon says in the movie, he's a common opportunist, and it's kind of amazing he succeeded as well as he did. Barry gave little to the world&#x97; only took. He lied when convenient, and abandoned when the going got tough. Even when he might have righted his course and made something of himself, Barry ducked out to chase more exciting (though less legitimate) prospects. As I get older, it becomes impossible to sympathize with the character, and yet the film about him seems no less great, no less significant.Stanley Kubrick's directorial follow-up to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (after a failed attempt to make a feature based on Napoleon) offers little of the visceral excitement of the previous movie, and even less of the cosmic significance of the one before that (1968's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY), but is nevertheless one of the legendary director's great films. BARRY LYNDON is based on an 1844 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, charting the development (and eventual demise) of a young upstart originally known as Redmond Barry&#x97; from his humble beginnings as a dim-witted Irish country boy, to his misadventures in English high society. How Barry gets from one place to the other is the plot of the movie, and as much as I cringe at the character's various life decisions, Kubrick's pacing (and gorgeous period imagery) keeps me glued into this movie throughout its generous duration.Since the movie is so well made, it's easier to forgive the fact that the title character is basically a scourge to society. Ryan O'Neal's Barry is a mildly charming parasite, offering no real concession to endearment to the audience (or his fictional peers), other than a vague, naive charisma, and occasional personal victories along the way to ruin. I don't feel particularly bad spoiling that Barry's end is a tragic one, because Kubrick's arc for the movie is almost precisely 50% rise and 50% fall, which means a brutal, extended descent for viewers. Maybe you have to be a misanthrope to really love this movie, or maybe it's just fun to watch people fail so spectacularly. Either way, the film succeeds in spite of its downwardly spiraling story.Big wins for this movie include - Good acting. O'Neal has sometimes been criticized for his performance (including suspect Irish accent), but in my view, he plays Barry very well, right down to the s**t-eating, vacant charm. Hardy Kruger (as the Prussian Captain Potsdorf) is also great, and in the scenes between his character and O'Neal's, comes off as both very intelligent, and equally open to ambiguous corruption.

Right from the start, its washed-out colour palette effectively evokes the classic film noir look and the addition of a world-weary narration also contributes to the rather ominous atmosphere of the piece.Predictably, for a revenge thriller, there's plenty of action, violence and explosions and a whole gallery of colourful characters that include gangsters, prostitutes and crooked cops. The dialogue is also brilliant throughout and ranges from a typically hardboiled voice-over to some darkly humorous one-liners.Following a heist in which some Chinese gangsters were relieved of $140,000, Porter (Mel Gibson) is betrayed by his two accomplices when his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) shoots him in the back, leaves him for dead and takes off with his partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) and all the loot. After having bullets removed from his back by a whisky-drinking doctor and taking five months to recuperate, Porter sets out for revenge and to recover his cut from the heist which amounts to $70,000. His mission is complicated however, because soon after he traces his drug-addicted wife, she dies from a heroin overdose and then he learns that Resnick is unable to pay up because he'd needed $130,000 to repay a debt he owed to a crime syndicate known as the outfit.With the help of Rosie (Maria Bello), an outfit-connected call girl for whom he used to act as a driver and bodyguard, Porter then pursues the repayment of his money with incredible determination and despite being beaten up and tortured at different stages, remains totally single-minded as he confronts a whole series of the outfit's mobsters. Inevitably, his endeavours eventually bring him into a confrontation with the outfit's top man who's the only one who actually has the authority to repay him but, of course, has no intention of doing so, especially after Porter kidnaps his son.Porter, who's only known by his surname throughout the whole movie, is introduced as a despicable anti-hero who steals money from a street beggar, picks the pocket of a random man in the street and steals cigarettes from a woman who works in a diner. He's regarded as insane by all the mobsters who think that the risks he takes in pursuit of a mere $70,000 are absurd. He obviously sees things differently though because, in his mind, what he's doing involves a matter of principle and this provides the movie with a running joke as, at various times, members of the outfit talk about making higher payments only for Porter to reiterate that the sum he's pursuing is just the $70,000.Mel Gibson is well-suited to his role as he's convincingly tough and violent but also adds a certain tongue-in-cheek quality which distinguishes his performance from that of Lee Marvin's in Point Blank. The rest of the cast is also very good with Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and William Devane all standing out and Lucy Lui absolutely sensational as a highly-enthusiastic, leather-clad dominatrix whose sudden outbursts of violence are both physically impressive and comical at the same time.Payback is visually strong, nicely paced and features some well-executed action sequences. It's thoroughly entertaining from start to finish and despite not reaching the standards set in John Boorman's original, is enjoyable, full of atmosphere and well worth watching.

For what it's worth, I will say that it is humbling to have your life dictated by some machine. We have freed ourselves from many of Mother Nature's restrictions, but in their place, we have built ourselves gods of steel and microchips. I wonder if that's an improvement.Anyway, as a person with (hopefully) more talent than the real Ed Wood, I hereby present this review of this cult classic by Tim Burton. Burton is a strange director for me; while I like most of his films, I do not absolutely love any. Some of you might think this has something to do with my not liking his style, but in fact that is my favorite thing about him. I like Batman Returns over Batman for specifically that reason; they gave him freer rain in the former, and he used it to carve out his own unique style. The closest thing he has to a great film in my book, Edward Scissorhands, is also the most flush with his handiwork.If you are like me, and you love his style, make sure to check out this one. Despite being an ostensibly 'real world' movie, no one else could have made this movie. Perhaps no one else could have even made an Ed Wood film, or at least a good one; Burton, for whatever he may lack in pure cinematic skill, he more than makes up for in his ability to portray the complexities of dark and twisted, but well-meaning men.This film flopped at the box office, and predictably so; people are used to the creepy reveries of Burton, but this is a whole different sort of weird and bizarre a realer, more disturbing sort. And from a pure financial sense, who on the planet wants to see the guy who made Beetlejuice and Batman direct a film about an infamously bad director? Seriously; no one, kid or adult, male or female, who is not a serious film-goer or Burtonite, would ever go see this on their free time. Thankfully, it spread over time and now has gotten the cult love it deserves, the cult love it was perhaps always destined for.I am perhaps more intrigued by this film than I am a fan of it. I feel more down-the-rabbit-hole here than I ever did watching Burton's mediocre adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Ed Wood seems like the sort of man who I would eavesdrop on while pretending to listen to music, so interesting is his weird life. Despite the face that his flaws are evident, you can't help but like him. Depp (not yet a frequent Burton collaborator) portrays him as a man with no talent but a lot of heart, who kept going towards his vision no matter what the system or the world or reality seemed to shove in his face. As a writer, I can't say that this didn't have an impact on me, this dedication towards your dreams for as long as you may live. He is by no means a figure to be looked up to, but he is a figure to be respected.The intro, where you are introduced to the film by a B-movie monster, is campily spectacular and sets the tone for the film. Now, if only it had done more to live up to that tone in the first third, which is slow and a bit limp. The other two thirds are better, but the film does fade sometimes, specifically during the filming sections. Ed is more of an interesting person than he ever was as a lousy filmmaker. And there are parts that are a little mish-mashed some of the sections have too much dialogue, others too little.But through these flaws, it keeps you intrigued. I picture a younger version of myself turning the pages in a giant Gothic storybook, wanting to know what's next. The performances are stellar. Howard Shore's score is not LOTR-caliber, but it is sneakily ambient. And Burton, like Ed, made sure to do it his way.

Perhaps no one else could have even made an Ed Wood film, or at least a good one; Burton, for whatever he may lack in pure cinematic skill, he more than makes up for in his ability to portray the complexities of dark and twisted, but well-meaning men.This film flopped at the box office, and predictably so; people are used to the creepy reveries of Burton, but this is a whole different sort of weird and bizarre a realer, more disturbing sort. And from a pure financial sense, who on the planet wants to see the guy who made Beetlejuice and Batman direct a film about an infamously bad director? Seriously; no one, kid or adult, male or female, who is not a serious film-goer or Burtonite, would ever go see this on their free time. Thankfully, it spread over time and now has gotten the cult love it deserves, the cult love it was perhaps always destined for.I am perhaps more intrigued by this film than I am a fan of it. I feel more down-the-rabbit-hole here than I ever did watching Burton's mediocre adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Ed Wood seems like the sort of man who I would eavesdrop on while pretending to listen to music, so interesting is his weird life. Despite the face that his flaws are evident, you can't help but like him. Depp (not yet a frequent Burton collaborator) portrays him as a man with no talent but a lot of heart, who kept going towards his vision no matter what the system or the world or reality seemed to shove in his face. As a writer, I can't say that this didn't have an impact on me, this dedication towards your dreams for as long as you may live. He is by no means a figure to be looked up to, but he is a figure to be respected.The intro, where you are introduced to the film by a B-movie monster, is campily spectacular and sets the tone for the film. Now, if only it had done more to live up to that tone in the first third, which is slow and a bit limp. The other two thirds are better, but the film does fade sometimes, specifically during the filming sections. Ed is more of an interesting person than he ever was as a lousy filmmaker. And there are parts that are a little mish-mashed some of the sections have too much dialogue, others too little.But through these flaws, it keeps you intrigued. I picture a younger version of myself turning the pages in a giant Gothic storybook, wanting to know what's next. The performances are stellar. Howard Shore's score is not LOTR-caliber, but it is sneakily ambient. And Burton, like Ed, made sure to do it his way.

For what it's worth, I will say that it is humbling to have your life dictated by some machine. We have freed ourselves from many of Mother Nature's restrictions, but in their place, we have built ourselves gods of steel and microchips. I wonder if that's an improvement.Anyway, as a person with (hopefully) more talent than the real Ed Wood, I hereby present this review of this cult classic by Tim Burton. Burton is a strange director for me; while I like most of his films, I do not absolutely love any. Some of you might think this has something to do with my not liking his style, but in fact that is my favorite thing about him. I like Batman Returns over Batman for specifically that reason; they gave him freer rain in the former, and he used it to carve out his own unique style.

That film had a very low budget and a fantastic script whereas this film has a much larger budget ($6million) and an incredibly mediocre script. It seems like a watered down version of Clerks in that the dialogue is nowhere near as witty or well observed (though it tries to be) and T.S., Brodie, Rene and Gwen are basically the poor man's Dante, Randal, Veronica and Caitlin. I had heard that many people found it disappointing but I went in an open mind, only to find out that they were right. When Smith guest starred in Degrassi The Next Generation, he poked fun at the film's poor reception in dialogue that he wrote himself. Caitlin Ryan tells him that this is her favourite Kevin Smith film and he replies, You're lying. 'Mallrats' is no one's favourite Kevin Smith film. I just hope that the sequel MallBrats is better than this.On the bright side, Jason Lee is quite funny as Brodie and has most of the good lines but he could have been so much funnier with better material. The same goes for Michael Rooker as Svenning and Jason Mewes and Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, the only returning characters from Clerks in spite of numerous references to it. Jeremy London is likable as T.S. but the character doesn't have much of a personality and is a far less effective straight man to Brodie than Dante was to Randal. Ethan Suplee's subplot as Willam goes nowhere very slowly. Claire Forlani has been much better elsewhere while Joey Lauren Adams deserved more screen time. Shannen Doherty is simply forgettable as Rene but Ben Affleck is quite good as Shannon Hamilton. My favourite scene in the film is when Stan Lee gives the completely starstruck Brodie romantic advice but that is more of a sweet scene than a funny one.
