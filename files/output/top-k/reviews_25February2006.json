They're completely myopic. Go somewhere else and spew your nonsense! This movie is wonderful..its only flaw is that it was too short. I could have watched these characters navigate through this first date another hour. The only scene that didn't draw me in as much, though at least served as some sort of bridge to reveal that Jackie actually accomplished something that her date hasn't (yet? perhaps, but unlikely), is the one in which she read her story. I didn't like the story at all, though it may have tried to reveal that her character had some painful memories in her life to work out...we don't really know. Nonetheless, I loved this film. The awkwardness in the beginning of their conversation, after he first arrives at her apartment, especially on her part, and the revelation at the end of his character were both very touching. Moreover, I loved the ending. ***Spoiler to come*** Once he unleashes his burden by revealing what he does reveal about himself to her, he is ready to continue their conversation, more or less, and ask her out on a second date. I loved her reaction, in turn. They're both hurt, lonely people, and want to tread cautiously with this relationship, each at different points in the film.I very highly recommend this film if you're interested in delving into a character's psyche. If you need a loud soundtrack, goo-goo eyes, and a really happy ending, this is not the film for you. It takes place in one apartment the entire length of the film (and I love the apartment, its blue hues and its simplicity of design, even though it is really small...you just imagine her small lonely life, but sort of marvel that she gets up every morning and goes to work every day, and keeps afloat).The music used in the opening and at the end is great as well, which Tom Noonan composed. I wish I could find the soundtrack. It's a great little film that I've been watching very frequently lately. I only wish it were longer. Or, maybe Noonan should do what Ethan Hawke did with Before Sunrise, and make a sequel, ten years later. Do these characters still work at the same firm? Are they dating? Do they have separate lives altogether but happen to run into each other one day? Does he salvage himself to any degree? I'd love to see each of their stories and how they may or may not intertwine again.

All the characters are great, and the story is very good as well, plus Christian Bale is simply incredible in this!. It's not overly graphic, but it still has many disturbing scenes, and while I have never read the book, I really enjoyed this movie, plus the ending is especially good, and will really make you think. While the performances were all very good, Bale carries the movie, as he played Patrick Bateman perfectly, and actually managed to give me the creeps, and I thought it was very well made and written as well, plus I also liked how unpredictable it was. The phone call Patrick made to his lawyer, was somewhat funny but also very disturbing at the same time, and I also found his obsession with music to be quite fascinating, plus I loved the dialog as well. All the characters are extremely likable, and Reese Witherspoon is a lot of fun as Patrick's whiny girlfriend Evelyn, plus everyone was perfectly casted. This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale, I highly recommend this one!.The Direction is great!. Mary Harron does a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles, adding some good atmosphere, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace.There is a little bit of gore, it is disturbing but not overly graphic. We get a person killed with a chainsaw (off screen), bloody bodies,severed head in a freezer, Axe in the face (off screen), gunshot wounds, and a bit of blood.The Acting is outstanding!. Christian Bale is amazing as always and is incredible here, he truly is Patrick Bateman, he is chilling, creepy, likable in a weird sort of way, played insane incredibly well, was extremely intense, was simply fascinating to watch, and could have totally went OTT, but he Didn't,this is truly a dynamic performance! (Bale Rules!!!!!!!). Chloë Sevigny is very beautiful, and gives a charming performance here, she played it very simple and it worked, I really liked her, she is an underrated actress. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always, and is brilliant in her role as Evelyn, I know her character is supposed to be annoying but I actually found her to be hilarious, especially her crying scene in the restaurant with Bale, sadly she Doesen't get enough screen time. (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Josh Lucas does what he has to do very well I liked him, he is a great actor. Justin Theroux is OK with what he had to do which was not much. Samantha Mathis is cute, and does fine as Courtney, I liked her. Willem Dafoe is excellent as always, and here is no different he has a small but great role here, and as always had commanding screen presence (Dafoe Rules!!). Jared Leto is good as the pretty boy and was quite convincing. Cara Seymour is fine as the hooker, I felt sorry for her. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1\/2 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale!.

Though he gets conned into backing the experiment and that's only if he can supervise the project, so it doesn't happen again. The experiment is going quite well, up until later on when Phillippe finds out his mischievous assistant has betrayed him, as he's secretly selling the idea of the teleportation device to another backer. So, to stop the word getting out, his assistant provides him with the same fate that his father had fought. Now, it's a race against time for Francois and Inspector Beecham to save Phillippe from the same aftermath of his father.Right of the back of the original film, comes a rather quickie of a sequel that doesn't push any limits. Firstly, no way does it come close to the superior original, but as an automatic b-grade monster feature, it's provides enough rollicking fun. Well, when you got Price on show, how can you go wrong? What we get is a bland story structure that lacks an ounce of life and astuteness, though it does have a few inspired moments, but these are far and in between many inferior sequences that come off just plain ordinary with some confusing plot details. The original managed to work around the silly context, but here it tends accept it by working in laughable story turns and monster effects. Even the dialog seems more like schlock, without the savvy and witty dialog that made the first film naturally engaging. The performances are all but cold and lifeless, but with the obvious exception of Vincent Price. He just has a spellbinding presence that when the words roll of his tongue, it has a Shakespearean vibe, no matter how bad the lines were. Price's performance is definitely this film's anchor. The rest of the characters I didn't care for, as they are rather unsympathetic and foolish.There was just more attention to fabricating unpleasant and cheap thrills, which are more out of control with a monster out for revenge hook-line. It's more violent than its predecessor too. I give it credit that it's more exciting in its basic dementia of its creation, but hell the treatment of the story and effects were laughable. That's unintentionally, though. This one seems more serious, but it's outlandishly executed in a drab fashion. But ironically everything works out in the long run with a happy ending for all&#133; well for the good guys. Now the effects are decent, but when it came to the fly's head on the human body. Why was it that huge!? It looks stupid! Sure, it looks even more hideous, but you got to be kidding, it was funny watching the guy running along while holding onto it, so it doesn't fall off. You could easily tell the guy was having trouble with it, even so when walking! They really out did themselves on that one.Another note was that the pacing is rather brisk, gladly. Also it does provide slight dose of suspense and atmosphere, but more so it's preoccupied in its second-rate chills and mayhem instead. The flick is shot in black and white, and it does look rather sharp and crisp in detail. Plus there's some showy photography and framework that adds a bit more creative eye to the wailing production. The story's actions on this occasion were just too ridiculous to take seriously with it getting more risible the further it goes, but it seems pretty unaware to all of that.It's not all that bad, but the quality is replaced by big chunks of camp that's more interested in wowing us with ludicrous action, rather then the strain it has on the characters and their relationships.

Now, it's a race against time for Francois and Inspector Beecham to save Phillippe from the same aftermath of his father.Right of the back of the original film, comes a rather quickie of a sequel that doesn't push any limits. Firstly, no way does it come close to the superior original, but as an automatic b-grade monster feature, it's provides enough rollicking fun. Well, when you got Price on show, how can you go wrong? What we get is a bland story structure that lacks an ounce of life and astuteness, though it does have a few inspired moments, but these are far and in between many inferior sequences that come off just plain ordinary with some confusing plot details. The original managed to work around the silly context, but here it tends accept it by working in laughable story turns and monster effects. Even the dialog seems more like schlock, without the savvy and witty dialog that made the first film naturally engaging. The performances are all but cold and lifeless, but with the obvious exception of Vincent Price. He just has a spellbinding presence that when the words roll of his tongue, it has a Shakespearean vibe, no matter how bad the lines were. Price's performance is definitely this film's anchor. The rest of the characters I didn't care for, as they are rather unsympathetic and foolish.There was just more attention to fabricating unpleasant and cheap thrills, which are more out of control with a monster out for revenge hook-line. It's more violent than its predecessor too. I give it credit that it's more exciting in its basic dementia of its creation, but hell the treatment of the story and effects were laughable. That's unintentionally, though. This one seems more serious, but it's outlandishly executed in a drab fashion. But ironically everything works out in the long run with a happy ending for all&#133; well for the good guys. Now the effects are decent, but when it came to the fly's head on the human body. Why was it that huge!? It looks stupid! Sure, it looks even more hideous, but you got to be kidding, it was funny watching the guy running along while holding onto it, so it doesn't fall off. You could easily tell the guy was having trouble with it, even so when walking! They really out did themselves on that one.Another note was that the pacing is rather brisk, gladly. Also it does provide slight dose of suspense and atmosphere, but more so it's preoccupied in its second-rate chills and mayhem instead. The flick is shot in black and white, and it does look rather sharp and crisp in detail. Plus there's some showy photography and framework that adds a bit more creative eye to the wailing production. The story's actions on this occasion were just too ridiculous to take seriously with it getting more risible the further it goes, but it seems pretty unaware to all of that.It's not all that bad, but the quality is replaced by big chunks of camp that's more interested in wowing us with ludicrous action, rather then the strain it has on the characters and their relationships. Still, there's b-grade fun to be had here.

The proportions of a movie shown then were much more like a standard TV screen rather than the long rectangle shape of wide screen. The proportions you see now on the DVD are the ORIGINAL proportions shown in the first version.In the 1950's, wide screen cinema became a standard since movies were now competing with TV and had to have something extra to bring people back to the theatres. That is when wide screen filming started. Then, for decades, those films were chopped on their sides to fit a TV screen.In the case of Gone With the Wind, though, to show it wide screen when it was re-released in the 1950's and 1960's, the original print had its TOP and a bit of the BOTTOM chopped to make it stretch. A lot of scenery was lost... for example, when Scarlett is in the train depot to try and find a doctor for Melanie, a lot of the scope of the shot is actually lost in wide screen since the top of the shot is discarded.These prints also tended to look washed out compared to the original prints since the film had to be blown up to fit a big screen. So, to conclude, although it may seem like you are getting less with the non-wide screen version of this film, you are actually getting more, and better than many people saw for decades.As for the movie&#133; definitely in my top ten movies. It used to be my #1, but as I got older, it slipped a bit. Not because it's a bad film, but because it's very primal, very direct, which I'm sure has been a big part of its appeal through the years, especially to younger fans.People are given to say this movie is a soap opera. I accepted this, until I noticed pretty much every movie with a female lead character gets dismissed as a soap opera from people who, unconsciously or not, don't see a film as being serious unless a man is the lead and focus.Also, so many women are portrayed (especially on TV) as one dimensional. There is an abundance on US TV of perfect mommies\/wives without unsightly tummy bulge and who are always one step ahead of bumbling daddy. There's also the stereotype of the business bitch that is either cold and ruthless or stunted and subdued&#133;. And she's almost always shown as a perfect wife\/mommy just waiting to happen&#133;.There are very few women characters who are not portrayed as a saint or a whore, even now, in our politically correct era.Gone With the Wind was decades ahead of its time in its portrayal of a woman trying to survive in a hostile world who is not evil, not saintly, but just a person trying to make it. She's not smart enough in some ways, and very smart in others&#133; just like the rest of us.People also say it's a bigoted film and its attitude is destructive. Yes and no to this one. Yes, Margaret Mitchell was a conventional white, southern woman of her time with all the good and bad that suggests. She was a bigot. So were the people who made this film. HOWEVER, if you watch this and are either so; 1. Weak minded it makes you into a bigot, or 2. You are already a bigot and think this is super-accurate history and every African American was thrilled to be a slave, then you have issues way beyond what this film could possibly address.A sensible, rational person takes this film and realizes it represents attitudes which are not acceptable. They also see that a change of thought on the subject of race does not mean we erase and forget anything that smacks of it because once you forget history, it does tend to repeat.To sum it up&#133; there's a truly interesting female lead. There is an unconventional love story that ends in an unconventional way, even for our day and age. And there is an outdated P.O.V. of a minority which may disturb some, but unfortunately is accurate for its time.

There's also the stereotype of the business bitch that is either cold and ruthless or stunted and subdued&#133;. And she's almost always shown as a perfect wife\/mommy just waiting to happen&#133;.There are very few women characters who are not portrayed as a saint or a whore, even now, in our politically correct era.Gone With the Wind was decades ahead of its time in its portrayal of a woman trying to survive in a hostile world who is not evil, not saintly, but just a person trying to make it. She's not smart enough in some ways, and very smart in others&#133; just like the rest of us.People also say it's a bigoted film and its attitude is destructive. Yes and no to this one. Yes, Margaret Mitchell was a conventional white, southern woman of her time with all the good and bad that suggests. She was a bigot. So were the people who made this film. HOWEVER, if you watch this and are either so; 1. Weak minded it makes you into a bigot, or 2. You are already a bigot and think this is super-accurate history and every African American was thrilled to be a slave, then you have issues way beyond what this film could possibly address.A sensible, rational person takes this film and realizes it represents attitudes which are not acceptable. They also see that a change of thought on the subject of race does not mean we erase and forget anything that smacks of it because once you forget history, it does tend to repeat.To sum it up&#133; there's a truly interesting female lead. There is an unconventional love story that ends in an unconventional way, even for our day and age. And there is an outdated P.O.V. of a minority which may disturb some, but unfortunately is accurate for its time.

The proportions of a movie shown then were much more like a standard TV screen rather than the long rectangle shape of wide screen. The proportions you see now on the DVD are the ORIGINAL proportions shown in the first version.In the 1950's, wide screen cinema became a standard since movies were now competing with TV and had to have something extra to bring people back to the theatres. That is when wide screen filming started. Then, for decades, those films were chopped on their sides to fit a TV screen.In the case of Gone With the Wind, though, to show it wide screen when it was re-released in the 1950's and 1960's, the original print had its TOP and a bit of the BOTTOM chopped to make it stretch. A lot of scenery was lost... for example, when Scarlett is in the train depot to try and find a doctor for Melanie, a lot of the scope of the shot is actually lost in wide screen since the top of the shot is discarded.These prints also tended to look washed out compared to the original prints since the film had to be blown up to fit a big screen. So, to conclude, although it may seem like you are getting less with the non-wide screen version of this film, you are actually getting more, and better than many people saw for decades.As for the movie&#133; definitely in my top ten movies. It used to be my #1, but as I got older, it slipped a bit. Not because it's a bad film, but because it's very primal, very direct, which I'm sure has been a big part of its appeal through the years, especially to younger fans.People are given to say this movie is a soap opera. I accepted this, until I noticed pretty much every movie with a female lead character gets dismissed as a soap opera from people who, unconsciously or not, don't see a film as being serious unless a man is the lead and focus.Also, so many women are portrayed (especially on TV) as one dimensional.

Gene Hackman is fantastic in his role, and I thought Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn had very good chemistry together, plus the finale is extremely suspenseful and tense. It's very well written and made, and while patience is required at times, it's never boring, and always engaging, plus Holly Hunter is terrific in her role. It will always keep you guessing throughout, and it's also quite creative as well, plus Sydney Pollack has another excellent film that he can add to his resume. It had some exciting chase scenes, and this role is ideally made for Cruise, plus I liked the ending as well. This should be higher then 6.6 in my opinion, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise and Ed Harris had some brilliant and intense scenes together. This is an excellent thriller, that's very suspenseful and involving, with a great story, and superb performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Sydney Pollack does an excellent job! here, with awesome camera work, great angles and just keeping the film suspenseful and at a very engrossing pace. The Acting is top notch!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, as always had tons of charisma, had a role that was ideally made for him (a cocky young hot shot lawyer), was focused, had very good chemistry with Tripplehorn, was fantastic in the action scenes, and he can add another brilliant performance here to add to his resume as well!

Jeanne Tripplehorn is very solid here as Cruise's wife, she is pretty likable, and did a very good job, it was actually rather difficult role, and she pulled it off just fine, I really liked her. Gene Hackman is fantastic here, he had an unpredictable character, was likable, and as usual didn't know what to expect from him, he was just perfect for this role. Hal Holbrook does what he has to do well, and added class. Ed Harris is brilliant in his role here, he had some seriously awesome scenes with Cruise, as they were one of the true highlights of the film, he had a great role!, I loved him. Holly Hunter is top notch here, she deserved her Oscar, and really impressed me a lot. David Strathairn is good as Cruise's brother, I dug him.

I haven't seen a movie that depressed me(In a good way) this much since Million Dollar Baby, and the chemistry Cage and Shue had was phenomenal, plus Cage truly deserved his Oscar, as Shue definitely should have gotten one as well, in my opinion. It's also a brilliant tragic love story, and this is extremely well made and written as well, plus you will really feel for Cage's character trust me. The ending is very sad, but very well done,and I was seriously on the brink of tears, plus this will really leave you thinking long after you have finished watching it. I was really rooting for Cage's character to get help, and believe it or not it actually has a few humorous moments surprisingly! plus the scene where Cage flips out at the casino really got to me good. This truly should be in the top 250 in my opinion, and you will also feel plenty of sympathy for Shue's character Sera as well, plus I found it really sad how Cage's alcoholism got her and Shue kicked out of the casino and that hotel. Julian Sands plays another wonderfully bizarre character, and it's very very unpredictable throughout, plus I truly believed Ben and Sera loved each other, just all the stuff and emotion they went through together. I love Drama's so naturally I expected a masterpiece going into this, well I got that and even more, and the dialog is just brilliant, plus I can't believe they snubbed this film at the Oscars.

The basic premise is that Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman) comes back home from school in the East as a scholarship winner. His parents, friends and relatives all believe that he is a young man of substance with a great future ahead. To avoid a party that his parents held for his triumphant return he reluctantly drives back Mrs Robinson (Anne Bankroft)to her home. She seduces him and they have a summer affair. However, he falls in love with her daughter Elaine Robinson and that is when the fun and games truly begin.For me the most fascinating part of the film is the way in which Benjamin violently rejects the pigeon holed view of the future that his elders have in mind for him. He is from a wealthy family and the American Dream is their for the taking as long as he continues on the right path. I think he realises that he cannot become a person in his right right until he has some experiences on the wrong path. Halfway, through the film there is a scene where he just lays in his parents pool doing nothing other than waiting for his next sordid night with Mrs Robinson. The music by Simon and Garfunkel is a perfect aid to help illustrate the lack of direction and purpose that Benjamin is feeling.Through his parents insistence he is forced to take out Elaine Robinson at the express forbidding of Mrs Robinson. He strikes a relationship with Elaine and is willing to forget about his affair with her mother. However, Mrs Robinson does all that she can to keep them apart. This includes sending Elain to Berkely, alleging that she was raped by Benjamin and setting up a quick marriage for Elain, to a young man she met at college.This is the moment that Benjamin's lack of direction, purpose and lethargy disappear and he knows what he really wants in life. He pursues Elaine to Berkely University and lets no obstacle get in his way to gain her love and companionship. This involves many hilarious scenes and especially the crazy ending which is totally unbelievable but fun none the less.Dustin Hoffman Puts in a solid performance as the misdirected young man trying to find his place in the world. However, the star of the show is Anne Bancroft as the bored housewife posing as a super confident, stylish and refined mature lady. Although in reality she was only six years older than Hoffman, she was able to convey far more experience and worldliness, to make it believable that she was old enough to have been Benjamin's mother.This film is a true classic as it has stood the test of time and in my humble opinion will continue to stand the test of time.

The George Gershwin music track and black and white cinematography of the great city of New York are compelling cinema, in this unique work of late 20th century art. An amazing movie but, despite being alarming funny, it is so very sad. Is it Woody's aim as a filmmaker to make the audience laugh and cry at the same time? Perhaps. Woody is very clever, but he is no genius, and because he thinks he is, this is downfall. Regardless, Manhattan is a truly great film.Once again Diane Keaton is Woody's straight woman amongst shtick, and in this cinema she is heartbreakingly beautiful. Her cheekbones rise and fall to new heights and lows, and her lyrical voice and disarming gestures are frankly hard not to fall in love with. But Diane is not alone as cast in this fascinating film, as there are many other supportive actors and actresses in this story, all very good, and all necessary to tell the story.The story is about a TV script writer, played by Woody, that tires of the mundane and phony grind of the everyday. He is admired by New York's culture for being intellectual and witty, but he can't take the phoniness of it anymore and quits his job to pen the great American novel. Of course, without money, or a job, a man is a bum, and this eats away at the Allen character.Within the thread of this brilliant film is a tall tiny fragile flower. A 17 year old girl that has a serious infatuation with the 42 year old Woody character. Telling is a moment of dialog in this film, when Diane Keaton's character asks this young girlfriend, Tracy was her name, what she does, and she innocently and primly says I go to High School. This sets a sort of tone to the emotional end to this film. This young girl was portrayed with a sad and final very hard bitten lesson, by a young actress with an ethereal beauty in one Mariel Hemingway. And finally I can't omit, an ex-wife of Woody's character, playing a lesbian, an act that is so very out of character, in a very early role, of one stunning blond in Meryl Streep.The final chapter in this very good story is about that young afore mentioned High School girl. When Mariel, as Tracy, implores, and looks at the imploring heel played by Woody, and says, You really hurt me, this little line says it all. Young people should not mix around with the old, because it is the old that controls the emotion of love. I know that all too well having had to deal with age differences in relationships. But still . . .To really experience this movie, and the failure of human relationships contained within, is to imagine you are Tracy, the young girl acted, aptly, and so very sadly by Mariel Hemingway. She breaks my heart every time in black and white weeping. It is how I view this film and when I feel her hurt, I really take in this experience, and I feel young, but betrayed by love and age.This film is a 1970's period piece. Manhattan's sky line is old. The cars are relics. The human relationships are a cliché of that era. That is, except, for the love that the young Tracy feels for Woody Allen's character Isaac. And through all the weaving in and out of lies, cheating, and what could be, it is the young woman's love, for an older man, that is brought forth as true. Woody realizes this almost too late, but you have that feeling, that that spring and fall relationship will not work. Because in the end, it is the young girl who grows up, illustrating the immaturity of Woody's character.

Grant brings along Billy (Alessandro Nivola) because the whole coming along thing was his idea to begin with. They never showed this part, but that didn't bother me.

Keep in mind that scientists aren't sure if they were quadruped or biped, due to uncertainty about the weight of the sail. They could've been that way. As for the raptors&#151;don't get me started on those. On all three, the raptor is portrayed as being big--which they aren't. Deinonychus is.Anyway, this movie isn't as bad as anyone says. It definitely has its parts, some of which are funny. Go watch it.

I was told that it really sucked, but I beg to differ. It doesn't suck, although it's not the best--it's good in parts.Paul and Amanda Kirby (Macy and Leoni) are a seemingly rich couple who hire Alan Grant (Neill) to give them a tour of the island. Little does he know, though, that they really want him to help find their son, that they're not as rich as they say, and that their son is on the island he never went to. Danger lurks on the island, ready to leap out at them and have them for dinner&#151;including the mighty new creature that wasn't on the other island a spinosaurus.(Funny line from Grant about not getting paid&#151;made me think of the first movie, and the amount Hammond paid him.) Grant brings along Billy (Alessandro Nivola) because the whole coming along thing was his idea to begin with. They never showed this part, but that didn't bother me. I was just glad that Billy gets to go. Without him, the movie would've been less exciting.Two or three others go with them, which are eaten one by one.

Others claim the title to be inspired by true events. Stone attempts to do the former, but ends up doing the latter. This is a good movie. An idealistic man tried to unravel the conspiracy of the assassination of a president, and ends up being thwarted by the conspirators at every step as they cover up their tracks. Stone is a very good director and this movie is no exception. The historical accuracy of this film has been debated by very knowledgeable and passionate people, and I've read enough to find its credibility lacking, so I am judging this movie as a work of historical fiction - inspired by true events. The death of JFK was taken as a shattering of the myth of Camelot, the end of the 20 years after WW2 when America reigned supreme and basked under the sun of its military and economic might. Stone plays upon this sentiment very well, presenting us with a series of what if's focusing on what would happen if JFK had lives. An idyllic utopia in which there was no Vietnam, where civil rights miraculously spread across the land, and several other unrealistic, but very appealing notions. As a Vietnam veteran, one can understand Stone's passion in making this movie. Its rather obvious that he associates the death of JFK with the start of events that led him to a series of unpleasant events in his life. Just as one mourns the death of a child because of the potential and hopes of the future, so we mourn the death of JFK based on notions of what could have been. Whether or not JFK could have accomplished these things is another matter, but we can hold this belief inside that had he lived things would have been better. Stone plays for his audience and his time very well. The Cold War had just ended, and we no longer needed the same government that kept the Evil Empire at bay. Documents became declassified, and there was an overall backlash against the shadowy government - X-files, alien autopsy reports, etc. It was not difficult for Stone to feed upon this climate of distrust of the government in presenting his conclusions in a very appealing manner. There is no proof because the conspirators destroyed the truth. For a public just finding out a lot of the things that its government did during the Cold War that was subsequently kept quiet, the killing and cover-up of a president seemed very realistic. As a piece of storytelling, this movie is great. It sucks you in and keeps going at a mounting pace until its eventual climax where all is revealed, and nothing is proved. As a piece of political propaganda its a masterpiece, and should be studied by every filmmaker and politician as how to take disjointed facts and coincidences and twist them together to paint a compelling story that the public would love to swallow up. Did these events happen as shown on the screen? Its possible. Stone himself admits he took dramatic license in several events, which, if you are trying to show a factual and historical story pretty much kills your credibility from the beginning. More and more time has passed for any one of this apparent legion of conspirators to come forth and make a deathbed confession, and so the veil of conspiracy and cover-up wears thinner and thinner with each passing day. Surely Cancer Man must be getting tired eliminating witness after witness, document after document. Watch the movie, think about it. There is plenty more to learn about what happened outside the movie, the JFK movie board itself, and the links provided in and of themselves will provide you with more information that you can imagine. But in the end, this is just a movie - inspired by true events.
