They're even more awesome when you think about the budget of this film. $75 million, which is certainly a lot, but in Hollywood, not so much. That's also half the budget of X-Men Origins Wolverine.Veteran actors Patrick Stewart (of Star Trek TNG fame) and Ian McKellen (of Lord of the Rings fame) each deliver great roles, while (at that time) newcomers Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, and James Marsden each bring tons of charisma. Anna Paquin, who is the youngest Oscar winner of all time, isn't limited as Rogue My final word is that this is a fast paced film that you can watch over and over without getting old.10\/10!

Star Trek IV The Voyage Home is arguably the greatest Trek. It is the most popular Star Trek film (not including the 2009 reboot). Before the reboot, it was the only Trek to gross over $100 million domestically, plus it was extremely well received by critics and fans alike. It surpassed every expectation that it had set up for itself, simply because it is the funniest and most light hearted Trek.The best part is the interactions between the characters. Yes, the film was nominated for 4 Oscars (once again, the most of any Trek) including best effects, but the effects aren't the best part. It was the success of this film that convinced Paramount Television to give a spin-off series a shot. As you probably know, TNG, DS9, STV, and STE were all very successful, and they were the result of a chain reaction which started with the success of The Voyage Home.The film also noted Leonard Nimoy as a top-notch comic director. This won him the job of directing Three Men and a Baby.If you like Star Trek, this is definitely the film for you. Everyone else? Just research the characters a bit and I'm sure that you'll have a good time.This film earned its money and its acclaim. It features many classic moments (Spock mind-melding with the whale, Scotty talking to the computer, Kirk using colourful metaphors to handle an angry cabbie, Spock using the nerve pinch on a punk on the bus, Kirk and Spock arguing over their preferred foods, and that's just scratching the surface!).10\/10 A Sci-Fi Comedy along the quality of Ghostbusters, MIB, and Back to the Future!

It was so sad and heartbreaking when you see all the cruel things the Jews had to go through, but at the same time very uplifting when you see how far one man is willing to go to save these Jews. Especially when you see how he cries his heart out when he learns that he could have saved one more life by putting her name on the list (the maid\/servant that Goethe liked, I think?) I had previously seen a few Holocaust movies, particularly liking The Pianist, but Schindler's List has much more of an emotional depth and impact on you when you watch it. For instance, when the two guards took away the old man with one arm, I knew he would be shot, but even when I saw it, I was still horrified as if I didn't know. To think that this really happened, and for so long, makes me believe that the only possible reason God allowed this to happen, is to show us good people how to defeat true evil and to make sure that it never happens again. I liked the color scheme, especially with the girl in the red coat. I saw her just almost waltzing through the liquidation, minding her own business, and the whole time I was thinking, How is she doing this? Is she even real? Or is she just a figment of Schindler's imagination meant to represent how the Jews will persevere through all this horror? I thought at first that Schindler looked like sorta a bad guy how all he was concerned with was making money rather than saving lives. But after seeing all the burning bodies being carted out, he had the ever-important pang of conscience. The rest is history. I believe that Spielberg has created something that can never be matched in ours or any lifetime. I wish I could personally meet him and shake his hand and say, Thank you for making Schindler's List. It's a real eye opener into human perseverance, be it in trying to survive (Jews) or in trying to save as many lives as possible (Schindler). This is one instance where the movie was FAR FAR better than the book, which I have read and will re-read. That 3 hours it took to witness flew right by for me, and I will be forever happy that I took those 3 hours to see it. Steven Spielberg will forever more be remembered for some of his other masterpieces like ET and Jaws, but I will always remember him for Schindler's List.

The plot's about nude dancers, so I guess in a way it's functional but dear God, no more. When you're not seeing breasts, they're being discussed or at least mentioned, in case you briefly forgot they existed. Also somewhere along the way a morbidly obese woman claims she's had a wart on her vagina. It's just a really solid screenplay. Writer Joe Eszterhas tries his best to give his characters some depth, and by depth I mean nude scenes. Sure, there's something about Nomi having a bad childhood, but really, Eszterhas himself doesn't even seem to care. This doesn't mean the movie is without merits though, because it does capture how sordid Las Vegas (presumably) is. Every scene is bathing is a very nasty atmosphere, which I can only assume is the point. Also, some scenes are just so hilariously awful they're way more entertaining than movies that are actually good (the sex scene!). This movie is bad, but I had no problems with watching the entire thing.
