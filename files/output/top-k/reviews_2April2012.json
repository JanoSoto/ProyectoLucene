I won't describe it here partly because it would spoil the fun of future viewers and partly because it would take too much time and space. In my opinion the great quality of this movie are its characters. If you watch it closely you'll notice that although it deals a lot in a fantastic environment the characters are very realistic. There are no good guys and bad guys. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is in a particular position because of his\/her past and experience. i believe that all the actors do their best and the result is more than satisfying.The other strong point of this movie is the relationships between the characters. Love, hate, friendship, abandonment and rejection continually change places and mark the lives of all the heroes. It could be a love story but as it often happens in real life true love is most of the times hidden and silent. This movie also treats death as a form of catharsis and redemption, the way most great tragedies do.You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the fight scenes. I thought so. I won't say anything about them because i believe that people should see this movie for the movie and not for the fx.Someone said that if this was a Hollywood movie everyone would be ranting against it. I would like to add that if this was a Hollywood movie  firstly it would have won the Oscar and secondly it wouldn't have captured the true eastern philosophy. It would turn out to be another martial-arts-great-sfx-but-no-meaning movie and i think that Wo hu zang long is a lot more that that.

Less than more recent comedies. Is it still funny anyway? Another yes. Is it really the funniest American comedy? It sure is one of them. Is it the best? Well, according to the American Film Institute it is. Let's get to the point now, Billy Wilder's screwball classic is not the greatest American comedy because it's the funniest, but just because it's one of the most classic among the funniest (and vice-versa). You might find Airplane! or Animal House funnier, or have a fondness for the wisecracking humor of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks, unless you're one of these purists who believe that nothing can beat the Silent Era pioneers, or that Woody Allen is the king of Comedy. Hell, it's also your right to find Sandler or Ferrell funnier. However, this is one comedy that will reconcile all these tastes. Comedy is probably as old as Cinema, and that providing laughs was the first premise of filmmaking when the special effects were still missing. Some Like it Hot is right in the middle of Comedy's chronological map, old enough to be a classic, and modern enough to keep all its appeal toward modern audience. The film opens in the Prohibition days, in Chicago, paying tribute to classics such as Scarface, The Public Enemy and Little Caesar with a fitting role for George Raft, as the story bad guy Spats Domino. The plot &#x96;do I need to describe it? - involves a bass player, Jack Lemmon as Jerry, and a saxophonist, Tony Curtis as Joe, who accidentally witness a shooting that is a reminiscence of the infamous St Valentine's Day Massacre. They disguise themselves as women to be hired in a female band going to Florida. Meanwhile in the train, they meet Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, a sweet, naive and idealistic ukulele player.If the film's setting pays tribute to old Hollywood, the content is incredibly fresh and subversive in the way it portrays women from two average Joes' point of views as sensual and sexual objects of desire. Jerry's comment on Sugar's voluptuous body while she walks at the train station and reference to Jelly-O springs is so full of lust when it concludes by It's a whole different sex. The film plays with cross-dressing and gender comedy with the perfect dosage of naughtiness and innocence. The part where Sugar is in the same bed as Joe aka Daphne and he keeps repeating in himself he's a man gives you an idea about the kind of reaction he's having, being in bed with such a beautiful instrument player. Along with Anatomy of a Murder and Psycho, Some Like it Hot is one of the most defining examples. Of the agonizing days of Censorship, hell, I would have never thought I would hear the word 'frigid' coming from Marilyn's mouth.But beyond its modern tone, Some Like it Hot is mostly carried by two top-notch performances from the two leads and two stroke of genius in the casting of Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, and Joe E. Brown as the old billionaire who falls in love with Daphne in Florida. Sugar has this naivety and sweet tenderness that wouldn't have been believable if another actress played that part. Marilyn embodied this kind of personality, trusting men, victim of their lies and promises, but what lead to her demise in real-life is used for a much happier ending here. Still, there is something poignant in the way Sugar trusts the two girls, but the film never keeps that in a mean-spirited tone, especially since it's a matter of life and death for Joe and Jerry and since, Joe E. Brown steals the show in every single scene to incarnate the kind of comeuppances Jerry needed for his exuberant behavior. Some Like it Hot is punctuated by countless iconic scenes, from Monroe playing her ukulele and singing Runnin' Wild to her I Wanna be Loved by You song, we're both fascinated by Monroe's sex appeal and Joe and Jerry's struggle to keep theirs intact. And the story doesn't take its plot for granted but adds a supplementary twist by introducing another romance between Jerry and Sugar. Jerry exploits Osgood's crush on Jerry to disguise himself as a 'harmless' billionaire, inviting Sugar in Osgood's yacht while the owner is dancing a frenetic tango with his sweetheart. The way the subplots interact between the last confrontation with Spats Domino is cleverly handled and plays as a fantastic tribute to Wilder's clever writing. Yet even before the last five minutes, the film is funny without having this little thing that elevates it above all the other comedies.Many comedic films end with the conventional happy ending or the resolution, it might have a final gag or a funny bit, but hardly the highlight of the film. Some Like it Hot follow the principles of the greatest jokes, it can drag a long, be averagely funny, even annoying, but if the pay-off is hilarious, the joke works. Movie endings can redeem any film, but this applies even more for comedies. And in Some Like it Hot, not only the ending is one of the greatest of any film, but if you pay attention to the dialog between Daphne and Osgood, it works as a summary of everything that went before, and the last dialog couldn't have worked without all what happened.We all know that Daphne will sooner or later remove his wig and reveal his identity as Joe did with Sugar, but Osgood seems so casual about that the final line must be a killer, the strike of the film, its triumph, and on that level, Wilder did it again, after Norma's close-up, Well, nobody's perfect are three distinct words that differentiated a funny screwball comedy to a perfect classic.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"2 April 2012","score":"","review":" Is Some Like it Hot as funny as its reputation implies? Yes, sir. Has it aged a little? Less than more recent comedies. Is it still funny anyway? Another yes. Is it really the funniest American comedy? It sure is one of them. Is it the best? Well, according to the American Film Institute it is. Let's get to the point now, Billy Wilder's screwball classic is not the greatest American comedy because it's the funniest, but just because it's one of the most classic among the funniest (and vice-versa). You might find Airplane! or Animal House funnier, or have a fondness for the wisecracking humor of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks, unless you're one of these purists who believe that nothing can beat the Silent Era pioneers, or that Woody Allen is the king of Comedy. Hell, it's also your right to find Sandler or Ferrell funnier. However, this is one comedy that will reconcile all these tastes. Comedy is probably as old as Cinema, and that providing laughs was the first premise of filmmaking when the special effects were still missing. Some Like it Hot is right in the middle of Comedy's chronological map, old enough to be a classic, and modern enough to keep all its appeal toward modern audience. The film opens in the Prohibition days, in Chicago, paying tribute to classics such as Scarface, The Public Enemy and Little Caesar with a fitting role for George Raft, as the story bad guy Spats Domino. The plot &#x96;do I need to describe it? - involves a bass player, Jack Lemmon as Jerry, and a saxophonist, Tony Curtis as Joe, who accidentally witness a shooting that is a reminiscence of the infamous St Valentine's Day Massacre. They disguise themselves as women to be hired in a female band going to Florida. Meanwhile in the train, they meet Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, a sweet, naive and idealistic ukulele player.If the film's setting pays tribute to old Hollywood, the content is incredibly fresh and subversive in the way it portrays women from two average Joes' point of views as sensual and sexual objects of desire. Jerry's comment on Sugar's voluptuous body while she walks at the train station and reference to Jelly-O springs is so full of lust when it concludes by It's a whole different sex. The film plays with cross-dressing and gender comedy with the perfect dosage of naughtiness and innocence. The part where Sugar is in the same bed as Joe aka Daphne and he keeps repeating in himself he's a man gives you an idea about the kind of reaction he's having, being in bed with such a beautiful instrument player. Along with Anatomy of a Murder and Psycho, Some Like it Hot is one of the most defining examples. Of the agonizing days of Censorship, hell, I would have never thought I would hear the word 'frigid' coming from Marilyn's mouth.But beyond its modern tone, Some Like it Hot is mostly carried by two top-notch performances from the two leads and two stroke of genius in the casting of Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, and Joe E. Brown as the old billionaire who falls in love with Daphne in Florida. Sugar has this naivety and sweet tenderness that wouldn't have been believable if another actress played that part. Marilyn embodied this kind of personality, trusting men, victim of their lies and promises, but what lead to her demise in real-life is used for a much happier ending here. Still, there is something poignant in the way Sugar trusts the two girls, but the film never keeps that in a mean-spirited tone, especially since it's a matter of life and death for Joe and Jerry and since, Joe E. Brown steals the show in every single scene to incarnate the kind of comeuppances Jerry needed for his exuberant behavior. Some Like it Hot is punctuated by countless iconic scenes, from Monroe playing her ukulele and singing Runnin' Wild to her I Wanna be Loved by You song, we're both fascinated by Monroe's sex appeal and Joe and Jerry's struggle to keep theirs intact. And the story doesn't take its plot for granted but adds a supplementary twist by introducing another romance between Jerry and Sugar. Jerry exploits Osgood's crush on Jerry to disguise himself as a 'harmless' billionaire, inviting Sugar in Osgood's yacht while the owner is dancing a frenetic tango with his sweetheart.

Except for the thunderstorm scene, this was a great movie! The opening scene with Julie Andrews dancing through the Alps singing the title song still brings tears of joy to my eyes! They just don't make movies like this anymore. Even my grandmother loved it.Since this was filmed over in Austria, I always wondered how they filmed those thunderstorm scenes. Did they go out in an actual thunderstorm and film this? I also read that it did rain in Austria while they were over there filming this.I finally got the answer to that question no. The interior shots were filmed at the 20th Century Fox studios in Hollywood. The first scene filmed was where Liesl (played by Charmian Carr) was coming in from a thunderstorm, with her dress all wet and dirty from the rain, and climbed into Maria's bedroom window. (She was outside in the gazebo with Rolf, played by Daniel Truitte, when it started to rain, and they ran into the gazebo.) Anyway, they sprayed Charmian Carr with water several times and she had to be wetted down for every take.Sadly, they just don't make movies like this anymore. Today's films are simply filled of sex, violence, and cursing. The Sound of Music was a huge success at the box office, and is still a timeless classic!

And perhaps, in the case of Malik, perhaps not. With this, The Thin Red Line, just what is the man trying to do?It is, by turns, part post-modern war movie, South Sea travelogue, art house something-or-other and even touches on your actual straight-down-the-line gung-ho shoot-em-up before it reminds itself of its pacifist motivation and resorts to art house something-or-other. The technical term for The Thin Red Line is 'a mess' and that is putting it charitably. In another review I warned of the incessant, remorseless wall-to-wall sentimental soundtrack which does its very best to manipulate the feelings and thus the judgment of the viewer, and that warning applies to this film, too. I can best describe the soundtrack as chocolate box church music meets Joe Schmaltz and his Touchy-Feely All-Stars. And that description, too, is somewhat charitable, and for a film of this length - 163 minutes - I suspect the soundtrack composer was paid by the hour.I must confess that I was well on the point of throwing in the towel after about 20 minutes. Someone once said of Richard Wagner that after hearing his music for half an hour, you look at your watch and realise only five minutes have passed. Malik seems to share that same affliction in The Thin Red Line. But I took into account the director's current reputation and decided to stick it out. I could, I told myself, be missing something and Malik deserved an honest hearing. As it turned out, I wasn't and he didn't.I was stumped right from the off by a rather long shot of an alligator\/crocodile entering a river and slowly sinking beneath the water. Significant or not? Well, to be honest, I don't know, although as that, or another, alligator\/croc turns up in the film for no particularly good reason several hours later, tied to a plank in the back of a truck and surrounded by battle-weary troops on an R&R break, the odds are surely on 'significant'. But don't ask me how or in what way.There followed quite a long digression (it, too, seemed longer than it probably was) of two squaddies relaxing with and relating to a village of South Sea islanders - paddling in the sea, being friendly with the locals, poetically musing on nature, you know, that kind of thing - before the navy show up and we realise the two have gone AWOL. Once interned to the ship's hold, it is then we are led to believe that the film will finally get going. And it does in a kind of way, but, well, not really. One young farm lad confesses to the sergeant that he's scared, another steals a pistol, a third reveals that he was once an officer but was busted to private - Malik is almost in danger of becoming conventional but confirmed cineastes will know full well there's no danger of that. So on it goes.At one point Nick Nolte does a 'is this man mad or just really, really committed' act, but the film isn't about that, either. Gorgeous George Clooney even puts in an appearance as the captain replacing the 'good man' unjustly sent home in disgrace, but after earning his million or two salary for the very brief guest spot, he, too, disappears.What were you trying to do, Mr Malik? Tell us, because I sure as hell don't know. Were you honestly trying to inform us that 'war is bad'? Are you really still not convinced we don't know that? And what was with all the, to my ears insufferably trite, cod 'deep' insights intoned every ten minutes or so in voice-over? Here are three random examples 'War doesn't ennoble men, it poisons the soul'; 'Love? Where does it come from?'; and 'What's keeping us from reaching out and touching the glory?'

There are well-directed action war sequences which would not disgrace any steak and potatoes action film, but after all the cod philosophising and insights it should seem obvious that Malik is not in the least bit interested in that kind of cinematic titillation. If anyone reading this wants to hear at first hand just how nasty and dehumanising war is, forgot about watching a confused and confusing Malik opus and simply ask your grandfather, father, uncle or brother.For this viewer at least Malik's The Thin Red Line is not just not a masterpiece, it is dangerously close to being an insulting piece of self-indulgence. Malik has a duty to provide us with, at least, the means and context to try to understand what he is attempting to do.

But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, You wouldn't believe how this land has changed. The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie.

But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, You wouldn't believe how this land has changed. The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land.

However, this movie was a bit different, I actually enjoyed it. This was an old time musical which I expected to be boring and never to end. This movie wasn't like that all, it was full of vibrant colors, great comedy, and bold characters; which whom had versatile acts. I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to the very end. Everything just fell in place; I wasn't confused or stuck on what was happening. Like most musicals I watch, I become confuse and lost into what I'm watching. Maybe because I become so overwhelmed with the singing, I forget what's going on in the movie, Lol. Although this movie was a musical, I actually enjoyed it and thought all the songs that were sung were pretty catchy.

What I did see i sort of enjoyed, being as young as I was, and being ignorant of the comics, I had no idea how wrong this was. I can give multiple examples of why this movie failed.1. Ice Puns 2. Bat Nipples 3. Bat Butt 4. Bat Crotch 5. Bat Credit Card 6. Bane Screwed-up beyond all recognition 7. Batman and Robin were prepared to fight Freeze before they even knew he existed 8. Bane's idiocy puts the Hulk to shame 9. Redeeming Freeze at the end 10. Batgirl is Alfred's niece, not Gordon's daughter. 11. The Ice-Suits, and so much more.this movie was absolutely horrible. When i got older, I enjoyed Batman for what Batman is. He is a dark hero, Batman is a Dark comic book. Everything is dark. This was campy. 95% of the movie comprised of CGI. Joel Schumacher should be ashamed for what he did to Batman. Batman was saved When Christopher Nolan swooped in, and saved the once great hero and made Batman Begins. Much better than Schumachers proposed fifth film Batman Triumphant would've been.
