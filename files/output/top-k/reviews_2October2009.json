I had heard about the movie a while before then, but didn't get interested in it watching until recently. A friend mentioned having watched it to me, so I decided to watch it. It was like nothing I had ever seen. It was also the strangest movie I have ever seen, yet one of the most original. I admire David Lynch for this achievement.While looking on IMDb I noticed that the opinions on this film were mixed, ranging from a masterpiece, to a waste of time, and boring. It could indeed be argued that Eraserhead is a masterpiece. Many reviewers said the movie was hard to understand, or that it had no plot, or that it didn't make any sense. I think the film will make sense, if you pay attention to it closely and analyze it.That's the thing about Eraserhead; unlike almost any other movie, it challenges the comprehension of the viewer. There were a few very puzzling scenes but apart from that I understood Eraserhead. I think these peculiar scenes, that leave the viewer scratching his head, are best how they are. Not everything in this movie is supposed to make sense, and some of it isn't going to; its going to weird you out. I mean, a lot of movies have weird scenes. Some have very weird scenes.Eraserhead takes the cake. It's just downright weird. A lot of scenes may be disturbing, but if a weird scene make no sense, it's going to be even more disturbing. That's part of what I liked about Eraserhead. I also believe the film does have a plot, and a pretty good one. It is just an abstract one. The plot of an abstract film is going to be very different from that of a normal film; viewers should understand this. Just because a plot is different or odd, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.The film does start off very slow, but it picks up after that and delves into the story of the movie. I also noticed that some reviewers said that this movie is better if you don't classify it as a movie but instead as art. Well, I wouldn't go that far. No matter what you call it, it's still a movie. Now, for the story of Eraserhead. Eraserhead is primarily a surreal tale of a taciturn man living in an apartment in a barren town, who is coping with bad insomnia one night, because of his newly born mutant baby, and his cumbersome wife.Now for how he got in these circumstances, he usually keeps to himself, but he is invited to a dinner. He decides to attend this dinner, where he meets some friends. He eats with about four other people. It is there that he finds he has impregnated one of them, and she has delivered the baby. He is also informed that the baby is premature, which is presumably why it is mutant. He experiences a lot of visions during this night. I call them visions, but some could just be nightmares. Others are supposedly happening in real life.It is in these scenes, where the viewers may find themselves lost. It's really not that difficult to tell which is which though. Eraserhead does start off very slowly, but it gets better and better. I would recommend it, if you are interested. I would not recommend this movie to someone just because you are a horror movie fan; however. Eraserhead is sometimes classified as a surreal horror, which is true, but in this case a surreal horror is a completely different animal from a horror. I am myself a horror fan, who liked this movie, but I think part of that is because I really like surrealism. I can see a lot of horror fans disliking it. Eraserhead is a very good film for its genre. I would recommend it to any one who likes surrealism.

At that time Virginia Madsen caught my attention with her seductive look and the put on southern accent. To avoid embarrassment I would record the movie secretly without my parents knowing, so I could watch it in my private time. It was one of those movies that generated so much curiosity within me. After countless repeated viewings this has been one of my cult favourite noir movies of the 90s. It gets better each time of watching. The sultry feeling that the movie evokes is very addictive to anyone who understands this genre of cinema.The veteran actor Dennis Hopper jumped on the directing saddle for this movie. The man has dazzled all of us with his great foray of diverse roles that he played over the years. As his number of directed projects is limited, this is clearly one of his movies that stand out of the crowd. 'Colours' was brilliant too, being his second best. Hopper's style of direction is nothing special, however he has proved that he can direct. This movie is very reminiscent of the classic 40s and 50s cinemas at the time when original thinking and creativity was on the horizon. That era has been more of an inspiration for todays filmmakers. 'The Hot Spot is a classic example of a novel adaptation by Charles William Smith, originally titled 'hell hath no fury'. I cannot compare the two as I have not read the novel.The movie has the perfect setting to tell a story of unsavoury characters who are not what they may seem.

Patience is a virtue. The background score is just perfect nd does not resort to using melodramatic music. There are constant usage of heavy sounds which make a good enough impact.

The characters are not interesting what so ever, and the character that doesn't seem like cardboard gets killed off fairly early in the movie. I don't know why David Fincher decided to go this direction, cause it doesn't add anything by getting rid of a character that stands out the most from a group of convicted skin heads. It also disappoints the fans of Aliens cause it shows everything that Ripley worked for adds up to nothing, by the beginning and the end of this movie. They tried to make Ripley seem like a Christ figure somewhat, but that all goes down the drain cause this time she is the one that starts the whole mess, and the convict that gets angry at her for that reason has every right to get angry.

I don't think I have to add any more praise for Terry O'Quinn's performance to what's already been said in these reviews and IMDb user comments. He is indeed effective in the calmer scenes and those scenes where his true menace comes out. I also liked the fact that his character was written to be very smart (though not 100% perfect) - this made his character more chilling, since a smart menace is more frightening than a dumb one. The screenplay and direction have a number of subtle touches that help keep your interest. The violent sequences are more realistic than you usually get in a movie like this.But the movie is not perfect. Here are the bad things about it. I thought the electronic musical score was not only too '80s, but intrusive at times - many creepy scenes would have worked better with subdued or no music at all. I also thought it hard to believe that O'Quinn's character could be settled in a new life (with a new family) in just a year. (Two years maybe... but ONE year?) Also, there's somewhat less focus on O'Quinn's character than you may think. Showing more of this character - his needs and wants, his struggles, etc. - would have been more interesting (and add a more creepy feel to the movie, I suspect.) Still, the movie is worth seeing overall. I don't regret the buck I spent to buy my copy. And I'm pretty sure that this movie will turn out to be a lot better than the upcoming remake.

Yes, James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2 Judgment Day' due to his own success, as well as the cult following part one had. But, he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original, interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward, excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded, and it did, tenfold.

And while I have never read the book itself, I can still say that this is one of the best films associated with both King and De Palma.Carrie is the story of a shy girl who is bullied in high school. She has telekinetic powers that seem to be connected in some way with her progression into womanhood. Her religiously fanatical mother dangerously over-protects her from the wider world. Things then take an unexpected turn when Carrie is invited to the prom by one of the popular boys from the school.Firstly, let me say that I find this film absolutely heartbreaking. It rips me apart emotionally every time I watch it. To say the least, this is not what you expect to happen when watching a horror movie. Much of the reason for this is down to the performance of Sissy Spacek. A more delicate and nuanced presentation of a troubled and bullied young girl you will have difficulty finding. She is perfectly cast. You would have to have a heart of stone not to want happiness for this girl. Another significant performer is William Katt. He too is excellent and is a highly likable presence; the romantic developments between these two characters are extremely touching and genuine. Forgetting the horror element for a moment, Carrie works brilliantly as a heart-warming coming-of-age drama. So much so, that every time I see it, I dread the horrific finale in the school. I just want this girl to be happy. By the end of this movie I feel emotionally drained. Although many horror films end in a pessimistic way, the manner in which events in Carrie are built up and then ripped apart is incredibly cruel and carry an unusually high emotional impact.Stylistically, as is typical for De Palma, this is a great looking film. The widescreen format is used beautifully throughout but the cinematic style is truly taken to the fore in the final showdown in the school. De Palma's combination of split-screen photography and jump cuts really accentuates that scene. It's a mesmerizing sequence that does not disappoint. If I had to voice a minor quibble about the movie it would be regarding the soundtrack. In a couple of the lighter scenes it's cheesy in a horrible way and later it unfortunately resorts to shrill Psycho-esquire strings when Carrie uses her telekinetic powers. This latter factor, along with the use of the 'Bates School' name, are the type of Hitchcockian references that De Palma has become notorious for. However, aside from this, Carrie is not an obvious ode to the master of suspense and should not be thought of as such.Overall, this is a great film. Aside from Spacek and Katt, Piper Laurie is also excellent here, in what is a film full of strong performances. The exemplary acting contributes to the strong dramatic impact of Carrie, and this allied with De Palma's mastery of cinematic style, means that this is a film of a very high calibre. Effective horror films to tend to work on the emotions, as they play on our inner fears. Carrie is no different in this. But what sets this film apart from so many of its contemporaries is that it is not only about that, it's also about adolescence, loneliness and bullying. It might even make you cry.

Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be.

I just cannot comprehend this idea. The Rescuers was an exceptionally well-made movie, with a strong plot and an unforgettable visual style. Out of the Disney movies that aren't heavyweight classics, it's one of the studio's very best. The Rescuers Down Under is often gorgeous to look at. But it's not by any means half the movie the original was.The good stuff in Down Under is obvious. The three dimensional landscapes, the effect shots, the good voice cast and the wonderful music all create a movie that LOOKS and SOUNDS just absolutely great. It's a spectacle to watch the many sequences taking place in the air, the eagle flight in the opening and that mindblowing descent into a blizzardy New York City from the albatross. It takes your breath away every time. It is the very anti-thesis to the first movie, which was mellow and low-key, which used an almost eerie silence during a lot of dramatic events and had very few action scenes at all. As an adventure movie, Down Under is often a treat.But there are many things with the movie that bothers me a lot. The first film was dark and atmospheric, even poetic at times. I know it's going to sound strange but I find the movie is too kid friendly. It's not that a Disney movie shouldn't welcome it's target audience, it's just that I get the feeling the movie is really taking the kids for granted, rather than working in their service. There is something so redundant and automatic with the plot of this movie. A generic boy with no greater character traits (other than being a morally correct role model) is captured by a big evil poacher McLeach, wonderfully voiced by George C. Scott, driving around in an elaborately huge war-machine and living in a big, evil looking, home-made hunting lair (we learn he is wanted.... you'd think he'd be more discreet!). To the rescue are Bernard and Bianca, who are introduced with a slapstick scene where Bernard tries to get back the wedding ring he tries to present to Bianca. The thing about The international Rescue Aid Society, which served as a big and great introduction scene in the first movie, is over within less than a minute. In a movie 74 minutes long, couldn't we at least get that catchy rescue song? But were not wasting time in the 90's, we hurry off to Australia where we get a great character in Jake, the Australian kangaroo, but he gets almost nothing to do in the movie (though he surely serves as a good toy for McDonald's). Meanwhile, the kid in McLeach's lair also meet some new characters as it turns out that McLeach holds several animals captive in his basement. We get a few lines from a grumpy koala, and a few from a very well mannered kangaroo, but most of the attention goes to an obnoxious lizard that I don't recall at all from my childhood. It's one of those obligatory comic relief characters that they think will amuse the kids, and I don't know, maybe they do. But I still think it's annoying to give so much screen time to a stupid and annoying lizard when they could have made something memorable, with proper character. The swamp folks in the original Rescuers were more like adults (albeit drinking rednecks, but who's perfect right?) and if memorable comic reliefs is your bag, the silent firefly Evinrude was unforgettable. The most memorable sidekick in this movie is Joanna, the dumb iguana of McLeach's. She is most fittingly a follower to the eels in The Little Mermaid and a precursor to the hyenas in The Lion King and she is both funny, well drawn and have a strong character (unlike many of the other characters in this movie). McLeach is also a good, if a little standard, villain.The movie wraps itself up pretty quickly and the plot is lazy, automatic and doesn't even believe in itself - we MUST have, I suppose, a comic relief sidestory involving John Candy's albatross. It does not serve the story of the movie at all, but I suspect the film makers didn't have any ideas, so they just threw in these hysterical scenes to make a couple of minutes pass. What made the first movie so good, besides that it too was gorgeous to watch, was that it had a plot that held up. One girl trapped in a scary swamp. Two detective mice getting closer to actually finding her within an actual investigation (in Down Under that's not even a problem, as said they don't waste time). One flight to Devil's Bay, one team-up with the girl, one scheme, one evil lady and two crocodiles, some swamp people, scary pivotal scene in a cave, finale with fireworks, all ends well. It's a great movie! In Down Under the mice act just so that the movie can continue until it ends, meanwhile giving us great stuff to look at, some comic relief and some tension that is generic and un-original. Get this The movie doesn't even have the interest to show a reunion between the boy and his mother! This despite the fact that we learn his dad has died and that the police take the boy for dead too. Down Under tells its story sloppy and automatic.Even so, it's an entertaining film, mostly due to it's great looks. But it does feel calculated and soulless in comparison to The Rescuers, which was a genuine, original and actually pretty bold animated movie that didn't take kids for granted and made a movie that anyone can enjoy to fullest degree.

Terry O'Quinn has the title role of a psychopath who makes a habit of marrying widows\/divorcées with children and trying to forcibly conform them into his personally idealized 1950s Father Knows Best view of how families act and then getting homicidal when they fail to meet his lofty expectations. The film opens in the bloody aftermath of his last failed family before he then alters his appearance to go trolling for his next set of family\/victims. We next see our family man comfortably ensconced in the lives of Shelly Hack and her troubled daughter Jill Schoelen. Hack is oblivious, but Schoelen is pretty sure that there is something not right about her stepfather and her suspicions are more than likely to elicit O'Quinn's homicidal tendencies. Made before and missing the light comical flourishes of Scream, the film takes itself in dead earnestness. Unfortunately, for all its seriousness, the film follows familiar notes by rote and never elicits any surprise or suspense, and emerges as merely an unpleasant viewing experience. One scene where O'Quinn brutally attacks and murders the nice guy guidance counselor of his teenage daughter is particularly cringe-worthy, but in much the same way that an especially gory scene from Friday the 13th would elicit that response. It also does not help that the performances are so flat and elicit limited sympathy. Hack is so dim and unwitting that she seems cut from the same Stepford mold as her psycho hubby. Our sympathy should rest with Schoelen, who gives the best performance in the film, but there is something very remote about her acting that prevents us from truly embracing her character. O'Quinn's much ballyhooed performance is a hot mess. He is not a looker and there is nothing charming or appealing about his faux personas to make us understand why one woman, much less a slew of them, would fall into his net and succumb to marriage, especially bringing along families who harbor suspicions about him. His range in the role is laughably limited and he fails to either provide someone so appalling that we would root against him or to elicit any sympathy for a mentally ill man desperate for the perfect family. Given that I am also not a fan of his strained performance in Lost, I am undoubtedly in the minority here. One would think that with the subsequent emergence of the frothing family values crowd in the US that the film would take on a certain relevance, but even such after-the-fact parallels fails to elevate this to a higher level.

Hack is oblivious, but Schoelen is pretty sure that there is something not right about her stepfather and her suspicions are more than likely to elicit O'Quinn's homicidal tendencies. Made before and missing the light comical flourishes of Scream, the film takes itself in dead earnestness. Unfortunately, for all its seriousness, the film follows familiar notes by rote and never elicits any surprise or suspense, and emerges as merely an unpleasant viewing experience. One scene where O'Quinn brutally attacks and murders the nice guy guidance counselor of his teenage daughter is particularly cringe-worthy, but in much the same way that an especially gory scene from Friday the 13th would elicit that response. It also does not help that the performances are so flat and elicit limited sympathy. Hack is so dim and unwitting that she seems cut from the same Stepford mold as her psycho hubby. Our sympathy should rest with Schoelen, who gives the best performance in the film, but there is something very remote about her acting that prevents us from truly embracing her character. O'Quinn's much ballyhooed performance is a hot mess. He is not a looker and there is nothing charming or appealing about his faux personas to make us understand why one woman, much less a slew of them, would fall into his net and succumb to marriage, especially bringing along families who harbor suspicions about him. His range in the role is laughably limited and he fails to either provide someone so appalling that we would root against him or to elicit any sympathy for a mentally ill man desperate for the perfect family. Given that I am also not a fan of his strained performance in Lost, I am undoubtedly in the minority here. One would think that with the subsequent emergence of the frothing family values crowd in the US that the film would take on a certain relevance, but even such after-the-fact parallels fails to elevate this to a higher level.

Charm is not a word one usually applies to a crime&chase comedy, but it is the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the subtle development of the relationship between Jack Walsh and Jonathan the Duke Mardukas over the course of the film. Walsh clearly views Mardukas as a paycheck and, once he picks him up, a pain in the neck. But we see the interaction between them, subtly worked out over the course of the flick, lead to an unexpected ending. Of course, aside from that, there is the sheer fun of the chases, car wrecks, surprises and plot twists along the way that keep one on the edge of one's seat. Wonderful acting from the leads deNiro and Grodin, as well as from Yaphet Koto as the harried FBI agent, Dennis Farina as the mob boss, and John Ashton as Marvin, Walsh's boneheaded competitor. A very enjoyable and satisfying move that stands up well to repeated viewings.

If you look at this madcap rock 'n' roll musical from a purely cinematic point of view, it's easy to understand why an amateurish attempt at a story, less than stellar performances, virtually nonexistent production values, and some of the cheapest special effects ever captured on film (even for the year 1975). When caught up in technicalities and a longing for mainstream purity, then one would have a perfectly good argument for The Rocky Horror Picture Show being one of the worst movies ever made. But if one were to ask a fan of the film why they love it so much, I guarantee you that their reason has nothing to do with production values or mainstream desirability. Quite the opposite--it's a film that's shunned by most audiences. This hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most successful cult films ever made, grossing to date over $100 million (this is over a thirty year period, mind you; it's initial release was a disaster). This is because The Rocky Horror Picture Show is not just a motion picture. It's a pure social and cultural experience, one that has liberated numerous people labeled by society as misfits or outcasts with its message of, Don't dream it, be it. It's also a ritual that warrants midnight gatherings on Fridays and Saturdays dressed as one of the film's characters. The fun is enhanced through the use of props (such as rice, water pistols, and toilet paper, all of which are used on cue) as well as by the act of shouting vulgar lines back to the screen. This trend of audience participation has remained a staple in Rocky Horror's successful history and only adds to its appeal. Can you imagine how uninteresting it would be to view this film in the privacy of your own home? Above all else, it's an opportunity to have fun, allowing for (and often encouraging) the release of the party animal within us all. Only at a Rocky Horror showing would no one blink when seeing an audience decked out in fishnet stockings, glittering corsets, and pasty makeup plastered on their faces. Everyone is uninhibited and no one cares what others may think. What a great excuse for a year round Halloween party. Rocky Horror is also about the music, with some of the most classic songs ever recorded, including the show stopping Sweet Transvestite, the delightfully sappy Dammit Janet, and The Time Warp, the film's signature song (which prompts the audience to get up and dance along with it). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the very fabric of the film's greatness depends on the music. And why not? The oddball mix of science fiction, horror, sex, and comedy just aren't enough; all that can be seen in plenty of other cult films. Give us something more, something that would leave a lasting impression on the ones who took the time to see what this movie was all about. Through music, Rocky Horror does that, and does that well. Of all the performances in this film, Tim Curry as the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N. Furter is the most memorable. His decadence and sexual overdrive hits us like a ton of bricks and never lets up. (And who really wants it to?) In the tradition of Frankenstein's Monster (who has just come out of the closet), Frank actually creates a muscle man named Rocky for the sole purpose of relieving his tension. The Middle American, wholesome young couple Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) couldn't be more out of place in the world Frank lives in, which makes the situation they're in all the more entertaining. Things only get weirder when you throw in a houseful of servants with quirks of their own, such as hunchbacked butler, a voyeuristic maid, and a tap dancing groupie. Top that off with the film's sinfully twisted story about the night that Brad and Janet spend in Frank's castle, and you have all the ingredients for a cult classic. Like such offbeat films as Forbidden Zone and Pink Flamingos, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a film that is experienced, not seen. From its humble beginnings as a London stage play to the creation (and initial failure) of the movie we all know today, Rocky Horror has given story creator and Riff Raff portrayer Richard O'Brien a godlike status among fans. The film is pure camp from start to finish fun, cheesy, and entertaining. Whether you've seen it 1,000 times (some have actually seen it more than that) or are seeing it for the first time (which would label you as a virgin), it remains to this day a very unique piece of celluloid history. Well, what are you waiting for? Pop in the DVD. Don your garter belt, spiked heels, and party hat. Get your water pistols, newspapers, and lighters. And above all else, let's do the Time Warp again!
