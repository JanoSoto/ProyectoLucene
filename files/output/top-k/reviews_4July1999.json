First of all, the special effects are incredible.  It was amazing how real everything looked.  The computer generated characters (Jar Jar, Boss Nass, Watto, the battle droids and the rest) looked real.  Not only that, but it was amazing how well they interacted with everybody.  I have seen the movie 6 times, and each time I have looked for parts where the CG characters mess up, but I have yet to find any.  While I didn't care much for the underwater scene, it was still incredible how real it looked.  Unless I'm mistaken, (I don't think I am), all of Coruscant was CG, and assuming it was, it was amazing how real it looked.  The podrace was fantastic.  Not only the special effects, but the sound was amazing too.  Another great part about the movie was the characters.  Qui-Gon was a great new character.  He had the same presence that Obi-Wan had in the original trilogy, only more of it.  Ewan McGregor did great playing a young Obi-Wan.  He did a good job making his voice sound like Sir Alec Guinness.  Jar Jar, though a bit irritating at times, actually isn't as bad as most people say he is.  He was even kind of funny at times.  And, although many people will say things to the effect of Jar Jar shouldn't have been in the movie, that is completely wrong.  He was a necessary character, though he was a bit overdone.  Anakin was a pretty good character, although personally I think that he should have done at least one thing kind of evil.  But, there is no doubt in my mind that he will do enough evil things in the next 2 movies to make up for it. Palpatine\/Sidious (the phantom menace, if you will) was a good character. The movie did a good job starting to show how he becomes Emperor, by giving him more power.  Darth Maul was a good character.  He probably could have been in the movie more, and had more lines, but there's just something about characters that don't do much that is very cool.  (i.e. Boba Fett).  The lightsaber battle at the end of the movie was incredible. Ray Park was amazing.  After seeing The Phantom Menace, the lightsaber fights in the original trilogy are pretty much terrible.  Of course, there is more to a movie than special effects and characters.  That of course, is the plot.  I think that the plot is very underrated.  It probably could have been a bit clearer, but it did everything it needed to do.  Basically what it was about was how Palpatine got more power, which will eventually lead to the formation of the empire.  And I thought it did this pretty well, although I would have liked to see Palpatine actually being elected as Supreme Chancellor, instead of just having Amidala congratulate him.  Oh well.  I really don't have much else to say about the plot.  John Williams' soundtrack was very good, and it fit the movie well.  I guess that's pretty much all I have to say.  I'm sure this was a pretty bad review, because I had trouble saying what I wanted to say.  If i could have explained it better, that would have been good.  Oh well.  Basically, I love the movie.note-I have loved Star Wars all my life.  All four of the movies are by far my favorite movies.  The Phantom Menace ranks second (behind The Empire Strikes Back).

It was a fascinating, funny, frightening study of human reaction to crisis and a wonderful commentary on the summer of 1977 in New York City arguably the craziest summer in history.  This movie covers an extremely broad scope typical of Spike Lee's style telling twenty stories at the same time, and doing so better than most directors tell one.  The film is fast paced and relentless in its pursuit of your undivided attention. You blink and you could miss something important to one of the plot lines (all of which are interesting by the way).  Leguizamo turns in a good performance as the coke-addicted husband, Vinny, who can't seem to stop cheating on his lovely wife.  He has his good points, and he loves his wife. However, he can't stop cheating on her which is what makes him so difficult to understand.  His paradoxes make him interesting.  Leguizamo was certainly a far cry from To Wong Foo with this role, bravo.  Richie remained a vague character  the old Brooklyn goombadi turned punk rocker.  We are never actually clear on his sexual preferences either, which is odd because the movie spends a great deal of time on it.  The most solid performance is most fittingly delivered by the Oscar winner in the group.  Mira Sorvino completely erased my memory of the horror that was At First Sight.  Her character, Dionna, is a good wife, a good daughter, and more so than any other character in this film a good person.  Beyond that she also knows how to stand up for herself.  Just when you think she's pathetic for putting up with her cheating husband, she shocks you by doing what the audience (or at least I) thought her incapable of.  She was also really underwritten, I would have liked to learn more about her.  But, brava, Mira.  As far as the murders are concerned, they simply contribute to the atmosphere of the city. The movie is not about the killings or the real hunt for Son of Sam... these are touched upon but not paramount.  As Spike Lee said, The murders are a cloud that hangs over the movie.  Two thumbs up and a solid A- for the latest Spike Lee joint.   ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 1999","score":"","review":"  See this movie!!

And you pick up some things you didn't notice before. Watch it a few more times. And you pick up more. By then you're obsessive and you go to websites on the film. And you find a list of bloopers. And it's a *long* list. So you print it out and you watch the movie again. And it gets even better once you can pick out all the spontaneous goof-ups on film that, when you watched it the first time, you never picked up. And by then, you've become a real fan, part of the huge Newsies cult. chuckle This is a movie that either you love or you hate, and only very few people are in the middle area. Not only is the music and dancing incredible, the story is inspiring and the setting is breathtaking. You wouldn't think the slums of New York City would be so incredibly beautiful, but in a way, it has a charm to it all its own, adding a real flair to the piece. Even with the editing mistakes and the bloopers, it's an excellent film, and I believe that the mistakes add to the charm of it and make you watch it again to pick up everything. But even if you don't pick up the bloopers, you will probably want to see it again. Perhaps to learn the dances, or the words to all the songs. However, the video and soundtrack are hard to find (I recommend amazon.com). Not only will children enjoy it because of the music and the dancing, teenage girls will enjoy it because of the hot guys, and just about anyone else would like it because of the story and the tough New York attitude of the characters.I'm not just saying this because Newsies is my favourite film. I'm a critic, generally, and I'll point out anything I don't like about the movie. So, now is my time to be a critic. One If you don't enjoy musicals (even though this is FABULOUS music from the one and only Alan Menken), don't watch it. I believe it's started a musical revival in the film industry. Two Medda Larkson (Ann-Margret) should be seen more often. So much more could have been done with her character and her relationship with Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) was never established. There should have been another scene with her. Three Sarah Jacobs (Ele Keats). That's all I have to say. If you've seen the film, you'll probably agree. She was pretty, but she didn't seem the type Jack would fall in love with. She had no real character, and seemed like a damsel in distress until the Delancey brothers attacked her and she threw a punch to Morris's face. But for the rest of that fight, she cowered in the background and let the two thugs beat up her older brother, then watched Jack come to the rescue. I'm not one for damsels in distress.But, despite this, it is a movie worth watching. Really. Especially for the bloopers.. you'll feel like you're in on a big inside joke that no one else knows about. Check out this film, it's a winner!

But even if you don't pick up the bloopers, you will probably want to see it again. Perhaps to learn the dances, or the words to all the songs. However, the video and soundtrack are hard to find (I recommend amazon.com). Not only will children enjoy it because of the music and the dancing, teenage girls will enjoy it because of the hot guys, and just about anyone else would like it because of the story and the tough New York attitude of the characters.I'm not just saying this because Newsies is my favourite film. I'm a critic, generally, and I'll point out anything I don't like about the movie. So, now is my time to be a critic. One If you don't enjoy musicals (even though this is FABULOUS music from the one and only Alan Menken), don't watch it. I believe it's started a musical revival in the film industry. Two Medda Larkson (Ann-Margret) should be seen more often. So much more could have been done with her character and her relationship with Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) was never established. There should have been another scene with her. Three Sarah Jacobs (Ele Keats). That's all I have to say. If you've seen the film, you'll probably agree. She was pretty, but she didn't seem the type Jack would fall in love with. She had no real character, and seemed like a damsel in distress until the Delancey brothers attacked her and she threw a punch to Morris's face. But for the rest of that fight, she cowered in the background and let the two thugs beat up her older brother, then watched Jack come to the rescue. I'm not one for damsels in distress.But, despite this, it is a movie worth watching. Really. Especially for the bloopers.. you'll feel like you're in on a big inside joke that no one else knows about. Check out this film, it's a winner!

And you pick up some things you didn't notice before. Watch it a few more times. And you pick up more. By then you're obsessive and you go to websites on the film. And you find a list of bloopers. And it's a *long* list. So you print it out and you watch the movie again. And it gets even better once you can pick out all the spontaneous goof-ups on film that, when you watched it the first time, you never picked up.

The time when Hollywood trots out it's worst of the summer.  You know the drill.  There's a Godzilla every year, somebody has to be it. Wild Wild West clenches the title hands down this summer, and we still have eight weeks to go!The Will Smith phenomenon has now entered it's third phase overwhelming ego project. Teaming with his Men In Black director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess.  A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith?  I think so.  Men In Black and Independence Day were gigantic hits, they even call the 4th of July Big Willie Weekend due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves, the writing, acting, directing, and not just because of Smith.  West is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone.  The truth shines through clearly.  Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 1965-1970,  the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West (Smith), who must team up with a weapons expert (Kevin Kline, at his most painfully unfunny) to thwart the evil plans of the villain, and legless, Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh).  Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula, President Grant, and the stunning, gorgeous, lovely, and just plain old hot Salma Hayek.  The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all.  Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear, as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people, these are professionals up on screen, and they blew it.The screenplay, credited to FOUR writers, has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny.  You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film, not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt.  Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix.  Yes, Will Smith is African-American, but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes?  The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material.  This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well, it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery.  She's barely in the film, and when her character is explained, you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all.  Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt (literally) of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming.  A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures (Get Shorty), but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action, like a better, funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easy-to-spot green screen shots, the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made.  This is a very top-heavy production with little chance to breathe.  But Sonnenfeld made this choice, he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits, and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists.  Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score.  While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black' Will Smith rap tune, Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film.  The cinematography is also without color, and the catering probably sucked too.Wild Wild West is the product of zero imagination.  A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season.  I am always wary of comic westerns, and this film seals that envelope.

You don't see Austin Powers to learn about lasers. But joke for joke, reference for reference, there are far fewer in the sequel. I laughed continuously last time. This time, there were plenty of areas which didn't even make it to funny. If you're doing a parody of spy flicks with a dose of pop culture thrown in, then I can't imagine it being tough to fill the movie up with decent gags - as Myers did in 1997.This is essentially the Austin Powers reinterpretation of the Roald Dahl screenplay of You Only Live Twice (its prequel being a mixture of the movie versions of Thunderball and Casino Royale) Dr Evil in a volcano hideout, surrounded by hot liquid mag-ma; with a bit of Matt Helm and Derek Flint thrown in. But not enough, for my liking. And for those who loved the 1960s pop culture, there are far fewer references to those great songs - only I'll Never Fall in Love Again and I'm a Believer. Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me is very 1990s and in some places, commercialism and an attempt to capture the teen market were evident.Good points? There are many George Clinton's fabulous parody score, which repeats some cues from the original plus a lovely spoof of John Barry's Space March\/Capsule in Space and You Only Live Twice themes, the latter used when Felicity and Austin arrive on the island with a volcano, both dressed like Honey Ryder in Dr No... The opening sequences are brilliant, as is Heather Graham's very natural and almost naïve manner, which I rate higher than Elizabeth Hurley's effort in the original.

Rob Lowe is magnificent in his impersonation of Robert Wagner, down to his mannerisms and accent, although Wagner's own appearance is sadly limited. Finally Starbucks, Springer and Seth top marks.Bad points aside from those mentioned, toilet humour ain't my sort of thing. Great if you like the thought of Austin accidentally drinking fæces instead of coffee. The sequences involving Fat Bastard were disgusting in parts - and I'm not exactly your most PC of people.

Resembling a young Julia Roberts, I couldn't take my eyes off of her.  A star is born.- What's up with the girl wearing braces in the scene with the kids and Ani Skywalker before the pod race?

Hated his speech-- I couldn't understand half of what he said. This is probably intentional so as to get more second- and third-time viewers. ;) Since I knew he was computer generated, I found myself distracted whenever he appeared-- trying to see if I could tell the difference between him and the real people.  Mostly I couldn't.  But Liam and the kid once look sort of in the wrong direction when Jar Jar speaks.- The plot of the movie was hard to follow (but then, I even have trouble with James Bond movies).

I could tell the good guys from the bad guys, but that's about all I could figure out.

Then the movie spends the rest of the time building up to the inevitable...and then gives us the inevitable.  After watching the final scene, I wondered if the script was written on autopilot, after lots of cigarettes and coffee, at about 3 in the morning.The movie is a remake, or an inspiration anyway, of Dial M For Murder. That was only an okay movie, really, and this one doesn't do a whole lot to build off of it.  The one thing that it really has going for it are the performances, which are convincing, especially Paltrow and Douglas, who come across as a couple who got tired of each other long ago and are now just going through the motions of a marriage, while Douglas's character harbors deep and secret resentments about the fact that his wife is cheating on him.I enjoyed the setup, as we learn that Paltrow's character, Emily, has been having an affair with a destitute artist, played intensely by Viggo Mortensen.  She believes her husband, a wealthy investor, doesn't know. What she doesn't know is that her husband, Steven, is about to get wiped out on the market because of some unwise overseas investments, and knows as well that she has been unfaithful to him.  As someone points out, cheating on your spouse is the second-most common reason to kill, and money is the first.  Steven has both motives.In a startling twist, he arrives at the artist's home one night and tells him that he knows everything about the affair and the artist's past, which involves jail time and swindling widows out of lots of money down in Boca Raton.  Steven offers him an out kill his wife, for a payment of $500,000. The artist, David, is trapped; on the one hand, he faces prison, on the other, killing his lover.  He opts for the latter.David's character is ambiguous, to say the least.  At times he appears to truly care for Emily.  At others, he seems to care nothing for her.  His decision-making is all over the map, and wildly implausible.  Steven, on the other hand, is cool even under incredible pressure.  He is certain of what to do and how to do it at all times.  There are moments in the film where he is confronted with his actions and is able, even in seemingly impossible circumstances, to talk his way out of it.  I enjoyed watching his character, even if it was recycled from his performance in Wall Street.As I said earlier, I enjoyed the buildup.  It plays pretty well and is smoothly handled.  The movie is a well-oiled machine right up to the end, which is both abrupt and utterly predictable.  Without revealing what happens, I will say that I was surprised that the movie did not try for a bolder resolution, especially from Davis, an accomplished director.  This was a standard Hollywood ending that is far below a man of his directorial skills.As an afterthought, I might as well mention that the DVD Criterion Collection release of this film contains as an extra an alternative ending to the movie, which is supplied both with an without commentary by Davis. Watching it, I was unimpressed; it doesn't deviate enough from the final choice to really make a difference.  Yes, there is a shift in the moral balance as far as one character is concerned, but the end result is the same, making it as weak as the original.

OK so Judd nelson(jack of suddenly susan & hot rod(believe or not) of transformers the movie) did play his part well but he's not exactly the idea of an terrorist villian (so many people expected the villian to be a supervillian but the film ended up as having a terrorist as the villian) & sure the story had a major difference to the comic, but just because movies place in more than just a li'l bit of artistic license doesn't always make a movie bad (which I can say for the movies of SMB & street fighter) so there my 2 cents for right now.

For a start, the special effects and the visions of the future were imaginative and carefully planned.  Michael J Fox and Christopher lloyd are still adorable in their respective roles.  Although the rest of the cast, with the exception of Biff have little to do.  The scenes for 1955 are just a rehash of the first, but there is very little that they actually could have done to prevent that.  I thought they integrated the new characters into the old scenes quite well, in keeping with the original story from part 1.  Obviously well planned.  Because the end runs directly into part 3, part 2 was necessary for part 3 to occur.  It is a filler in a way which was made into a film of a sort.  My Conclusion, although its not as engaging as 1 or 3, it's still a worthy part of the trilogy.

Some people I talked to liked Cruel Intentions or the Phantom Menace.  Me?  I hated them both, but loved The Matrix and Election. Election was funny, if you can relate to movies that seem so surreal they actually imitate reality.  I was surprised that R. Witherspoon was chosen for the role of the ghastly Tracy Flick, but she can really act (which was a surprise especially after Cruel Intentions and Fear).  Matthew Broderick's character was more hilarious, though, because the manner in which he attempts to drive morals and ethics into his students minds and later attempts to have an an extra-marital affair is breathtaking.  The movie ends on a note that I wasn't sure about, but upon more thought, I do believe it made its point.  If your brain hasn't been totally saturated with the usual superficial Hollywood CRAP, then you can appreciate Election.  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 1999","score":"","review":"  And others do.

Sort of...Well as you can tell, describing a Wes Anderson picture is a perplexing task.Rushmore is a story about a 15 year old scatter-brained jack-of-all-trades named Max (played by newcomer Jason Schwartzman).  Max is given scholarship to a prestigious prep school following the success of a stageplay he writes while in the 2nd grade.  Life thereafter is not easy for Max for his IQ is not quite average, yet he dreams big.  One day Max befriends a wealthy booster named Herman.  Bill Murray's portrayal of this character was Oscar-worthy.  He wishes he had a son like Max and makes his malcontent with his own children obvious throughout the picture.  Ultimately, Max and Herman fall in love with one of Max's teachers, Mrs. Cross, and what ensues is one of the most charming and unique love triangles ever filmed.With Rushmore, subtlety is everywhere cinematography, scene composition, dialogue, and of course acting.  What makes this film so wonderful is the manner in which the audience can find faults with all the characters yet they're so richly developed that you still embrace them.  There is no over-the-top conflict between characters in Rushmore.  In one pivotal scene Max and Mrs. Cross exchange sentiments that they've never met a person quite like the other.  I've never quite seen a film like Rushmore.If there is one minor critique of Rushmore, it would be that Anderson seems to be intentionally unconventional with scene transition, which was more annoying than artistic.All considered, I still consider this gem a splendid 10\/10.*psssst* Make sure you see Bottle Rocket too!
