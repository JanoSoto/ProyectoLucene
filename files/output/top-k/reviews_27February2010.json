He is a great voice actor and this is his best performance. In the original novel, Frollo was a priest, not a judge. However, if he was a priest, the movie would be BANNED(as a kid's movie). I love it when he sings Hellfire, one of the best Disney songs in my opinion. Frollo is a very evil Disney villain. Npot only is he a hypocrite, he is also a very lustful man. The film explores lust, religion and deformity just to name a few. The movie is also pretty funny. This film is an Disney Renaissance Classic. Besides, how many Disney films can you name that mention eternal damnation as one of the main subject matters? All in all, great film. Check it out.

I enjoyed this movie a bit as a child, but mainly because I liked things like dragons and Godzilla movies. Granted this one features a rather friendly dragon, it still was fun for me to watch as a child. The songs though are a bit silly and not very good, the plot goes here and there a bit to much and it has one of those sad endings like a lot of Disney movies from this era seemed to have (though nothing compares to the ending of Old Yeller). The story has a boy who is befriended by a dragon and at the start of the film he is trying to escape his strange family. He is an orphan and I think he is basically a foster child as they have a bill of sale on him so it is almost a case of him being a slave. Well he ends up in a town where he is taken in by a local who happens to live in a lighthouse. Her husband I believe is out to sea at the moment and this sets up a plot point that occurs during the end of the film. Pete gets in all sorts of trouble thanks to his dragon at times, but the dragon also gets Pete out of trouble at times as well and really comes through in the end. There is also a plot point involving a sort of medicine man who actually sees the dragon at one point and wants to chop him up and use him in potions. The dragon is invisible for a lot of the film and this is why Pete gets in so much trouble because of him. It has its moments, but it is kind of lame and sappy at the same time.

There's something about it where you could watch it over and over and over and know everything that's gonna happen and still be shocked, saddened, and amazed by it as if you saw it for the first time. It just screams perfection perfect story, acting, themes that are greatly worked into it without being too obvious. Part of the reason this is one of my favorites, maybe even my overall favorite film, is that it touches on so many world-essential things that everyone can relate to hope, faith, integrity, justice, and the will to live and survive to name a few. I was shocked when I learned that this didn't win any Oscars. Although I do love Forrest Gump (the big winner of '94 which beat Shawshank for pretty much everything it was nominated in) and think that Tom Hanks did a brilliant job as Forrest, I still feel that Shawshank was slightly better. Morgan Freeman delivers what might be the performance of his career. There's so much believability in that it's just amazing. Tim Robbins is probably the only man who could have played Andy so perfectly. His quiet demeanor evokes great wonder about him, much like how Roy Orbison is such a presence on-stage and he hardly even moves. But the thing to really marvel about Andy is his integrity and patience. Although his need to escape could have driven him insane, his hope and faith in justice and God kept him sane enough to patiently work out his escape for 19 years. That meeting between Red and Andy where they discuss hope has to be one of the greatest scenes in the whole movie, next to Andy's resurrection baptism in the rain and when he breaks the sewage pipe with the stone in sync with the lightning. This film is much like another favorite of mine Citizen Kane because when it first came out people didn't really understand it that well and didn't see the prophetic power in it the first time around. But nowadays we as viewers have realized the impact and power that Shawshank holds on everyone who sees it. Every time it rains now, I just have the urge to run outside, take my shirt off, and just feel the rain pour down on me. I've seen this film maybe 10 times by now, and I know that I'll never stop watching it until the day that I die.

Unfortunately all this is usurped by two fundamental flaws; the script and the action elements.In terms of the script, its fair to say that the writers definitely had a serious off-day. Trek comedy has always been fairly hit and miss, but whoever thought Data asking Worf 'if his boobs were firming up' or that Picard and Worf distracting Data during a mid-air dogfight with Gilbert and Sullivan was comedy gold was clearing smoking something good. There are just so, so many cringeworthy lines in this film, mostly revolving around Data and so many attempts at a cheap laugh. Quite why the writers felt they needed to spice up a story involving forced relocation, genetic manipulation and insubordination with gags such as Worf getting acne and Data inflating into a buoyancy aid is beyond me.If that were all, then the positives of Insurrection, such as the aforementioned engaging plot and strong acting from Stewart would still come to the fore. But sadly its not.The action elements in this film are sadly as lamentable as its script. Again, it's not as if Trek in general is renowned for its action, especially TNG, undoubtedly the most cerebral and least 'old west in space' of the franchise. If you are going to make a film appealing to the philosophical strenghs of TNG then why do you need so many weak phaser fights and running around? Added to that there's a ludicrous ship-to-ship duel in which Riker pilots the Enterprise with....a joystick.Obviously I recognise there needs to be an element of action if the title of the film is 'Insurrection', but surely it could have been done better than this?

Moore lacks the elegance of Sean Connery but he has a lot more wit. However, it is not just because of him that the film is silly; the plot overall seems to take itself less seriously than usual, and many scenes are really weird, particularly the ones that take place in the Caribbean island San Monique and contain voodoo elements. There is also the redneck sheriff J.W. Pepper, a terrible character who is unsuccessfully played for comic relief where none is needed (after all, we already have Roger Moore's one-liners and the crazy voodoo rituals). Having said that, for every aspect that is different with Live and Let Die, there is one that is similar as well. The villain (here played by Yaphet Kotto, who is adequate but somewhat forgettable) has the same objective as usual, Bond still knows his way with women, and there are plenty of gadgets and chase scenes.Live and Let Die has many problems; sometimes it feels a bit too silly for its own good, the death of the villain feels really unworthy (not to mention that the effects are extremely poor) and the depiction of black people is borderline offensive with far too many stereotypes. All Bond films are a product of their time, but perhaps this is truer with Live and Let Die than any other. Here, they try to ride on the success of the blaxpoitation genre, but it feels like a rather forced decision. I can easily overlook most of these complaints though, since the film is so entertaining, indeed, it is probably one of the most entertaining films of the entire franchise. Some of the future Moore films would refine the style of Live and Let Die further, but it is already a fun film as it is.

Elevated by some lovely animation, good songs and cute characters it is very pleasant to watch, even if there are segments that are better than others.Once Upon a Wintertime(9\/10)- One of my personal favourite segments from the film. I admit I knew about this one long before seeing Melody Time from watching my old Christmas videos. The animation is absolutely gorgeous in this segment, with a nice romantic story and a truly beautiful title song, sublimely sung by Frances Langford.Bumble Boogie(9\/10)- When I first heard of this I thought Rimsky Korsakov jazzed up? How will that turn out? My verdict is surprisingly entertaining, despite its scant running time and being a tad too rushed, with a cute and endearing title character, nice animation and a clever arrangement of Flight of the Bumble Bee. I will say I don't know what Rimsky Korsakov would make of it though, he was very particular about how he liked his orchestration.Johnny Appleseed(10\/10)- My personal favourite. Very colourful visually, with some lively songs and the perfect melodious voice of Dennis Day elevated it to a greater level. Could've easily been very dull in terms of story, but the above elements made it worth seeing.Little Toot(8\/10)- I have one word for this little segment- CUTE! Little Toot himself is adorable.

The writing of the movie is very much in the shadow of Steinbeck and Tennessee Williams, against the background of the burgeoning Civil Rights movement in America at the time, but for me, it buckles under the weight of its own over-earnest good intentions, despite the considerable efforts of both cast and crew.I was surprised to learn that the screenplay wasn't adapted originally from a play, given the amount of static movement in the film coupled with a lot of speechifying. I also just couldn't get my head round the premise of two racially different felons just happening to be chained together and finding themselves on the run together in the Southern States, all the film's gritty realism scuppered for the sake of allegory.There's still a lot to savour, the cinematography is excellent in its near-documentary realism, while the two leads throw themselves unstintingly into very exacting physical parts. I like both Curtis and Poitier but wasn't completely convinced by their respective performances, Curtis's accent comes and goes and you can see him straining to act seriously in the first half of the film - however he improves as the film progresses and ultimately convinces by the ending. Poitier is again forced to adopt a degree of racial stereotyping, notably his crooning of the plantation-type song, but his acting is more consistent than Curtis and for me, more enjoyable. However as stated above the idea that these two, the racially prejudiced Curtis and the proud Negro Poitier could get along for more than five minutes, never mind pour out their collective hearts along the way as they get all philosophical and universal on us, is too much to swallow.In support, Cara Williams is fine as the abandoned country wife, desperate for love and a future with Curtis (there's an excellent dissolve shot as their relationship is consummated) but what a difference it would have made to the dynamics of the film if she had fallen for Poitier instead - not, of course that such a storyline film could ever have been green-lighted at the time, while Theodore Bikel is excellent as the pursuing sheriff who retains his humanity, refusing to bow to the pressure of his posse to bring the wanted duo back more dead than alive. The petty squabbling of the pursuing pack, together with the lynch-mob mentality of a small outpost where the convicts are caught seeking food are obviously thrown up as contrast to the developing get-along relationship between the escapees, but as I indicated it was shown in too sharp relief.Certainly a worthy and well-meaning film but too unbelievable and portentous to really hit home, at least with me.

He invented techniques that to this day are used by other filmmakers (though not to the same level) to stimulate excitement and dread in the hearts of the audience. And Hitchcock was willing to try anything new. By 1963, Hitchcock had made just about every kind of thriller he could. He'd made his sheer suspense thriller Rear Window. He'd made his nonstop, lighthearted thriller North by Northwest, his psychological thriller and ultimate masterpiece Vertigo, and of course, need I say it, Psycho. What else was there for him to try in the genre but a creature feature? The film he made was called The Birds, and it is a richly complex thriller that, despite its flaws, reaches the level, I say, of being a masterpiece on the same tier as the films I just mentioned.The Birds starts out not with an attack by a creature, but setting up the human story, a bold and efficacious move of storytelling. Tippi Hedren stars as Melanie Daniels, a San Francisco playgirl who travels to a small coastal town in northern California in order to pay a mischievous visit on the lawyer (Rod Taylor) who humiliated her. After she arrives in the town, strange incidents involving birds of all species begin to take place and before long, Melanie as well as the whole town begin to realize that birds have started an attack on humankind. And the most horrifying thing is, nobody can find out why.Now in plot The Birds sounds corny and unbelievable. But like I've told people many times, plot is just an attention-getter. It's the story that matters and The Birds works on that level. Hitchcock was always a director to break conventions and he does that here. Instead of opening up with a clichéd scene like a bird attack, he opens up with our human story and works that well into the first hour of the picture before the attacks really start coming furiously. And this human story, most notably the relationship between Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor and their mutual friendship with a somewhat unhappy school teacher wonderfully played by the late Suzanne Pleschette really gets you involved, much more than you would expect to be in a movie of this genre. What else is daring? Try the fact that there is no music score. Bernard Herrmann is credited, but only as a sound consultant. And of course, there is the fact that not once throughout the whole picture is it explained directly to us why birds have all of a sudden started a war on humankind. That's a bold and surprisingly effective move than if Hitchcock had opted to go with a tired old scientific speech to further the fowl plot and extend running time. Tippi Hedren and the cast are very good in their roles and help translate the dialogue into the personalities of three-dimensional human beings. I believed and liked these characters, most notably the one played by Suzanne Pleschette, and that really got me involved when their lives were threatened.As a thriller, The Birds, of course, scores with excellence. Hitchcock at first just introduces little shocking moments to get us stimulated and then, when we know that there's a danger, he again goes with his suspense theory, where the buildup is long and drawn-out and the actual moment of the threat is run through quickly and there are some genuinely scary moments in this motion picture. Only a director of Hitchcock's status could make seagulls and finches and crows into some of the most frightening cinema villains, who scare me a lot more than say the modern-day slasher villains that try to become Norman Bates. The Birds utilizes some very good graphic effects to insert birds and human actors into the same shot and the composition is very good. There is a flaw in one scene, where a colony of birds flood into a house through a chimney and we can see palm-sized pheasants fluttering about in the shots, clearly a lot smaller than they would be, but that's a minor detractor. Hitchcock also keeps the level of horror under control by not pouring out fountains of blood, but using just enough of it to get a reaction from the audience.The Birds is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and that's why Alfred Hitchcock is still one of the most popular directors of all time. He made great, original movies, but he made them for the audience and he wanted them to have fun. And The Birds is a lot of fun. Now if you've had problems with the way Hitchcock chose to end his movies in the past, you'll have your biggest fit with this one, but I implore you to try not to and enjoy the movie. This is Hitchcock's creature feature and one of the best I have seen.

He invented techniques that to this day are used by other filmmakers (though not to the same level) to stimulate excitement and dread in the hearts of the audience. And Hitchcock was willing to try anything new. By 1963, Hitchcock had made just about every kind of thriller he could. He'd made his sheer suspense thriller Rear Window. He'd made his nonstop, lighthearted thriller North by Northwest, his psychological thriller and ultimate masterpiece Vertigo, and of course, need I say it, Psycho. What else was there for him to try in the genre but a creature feature? The film he made was called The Birds, and it is a richly complex thriller that, despite its flaws, reaches the level, I say, of being a masterpiece on the same tier as the films I just mentioned.The Birds starts out not with an attack by a creature, but setting up the human story, a bold and efficacious move of storytelling. Tippi Hedren stars as Melanie Daniels, a San Francisco playgirl who travels to a small coastal town in northern California in order to pay a mischievous visit on the lawyer (Rod Taylor) who humiliated her. After she arrives in the town, strange incidents involving birds of all species begin to take place and before long, Melanie as well as the whole town begin to realize that birds have started an attack on humankind. And the most horrifying thing is, nobody can find out why.Now in plot The Birds sounds corny and unbelievable. But like I've told people many times, plot is just an attention-getter. It's the story that matters and The Birds works on that level. Hitchcock was always a director to break conventions and he does that here. Instead of opening up with a clichéd scene like a bird attack, he opens up with our human story and works that well into the first hour of the picture before the attacks really start coming furiously. And this human story, most notably the relationship between Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor and their mutual friendship with a somewhat unhappy school teacher wonderfully played by the late Suzanne Pleschette really gets you involved, much more than you would expect to be in a movie of this genre. What else is daring? Try the fact that there is no music score. Bernard Herrmann is credited, but only as a sound consultant. And of course, there is the fact that not once throughout the whole picture is it explained directly to us why birds have all of a sudden started a war on humankind. That's a bold and surprisingly effective move than if Hitchcock had opted to go with a tired old scientific speech to further the fowl plot and extend running time. Tippi Hedren and the cast are very good in their roles and help translate the dialogue into the personalities of three-dimensional human beings. I believed and liked these characters, most notably the one played by Suzanne Pleschette, and that really got me involved when their lives were threatened.As a thriller, The Birds, of course, scores with excellence. Hitchcock at first just introduces little shocking moments to get us stimulated and then, when we know that there's a danger, he again goes with his suspense theory, where the buildup is long and drawn-out and the actual moment of the threat is run through quickly and there are some genuinely scary moments in this motion picture. Only a director of Hitchcock's status could make seagulls and finches and crows into some of the most frightening cinema villains, who scare me a lot more than say the modern-day slasher villains that try to become Norman Bates. The Birds utilizes some very good graphic effects to insert birds and human actors into the same shot and the composition is very good.

This Godzilla is both a reverent remake and a very welcome technical upgrade of those silly Japanese films. Humor perfectly balanced against thrills. Better characters than usual for an Emmerich flick. Great action sequences, credibly embedded in real-world locations. Even a bit of sympathy for the big green lizard. What the $&%#@ else do people want???Oh, sure... this ain't yer Papa-san's Gojira. So what? Aside from the very first black-and-white film (and then only in its original Japanese version), that series was a joke almost before it started. Emmerich's Godzilla is a more athletic beast, but it's actually believable enough to be frightening, and it's got a personality that actually works. (Could it really hide down in the subways? Hm, let me get my tape measure... Oh, wait a minute who cares??)I could have done without the Siskel-and-Ebert in-joke, but hey, Emmerich deserves a chance to have a little fun like the rest of us. And it balances out, anyway, against his hilarious use of the French secret service. (Why the French? Why *not*? In all those James Bond movies, why do the British always have to solve the world's problems?)I've enjoyed all of Emmerich's films enormously... though I do find Independence Day a bit hard to take. (Just a smidgen too much humor in that one.) Even 10,000 BC surprised me, improving a great deal on a second viewing. (A question of expectations; I was looking for a semi-remake of One Million Years BC.)These pure-entertainment, CGI-heavy films may seem trivial, but not a lot of directors can crank them out as reliably as Emmerich. He'll never be mistaken for another Fellini, but so what - the opposite is equally true. While I certainly do like to pull out La Strada or 8-1\/2 every decade or so, I've watched my DVD of Godzilla at least a half-dozen times... it's an E-ticket carnival ride I'll never get tired of.

With films such as Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever, he shows his passion and understanding of situations such as racial feelings between all races, not just whites and blacks as well as how outsiders view interracial relationships. Here, his target is the entertainment industry, specifically television and he cuts right to the core because he knows how important and complex this issue is and wastes no time of this 135-minute film to stuff every frame and scene with a message and relating what he has seen in this country and how he feels about it.First off, the acting is near flawless. Damon Wayans gives his best performance ever as Pierre Delacroix, a successful producer upset that he is not considered black with his fancy dress and white accent. Determined to make his case, he decides to create a minstrel show very much in the vein of those from the 1930s and 40s. However, he goes one step further and hires black actors to use blackface makeup as well as make the subject and setting the most politically incorrect setups imaginable. What he doesn't expect is the overwhelming popularity of the show complete with huge ratings and numerous critical awards.For my money, Lee almost had a great film here. The first hour is terrific, biting satire, attacking everything and anything. Lee takes no prisoners and also gives some very interesting bits about how a TV show is brought to life. But, once the show becomes a success and the people involved develop consciences, Lee's vision narrows and soon it becomes more of the angry and socially-aware Spike Lee we've seen in much better films. Being white myself, I never liked how Lee seemed to portray whites as leering fools and the true ignorant people of America as opposed to the more commonly accepted view of blacks. Still, his feelings were justified in Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever and earlier works. Bamboozled tries too hard and loses its mission towards the end.

Bernard Herrmann died the day he finished his recording sessions for the movie. Herrmann did the music for the radio broadcast of War of the Worlds and the films Citizen Kane and Psycho, among many others. The score for Taxi Driver has no memorable songs, no hit singles. It's tied inseparably to the visuals, searing and complete. The opening of the movie is riveting, with steam coming from the manholes and a cab appearing through the mists like some monster from a deep lagoon as Herrmann's menacing, sinister score fades in and out. When you've never seen the movie, you don't know what it's about, but you know immediately it's going to be bad. And it is.If you haven't seen the movie since it came out, it's time to see it again. It's been over thirty years, and Scorsese still has it nailed. It's riveted down and bolted. He welded it. It's still a scorching movie. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet with the scars to prove it. Inside and out. Bickle is seriously mentally ill. He's Holden Caulfield back from the Nam.* He keeps telling people he's got to do something, but he doesn't know what. We know he's going to explode, and we wait with a sick feeling in our stomachs for the carnage.Jodie Foster was 12 when she played Iris, the child prostitute. It's amazing to see her and realize how good she was. Her scene with Harvey Keitel when he talks her out of running away is mesmerizing. (Some scenes were shot with her 19 year old sister as a body double, by the way.) And her lunch with Bickle is totally natural. She was a star right from the beginning, holding her own with Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel. Incredible.Keitel is Iris's pimp, the epitome of all that makes Bickle sick, the scummy garbage of New York. Named Matthew, Iris calls him Sport, and she loves him. He manipulates her relentlessly and shamelessly because he makes a lot of money having a 12-year-old whore in his stable. You can do anything with her, Sport tells Travis, then he spouts a laundry list of filth, sickening Bickle. Keitel is one of my favorite actors; I've never seen him fail in a movie, and he doesn't disappoint here. Sport puts a name and address on Bickle's urge to do something.I've seen Cybill Shepherd in two movies where she played similar characters Betsy here in Taxi Driver (with Albert Brooks as her opposite number) and The Heartbreak Kid as Kelly Corcoran (with Charles Grodin playing her suitor). In both movies her character is pretty much empty - a blonde who's gotten by on her looks and who has no personality. Betsy provides a whitebread, sane counterpoint to Bickle. The problem is whether we're better off being the sane counterpoint, involved in an election campaign where nothing the candidate says means anything, surrounded by whitebread, incompetent, safe, well-meaning people who truly care whether the candidate's bumper stickers are printed correctly.Betsy sharpens our focus is on Bickle as he slowly spirals down, letting slip his facade of control, losing his grip on himself, in his solitary hell. Herrmann's score gives music to Bickle's seething anger and danger, underplaying the tempest we feel must be raging unseen in the black night of Bickle's soul. We never see Bickle's torment on his face, but we know his flat affect is the mask of his will to do something, anything to let loose his locked-down demons.Taxi Driver has lost nothing over the years. The characters, the directing, the music all work. See it with a good sound system.The movie was produced by a threesome that included Julia Phillips, author of You'll Never Have Lunch in This Town Again. If you haven't read that book, I recommend it. It's free at your local library and well worth the price of checking it out. She also produced The Sting, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and a few others. She had a lot to say in her memoir, and she said it well. Julia Phillips died of cancer a few years ago, I'm sorry to say.*To carry that analogy further, Iris is both Holden's prostitute and Holden's sister, Phoebe. Bickle protects her. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 February 2010","score":"","review":" Martin Scorsese's brilliant 1976 film about Travis Bickle has the best music score I've ever heard. Bernard Herrmann died the day he finished his recording sessions for the movie. Herrmann did the music for the radio broadcast of War of the Worlds and the films Citizen Kane and Psycho, among many others. The score for Taxi Driver has no memorable songs, no hit singles. It's tied inseparably to the visuals, searing and complete. The opening of the movie is riveting, with steam coming from the manholes and a cab appearing through the mists like some monster from a deep lagoon as Herrmann's menacing, sinister score fades in and out. When you've never seen the movie, you don't know what it's about, but you know immediately it's going to be bad. And it is.If you haven't seen the movie since it came out, it's time to see it again. It's been over thirty years, and Scorsese still has it nailed. It's riveted down and bolted. He welded it. It's still a scorching movie. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet with the scars to prove it. Inside and out. Bickle is seriously mentally ill. He's Holden Caulfield back from the Nam.* He keeps telling people he's got to do something, but he doesn't know what. We know he's going to explode, and we wait with a sick feeling in our stomachs for the carnage.Jodie Foster was 12 when she played Iris, the child prostitute. It's amazing to see her and realize how good she was. Her scene with Harvey Keitel when he talks her out of running away is mesmerizing. (Some scenes were shot with her 19 year old sister as a body double, by the way.) And her lunch with Bickle is totally natural.

Kyra Sedgewick and Bridget Fonda are very good while Matt Dillon has a few shining moments. Sheila Kelley is hilarious while Jim True is wasted.
