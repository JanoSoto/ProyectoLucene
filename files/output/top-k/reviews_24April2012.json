The animation was so lifelike that I was regularly unsure what was computer generated and what was real. And this came out in 2000? Seriously, but for the 3D elements, this was a lot better graphically than Avatar - and this was some 9 years earlier! Truly a masterpiece of cinema. The story was very interesting though it lost a couple of points for 1) unnecessarily making the dinosaurs appear a bit too much like humans and 2) in many ways the story ripped off The Land Before Time - though not entirely. It wasn't a big hit at the box office and if you watch it, you can see why. They tried to make the dinosaurs relatable by giving them human-like features, including their front legs looking and acting more like hands than they should. They even had some dinosaurs that acted more like dogs! Perhaps this is justifiable in a sense but it isn't actually realistic. The story was a good moral lesson for kids and generally I think would be great for kids to watch but it also had something in it for adults, and adults could enjoy the lessons. The story was genuinely interesting and not at all predictable. While there were violent elements, I would still think that children could enjoy it. Overall, a very good piece of entertainment.

So this is a case where the book is so much better than a film adaptation ever could be. And this is odd because most people and especially most young adults have experienced many more movies than books, so its almost shocking to think that mere words can do what the whole multi-sensory experience of film cannot. Its not so much what the film did that was bad, but rather all the things it failed to do.The first thing it failed to do was provide much of a story background for the viewers of this imaginary futuristic totalitarian world. I assume they did not have the time to include it, but this really weakens the build up to the so-called climax of the movie. It seems the director is basically assuming that anyone watching the film has already read the book. But if you haven't I promise that you will be asking questions and be scratching your head almost right away.I had a small problem with the casting of John Hurt. He acted well enough, but he is a good 15-20 years older than the 39 year old Winston Smith was in the book. I'm not sure why they changed that aspect of the character. The movie also wholly misses out on Winston's internal psychological terror and painful introspective ruminations on the meaning and loss of history. I didn't get the sense that Winston really cared about history all that much. The movie focused more on his longing for amorous connections. If you saw this movie without reading the book you actually would get a small sense of what it would be like to live within the party where whole experiences are denied to you because language has been altered or obliterated. But you wouldn't know it. This is hard to explain.The acting was certainly adequate for everyone except O'Brien. Some of O'Brien's scenes from the book were removed from the movie so he actually had less to work with, but even his torture of Winston at the end seemed uninspired and rushed. And Winston's interactions with the enigmatic O'Brien is another area the movie really botched. In the book Winston is longing for a savior figure from the Brotherhood and he has this sense of doomed fatalism about him at all times. He reaches out to O'Brien knowing he is a dead man already, but the movie fails to build up that tension properly. The result is that the twist where O'Brien reveals himself as a member of the thought police is not climactic at all. Again, if you had not read the book you would probably just be confused rather than shocked. Now despite these shortcomings, I actually still enjoyed the movie even though so much of the emotional and psychological impact was lost. This was most likely due to the excellent set and consistent acting. But this is definitely a case where another remake is in order. I think with today's technique and technology they might be able to capture the essence of Orwell's timeless work. But I can only recommend this film to someone who has already read the book.

The Cary Grant and Leslie Caron characters are both a bit exaggerated, Grant with his constantly sucking on a bottle but never appearing drunk, and Caron with her manipulative primness. We know Caron is going to do a Katherine Hepburn to Grant's Bogie in African Queen, and confiscate the liquor, and eventually get him to put on some clean clothes.And, of course, they're going to fall in love. But get married? There's not much of a transition here; at least Grant could have confessed how afraid he was she was going to die, or something. It's a real weak spot in the script, but then I guess this is sort of a children's movie, or at least one of those early Sixties family movies, a la Disney.I'm as shocked and mystified as anyone that this won an Oscar for best original screenplay. But then the good stuff, like Dr. Strangelove, Goldfinger, My Fair Lady and even Mary Poppins were based on books, and so didn't qualify. Speaking of My Fair Lady, can you believe Grant turned down Henry Higgins to be in this mediocrity? And he had hopes of Audrey Hepburn stooping to co-star, although I must admit, she would have been good in the role, as always. I wish Caron had played it more like Caron, with more class and finesse, and less anger.I saw this when I was a kid, and found it reasonably amusing. Viewing it from an older perspective, I can sympathize a lot more with Grant's character. The strongest section is the beginning, when he is being strong-armed into being an island watcher, the antithesis of South Pacific's Emile De Becque. The little girls certainly do a good job of being annoying, and providing a bachelor with good reason for retaining this status.Grant provides enough edginess to avoid turning this into a saccharine Disney number. He delivers a well-balanced comedic performance. But the roles are fairly generic, and other actors who could have played the lead, include Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon or Walter Matthau.What makes Father Goose most interesting, from a cinematic perspective, is that it came only a year after director Ralph Nelson's masterpiece, Lilies of the Field. This was a heart-warming story not unlike Father Goose, of a reluctant hero dragged into doing his duty by a bunch of women. But it was a gentle, slow movie grounded in realism. I wonder if Father Goose could have been made with a similar approach? Instead, we have slightly unrealistic acting matched with a somewhat improbable story. It might have been better had it been more believable. It might have been more dramatic, but then it might not have been as funny.As to one comment about it being sexist, that's hilarious. What do you expect the little girls to do, grab a machine gun and mow down the Japanese sailors? Swim out and attach a mine to the Japanese patrol boat? Father Goose is very much a product of its time an early Sixties mainstream comedy. And that's the way it was.Oh, as to the mystery of the screenplay Oscar, perhaps it had something to do with writer Frank Tarloff having been blacklisted during the Fifties for being an unfriendly witness before the HUAC committee, and having moved to England. He wrote under assumed names, but what, I do not know. Perhaps the award was a surrogate for some of his work under a pseudonym.Father Goose is not a masterpiece, even of its genre, but it is reasonably entertaining, and holds up fairly well. It could have been better, from an adult perspective, but no one involved needs to apologize. Most of all, it is good, clean family fun, which might be why some reviewers are so ecstatic about it.

Apparently Scream didn't get the message from earlier slasher movies that the sequel is supposed to be bad to average. What I really like about Scream 2 is that it doesn't try and be all that different and they for all intensive purposes cop to that fact in the movie by referencing it consistently even playing reenacted scenes from the previous years film. As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 April 2012","score":"","review":" 70\/100.

As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date.

A couple of performances are a little over the top while a couple of other performances are a little understated.

My biggest problem with this movie is the number of times Bruce Willis fires his guns (twin 1911s) without reloading.

Watching it again as an adult, I can see why anyone above the age of 12 would not like this movie, but as I said, that doesn't mean it's bad.The plot is simple enough; an evil criminal kidnaps Pistachio's (Dana Carvey) parents in order to steal prized possessions from around the USA, and now Pistachio must learn how to utilize his family's ancient tradition of disguise to get them back. As the story goes along, we see Pistachio utilize many different characters to gain access to information, the most memorable being Turtle Guy, and that really is the main point of seeing the movie It has Dana Carvey doing all sorts of funny stuff. To this day, my friends and I still say quotes from his characters.Unfortunately, aside from Carvey's performance, the movie doesn't have a lot to offer. Most of the other jokes are very immature and not funny even to little kids, such as a running gag where the main villain farts in the middle of his evil laugh.For what it is, it's not worth seeing if you're a teenager or older, but if you have kids of your own, put this on for them and see if they like it.

But this did not simply make it another women's picture.You see, although the title now reflects the gender-swap and the lines have even been re-jiggled to make Walter Burns the hero's ex-husband as well as ex-boss, this is still very much the same story as before. It's as if the female Hildy was there in potentia all along, with the familiar, quarrelsome relationship between journalist and editor having been very much like antagonistic ex-lovers all along. It's significant because this makes her a strong, professional character, as opposed to the floppy, flimsy females that screenwriters usually came out with in this era.The new Hildy is magnificently brought to life by Rosalind Russell. Russell is fluent in sarcasm, and the knowing, world-weary tone she brings to her lines is exquisite. She seems totally at ease amid the boys' club atmosphere of the newsroom, and more than able to carry the movie and match up to her exuberant co-star Cary Grant. Grant shows a touch of Ned Sparksism in his performance, and it is easy to see Burns as the sort of pompous grouch that Sparks would normally play. By and large though this is prime Cary, with plenty of ridiculous exclamations and indignant gestures, best of which is a dismissive flick of the hand as he tells everyone to get out. There are plenty of fine supporting players too. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's would-be husband Bruce, Bellamy being an intelligent man who is good at acting a buffoon.The action is overseen by ace director Howard Hawks. Hawks is brilliant at handling smooth switches between the general and the specific. The movie begins with a lengthy tracking shot (or rather two shots, but the blend is disguised) going right-to-left, showing off the indistinct business and bustle of the newsroom, before coming to rest on a slightly more empty end. Then Rosalind Russell enters, and we follow her with another tracking shot left-to-right. It's a great way of introducing the character. This second tracking shot is ostensibly a reversal of the one before it, but the first one is a broad picture of a place and the second has its focus on one person. Throughout, Hawks encourages not only the oft-praised overlapping dialogue, but also punchy visual collages of tense and hasty movements. Whenever the gaggle of reporters are in the room there's always one chewing gum or shifting his balance. His Girl Friday begins at high speed and from then on barely pauses for breath.Of course, not all the genuine women's pictures of the 30s and 40s were poorly-written, and in fact a lot of them I enjoy immensely.

Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.The fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE's number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.It was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli & Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.As with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry's blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance.

Bond's by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed.

We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program.The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work.The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else.Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is.Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience.1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the injustice of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much.

I prefer it to all the Universal Frankenstein films except 'Son of Frankenstein' which I liked about equally. This does not include those films with other monsters in them. Personally I thought 'Bride of Frankenstein' was a bit silly thanks to many of the over-the-top Doctor Pretorius scenes. I only enjoy it for the wonderful visuals and makeup. 'Frankenstein' as a film was just okay even if Karloff was excellent as always. I realize I am in a small minority. 'Ghost of Frankenstein' for me was much more fun to watch overall then those others, I especially like Lugosi's work in it. The brain transplant of ygor to the monster's body added a weirdness and horror to the film that sets it apart. The same goes for 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein' when they wanted to transplant Wilbur's brain in the monster.It's a shame 'GoF' lacked continuity with the next film 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. They should have kept the monster blind or at least have explained his regaining his sight. Poor Mr. Lugosi played the monster (in 'FMtW') with a sleepwalker-like lumbering gait with arms outstretched because the monster was supposedly still blind.

In the 130 minute run-length, Roman Polanski sketches a story that could have been said in ninety minutes or even less. We know what will happen in the end way before Rosemary's confrontation itself, but we still follow Rosemary's abject situation intently because we have become attached to her and pitied by her condition. The most terrifying elements in the film do not call for creaking doors or vanishing figures, but use the most unpleasantly calm manner for inducing terror. The first haunting lullaby, with the piano keys connotes the mood of the film, and we know that this Doris Day movie-like sequence that follows will not remain this placid. Rosemary, a bonny housewife and her husband Guy, a struggling actor move to a Gothic-inspired apartment in New York after marriage. The couple redecorates the place to suit their lifestyle since the house was previously occupied by an old lady who had died under mysterious circumstances. Soon, Rosemary befriends another lady in the laundry who lives with the Castevets, Rosemary's neighbors. But the girl is found one day lying on the pavement outside the building, she had apparently jumped to her death. This is when Rosemary and her husband get acquainted with the Castevets, who seem like a typical old couple, kind and helpful. Guy and Rosemary are invited to dinner where Guy has a private conversation with Roman Castevet until the ladies enter. Rosemary maintains her distance from the couple, especially the prying Minnie Castevet, who begins asking the price of her furniture; Guy however keeps visiting them often and seems quite preoccupied with 'work'. Rosemary, feeling alone and aloof, bites her tongue, fidgets, and then visits her doctor to share her woes with him. But the couple make up when Guy announces that they should have a baby, but maybe because of the half-eaten 'chocolate mousse with a chocolate under-taste', Rosemary feels enervated and faints. This is when her visions become all the be more surreal and puzzling, as Rosemary is not able to decipher whether it is a dream or it is really happening. Rosemary gets pregnant and informs this to Guy, who seems to be more relieved than excited and quickly, informs the Castevets. Rosemary, under the oldsters' suggestion or rather insistence, seeks help of a renowned doctor, Abraham Sapirstein, who in turn tells Rosemary to stop seeking advice from others, discontinue reading pregnancy books, and take a health drink prepared by Minnie, which is supposedly more effective than any goddamn pills. Rosemary undergoes a drastic weight-loss where she begins looking 'chalky' and her young friends begin worrying about her health. Apart from this, people begin dying or getting blinded or paralyzed under mysterious circumstances and Guy suddenly begins getting offers. Rosemary starts suspecting everyone around her and this leads to an unforgettable climax that you may have known beforehand but never expected to be like this.Rosemary's Baby succeeds not just because of the fear that keeps looming at a distance, ready to strike us anytime, but also because of the ensemble's near brilliant effort at capturing the spook of homely horror- I don't know how else to describe it. The horror that is so close to home that Rosemary can see it coming but cannot help herself at getting away from it requires total unpretentiousness from the character's that establish this horror. This nosy hag Minnie and her striking husband Roman seem so unlikely to do any harm that when the truth is revealed, it brings double the chills than it would have with a long-haired, crazy looking couple with gaunt eyes and shaggy looks. Ruth Gordon is a gem, portraying her Minnie with tempered eccentricity while Sidney Blackmer is the perfect choice for Roman. John Cassavetes does his job well but could have explored his character more in terms of the guilt that Guy would have felt at committing the actions. The supporting cast is equally strong in keeping the movie alive but it is Mia Farrow, the disarmingly attractive model-actress who gives one of my favorite performances and probably one of the best of 1968. Her acting is not perfect, and neither does she pretend it is, but she is able to submit herself to her director and perform with instinct and understanding. Take the scene where she obtains the book on witches from Hutch and begins working on an anagram; you can see the excitement, tension and apprehension on her face &#x96; she wants Hutch to be wrong and the book being a hoax, but in the back of her mind, she knows that there is some connection between the book and her current situation. Mia does this and the rest of her scenes wonderfully; it's a shame the Oscars did not nominate her.The DVD has bonus material, one that has the director, writer and producer of the film talking about their idea formation and decisions regarding the cast. There is not much information regarding technique as much of the runtime focuses on Mia and Roman (Polanski's) magical rapport. But we do see some behind the scenes footage, and we realize how flexible Roman is as a director. A random thought It's funny whenever I think of the name Roman, I hear Nicki Minaj's 'Roman Holiday' in my head; Roman Zolanski had his exorcism on the Grammy's recently while Roman Castevets brought the devil's son Adrian to the world in 1966 Year 1. Roman Polanski on the other hand is battling some very serious allegations in USA.

Considering it was coming off two of the most successful horror films of the 90's, Scream 3 does pretty good for itself especially when one takes in consideration other horror movies made in the same year. It definitely misses Kevin Williamson's input, but despite the criticism he's garnered from this film, I felt that Ehren Kruger did a passable job. The only negative aspect from his script was keeping Sidney in exile. Considering most horror movies generally wane by the second sequel, the story didn't need to have another uphill battle by having the main character stuck in isolation for half the movie. But somehow Kruger made it work as I felt he really nailed the character of Sidney and how she would react to her previous battles. Basically the time in the first two that would have been used to develop Neve was used on Dewey and Gale who are the de facto stars until Sidney finally arrives in Hollywood. Even though I'm a Wes Craven fan, his direction seemed a little off compared to his other works. A lack of a Williamson script kept the film from finding the right mixture of laughs and scares generally focusing more on the former than the latter. What makes this even more ineffective is Craven's use for a more dark atmosphere which along with some of the more serious situations present in the trilogy is at constant odds with the abundance of humor. Examples being the Jay and Silent Bob cameo along with Carrie Fisher's role; these detracted from the film's tone. With that said, Scream 3 continues the franchise's trend of being one of the smarter horror series out there. I actually was a fan of the Hollywood location, which provided great genre jokes and help carefully paint horror movie cliché's only this time from a behind the scenes perspective. Outside of yet another annoying performance by Parkey Posey, the supporting class was exceptional and although the killer(s) identity was uninspired and random, the final showdown was actually an improvement over Scream 2's finale by finding a way to effectively do the job the filmmakers set out to do by making a satisfactory ending to an entertaining trilogy...until Scream 4.

This is an incredibly strange documentary that has witnesses that no lawyer in the world would put on the stand but at the same time there's no question that the film will keep you glued to what you're watching. It's hard to say how much truth is found in this documentary or if everything here is nothing more that cruel gossip but I must say that it's rather obvious that Broomfield hates Love. There are a lot of problems with this documentary with the main one being Broomfield's attacks on Love at every chance he gets. It's clear he wants to know whether or not Love killed Cobain but I think there are quite a few cheap shots taken at her. The director is constantly saying how he wanted to use certain music but Love wouldn't allow it. Well, duh. Any music rights owner isn't going to let you freely use something so considering this film ran out of backers it's clear that they wouldn't have had the money to buy the music even if they were for sale. There's an episode at the end when the director could have asked her a question but didn't and instead gets on a stage and does it in public. Another cheap shot. With that said, the murder conspiracy is just something hard to wrap your brain around. Even if it was true, the witnesses here are cracked out heroin addicts so it's really hard to take what they say as the truth. You could argue that Kurt and Courtney were a part of this crowd, which I guess would be fair but I do wonder what motive some of these people had. It's clear that Love's father hates his daughter so his motives are certain. Others claim that they're terrified of Love yet they come out and say she murdered Kurt.

This is an incredibly strange documentary that has witnesses that no lawyer in the world would put on the stand but at the same time there's no question that the film will keep you glued to what you're watching. It's hard to say how much truth is found in this documentary or if everything here is nothing more that cruel gossip but I must say that it's rather obvious that Broomfield hates Love. There are a lot of problems with this documentary with the main one being Broomfield's attacks on Love at every chance he gets. It's clear he wants to know whether or not Love killed Cobain but I think there are quite a few cheap shots taken at her. The director is constantly saying how he wanted to use certain music but Love wouldn't allow it. Well, duh. Any music rights owner isn't going to let you freely use something so considering this film ran out of backers it's clear that they wouldn't have had the money to buy the music even if they were for sale. There's an episode at the end when the director could have asked her a question but didn't and instead gets on a stage and does it in public. Another cheap shot. With that said, the murder conspiracy is just something hard to wrap your brain around. Even if it was true, the witnesses here are cracked out heroin addicts so it's really hard to take what they say as the truth. You could argue that Kurt and Courtney were a part of this crowd, which I guess would be fair but I do wonder what motive some of these people had. It's clear that Love's father hates his daughter so his motives are certain. Others claim that they're terrified of Love yet they come out and say she murdered Kurt. No matter what your opinion on the truth is, it's hard to take any real evidence out of this documentary. ","genre":"Documentary, Crime, Music"}]
