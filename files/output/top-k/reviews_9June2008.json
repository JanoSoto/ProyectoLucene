Basically John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is a New York homicide officer who lost his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 30 years ago, he was a firefighter and he was killed in a house explosion, John has traumatised since. During an atmospheric phenomenon, John finds his father's old HAM radio, and somehow, he can communicate to Frank, 30 years in the future. With this ability to communicate, John manages to save Frank from the explosion that would have killed him, and the also save the lives of other souls. But more importantly, they are trying to find a way to stop a serial killer from murdering John's mother\/Frank's wife with a 30 year gap. It is a little predictable and cheesy the ending, where an older Frank and John are reunited, but it has to be that way. Also starring André Braugher as Satch DeLeon, Elizabeth Mitchell as Julia 'Jules' Sullivan, The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich as Gordo Hersch, Shawn Doyle as Jack Shepard, Jordan Bridges as Graham 'Gib' Gibson and Melissa Errico as Samantha Thomas. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for When You Come Back to Me Again. Good!

I watched two long explicit trailers on YouTube of this movie to see if I wanted to be exposed to all that gore. Having watched the whole thing, the plot takes a while but the killings, while maybe a little gratuitous, were still entertainingly filmed. The end with the dolls ganging up on Frank especially so.

There's the obscurity status for starters (I'm particularly intrigued by films I never heard about before), the prominent cast (Willem Dafoe, Gregory Hines, Fred Ward, Keith David, Scott Glenn), the period of release (late 80's) and - most of all - the concept in its entirety. As you can derive from the alternate title Saigon, the film is set in Vietnam during the infamous war, but it's definitely not just another epic illustrating the horrible battles in the jungle or the traumatizing impact on its soldiers. Off Limits is first and foremost a genuine cop thriller, set in a hellish environment torn apart through warfare, and an effectively disturbing portrait of the horrible issues caused by American soldiers outside of the battlefields. McGriff and Perkins have the worst jobs in the world, since they're employed as army police officers in Saigon and responsible to investigate the crimes committed by American soldiers. One day they're assigned to investigate the murder of a Vietnamese prostitute who had a child with an American soldier. They quickly discover this isn't the first gruesome crime of its kind, as no less than seven similar cases were reported during the past year and they're clearly the work of a serial killer with a strict modus operandi. The devoted and headstrong duo also discovers that the previous officer prematurely quit his investigation even though he came fairly close to capturing the killer, undoubtedly because several high ranked officers got involved and his own life became endangered. McGriff and Perkins, however, are determined to stop to sadist killer, especially when they receive help from a beautiful and street-wise young novice. Off Limits is a fast-paced, suspense and frequently very violent thriller with a screenplay that is full of misleading twists, false leads and red herrings, like a legitimate and compelling whodunit thriller ought to be. Some sequences are even downright fantastic, for instance the helicopter-interrogation (Scott Glenn is sublime) or the nail-biting scene where the copper duo is surrounded by a mob of furious and vengeful Vietnamese people. Christopher Crowe's direction is tight and consequently surefooted &#150; which is quite remarkable for a debut feature &#150; and his own script is *almost* completely devoid of dreadful clichés and irritating stereotypes. I do emphasize the word 'almost' because a Vietnam movie without mad-raving American officers and\/or foul-mouthed Vietnamese prostitutes is practically unthinkable. Dafoe and Hines provide some terrific on screen chemistry, but they certainly aren't your typical witty interracial buddies like Eddie Murphy & Nick Nolte in 48 Hours or Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. They tease and provoke each other all the time, but the atmosphere of the film and the nature of the events are simply to austere to mix with comedy. The film is beautifully shot and has a marvelous soundtrack filled with timeless contemporary songs from James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Arthur Resnick.

First off, Jack Lemmon (audience cue Boo! Hiss!) is excellent in playing both the villainous Prof. Fate and later on the lookalike Prince Hapnick (what a laugh he does!). As The Great Leslie, Tony Curtis (Yay!) provides the amusement of constantly shining his white teeth with Edwards' assistance of course. And then there's Natalie Wood who as reporter Maggie Dubois is frequently trying to one-up Leslie and others on her superiority concerning women's rights. Of the three, Lemmon comes off best as he's consistently funny throughout with great help from Peter Falk as inept assistant Max. Keenan Wynn as Leslie's right-hand man Hezekiah is less so but manages okay with what he's got. Other fine support come from Arthur O'Connell as Maggie's newspaper boss, Marvin Kaplan as his assistant, Vivian Vance as the wife of said boss, Hal Smith as a town mayor, Denver Pyle as the sheriff, Ross Martin as a fence\/sword dueler with Leslie, Larry Storch as Texas Jack, and Dorothy Provine as singer Lily Olay. Screenwriter Arthur A. Ross (who's from my original hometown of Chicago, Ill.) provides great punchlines for the stars and Edwards constantly fills the screen with several visual touches, including the biggest pie fight ever, that bring to mind the great silent comedies of the early 20th century.

This one came out 24 years before I was born, but I first saw it back in 1999 on TV. It was the first James Bond film I watched from start to finish, and I don't recall loving it, but I guess I found it entertaining and memorable enough, even though I couldn't remember the title. Years later, with a second viewing, I still found that it was a reasonable romp.English secret agent James Bond (007) is sent on a mission to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of fellow agents who have been assassinated on the tropical island! In Jamaica, he faces a number dangers during his investigation, and is joined by Quarrel and CIA agent Felix Leiter. It turns out that an evil scientist with plans for world domination named Dr. No is Bond's main foe on this mission, and the secret agent must find the headquarters of this man, which is on a nearby island called Crab Key. After his arrival on this island, Bond soon meets a shell collector named Honey Ryder, and quickly falls in love. Ryder becomes another assistant in Bond's mission, as they bravely search the dangerous island for the terrorist's lair! I haven't read any of the books, so I don't know how this adaptation of Dr. No compares to the novel. However, judging it simply as a film, it has its merits. It didn't keep me consistently entertained throughout, sometimes due to the pacing and sometimes due to other flaws, but there certainly are some intense moments (usually action scenes), and there was enough suspense to keep me watching, even though I had seen the movie before and knew what would happen. Although Connery is now well past his Bond days, he is still well known for the role, and having seen him in it, I can see why. His version of the character is unforgettable. Also, I know many guys have said this before, but being a straight male, seeing Ursula Andress, who plays Honey Ryder in this film, in a bikini was a highlight for me, and I think the tropical beach setting for the scene where she comes in helped.This first Bond film may be a bit dated in some ways, and probably can't have the same appeal as it did upon its original release 46 years ago, but overall, it's still reasonable, and clearly still has appeal among today's audiences after all these decades, and after many more Bond films. If you want non-stop action, you won't find it here, so if you need it in order to be entertained by a spy thriller, then you'll likely find Dr. No very boring and probably very unmemorable as well. However, if you can enjoy a slower film of this kind, with a reasonable amount of action, this Bond film that started it all is probably worth watching. Even if it doesn't blow you away (it didn't do that for me), it could still easily have enough to keep you from stopping the film early.

I was used to stupid senseless films like scream, scary movie, and other garbage like that. I was very mature for my age then, so unlike my best friends who were in my age group at the time, I wasn't into the humor that they were into. I watched it with my brother, three of my best friends and my sister. I admit I was awed by the fact that it was a low budget film but had the posh look of a cool forty million dollar big budget production. (Dreamt of going to film school once...too damn expensive) I have to give Sarah Michelle Gellar props because she obviously took her time to understand the character. And when an actor makes you despise them and their character, then that means they did the job they were paid to do with skill. She is obviously a woman of great talent. It makes me respect her and her craft even more. That is just my own opinion of course. But I agree with the person who said that this movie has a message. There are several subliminal messages conveyed in this film, which is why I enjoy the movie so much. Towards the beginning, the film was a little slow, but picked up quickly once Kathryn was introduced. I liked the wicked interplay of dialog between the characters. It kept my eyes open and kept me interested in the story.This film was unlike any teen movie I ever watched. I happen to disagree with the people on this forum who complain that Kathryn doesn't have anything to be bitter about. Yes, the girl has looks, exudes raw sexuality, beauty, and has money. But because of her selfish, Over weening, conceited, malefic personality, she is always dumped for the Innocent little twits as she calls them. Not to mention, her ex was turned off by her eating disorder. She embodies total anarchy and displays sociopathic tendencies. Which is why she has so much to be bitter about. She is almost like a polished stylishly glammed version Lisa Rowe from the movie Girl Interrupted. Lisa and Kathryn are two totally different characters. They are worlds apart and are nothing alike. The only thing they both share in common is that both are sociopaths.The difference between Kathryn and Lisa is that Lisa has the courage to admit who she is and doesn't hide it. She was always honest about it and never hid behind any facades. The character Lisa prided herself with the fact that she never hid behind any false preconceptions or self dilution when it came to who she was. Kathryn, however, is blinded by the 'God complex' and believes herself to be Omnipotent and manipulates the world to revolve around her.. Kathryn has a cleverly crafted image to hide behind. She hides her true self from others until one of her victims crosses her the wrong way and puts a crack in her little world. As Sebastian writes in his journal....She cares about absolutely no one but herself. The girl has elevated self-absorption to an art form. She believes in nothing and laughs in the face of sadness, faith, and sincerity. A person solidly observing her and having seen the damage she's done to so many lives would most likely classify her as evil. She scoffs at any and every type of religion all the while manipulating others by using the idea of being religious, to her advantage. ---Sebastian Valmont I caught on to some of the messages when I was young. And most of them were pretty obvious. It mostly dealt with the drugs and sex that teens were struggling with back when I was in high school. Now that I'm 25, I watched the film a few days ago.

The movie calls itself a comedy of love in the 90s. I don't think it was that funny, or that realistic, but it was a good clean movie to watch and had some pretty good acting. It has a lot of good music, and the classical references in the movie are pretty interesting.The basic plot is about these struggling recently-graduated people trying to find jobs and dealing with the real world (one wonders why they'd want to, given that they could be in college forever). As John, my mentor, remarked, this (finding jobs) somehow seems to a obsession among undergraduates these days. The statistics aren't clear, but is it really true that one, who is reasonably successful (by this I mean someone who also manages to avoid being average), will find it difficult to get a job? It is definitely true an undergraduate degree doesn't hold much value these days, but that's because, in one sense or another, standards have declined and therefore it is a lot easier to graduate without much effort. This might sound unfair, but there are a lot of majors which make graduation all the more easier. A college degree no longer matters---what it is in matters a bit. In any case, a college degree is not a prerequisite for being good in an area. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that certain people, say people with experience in writing software and in systems OUTSIDE of classes, find it easier to get jobs than people who haven't spent enough time exploring what they intend to do the rest of their lives. This means you should obtain internships to show you can cut it. But I digress...Lelaina is the college valedictorian who's making a movie about her friends as they deal, having no role models, with reality. Troy is an intellectual, but a slacker and thus gets nowhere in life. Then there's Michael Grates (Ben Stiller), who's a non-intellectual yuppie who vies with Troy for Lelaina. Lelaina's roommate, Vicki Miner (Janeane Garofalo), who works at a GAP and sleeps with 66 (yes, she records each person's name in her diary) boys before she gets tested for AIDS. All these characters together form a modern-day soap opera. From one perspective, it diplays the confused interrelationship-etiquette seen in today's society. It also displays these young people struggling to fight against the commercialisation that reality brings upon them.

When tragedy struck and what seems like a tragedy story, there was light at the end of the tunnel. I especially admired the battle scene, how Kurosawa concentrated on the background point of view rather than directly on the action. When the warriors got off their horses, the camera was pointing at the ground where they would be pummeled by the charging horses of the Jiro. I thought the death of Saburo was tragedy especially when he found his father in the end and that was a highlight moment. Saburo was able to forgive his father and reunite with him to share that intangible moment. I thought the end would have the father taking back his kingdom but all the brothers end up dying including the father. In a way, it was a glorious revolution even though things went horrible. The destruction of the first castle was a turning point to a new and hopeful future. The dominion of darkness was taken down and I am guessing things would probably be better off without the corruption and the evil desires of world dominations by the brothers except Saburo.

When the warriors got off their horses, the camera was pointing at the ground where they would be pummeled by the charging horses of the Jiro. I thought the death of Saburo was tragedy especially when he found his father in the end and that was a highlight moment. Saburo was able to forgive his father and reunite with him to share that intangible moment. I thought the end would have the father taking back his kingdom but all the brothers end up dying including the father. In a way, it was a glorious revolution even though things went horrible. The destruction of the first castle was a turning point to a new and hopeful future. The dominion of darkness was taken down and I am guessing things would probably be better off without the corruption and the evil desires of world dominations by the brothers except Saburo. I enjoyed the movie overall, it was good war movie and it was quite enjoyable to watch and got my attention all the way through the end.

Apparently based on true events (with the real names having been changed) the movie provides a fascinating look at both the bungled bank job and Sonny's extremely complicated personal life. Divorced from his wife (with whom he had two children) Sonny had begun a relationship with a pre-operative transsexual (played by Chris Sarandon) who was becoming suicidal over not being able to afford a sex change operation. In partnership with Sal (John Cazale) Sonny robs the bank, but the police respond very quickly and Sonny ends up with a bank full of hostages. An interesting aside in the movie is watching how the various hostages handled the situation. The only real weakness I can see in this movie is that there's no explanation of who Sal was, or of how he was connected with Sonny. Sal provides a bit of humour to the movie. He comes across as completely lost, and begins to worry when he finds out that the media are reporting that the robbers are two homosexuals. He wasn't a homosexual, and he wanted the world to know that! Charles Durning also put on a good performance as NYPD Detective Moretti, who's handling the robbery, and who comes across as a pretty decent guy who really wants to find a way out of this for everyone.Essentially what we have here is a fascinating story complemented by excellent performances all around.

OK, so it is basically a re-make of when harry met sally (also one of my favs) and initially i thought the editing could be better in the beginning. it seems hurried or forced unlike the seamless transition between periods of time in when harry met sally. despite it's flaws though i love this movie. maybe it's just a personal thing for me because i always found myself in Freddie Prinz Jr.'s situation. getting stuck in the friend zone, lol. and Claire Forlani's character is absolutely my kinda woman. i love her quirky, off-the-wall intellectual humor. that's the kind of girl i'm looking for.

It's also not helped by clunky overacting from the three A-List leads and some of the hokiest dialogue ever heard this side of Pearl Harbour. There's barely a sentence uttered which sounds natural and unforced. Ironically there's a Reiner-ian attempt at humour as Cruise converses in little vignettes with his news-vendor talking purely in clichés, not realising in fact that everyone on board already talks in clichés. Cruise is excruciating in his maverick role as the green defence attorney up against big bad Jack , refusing of course to give in, before smartening and toughening up to win a sort of victory for his two young Marine defendants. He acts like it's Risky Business, overacting fit to jump up on Oprah's couch some 15 years early and is completely implausible from the off. Nicholson I can't stand in anything so apologies for the bias - here we get the same trademark mannered domineering, deranged performance he's adopted ad-nauseum since The Shining, he gets his obligatory big line - You can't handle the truth, and the whole film is obviously set up for his fall from grace at the climax. Moore acts the sensible sidekick cipher to Cruise's off-beat lead, clocking up more clichés to the dozen than anyone else as she naturally overcomes her initial frustrations at his unconventional callowness to of course become his head cheer-leader in his showdown with Nicholson. It's a wonder they don't get physically involved just to complete her journey! That's the big names summarily dealt with although there are some half decent performances in their considerable wakes, from notably JT Walsh, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland and the actors playing the young marine defendants, but on the whole I found it easy to predict scenes in advance (for example, Walsh's appearance in Cruise's car, Moore's rapprochement with Cruise on her day-off) - in fact I was sometimes able to pre-guess some of the dialogue in advance. Rob Reiner directs stolidly inserting symbols of American virtue every five minutes or so (The White House, The Capitol Building, The Stars and Stripes, okay, Rob, we get it!) with music used like exclamation marks to punctuate every major plot development but it just looks like what it is - a filmed play and to make that really work afresh you either need to be an innovative original director or be working with exceptional material. This film has neither and suffers accordingly.

Some critics thought that the movie might have had some moments too intense or unsuited for young children. I was eight years old when I first saw this film and it never bothered me. I was surprised to find swearing in this film, but again, it didn't degrade the film because it was sparingly used and by that I mean it was only used once or twice.The character of Stuart is very effectively brought onto the screen. The mouse is entirely computer-generated in an efficient way and the contributions of Michael J. Fox's voice work out very well. The same goes for the other animated characters. All of the live-action performances were well-done and they blended in perfectly with the CGI characters.Stuart Little has a good heart and it is can be a very warm little family movie for everybody to enjoy. I still enjoy it nine years after I first saw the film and I do recommend it. It's a film that will suit audience members of all ages. As long as you enjoy family films.
