Forget the reviews and the analysis by the so-called experts, and examine why you go to movies.  I like to be entertained. Sometimes that means becoming so involved in the lives of the characters that you feel their pain or share in their triumphs.  Sometimes it means you leave your educated, cynical brain in the glove compartment of the Accord, grab some Goobers and be transported to a fantasy world.  That's what this movie did for me.  If you go to movies to critique all the technical aspects of the film such as writing, lighting, acting, all that stuff, don't bother here.  This flick is funny and silly and if you let yourself, you'll find yourself rooting for this ragtag band of losers (I'm also a Cubs fan).  It is not the best movie I have seen this summer, but if you dropped 8 bucks on total garbage like Wild Wild West (plus a couple of drinks to wash it down), this one is much more satisfying.  If you ever tied your mother's tablecloth around your neck and stretched out prone across two kitchen chairs so you could pretend to fly, you gotta see this movie.  A special nod to William H. Macy.

He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90's ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don't think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.We all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron's Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.To start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.Next, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.Also, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.But most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn't matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.Titanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren't supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don't) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives. And one final note I can't understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that's just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.As for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80's. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.This is as good as a film gets!One final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD's so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn't do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say.

I made a mental note to myself - see this Blair Witch Project that everyone's talking about.And my chance came, as a special advanced midnight screening came to Toronto.  I was all set to hop on the subway and enjoy the show, but then Space happened to run Curse of the Blair Witch.  An examination of the Blair Witch throughout history, told as a straight-faced documentary.

Well, CotBW was fairly powerful in its own right, as I decided to skip the midnight showing.  I'm an atheist with little fear of spooks and ghosts, and I'm a veteran horror film watcher.  It takes a fair bit to put the scare into me, but based on this one hour mockumentary, I had come to the conclusion that leaving this film in the dead of night and making my way home alone was a definite no-no.  I decided to forgo this viewing in favour of seeing it with a group of friends when it reached general release.A wise choice.The story is a simple one.  Three filmstudents enter the woods in 1994 to make a documentry on local boogey man, the Blair Witch.  They never returned.  One year later their film is found.  Edited together, it tells the story of their last days.The film may be disappointing for some.  Unlike the current hollywood trend of cgi monsters on parade, this film sticks with the less is more school of filmmaking.  It doesn't spoonfeed answers to the audience - no confident scientist or brave police officer to explain bit by bit just how it all fits together.  No denouement to wrap it up in a nice and neat package.  There are no audio or visual cues to inform the viewer of impending danger.  Rather, the filmmakers have chosen a much more intimate approach.  We are forced to take in the information at the same pace the characters receive it.  We see what they see.  We know what they know.  Not all the questions are answered. Even the ending is open to multiple interpretations.This is a film devoid of effects or any form of Hollywood sparkle - as such, the entire film rests upon the strength of the actors.  Though I'm sure much of what we are seeing is the actors playing themselves, the performances are powerful.  That many are leaving the theatres convinced that what they just witnessed was an actual event is a testament to these actors' abilities.I would like to think that this film would act as a signal to Hollywood that we don't need multimillion dollar effects and actors to make a successful movie.  All that is needed are good actors and filmmakers who believe in the story they are telling. Alas, I fear the only thing they will take away is Hurray, we don't have to pay cameramen any more.  Be prepared for a wave of really bad mockumentries nipping on the heels of the Blair Witch.If you like films that provokes thought and discussion, if you are a fan of scary stories, if you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - than this is the film for you.

As I understand it, this mockumentary was originally intended to be part of the film - but the filmmakers separated the two, feeling that the footage alone was powerful enough to stand on its own.  Well, CotBW was fairly powerful in its own right, as I decided to skip the midnight showing.  I'm an atheist with little fear of spooks and ghosts, and I'm a veteran horror film watcher.  It takes a fair bit to put the scare into me, but based on this one hour mockumentary, I had come to the conclusion that leaving this film in the dead of night and making my way home alone was a definite no-no.  I decided to forgo this viewing in favour of seeing it with a group of friends when it reached general release.A wise choice.The story is a simple one.  Three filmstudents enter the woods in 1994 to make a documentry on local boogey man, the Blair Witch.  They never returned.  One year later their film is found.  Edited together, it tells the story of their last days.The film may be disappointing for some.  Unlike the current hollywood trend of cgi monsters on parade, this film sticks with the less is more school of filmmaking.  It doesn't spoonfeed answers to the audience - no confident scientist or brave police officer to explain bit by bit just how it all fits together.  No denouement to wrap it up in a nice and neat package.  There are no audio or visual cues to inform the viewer of impending danger.  Rather, the filmmakers have chosen a much more intimate approach.  We are forced to take in the information at the same pace the characters receive it.  We see what they see.  We know what they know.  Not all the questions are answered. Even the ending is open to multiple interpretations.This is a film devoid of effects or any form of Hollywood sparkle - as such, the entire film rests upon the strength of the actors.  Though I'm sure much of what we are seeing is the actors playing themselves, the performances are powerful.  That many are leaving the theatres convinced that what they just witnessed was an actual event is a testament to these actors' abilities.I would like to think that this film would act as a signal to Hollywood that we don't need multimillion dollar effects and actors to make a successful movie.  All that is needed are good actors and filmmakers who believe in the story they are telling. Alas, I fear the only thing they will take away is Hurray, we don't have to pay cameramen any more.  Be prepared for a wave of really bad mockumentries nipping on the heels of the Blair Witch.If you like films that provokes thought and discussion, if you are a fan of scary stories, if you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - than this is the film for you.  Although you may wish to cancel that late summer camping trip.This film gets five out of five Moohoohaha's on the scary movie scale. If I were to see this film again, I'd pay as much as $10.

It's not truly anticlimactic,it's just pure suspense,anticipation of what might happen rather than does.It's also amazing that no other director,at least to my  knowledge, has pursued this aviaristic theme.There's a very funny story told by the director Peter Bogdanovich about Hitch.One day he was waiting for Hitch at some hotel somewhere and when they met,they got on an elevator to go down to the hotel lobby,some 20 stories below them. Hitch got in the back and the lift filled up with people.Suddenly Hitch starts to speak... There was blooood eveerrywhere,he starts in his British accent.

The Baker brothers have been playing together for thirty-one years, and professionally for fifteen years. We learn early on, by Jacks' tone, that he is not a 'happy camper'. His remarks are short, flip, and sarcastic. Frank is the big brother, protector, organizer, and their work manager.  Frank tends to play the games of life while little brother, Jack fights them.Professionally, they are not doing so well, so Frank comes up with the idea to take on a singer. From the minute, Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) strolls into the audition late, we see that she has an edge to her just like Jack. She is wise-cracking, gum-chewing, and sarcastic, but wonderful singer  that turns this duo into a trio. From the first song she sings with them, there is a real transformation--first of the group, and later in the film as individuals. After the first night on the road together, Frank says Mark my words, from this night forward our lives will never be the same. And he is right.Jack turns out to be not as tough as he appears.This is shown by his relationship with his neighbor's young daughter, whom he teaches piano lessons to, and his love for his dog, Eddy. But everything changes on a New Year's Eve road gig. By now, Frank senses there is something between Jack and Susie, and makes it known to his little brother that he doesn't like it. Frank gets called away and while he is gone, the sparks fly between Jack and Susie. The next two scenes are really intense. The first between Jack and Susie. Their dialog cuts like a knife. They each have each other's number and manage to say things that cut to the core of one another. At one point, Susie says, You know I has you pegged as a loser the first time I saw you. But, I was wrong, you're worse, you're a coward. Ouch! Cut to Frank and Jack playing in a telethon. Jack, not being happy about the gig, says, You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. Where is your dignity? Frank answers, ...I have to be responsible. And that speaks volumes about the relationship between the two of them.I don't want to give any more of the movie away. It is very well acted by Beau and Jeff Bridges, and by Michelle Pfieffer. They do a great job.

","genre":"Drama, Music, Romance"},{"date":"12 August 1999","score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Real life brothers, Beau and Jeff Bridges, play brothers, Frank and Jack Baker in The Fabulous Baker Boys. The Baker brothers have been playing together for thirty-one years, and professionally for fifteen years. We learn early on, by Jacks' tone, that he is not a 'happy camper'. His remarks are short, flip, and sarcastic. Frank is the big brother, protector, organizer, and their work manager.  Frank tends to play the games of life while little brother, Jack fights them.Professionally, they are not doing so well, so Frank comes up with the idea to take on a singer. From the minute, Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) strolls into the audition late, we see that she has an edge to her just like Jack. She is wise-cracking, gum-chewing, and sarcastic, but wonderful singer  that turns this duo into a trio. From the first song she sings with them, there is a real transformation--first of the group, and later in the film as individuals. After the first night on the road together, Frank says Mark my words, from this night forward our lives will never be the same. And he is right.Jack turns out to be not as tough as he appears.This is shown by his relationship with his neighbor's young daughter, whom he teaches piano lessons to, and his love for his dog, Eddy. But everything changes on a New Year's Eve road gig. By now, Frank senses there is something between Jack and Susie, and makes it known to his little brother that he doesn't like it. Frank gets called away and while he is gone, the sparks fly between Jack and Susie. The next two scenes are really intense. The first between Jack and Susie. Their dialog cuts like a knife. They each have each other's number and manage to say things that cut to the core of one another. At one point, Susie says, You know I has you pegged as a loser the first time I saw you. But, I was wrong, you're worse, you're a coward. Ouch! Cut to Frank and Jack playing in a telethon. Jack, not being happy about the gig, says, You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. Where is your dignity? Frank answers, ...I have to be responsible. And that speaks volumes about the relationship between the two of them.I don't want to give any more of the movie away. It is very well acted by Beau and Jeff Bridges, and by Michelle Pfieffer. They do a great job. And let's just say, it is very realistic especially when Frank keeps referring to Jack as little brother. You just imagine that is how Beau talks to his little brother, Jeff.

There is a great line in the film after Demi Moore comes back from her encounter with gazillionaire Robert Redford.  Her husband, played perfectly by Woody Harlesson, is asking her questions that don't need to be answered.  Because if they are, it will put a damper in their marriage.  But he persists and finally Demi shouts out to him,  If I tell you he wasn't any good then I'm a liar.  If I tell you that he was then I'm a whore.   What a brilliantly written line and it is one that lends a perfect ear to what the film is about in most senses.  Jealousy is a powerful emotion but being broke and in love is just as powerful on the other end of the scale.  What is so great about this film is that is makes us all question what we would do in that exact same situation.  Would you let your wife sleep with a man for one million dollars?  Could you look at it and say that it was only one night and you can deal with it?  Would you say that your marriage is strong enough to overcome something so meaningless?  And that is the key issue right there.  Is it really that meaningless?  If you are married and in love ( if you are together in a monogamous relationship), is there ever a time when sex is meaningless enough to overlook, even if all of your financial problems are solved in the aftermath?Indecent Proposal is a great film in almost every sense.  The actors are great, especially Oliver Platt who has a cameo as their lawyer and he gets all the laughs.  The direction is great as it never gets anywhere close to pornographic, and it lets the audience decide for themselves what happened on that fateful night.  When you look at the whole concept of the film, you know it could get cheesy if handled poorly and irresponcibly.  But it never does.  It stays on course and delivers the goods.  I highly recommend this film and I think it is good to watch it with someone that you love.  It will invoke some very interesting conversations after words.  But don't watch it with them if you are afraid of the answers that you might get.  That, to me is good film making.  Something that leaves you discussing it long after it is over.

This small, quiet scene, accompanied only by Williams' score speaks worlds in those few moments than most movies do.  It's testament that special effects and CG can't replace the powerful simplicity of human emotion.All of the elements of Star Wars work so well together that it's hard to point out just one positive thing about this movie.  It's a film that if you haven't seen (if so, how has living on that deserted island been), you need to.  This is one of Lucas' finest achievements without compare.I have to rate this movie twice.  The 1977 version is easily a 9.  The 1997 re-release loses points because I think the new CG effects actually take away from the story.  I absolutely loathe the revised Han Solo\/Greedo shoot-out scene.  It looks cheap and unrealistic, and Greedo must be pathetic if he can't kill someone from across a small table.  This version gets a 7 based on overall blasphemy of a movie that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.  It should have been cleaned up and nothing more.Well, at least Jar Jar Binks wasn't added to this one.

If you thought Alien was far better than Aliens, chances are you'd be more inclined to like this movie.  Same with Jaws vs. all the sequels. This movie is all about suggestion.  You never SEE anything, and that lets your imagination runs wild.Another viewer characteristic that makes this movie more enjoyable is the ability to put yourself into the movie characters' situation.  That is what I think makes this the most scary movie I have ever seen.  For example, I think Alien was a great movie, but that situation will most likely never ever happen to me.  Blair Witch, though...I have been camping, and I have heard noises coming from the woods.  I know that can be spooky, even if it goes away immediately.  In those scenes where they were shining the lights on the cameras out the opening in the tent, I felt like I was right there with them, straining to find anything in the blackness.Anyway, I think this is a really great film, because it is the first one to actually scare me.  Most films that attempt to be scary end up just being funny, but not this one.Oh, and one more characteristic that it would help to have to really enjoy this movie...a strong stomach.

I for one loved this film.  I love that it was original ( and I say that knowing there are films out there like Cannibal Hollocaust and the Last Broadcast ), I love that it was documentary style, I love that it made you use your imagination and I loved the three actors in it. But I do have a few comments to make regarding the criticism.First off, the Blair Witch Project was a small film that like El Mariachi and Clerks was just hoping to get a video deal or perhaps a cable deal to recoup there budget.  So to say that this was film was over-hyped is a bit of a fallacy.  To me over hype is when a studio comes out and says a film that has been out for a few days ( take any Disney animated film ) is already a classic.  That is hype.  But when a film that no one really thought much of takes the film world by storm and it is us, the paying audience that gives it the kudos that it deserves, that is not hype, that is word of mouth.  So to say that this is a bad film because it was over hyped is just rubbish.  These two guys ( Sanchez and Myrick ) at the very least had an innovative idea and took what they remember as being scary from the classic horror films, and they combined it all into one scary-as-hell-play-with-your-mind-psychologically-tormenting-movie.  So it is not over hyped.Secondly) I can understand why some people don't like this film.  I know it is not for every taste.  But please stop and listen to yourselves when you do criticize it.  The majority of the people that don't like it say the same thing.  Where's the witch?  The only thing scary about this is that I spent 10 bucks on it.   Borrrrring.  Well if that is how you feel, then that is how you feel, but the least you could do is try to elaborate why it is that you feel the way you do about this film.  And also try to realize that perhaps the reason you are not scared or at least tense in the film is not because it isn't well made, it is just probably that you don't fear the same things that some of the rest of us do.  This film relies solely on playing with people's minds, and it did a hell of a job with mine.Finally, I love this film.  I love everything about it.  I think it is the best film that I have seen this summer and I admire the two directors for doing what they did.  To make a film that concentrates on atmosphere and mind games instead of blood and gore is a true testament to how much they must love the genre.  Think of classic Carpenter and Hitchcock.  They did much of the same thing.  There was hardly any blood in the shower scene in Psycho and very little in Halloween.  Blair Witch also has but one scene with blood in it, and yet it is one of the most effective scenes in the film because you are shocked by it.To people that don't enjoy this film, I honestly have pity for you, and I do not mean that in a pretentious I'm better than you kind of way.  I know we all have different tastes in horror films and that is okay, but if you could just feel the raw fear and experience that strange sensation when your heart races at the end of the film, or to actually go camping and stare into the darkness and wonder what that snapping twig is about ten feet away from you, you would really thank the guys for making this.  I love that this film could do that to me.  I love that it could get inside me like that.  And it's too bad that those of you that didn't feel that way, could, just for one moment.  That to me, is the power of film making.  To manipulate somone's emotions the way this film does is a treasure unto itself.Psycho had people in their generation always looking out of the shower. Jaws kept us out of the water.  Halloween kept us afraid of the night. Nightmare on Elm Street kept some of us from falling asleep.  Blair Witch will give you a paranoia about camping, for those of you that like the film that is.  My humble opinion, this is a 10\/10.  When people ask me what the scariest horror films I've ever seen are, I will respond with Halloween, Jaws, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left, Evil Dead, Amittyville Horror and the newest entry, The Blair Witch Project.  To me, and to many others, it is the epitome of fear.  And I love to be scared.
