There were more infantile plot twists than any good movie needs.  So many, in fact, I couldn't help but laugh at the scene transitions.  The oddest thing about this movie was that half of the acting was pretty good, but the other half was absolute horrible.  Take a wild guess at what part of the country the two dumbest soldiers are from?  Their Southern accents might give that away.  Yet another bash the only non-pc group left.  The overwhelming theme of the movie seemed to be `Killing, war, electrocution, breaking rules, losing your career, and violating peace-time treaties are all justified by the anticipation of lots of GOLD.'  Huh??That aside, Clooney was pretty good and Ice Cube was an excellent match for his role.  Mark Wahlberg is the most underrated actor today, mostly because the roles he ends up with (other than The Sixth Sense) are so astonishingly stupid, you question whether he actually has an agent.  His character in this has about as much brain power as my left foot, yet try to present him as being one of the more intelligent?DO NOT READ PAST HERE!  PLOT GIVEAWAYS.For instance, he is taken prisoner by the Iraqis and thrown into a bunker that's filled with a ton of stolen merchandise.  Surprise, surprise, there's a bag full of cell phones.  What does he do?  He presses 0 and asks for Operation Desert Storm and The big army in the desert.  Is this a cartoon?  Of course, he throws it to the ground in frustration destroying it.  Surprise, surprise, the very next phone he picks up works.  So he's about to call some number to get in touch with military officials and tell them where he is so they can rush in and rescue him, right? is what you're thinking.  No, he calls his WIFE somewhere in the U.S. and asks how the BABY is doing!!  Holy cow.It gets better.  Under shock-treatment torturous interrogation, the Iraqi goes into a long story about how he's so frustrated and angry at the Americans and the war because they destroyed his business, put his wife in a wheelchair, and killed his son.  Ok, that's fair.  I'd be angry too.  What does Marky Mark do?  He tells his interrogator his WIFE's name, his NEWBORN BABY's name, and all about how he FEELS not being able to see his family.  Uh, what?  I was expecting them to break into a verse of Kum-bah-yah next.The worst thing about the movie was the relationship between the American and Iraqi soldiers.  They acted like they were opposing sides in the middle of a televised football game and they didn't want to appear too mean in front of the camera.  Rarely did you get the feeling that these two groups were just on opposing sides in a deadly war.I cringe when I see movies like this that are so lacking in character, plot, and scenery that they have to fill every empty scene with ANYTHING politically correct.  They touch it all here too  racism towards blacks and Arabs, sexism, equal opportunities for women, gun control, violence, freedom of speech, ethnic cleansing, the War is bad theme stolen from The Thin Red Line, etc.  They even throw in the Rodney King video for good measure.

From the previews and clips I got a chance to see, I had expected either a sex romp or a super-trite bubble gum love story.  Quite happily I got neither.  Boys and Girls is a surprisingly touching romantic comedy that should please all ages. For the most part this movie follows the When Harry Met Sally movie formula.  The two meet four or five times in years spanning from grade school to college, each time with with that cute friction that only pure opposites can create.  Ryan (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) is a structured nerdy type who plans everything, while Jennifer (Claire Forlani) is a free spirit who takes each day as it comes.  They become close friends after Ryan is dumped by Jennifer's roommate Amy (Amanda Detmer), and their bond is put to the ultimate test when sex enters the picture.  The whole story is quite predictable, but thanks to a lot of clever writing (especially for the side characters) you'll probably never catch yourself checking your watch.The acting on almost all parts is very good.  Claire Forlani shines as Jennifer.  I questioned whether or not Claire could pass ass a bubbly college student since she's been playing characters in the 25-30 age category for the past few years, but she is marvelous.  It would have been easy to play Jennifer as a one sided college chick who goes through men like kleenex, but Forlani gives her many different shades, filling her out to a real person that most women could relate to.  She doesn't even fall into the trap of over-acting at the more dramatic points of the film.  That combined with her stunning looks make it impossible to take your eyes off her. Jason Biggs plays Hunter, Ryan's roommate who's too busy putting on acts and playing games to just be himself.  This is a variation of his character from American Pie, but Biggs never lets you down and creates a lot of the movie's funniest moments.  Amanda Detmer also creates a few laughs as Jennifer's quirky roommate with a taste for therapy.  Fans of Alyson Hannigan and Heather Donahue (Blair Witch) will only be disappointed with the brevity of their screen time (each only gets about 3 minutes).The only real dud here is Freddie Prinze, Jr.  He's hampered here mainly because by the time he's allowed to use his tricks (namely, a patented smirk and puppy dog eyes straight from the How to Make Teenage Girls Swoon catalog) we've lost all confidence that he'll make something of a part with wonderful possibilities.  It would have been nice if he had went out on a limb and played at least the first half movie as a dork, rather than a hottie hiding behind thick glasses, or if he could deliver a monologue using more than two facial expressions.  Luckily for us either Forlani or Biggs save the scenes he's dropping the ball on.  Knock, knock Freddie...your career is on its way out unless you try a new genre or stop running this one on auto-pilot.All and all, this movie should create a lot of good laughs and says a lot more about relationships than you would guess.  7 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2000","score":"","review":"  When I bought my ticket for Boy's and Girls, I didn't have high hopes.

Samuel L. Jackson is great in this, in fact he's the ultimate badass.  And it's not just carried by his acting talents.  I just saw Christian Bale recently in American Psycho whom I liked a lot and does a superb job in this as well.  Then you have supporting roles that all work well, although I didn't care for Busta Rhymes.  They also brought along the directing talents of John Singelton who has proven himself as a great director.  The screenplay also works although the language could have been toned down a bit, the F word is used so much even Quentin Tarantino would say that's a bit over the top.  But overall it does have some great moments and may just be placed on the top 10 movies to see this summer.

Other sci-fi films could learn a thing or two from Titan A.E, after all sci-fi in general naturally lends itself to the freedom of animation, where the extra-terrestrial and the extraordinary can be easily created on paper and now, the computer screen.The combination of CG and traditional cel animation works surprisingly well in Titan A.E., far better than any of the earlier teasers hinted at. In most instances, the 2D characters interact rather seamlessly with the mostly CG environments.

Nothing in film looks quite as good as the final confrontation among the gigantic ice crystals of the Tigrin system.

Quite the contrary to the inventive computer animation techniques, the characters are distinctly Bluthian in origin.  I could not help but think of Space Ace (Bluth's laserdisc follow up to the Dragon's Lair game) upon seeing the peanut gallery of critters Bluth has created for this film.  While sometimes at odds with the CG environments, the 2D animated characters give the movie its heart, and are certainly more believable than any rendered characters that may have been substituted (only Pixar has seemingly been able to create halfway believable humans using computer animation).There's already plenty here to crown Titan A.E. the best sci-fi movie to be released this year, but not only does this animated feature quash films like Mission to Mars and Battlefield Earth underfoot with it's imaginative scenes, it also tops them (quite easily, I might add) in story and characters.  Titan A.E.'s plotline may not be the best or most original space opera out there (it often blatantly borrow from Star Wars), but it certainly is more imaginative and engaging than most sci fi features these days. Considering that Titan A.E. is a space opera, its characters are surprisingly well-defined and unique in their respective personalities, thanks in part to some fine voice acting and intelligent dialogue.  Only Bill Pullman as Korso gives the most questionable performance of the flick (Pullman too often delivers his lines without any real sense of emotion).It is overwhelmingly satisfying to see an animated film that does not cater to the age 4-12 bracket, and is instead more concerned about spinning a thrilling sci-fi yarn. Indeed, Titan A.E. posseses a much darker tone than most audiences are used to in an animated feature.

The problems of transporting the plays, essentially minimal and cerebral, to moving images are daunting and I appreciate a novel attempt. Even if it fails, it is likely to fail interestingly. Of Shakespeare's plays, the comedies are about situations, the tragedies about ideas. Neither of those translates well to film. But the histories, lesser plays in my opinion, are about characters. Now, character exploration is inherently cinematic, a natural for the screen. especially with as many speeches to the camera, confidences with the audience, this play provides.So I went into this prepared, nay yearning to like it, even like its failures. I don't mind resetting, cutting and such. My favorite adaptation is Greenaway's `Prospero's Books,' to give you some idea of the slack I cut.But this simply doesn't work, either as film or as Shakespeare.There are interesting, even clever sets most of the time, but they are not used well. The battles, even the minor intrigues don't compel -- we always are distracted by the cheap staginess of it all. Some actors are good enough, some rather dreadful, but none of it works because the troop doesn't have a center. They could, should have relied on Shakespeare. But they didn't. Instead, there is a strange pastiche of camp, satire, earnest emotion. It is as if each actor had their own idea of the nature of the experiment, or joke and failed to tell the others.Someone, perhaps here, thought that if Shakespeare were alive, this is how he would have done it. Nay. He was first and foremost an actor, a skilled dramatist. He would have concentrated on story, on developing motivations, on conflicts, on duplicity. None of that has any citizenship here. He would never, ever pass off a tank blasting through a wall as a dramatic effect.All faults would be forgiven if the lead were sufficiently powerful to compel us, perhaps an early Wells. But McKellan just doesn't have the stuff. He can handle the language, such as he kept, but he lacks the projection, the charm Richard commanded.

The problems of transporting the plays, essentially minimal and cerebral, to moving images are daunting and I appreciate a novel attempt. Even if it fails, it is likely to fail interestingly. Of Shakespeare's plays, the comedies are about situations, the tragedies about ideas. Neither of those translates well to film. But the histories, lesser plays in my opinion, are about characters. Now, character exploration is inherently cinematic, a natural for the screen. especially with as many speeches to the camera, confidences with the audience, this play provides.So I went into this prepared, nay yearning to like it, even like its failures. I don't mind resetting, cutting and such. My favorite adaptation is Greenaway's `Prospero's Books,' to give you some idea of the slack I cut.But this simply doesn't work, either as film or as Shakespeare.There are interesting, even clever sets most of the time, but they are not used well. The battles, even the minor intrigues don't compel -- we always are distracted by the cheap staginess of it all. Some actors are good enough, some rather dreadful, but none of it works because the troop doesn't have a center. They could, should have relied on Shakespeare. But they didn't.

The writers for this film seem to have been too lazy to try to write their stories to complement the music, and instead decided to chop up the music in order to fit it in with their story line.  Laziness is the only explanation I can think of for doing this.  While this flaw was not absent in the original film (Stravinsky's Rite of Spring was reordered extensively, Moussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain was altered some to fold into Schubert's Ave Maria, and Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker was reordered.), it was done VERY carefully and with, what I thought, respect for the composers' vision.  In this Fantasia, though, the music seems quite secondary to the film's conception.  Stravinsky's Firebird has a fantasy oriented story to it that would have been right up Disney's alley, but they went with some different concept that involved omitting all but 3 movements, and they were chopped and cut heavily.This is not to say that the movie has no appeal.

No pro critic ever complains about a cliche plot when a classic novel is made into a new movie.

I believe Richard Wagner would have loved this film for its story (not for much of its music, though). In fact, with Wagner composing the soundtrack, this could have been a really, really wonderful film experience. Incidentally, this is why Star Wars movies are so good, but we already know that.
