Idiotic bad guy has crappy plan to take over world, and Bond stops him some how. I've always hated Bond and have no idea why people get into these crappy films. So when I saw Tomorrow Never Dies in theaters, I was surprised that I liked it. Sure, the story once again is about a guy who wants to control the media and print false stories and start wars, but at least this Bond goes all out in the action department. Pierce Brosnan is my favorite Bond, which is not saying much because the four others are pathetic. I hated the other three Bonds Brosnan did, but at least this one entertained me for such time.What is nice about this Bond is that they decided to get Michelle Yeoh instead of generic girl who spells her specialty with her name (Pussy anyone?). She did a fairly good job in this as well, even though her English isn't perfect. Brosnan still remains the best Bond because he has that certain look to him. I never bought the other four and that's probably why the films didn't click for me. The bad guy played by Johathan Pryce was generic, but I still didn't mind his performance.But this Bond succeeds because it has nice eye candy from beginning to end, from some great car stunts to that great sequence on the stealth boat. I'm not saying that this film is great in all aspects, but it easily is the only way the Bond films should be done. Its a shame that Pierce is gone, because I thought he had the best run playing this part. But hopefully they learn their lesson and pick someone who actually is worth seeing on the screen.This is the only James Bond film I will watch because I know that it has enough throwaway action fun that the other Bonds seem to be void of.

Some even seem to see that as enough reason not to like this movie. Personally I wouldn't go that far. For as far as I know the only comparison that can be made between the two is the fact that its story deals about animals and that most actors from the first movie also played a role in the second one. I don't think that's reason enough to like or dislike this movie and since I try to see it as a new and separate movie, I'll not make any further comparison between the two.When a massive company - which is active in all kinds of industrial and commercial branches - takes over the failing London Marwood Zoo, the cruel tycoon Rod McCain is only interested in bringing more business to the zoo or in case that isn't possible, to sell it to Japanese owners who will turn it into a golf course. Octopus Inc. (that's the well-chosen name of the company) hires a new manager, called Rollo Lee, who almost immediately comes up with a plan that will definitely attract more customers. The zoo will have to get rid of all animals that aren't ferocious or dangerous enough, because according to him the audience is only interested in dangerous things. This new policy shocks the zookeepers, who will do anything possible to make him change ideas. But in the meantime Rod McCain wants to see results and when he doesn't get them quickly enough, he sends in his son Vince McCain and the up-and-coming business executive Willa Weston. They will have to take over control from Rollo Lee, but once they are there, Willa's views on zoo management completely change. While Vince comes up with a lot of merchandise, fake robotic animals, a lot of publicity boards all over the place,... she starts to realize the true value of these animals. Together with Rollo and the staff, she tries to prevent that the McCain's will completely destroy this zoo...Overall the quality of this movie is quite good and the acting has a lot to do with that of course. I guess not everybody appreciates it as much as I do, but I really like John Cleese's style and in my opinion his interaction with Jamie Lee Curtis really works. Also interesting is Kevin Kline in his double role, Michael Palin as the bug-loving zookeeper,... I'm certainly not going to say that it's the best comedy I've ever seen, but I had a good time with it. Even though not all the jokes and gags worked perfectly, there were enough good ones to make me forget about that. And being a marketeer myself, I had even more fun with the jokes about the publicity. In our business it's very easy to go too far and that's something that was shown very well in this movie.

Personally I love all animals, but many people don't and may therefor not be that interested in this movie. Seeing so many of them in this movie, together with those fine and famous actors, really gave me a good time though.

But this one is just boring.I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.If it is, it's flat-lining.I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three Star Wars movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up. When Episode I was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans. And everyone in between.Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (THX 1138), period action-adventure summer matinées (Indianda Jones), sci-fi space operas (Star Wars, of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (Willow).

Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw Episode I in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.The first released chapter in the Star Wars saga (Episode IV A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In Episode II, I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, Gettysburg and the like.The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later. I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from Life As A House (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in Episode I. She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen.

Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his Howard the Duck. But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (exterme in any way) is a likely candidate for the cult following. But this one is just boring.I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.If it is, it's flat-lining.I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three Star Wars movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up. When Episode I was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans. And everyone in between.Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (THX 1138), period action-adventure summer matinées (Indianda Jones), sci-fi space operas (Star Wars, of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (Willow). His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.So Lucas brought on Johnathan Hales (The Scropian King and TV's Young Indiana Jones Chronicles) as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw Episode I in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.The first released chapter in the Star Wars saga (Episode IV A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In Episode II, I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, Gettysburg and the like.The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later. I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from Life As A House (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in Episode I. She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakesphere-style acting and mood for a theater performance.It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's L.A. Law and NYPD Blue fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second. And all this could've great for another great Star Wars classics. But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had.

As I see it a good film is comprised of a few static elements.First of all a good film is based on a good story and Alien has a very gripping albeit slow paced story that ultimately is as gripping as stories where the story is faster paced (e.g. Starwars). The story by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusset is innovative and as previously stated gripping and this combined with a brilliant flow makes the two hours the film lasts seem like much less. The story also contains one of the most memorable scenes in modern film history the chest burster scene and the little twist with Ian Holm at the end of the movie is pure genius.The second thing a good film needs is good acting and the acting in Alien is still top notch. Even though I'm not a big fan of Sigourney Weaver I admit that she does very well in this film and judging from her acting in this film its certainly understandable why she went on to become an icon in the movie business. Secondly we have Tom Skerrit also not one of my favorite actors but his sequence in the ventilation system truly shows the depth of his talent. He actually seems genuinely scared.

Now the second part was shown on television and I was curious about the fact whether I would like the sequel as much as the original version. Normally I don't like sequels all that much because they don't add anything to the story, but this movie is different...The second part of the Back to the Future-movies picks up where the first one ended as we see how Doc suddenly comes back from the future and asks Marty and Jennifer to come with him to 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. After doing so, they return to their own time, discovering that something has drastically changed in their neighborhood. Violence, murder, gambling,... have become common practice in the once so quiet neighborhood. This happened because in 2015 Biff Tannen stole the Delorean, taking with him a book with the results of every sports event from the 1950's till 2000. He gave it to his younger version in the fifties, using it to become incredibly rich. In order to restore the present, Marty and Doc will have to return to 1955 so they can retrieve the book...Despite the fact that I feared that this would be an easy way of making even more money out of the success of the first movie, I must admit that this isn't really the case. Not only have they added the element of the future and the changed present, they have also added a new part to what happened in the first film. It's true that they have re-used several parts from that first movie, but it's never boring to watch, because they have always used another point of view, instead of just using the same footage. If they hadn't done that, I would probably not have liked it a bit, but now I did.Once again the acting in this movie was more than OK. The performances of Michael J.

In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic\/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator, Joe Gillis, who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood. Fate, or maybe just odd luck, pits him into the driveway of a big, almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight. He meets Norma Desmond, whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star. I am big, she says in one of her trademark lines, it's the pictures that have gotten small. She confides in Gillis, after he tells her who he is and why he's there (hiding out as it were), that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her 'comeback'. He very reluctantly agrees to do it, and very soon gets sucked up into her world, becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends. But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations\/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's\/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the end scene at the beginning, and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character. And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird.

But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations\/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's\/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the end scene at the beginning, and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character. And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird. I can't wait to see it again.

This big budget trash went up against that other big budget trash, Dante's Peak, back in 1997; and even though this one obviously had more to work with; it still managed to come off even shorter than Pierce Brosnan's dreary vehicle. Featuring all manner of great special effects and autopilot performances from all concerned; Volcano subscribes to the classic 'disaster movie' profile, and shows this further by ensuring that the plot makes about as much sense as blowing up your house to keep it from being robbed. Tommy Lee Jones struts his stuff as some bloke who works for the government, and Anne Heche gets down and dirty as someone who knows about volcanoes. When a volcano erupts in Los Angeles (where'd that come from?), it's up to these two (and a load of firemen etc) to stop the lava in its tracks before Tommy Lee Jones' daughter is killed! Oh...and the rest of LA. The story is set up in the usual way; someone notices something, blah blah, he's ignored, blah blah, disaster happens, blah blah, the day is saved. Blah. Blah.This film is completely pointless, and is obviously only there for entertainment value. Still, even as entertainment, this falls flat on it's face. Obviously, in a film like this; you've got to expect some over the top sequences and silly goings on (such as a sequence that sees a train worker save one of his friends...), but the film continually throws stupid ideas into the plot, and before long it just gets so silly that it's impossible to care about it. Quite how Tommy Lee Jones has managed to maintain a semi-respectable reputation after all these years is astounding. To me, his name has become synonymous with 'stupid load of rubbish'. He might have the ability to portray a rugged action character, but he's unbelievably corny and doesn't make a good lead. Anne Heche stars opposite him and just does what you'd expect the 'female with brains' to do. Don Cheadle, who met with high acclaim after his performance in the massively overrated Hotel Rwanda, gives a very mundane performance, but I'd still rather watch him than either of the two leads. On the whole, if you're going into this expecting some brainless fun; you'll be pleased to know that it is brainless, but unfortunately it's about as much fun as an actual volcanic eruption.

But than again, is there any director who has made nothing but excellent movies? I can't think of one, but if you do, please let me know. But let's talk about this The Color Purple now. I first saw it on DVD when I was looking for the movies Trois Couleurs Rouge \/ Blanc \/ Bleu and this one stood right behind them. I didn't know much about it, but after reading the text on the box, I was intrigued. I didn't buy it, but I decided to put it on my To See-list and now that it was finally shown on television, I immediately taped and watched it.The movie tells the story of Celie, a 14 year old black girl who lives in the early 1900's with her abusive father and her younger sister. She is pregnant for the second time from her own father and when immediately after giving birth, a man comes to ask for the hand of Nettie, her better looking sister, her father tells the man that he can't have the youngest, but that he wouldn't mind if he took Celie with him, saying that she is damaged goods, but still able to work hard. She goes with the man and nothing really changes in her life. The man is as abusive as her father and only thinks about another woman Shug Avery. But when Shug finally arrives, a lot is about to change and it doesn't take long before Celie finally dares to stand up against everybody who has done her wrong in the past, finally taking her life in her own hands and doing everything to become happy...A movie that takes about two and a half hours to completely explain its story is something that you don't get too often and I'm sure that many people don't like it a bit. They want some easy entertainment that takes only 90 minutes to tell what it has to say and that's something that they certainly will not get in this movie.

This time there was absolutely no humor around his performance or character, making it possible for the man to show that he's able to do a lot more with his talents than what most people know of him.Overall this is a very good drama that will probably not appeal to some people, just because of its length. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, because I'm already used to watch longer movies, but I'm afraid that several people will stop watching it after one hour and a half.

To many anime fans this title may be immediately recognized as one of the so-called classic anime of all time. I myself knew it held this distinction but never knew why as I had never had the opportunity to watch it. When I finally got hold of it I read a couple of reviews on the net about it. They stated that it was a very confusing film, which had no clear story line and switched between story lines too much. Now one of my friends happened to have a go at watching it before I did. He had his very young son on his lap and randomly flicked through the film to see what the animation was like (I'm guessing that's the reason anyway, since I do that myself). He happened to come upon a scene where a girl is getting raped. Since his son was watching the film with him, he immediately stopped the film and messaged me asking if I had watched it and did I know the content. When he told me what he had seen I was slightly shocked that a film, which contained a scene such as this, could be labeled a classic. (However there are films such as Ninja Scroll and Wicked City which contain scenes such as this and are still viewed as classics, so I wasn't totally surprised.) I knew then I had to watch the film, if only to decide whether to keep it or get rid of it I'm a hoarder so this is a very important decision!). While I was watching the film I had in mind the rape scene so my viewing was slightly tainted. The film itself is what I would classify as a psycho-thriller? It was slightly creepy\/scary in parts but in a mental freak out kind of way. The story did kind of flick around a bit but from the way I understand the film, that was the intention. Towards the end of the film you are left questioning whether what you have been shown as reality is in fact reality or could it be that it is a film within a film (a tribute to Shakespeare's Hamlet perhaps?) It was in the vein of M. Night Shyamalan's movies such as 'The Village'. There was a lot of implied 'scariness' and encouraged your brain to make up the rest. It was slightly violent, which brings me to the first rape scene. This was the one my friend had seen. It was disturbing mainly because I am deeply against ANY sort of violence against women let alone something like this. It was justified (I believe) in the context of the movie and was interesting because the guy raping the main character actually says I'm sorry and he does actually mean it because *SPOLIER* filming the scene for a movie. Having watched the film in its entirety and now reflecting, it can also be seen as a trigger point for the events which then unfold. One of the main characters managers is watching the scene unfold on one of the preview screens and you can tell that she feels the main characters pain. So much so that you could almost believe that she is feeling the pain herself&#133;I can't say anymore without ruining the movie completely as once you know the twist the movie is not worth watching, another M. Night Shyamalan trait. There is a second rape scene in the movie, towards the end, though not as justified as the first. This one is slightly more disturbing as there is no audience this time. While upon reflection this scene seems important for the conclusion of the film I cannot pinpoint the exact reason. Possibly it highlights the mental confusion in the film at its climax? I would love it if someone who has watched this film could maybe clarify the reason for this scene or even just throw up a suggestion. Despite the two scenes I have described in detail I did actually enjoy the film and would recommend it. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy anime and enjoy physiological thrillers then you may enjoy it.

To many anime fans this title may be immediately recognized as one of the so-called classic anime of all time. I myself knew it held this distinction but never knew why as I had never had the opportunity to watch it. When I finally got hold of it I read a couple of reviews on the net about it. They stated that it was a very confusing film, which had no clear story line and switched between story lines too much. Now one of my friends happened to have a go at watching it before I did. He had his very young son on his lap and randomly flicked through the film to see what the animation was like (I'm guessing that's the reason anyway, since I do that myself). He happened to come upon a scene where a girl is getting raped. Since his son was watching the film with him, he immediately stopped the film and messaged me asking if I had watched it and did I know the content. When he told me what he had seen I was slightly shocked that a film, which contained a scene such as this, could be labeled a classic. (However there are films such as Ninja Scroll and Wicked City which contain scenes such as this and are still viewed as classics, so I wasn't totally surprised.)

Tarantino nails it; the next one, Pulp Fiction was more ambitious and had more bucks, but this had the advantage of a fresh approach, a new way of presenting cinema as, dare we say it, art. The actors went along with him, all the way, to the smallest detail. Watch the end of the introductory breakfast scene, after Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explains his non-tipping philosophy. Joe (Tierney) returns to the table and commands Pink to pay up anyway and Pink finally complies. Eddie (Penn) sits very solemnly during this point, with his hands under his chin, as if in deep thought. What's he thinking about? Could it be he thinks I should've forced Pink to pay? Is it times like these when I'm still the kid and my dad's the man? This is just a 2-second shot.Examples like that may be why a film such as this gets better every time I see it. I don't remember much about what I thought of it when I first saw it back in '92; probably that it was interesting. I thought it was more interesting the 2nd time I saw it. By the 3rd time, I was thinking, this is fantastic. I've just seen it again, probably for the ninth time and it's better than ever. Returning to Penn's performance as Eddie most fans of this film usually point out Buscemi as the comical, quick Pink, or the cool Keitel as Mr.White, or the unpredictably cool Madsen as Blonde (Blonde-what a color,eh?-you psycho!). Penn gives the performance of his career here. He switches from daddy's boy to Blonde-type menace in the space of a few frames. He's probably the most creative with Tarantino's lengthy dialog, juggling pressure from his boss\/dad, supervising the cadre of crooks and trying to make phone conversations interesting. And Tierney, struggling in a B or C movie career all his long life, has the role of his lifetime here thanks to Tarantino; the entire scene of him giving out the color names to the boys couldn't have been played better.What is really thrilling, however, is how Madsen still manages to surprise and chill after all these years. I watch him now and questions start to percolate in my brain was he on drugs when he 'acted' this role? Is he slightly insane in real life? He really is amazing here - so much so that the few years following this movie all his roles were overshadowed by this performance. I almost believe Madsen discovered a new method style of acting back then, which didn't take because no one else knew how to do it.So why not a full ten stars? I have a few problems with Roth; nothing too serious - he's dead on in some scenes, such as when he tells himself not to chicken out in the mirror; other times, he's trying hard to hide an accent or just trying too hard. Thing is, in most ways, he has the most difficult role; he has to act like a criminal being acted by someone else being acted by Roth. I'm also aware of accusations regarding the older film City on Fire which hints this work may be slightly imitative of at least one sequence unlike, say Pulp Fiction which, despite appearances, is wholly original.

He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction, and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mind-game with his friend. At the same time, four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.The first of them is a college friend Charlie (Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1) who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), whom he marries, and a sinister figure William Parcher (Ed Harris). Parcher has special designs for Nash he wants him to use his keen code-cracking skills for special top-secret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omni-present Parcher, who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin, he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into full-fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia, instead of moving on, forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question, in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real -- the way he introduces Charlie, Marcee, and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.And then there are the performances.

He is, right now, the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive head-first into the roles he plays.

If anything, he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around, and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hard-pressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in full-fledged conversations, and the hippie who mocks him, unnoticed, expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius, but one who has become damaged goods.Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism, her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense, she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene, when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on, undeterred.

It's neat to watch each of the unique characters go thru their paces as they wind thru the story coming to each of their conclusions. Charles Bronson is great as Harmonica, the man who plays before he speaks. He has a story to tell that comes out in the last 15 minutes of the movie in the way of a flashback. Most of Sergio Leone's characters don't speak a lot except for Jason Robards' character who is the most un-Sergio-leone-like but his character even works for the most part. Fonda plays a ruthless killer who's looking to gain the property of the widow played by Claudia Cardinale and along the way gains respect for Harmonica despite their extreme differences. Cardinale is unpredictable as the widow who's just trying to do what's right for herself and holds her own very well. This epic western could only have been better if it never ended. A sequel would have been great just to see how the remaining characters carry on and to see how the new town of Sweetwater exists with Cardinale at the helm. Bravo Mr. Leone!!

Even though the man hasn't really been able to prove a lot with his work as a director, I must say that I almost always appreciate him as an actor. He's perhaps not the most popular actor in Hollywood, but in my opinion he sure is one of the better ones.In this movie he plays the role of Karl Childers, a grown, but simple man who is released from the psychiatric hospital where he has been hospitalized since the age of twelve. He had to stay in that hospital for so long because he murdered his own mother and her lover, believing that they were doing something wrong. He returns to the town where he lived the first twelve years of his life and it doesn't take long for him to get a job as a mechanic, fixing all kinds of small motors at a local repair shop. In the same town he also meets Frank, a young and friendly boy who immediately seems to like this strange man. Soon Karl is invited by Frank's mother to stay in their garage, much against the will of her alcoholic and abusive boyfriend Doyle. While Karl's friendship with Frank gets stronger, the tension between him and Doyle keeps building up, until reaching its final climax...Now that I've finally seen this movie, I can only say that it's too bad that I didn't give it a try earlier. Especially thanks to the magnificent performance by Billy Bob Thornton, this is a movie that is more than just worth a watch. But also the other actors like Dwight Yoakam, Natalie Canerday,... did a very good job. The entire movie feels very realistic, is quite sober and never tries to be too dramatic. This is the kind of movie that could have become very preachy, but it hasn't and that's something that I really appreciate. Add to this some good directing and you know that Thornton has done a very nice job with this movie.This isn't exactly a typical Hollywood movie, not in its story and certainly not in its approach towards the subject. This could easily have become some kind of cheesy TV-movie, but Billy Bob Thornton has made a very good movie out of it instead. I really appreciated his work as a director, actor and writer in this movie, liked the story and was intrigued by the acting of all the actors. That's why I give it a 7.5\/10, maybe even an 8\/10.

This version was chopped up so much it was confusing and very disappointing. Of course, one does not know this until one views the DVD release. In the U.S. version, Hooper must have bowed to pressure that the movie was not scary enough so he had composer Henry Mancini change much of his music, go back to London, rerecord, and even then the producers or Hooper wasn't happy. Mancini said enough! and Hooper used other composers. Then he cut the film to pieces and moved bits around. Once I viewed the DVD, I realized the original release was a MESS. I much appreciated the campiness of the movie and do not see it as some sci-fi horror flick. Much of the acting is over the top (I think the leads were miscast - I like Railsback but why he was chosen as the obsessive and tormented character, I don't know and Firth was the campiest of all.) The story goes from a space sci-fi movie, to a vampire movie, then concludes as a zombie movie. Way too much but fascinating all the same. I don't think all movies have to be Golden Palm winners at Cannes and should sometimes be silly but really fun. I think the original intention was to craft a film that was more adventure than horror. But after production, they decided to go horror (for whatever reason, perhaps audience reaction to previews, which always mucks things up) and that actually made the film worse because of the last-minute amendments. I prefer the adventure version on DVD. My favorite aspect is, of course, Henry Mancini's score, which played in full, demonstrates the original intent of adventure. I also like that they restored the dialog and the original opening credits, which actually is still not complete. I remember the U.S. video and when I saw the DVD, I could not understand why they removed so much. The dumbest lines are the best! One of the grand things about DVDs, especially for us film buffs, is that they give us the opportunity to see the original vision -- as if we were denied this in the theaters. Unlike other reviewers, I would like to see even more footage added (I have a CD of all the music and listening to so many cues, it's evident that much was still cut, even on the DVD.) If I won the lottery, I'd restore everything myself... the original space sequence was supposed to be free of most dialog with the astronauts taking a look at the alien ship. Zombies don't have to be running around and bombs don't have to be going off to make a film interesting. Be patient, don't rush things.Another crappy thing about the U.S. video version is the horrid sound effects which I suppose were added to try to frighten the audience. The added miserable sound effects become quickly annoying, such as when the blood-lady forms in the helicopter and the dead bodies are screeching. Thankfully, this is toned down a lot in the DVD. When I watched the video a long time ago with some friends, their only comment was God, this movie is loud.So here's an idea.

This film is very much a product of the sixties and, like many things from the decade, will always be fondly remembered. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, men of substance and substance abuse, wrote the film together and Hopper directed it. These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties, and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time. The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else. It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including, most notably, George Hanson; an offbeat lawyer, played by the great Jack Nicholson.The American Dream has always been about freedom. But like George Hanson says; it's one thing to talk about being free, but something else entirely to actually be it. That's the theme of the entire movie, and the way that it plays out, and the ending especially, aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it. The acting performances are a big part of the movie, and the two leads; Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper stick out the most. The two actors brilliantly get into their characters, and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters. Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show. It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time. Even here, he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career. Last but not least, another great thing about Easy Rider is the music. Music was, of course, a big thing in the sixties; and it's a big thing about this movie. Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes, and it's very cool indeed. On the whole, this film is an out and out classic.

The two actors brilliantly get into their characters, and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters. Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show. It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time. Even here, he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career. Last but not least, another great thing about Easy Rider is the music. Music was, of course, a big thing in the sixties; and it's a big thing about this movie. Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes, and it's very cool indeed. On the whole, this film is an out and out classic.

This film is very much a product of the sixties and, like many things from the decade, will always be fondly remembered. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, men of substance and substance abuse, wrote the film together and Hopper directed it. These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties, and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time. The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else. It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including, most notably, George Hanson; an offbeat lawyer, played by the great Jack Nicholson.The American Dream has always been about freedom. But like George Hanson says; it's one thing to talk about being free, but something else entirely to actually be it. That's the theme of the entire movie, and the way that it plays out, and the ending especially, aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it.
