I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when it first came out and I loved it at the time.  I even rented it on video a few times later on that year.  It was a good date movie and really played up on its modern day fairy tale aspect.But after watching it again last night, I realized that that's all it really is.  Don't get me wrong, I still like the movie, but you've got to admit it's just a bit too glowing, even for a love story.  The main characters always seem to say just the right things and we are never led to question them in any way.  They're just a bit too perfect, even when they have to display their obligatory flaws.  I personally thought Annette Bening's performance was average for her, but this is definitely one of the more likeable performances given by Michael Douglas.  The supporting cast was the highlight for me with Michael J. Fox delivering the perfect performance in a role he's obviously custom-tailored for and David Paymer stealing all the best one-liners.And yes, this film is politically-biased (kind of unavoidable in a film about the President).  But even I got a bit irritated with the unrealistically sappy political situation toward the end of the movie (and I used to do volunteer work for an economic rights group similar to the one in which Annette Bening's character works).  The way opposite ends of the political spectrum are presented is just too one-sided.  Much of my extended family is staunchly conservative, but they're not the back room, cigar smoking, close-minded stooges that are depicted in this film.  Maybe conservative politicians are like that, but since they're the only depiction we see of conservatives in this movie, it's not a very fair representation.I'll still watch this movie when it comes on because I do enjoy it.  But if it happens to come on as the same time as Reitman's other Presidential film 'Dave' then I'll definitely opt for the latter.

I liked the genre in general, and I had heard good reviews about this film from people I knew.  However, I did not expect it to be nearly as good as it was.Several elements made this film a success the plot, the acting, the special effects, and the filming staff.First, the plot was excellent.  It was well thought out, and I was not expecting the ending.  Usually, I find most films lately to be predictable with minimal plot and a high dependency on special effects and explosions to sell themselves.  This film was different.  It led you one way only to let you know at the very end that your perception of the situation was way off course.  The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested in seeing more, and I actually watched it a second time a week later just to catch everything that I had missed the first time.The acting was excellent.Haley Joel Osment puts forth an excellent, believable performance as the tormented Cole Sear who claims that he can see dead people.  His performance is so real that you forget that he is acting.  He definitely is a young actor with a lot of potential, and I hope he wins the Best Supporting Actor award for this movie.Bruce Willis shows his full range of acting abilities in this film as well. He portrays a Dr. Malcolm Crowe, successful child counsellor who is troubled by the fact that he ultimately failed on one of his former patients.  He is using Cole Sear, a young boy with similar problems, as a way to (in his mind) compensate for his former failure.  Bruce Willis should have been nominated for Best Actor for this film.Toni Collette does an excellent job as Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.  She deserves to receive the Best Supporting Actress award.  She portrays a mother who is perplexed by her son's unwillingness to communicate with her and by her perceived lack of esteem in her mother's eyes.Olivia Williams also does a great job as Anna Crowe.  She believably portrays a wife who is depressed by her seemingly degenerating relationship with her husband, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.Donnie Walhberg's brief (pardon the pun!) cameo at the beginning of the film is spooky to watch as well.The special effects of the film were well done.  The film really built up suspense in various key parts.  The makeup and props for the dead people were done very well.Finally, the staff did a good job making this movie.  M. Night Shyamalan did a good job directing this film.  The music complemented its respective scenes very well.Overall, this is a good film with lots of philosophical depth.

He portrays a Dr. Malcolm Crowe, successful child counsellor who is troubled by the fact that he ultimately failed on one of his former patients.  He is using Cole Sear, a young boy with similar problems, as a way to (in his mind) compensate for his former failure.  Bruce Willis should have been nominated for Best Actor for this film.Toni Collette does an excellent job as Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.  She deserves to receive the Best Supporting Actress award.  She portrays a mother who is perplexed by her son's unwillingness to communicate with her and by her perceived lack of esteem in her mother's eyes.Olivia Williams also does a great job as Anna Crowe.  She believably portrays a wife who is depressed by her seemingly degenerating relationship with her husband, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.Donnie Walhberg's brief (pardon the pun!) cameo at the beginning of the film is spooky to watch as well.The special effects of the film were well done.  The film really built up suspense in various key parts.  The makeup and props for the dead people were done very well.Finally, the staff did a good job making this movie.  M. Night Shyamalan did a good job directing this film.  The music complemented its respective scenes very well.Overall, this is a good film with lots of philosophical depth.  I definitely recommended it to anyone.

Denzel Washington has been in the movie business for years and yet Hollywood never seems to give him the same respect that is given to actors like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. But when you listen to fellow actors speak about Washington, it is clear that he is regarded as an extremely talented actor and one of the best at his craft which brings me to his latest movie, The Hurricane.        This is a movie based on the true accounts of Rubin Carter, a professional boxer in the 1960s accused of murdering three people in a bar. The evidence surrounding the case was sketchy at best in the original trial yet in an attempt to satisfy public dissention and with the aid of an ethically challenged detective, a swift sentence was handed down to Carter and an innocent fan that happened to be with him when he was picked up by the police. The story paints the impression that Carter will spend the rest of his life in prison and flashes forward several years before we meet a young boy by the name of Lesra Martin. Living with a group of Canadians in Toronto, the young boy from Brooklyn visits a book market where he buys his first book; one written by Rubin Carter. A correspondence between Carter and Martin ensues not too long afterwards and after befriending the boxer, the boy and the Canadians decide that they are going to help Carter out of prison.        As with most movies based on facts, not all of it is going to be absolutely accurate. What you will see here is only one perspective and in this case, the perspective of a person wrongfully imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit. As such, you are going to see facts displayed from that perspective which may or may not be objective. Quite often, while I was sitting there, I did have questions as the story glossed over areas that did not related to the main character. For a movie that is primarily dialogue and storytelling, The Hurricane was inconsistent and sometimes incomplete. The director (Norman Jewison) would bring up situations at certain points and not really elaborate on them laterwards leaving the audience hanging on that particular issue. The impression that I got was that Jewison was trying to fit too much into the movie. He essentially tried to cover 25 years worth of facts in 3 hours and what resulted was a movie that was somewhat rushed.        What saved this movie was the performance of Washington. He took what he was given and did a fabulous job. I found myself riveted whenever he was speaking and couldn't help but gain a new respect (which I already had plenty of) for him. The young man who plays Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) also did an excellent job. The chemistry between Washington and Shannon was very evident and they do manage to tug on some heart strings. The rest of the cast was pretty good but unfortunately due to incomplete storytelling their performances seem to be lacking.        Overall, if you want to see some brilliant acting from Washington, then definitely see this movie. He has already won a Golden Globe for Best Male Actor earlier this year for his portrayal of Rubin Carter and I suspect that he will be favored to win for the Oscars. Hopefully Hollywood gives him the respect that he deserves after this performance. As for pure entertainment value, this movie does manage to tell the story but you may feel a bit lacking when you leave but I still do recommend it purely from a human interest perspective.

I'd never even heard of it before, and the unimaginative title and unremarkable cast didn't do anything special to entice my interest.  So I wasn't expecting very much.

But all at the service of what, exactly? The only depth on display in this movie is in the color scheme. The story is incoherent and downright embarrassing, and Cruise is all wrong as the protagonist. Nicolle Kidman fares somewhat better, as she gets some tour-de-force monologues (which she pulls off quite well) and then is pushed aside for most of the picture, where all the slipshod plotting takes place. Actually, plotting is far too generous a term. Things happen - but that's about the only relation this movie has to an actual plot. Even so, I could see myself enjoying it as an elaborate dream in another director's hands - say, Coppola's, or Lars von Trier's, even (maybe especially) Ken Russel's, someone with a more sensuous or enveloping visual style. But Kubrick has always been far too clinical for that - his images, no matter how stunning or well-lit, are always relentlessly flat and literal; they carry no meaning or suggestiveness beyond their rather prosaic surfaces. As such, the orgy scene in this movie (to take just one example) doesn't play like a bizarre hallucination, but rather as documentary footage, which forces you to ask immediately Who exactly has orgies like this?! no doubt breaking the mood Kubrick is at pains to set. In the theater where I saw it, laughter was the overwhelming response to this scene, not enraptured awe.  But at least that scene kept your interest (if only to see how embarrassingly over the edge Kubrick was going to go), which is more than can be said for a whole slew of others, such as the ones between Cruise and two separate prostitutes, the one in the costume shop, and most especially the one at the climax of the movie between Cruise and Sydney Pollack. The flat-footedness of the direction and acting in these scenes is truly astonishing for a mainstream motion picture, not to mention one made by a supposed master moments are drawn out endlessly, pauses exist that you could drive a truck through, and each scene's reason for being is highly suspect.

Actually, plotting is far too generous a term. Things happen - but that's about the only relation this movie has to an actual plot. Even so, I could see myself enjoying it as an elaborate dream in another director's hands - say, Coppola's, or Lars von Trier's, even (maybe especially) Ken Russel's, someone with a more sensuous or enveloping visual style. But Kubrick has always been far too clinical for that - his images, no matter how stunning or well-lit, are always relentlessly flat and literal; they carry no meaning or suggestiveness beyond their rather prosaic surfaces. As such, the orgy scene in this movie (to take just one example) doesn't play like a bizarre hallucination, but rather as documentary footage, which forces you to ask immediately Who exactly has orgies like this?! no doubt breaking the mood Kubrick is at pains to set. In the theater where I saw it, laughter was the overwhelming response to this scene, not enraptured awe.  But at least that scene kept your interest (if only to see how embarrassingly over the edge Kubrick was going to go), which is more than can be said for a whole slew of others, such as the ones between Cruise and two separate prostitutes, the one in the costume shop, and most especially the one at the climax of the movie between Cruise and Sydney Pollack. The flat-footedness of the direction and acting in these scenes is truly astonishing for a mainstream motion picture, not to mention one made by a supposed master moments are drawn out endlessly, pauses exist that you could drive a truck through, and each scene's reason for being is highly suspect. Of course, if you're going to get into reasons for being, you'd pretty much have to throw out this entire movie. Which is exactly what I recommend that you do.I have a special category of film which I describe as 'Neighbors' Bad - in honor of the 1981 John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd comedy. Briefly put, it is one (quoting from my own IMDb review of that movie) whose plot is almost indecipherable, whose events and characterizations are completely random, and again and again frustrates any expectation at arriving at any sort of meaningful conclusion, even a silly one. Without a doubt, Eyes Wide Shut fits the description to a tee - it is truly Neighbors Bad.

What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station incident are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best.

If it was in the hands of anyone else, perhaps Austin Powers  International Man of Mystery might not have worked.Myers relies on influences from his time spent in Britain, and perhaps a love for sixties spy films to bring us this film about a swinging spy for the British Secret Service who is frozen in order that he be around in case the dreaded Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) turns up in the future.  In the late sixties, Evil escaped in a space ship with his cat, not to be heard from until the late nineties.  The running gag in this effort is that these two sixties icons are now trying to carry on in the politically correct nineties.  For Austin that means his sexual escapades are no longer acceptable.  Here is an interesting commentary on male prowess as the sixties love machine is now striking out because he has bad teeth, flamboyant clothes and a tacky charm.  Dr. Evil, meanwhile, tries to resume his plans to destroy the world, but he can't get past the fact that one million dollars is petty cash if you are going to hold the world hostage.  Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is not only filled with these decade versus decade gags, but Myers throws in a few of his old stand by bits as well.  (Look, I'm in an elevator has been done a few times.) Myers has an appreciation for the old boys, making good use of folks like Robert Wagner, Michael York and Mimi Rogers.  The film pokes fun at those old Bond flicks with characters like Alotta Fagina and Number Two.  Dr. Evil ignores suggestions to simply shoot his prisoners, and instead chooses to put them in an 'easily escapable' scenario which he will decide not to watch.  Bionic Man fans will of course remember the Fembots and fans of the sixties will love the Burt Bacharach cameo.Austin Powers works on a very basic level.  It is funny (at least I thought so) however it is nothing more than that.

There is no question that Kaufman was brilliant, and that when he chose to do so, he could charm and mystify his audience.  The problems that he faced were almost all self-inflicted damage.  At times Kaufman did humor that was acidic and grating.  Any in the audience that took him seriously or did not count themselves in on the joke, turned against him in a rage. The wrestling against women issue was the funniest example.  If you looked at it as pure humor and didn't allow yourself to believe that he really felt that way about women, it was very funny.  If you took him seriously, it was as offensive as any thing could be.  Andy was very like Lenny Bruce in that way.  He chose to attack societal norms to inflict shock on his audience.  They were two of a kind in that regard.And Jim Carrey was just brilliant.  It was possible to believe that you were just watching Andy and those around his life.  They also mixed in enough people playing themselves to further that illusion.  They also had a lot of fun hiring actors and others in his life, to play different characters in his life, DeVito playing Shapiro, and Shapiro playing a club owner for example.  The biggest disappointment for me in the entire film was not getting to see the song `I go mad when I hear a yodel'.  On one of Andy's Saturday Night Live appearances he did that song over the music of a Choir of Conga players.  It was absolutely remarkable.  The yodeling over the top of the extremely funky groove was strange and just hilarious.  I was so hoping to see it included&#133;And of course the continuous running gag with the Tony Clifton character was another amazing piece of acting by Carrey.  JC was playing Kaufman, playing Clifton.  It was almost eerie how he could drop in and out of characters.  The Clifton character was the ultimate obnoxious lounge singer, taken to the greatest extreme possible.Kaufman was the consummate prankster or practical joker, and his favorite victim was his audience.  The Tony Clifton character was playing a concert, and Kaufman came out on stage just to try and trick on the audience.  He had his buddy play Clifton to add to the controversy.  He worked together with the pro wrestler in Memphis to create tremendous controversy.  I didn't know until I saw the movie that this was an agreement between those two.  I thought it was real.  Andy had put one over on me for nearly 20 years.  The only problem with this joking was its failure as a marketable commodity.Then as he was dying, he went to the Philippines to find a miracle cure for his Cancer, and instead he found a showman and grifter.  It was just the kind of show that Andy himself might have done at some point.  When he realized it was fake and how, the joke was on him, that realization was just one of the things that made me cry during this film.  The irony of that moment was impossible to miss.  Also what a horrible time he had convincing every one that he really had cancer.  He had `cried wolf' in a comic sense once too often to be believed.The funeral scene was another that brought on tears.  Watching everyone who had been in his life singing together and holding hands was the ultimate Kaufman fantasy.  Andy lived to see people just getting happy, and he made his final act and remembrance just such an event.  This movie will move you, twist you and wring you out. It is a must see.

At times Kaufman did humor that was acidic and grating.  Any in the audience that took him seriously or did not count themselves in on the joke, turned against him in a rage. The wrestling against women issue was the funniest example.  If you looked at it as pure humor and didn't allow yourself to believe that he really felt that way about women, it was very funny.  If you took him seriously, it was as offensive as any thing could be.  Andy was very like Lenny Bruce in that way.  He chose to attack societal norms to inflict shock on his audience.  They were two of a kind in that regard.And Jim Carrey was just brilliant.  It was possible to believe that you were just watching Andy and those around his life.  They also mixed in enough people playing themselves to further that illusion.  They also had a lot of fun hiring actors and others in his life, to play different characters in his life, DeVito playing Shapiro, and Shapiro playing a club owner for example.  The biggest disappointment for me in the entire film was not getting to see the song `I go mad when I hear a yodel'.  On one of Andy's Saturday Night Live appearances he did that song over the music of a Choir of Conga players.  It was absolutely remarkable.  The yodeling over the top of the extremely funky groove was strange and just hilarious.  I was so hoping to see it included&#133;And of course the continuous running gag with the Tony Clifton character was another amazing piece of acting by Carrey.  JC was playing Kaufman, playing Clifton.  It was almost eerie how he could drop in and out of characters.  The Clifton character was the ultimate obnoxious lounge singer, taken to the greatest extreme possible.Kaufman was the consummate prankster or practical joker, and his favorite victim was his audience.  The Tony Clifton character was playing a concert, and Kaufman came out on stage just to try and trick on the audience.  He had his buddy play Clifton to add to the controversy.  He worked together with the pro wrestler in Memphis to create tremendous controversy.  I didn't know until I saw the movie that this was an agreement between those two.  I thought it was real.  Andy had put one over on me for nearly 20 years.  The only problem with this joking was its failure as a marketable commodity.Then as he was dying, he went to the Philippines to find a miracle cure for his Cancer, and instead he found a showman and grifter.  It was just the kind of show that Andy himself might have done at some point.  When he realized it was fake and how, the joke was on him, that realization was just one of the things that made me cry during this film.  The irony of that moment was impossible to miss.  Also what a horrible time he had convincing every one that he really had cancer.  He had `cried wolf' in a comic sense once too often to be believed.The funeral scene was another that brought on tears.  Watching everyone who had been in his life singing together and holding hands was the ultimate Kaufman fantasy.  Andy lived to see people just getting happy, and he made his final act and remembrance just such an event.  This movie will move you, twist you and wring you out. It is a must see.
