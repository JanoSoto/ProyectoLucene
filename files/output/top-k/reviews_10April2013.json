The movies simple structure and plot makes it pretty accessible to anyone even in German. And that's what I liked about it. It sticks to its plot and style, and does what it does best. And it's only 80 minutes too. The style of the movie is based off of a video game and the people Lola interacts with change their destiny. It's unique for the time because it wasn't done to death like modern films have made movies from video games. Tom Tyker shot the movie well and fits the pace of the movie. And I absolutely adore the German Techno of the movie and I'm not even a fan of electronic music. Overall nice little concept movie.

This is not a stretch since NAVARONE was a monster hit in 1961, snagged an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, and has maintained a huge following among male moviegoers ever since.And until recently, NAVARONE was one of the few of the great epic war movies I had never seen all the way through from beginning to end. Watching NAVARONE today is to be transported back to a time when World War II was well within the living memory of every adult, including the youthful John F. Kennedy, who had just been inaugurated President; when that conflict still dominated the popular culture. The plot is quite simple a small group of commandos will infiltrate German occupied Greece and destroy the huge artillery weapons that prevent the rescue of two thousand stranded British troops on an island in the Aegean Sea. The mission has the be accomplished within a specific window of time or a Royal Naval relief force will be sunk before the British soldiers can be rescued.The men whose job it falls to take out the heavily fortified guns- Mallory, Miller, Stavros, Brown, Franklin-are hard bitten veterans; cynical pros who know how to get it done despite any and all roadblocks in the way. These men are the grandfathers of the characters Stallone, Willis and Statham would portray decades later. They're not patriots in the flag waving sense of the word, but men willing to get their hands dirty because they know that will save the lives of other men like themselves.The mission itself is a trek over sea through dangerous waters and up a sheer cliff; full of narrow escapes from the Germans and betrayal by a supposed ally. There is never a moment during the mission when you are not completely aware of the danger the commandos are in from the Nazis. The pacing is perfect, allowing the heroes (and the viewer) just enough time to catch their breath between narrow escapes and unforeseen obstacles. The climax has edge of your seat suspense as the cannons are readied to sink the British ships as the heroes race to blow them up with not a second to spare. NAVARONE is a great showcase for a style movie acting that has long passed. Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn were men who played men, not buffed up action stars; there is a maturity about the way they handle themselves that tells us their characters have been through a lot and done worse. All three men were at the peak of their very long careers when they made NAVARONE. Peck's Mallory is the epitome of resourceful competence, and his confrontation with Niven's Corporal Miller over the fate of Franklin, where both of these tough men reveal something of themselves, is the film's dramatic highlight. Great dialog and great movie star acting. Quinn's ruthless Stavros could easily be a cousin to his Zorba; both characters get to fall in love with Irene Papas.There are some great supporting performances by Stanley Baker and Anthony Quayle, two British actors who've been forgotten now that they've been gone from the scene for many years. Baker would go on to star in ZULU, another great war movie; while Quayle would join the other Anthony the next year in David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a classic that surpasses even NAVARONE. There is a connection between Bond and NAVARONE actor Walter Gotell, who would go on to play the head of the KGB in a slew of 007 films, has a significant role as a Nazi officer.One of the things that does date the film concerns the unmasking of the traitor in their ranks when the time comes to dole out rough justice, Irene Papas steps in and executes her at the last minute instead of Peck's Mallory. It seems that in a movie made in 1961, it just wouldn't do to have Gregory Peck shoot an unarmed woman in cold blood, even if she has sold him out to the Nazis. But things changed fast, only a few years later, American soldiers would slaughter German men and women without a second thought in THE DIRTY DOZEN. The era of the epic war movie, of which THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is a shinning example, began with the release of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAII in 1957 and along the way we got such classics as THE GREAT ESCAPE, THE LONGEST DAY, THE DIRTY DOZEN, WHERE EAGLES DARE, and continued through PATTON in 1970, before the genre went out of fashion during the Vietnam era. I guess movies like NAVARONE, which even at its most cynical, still suggested that war could be an adventure, rang hollow in time of Kent State and My Lai. But the war movie has never really gone away despite whatever politics of the time; the end of the 70's would bring the Vietnam epics like THE DEER HUNTER and APOCALYPSE NOW, and later there would be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THREE KINGS, BLACK HAWK DOWN,and THE HURT LOCKER. But these would be conflicts with no place for Peck, Niven, or Quinn and the kind of professionals they portrayed. Yet the spirit of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is alive and well in the 21st century; just watch INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and see what I mean. I'd bet Brad Pitt's Lieutenant Aldo Rane would enjoy having a drink with Captain Keith Mallory and Colonel Andrea Stavros.

This part of the movie dragged on a bit. It was OK, but more could have happened. But the second half was awesome.

There were even some good supporting roles too. Especially Gary Kemp. Who would have known that the guy from Spandau Ballet could be a good actor. He was really good in the Krays too.There was one scene in the movie though that made me laugh. Someone gets shot and has about 200 bullets shot at him from a few guns all at the same time... yet he did not go down! He still stood there for about 30 seconds after.

I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly cliché moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds.

This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly cliché moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.9\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"10 April 2013","score":"","review":" The first time I saw this film was about ten years ago when I was in my early twenties and recently having moved to London in search of work. I didn't quite get it at first - the twist felt totally unbelievable and the message of the movie didn't resonate with me at all. Now in my early thirties, I absolutely get it and with the benefits of hindsight, this movie has become one of the all-time greats. Not only is this a brutal and thrilling drama with personal bests from the cast but for once, it has a real brain behind the fist-slugging and a dirty, grubby style befitting for a movie about society and its citizens hitting rock bottom.Edward Norton plays an insomniac office worker, so bored of his existence that he attends support groups for illnesses and diseases he doesn't has. It's at one of these groups where he meets fellow dysfunctional Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) but even then, he still can't shake the sense of disillusionment he has. But when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the pair of them end up forming an underground group called Fight Club where guys can briefly lose themselves in one-on-one combat. But as Fight Club continues to grow, Tyler's ultimate goal is slowly, terrifyingly realised...The reason I reckon I get Fight Club at this point in my life is like the unnamed Narrator, there is a barely suppressed desire for escape from the dreary drudgery of the rat race and a wish to just leave everything behind. Never before has this need been better realised on film than it has in Fight Club, a film that has modern echoes of classics like Rebel Without A Cause. The three principals have rarely been as good as this - I cannot think of a better Norton performance in any film - but even the supporting cast are fantastic, led (perhaps surprisingly) by Meat Loaf and Jared Leto. But the film's other star is behind the camera - director David Fincher has peaked here with this film, offering a disturbing and uncomfortable film to watch. The opening scenes before Tyler's appearance are just sublime - the split-second splicing of shots makes the viewer feel as confused and disorientated as the Narrator's insomnia, making you question what's real and what's in your head. And when the twist is revealed, the film becomes an odd psychological thriller with no obvious end in sight.Brutal, uncompromising and full of bloody violence, Fight Club remains one of the most compelling and essential films to watch in the last thirty years. It even tries to raise a smile on your face with moments of macabre, dark humour (the theft from the liposuction clinic is both funny and gross at the same time) but I would imagine this is more to do with lightening the film's almost apocalyptic tone. It's like a big block of dark chocolate - not for everyone and probably not much good for you but seriously enjoyable when you get stuck into it. Personally, I reckon this is one of the best films I've ever seen - a rare film that excites the mind as much as the senses - and even rarer, it's a film that improves on multiple viewings. Fight Club stands head and shoulders over most adult movies and even though it's well over a decade old, it still feels fresh and contemporary with a message about society that still feels up-to-date in these financially difficult times.

I love the look, the plot, the acting, the music, the sets, the fashions. The entire thing.This movie had so much promise, but flushed it all down the toilet. For me the fatal flaw was the main character, Paul. He was not likable. In the least. I could see no reason that he should have any friends, or a girlfriend, or a job. He is a self-absorbed schmuck. In every scene, he has the ability to make his life better (or at least push the plot in a direction that would be mildly interesting). He COULD say or do something to improve his relationship with his girlfriend. He COULD say or do something to make the woman he is attracted to like him. He COULD say or do something to make his boss excited about his potential. Alas. Paul does almost nothing, and what little he does is irritating and\/or cringe-inducing. He squints. He furrows his eyebrows. He stares. A lot. He utters the minimum amount of dialogue necessary to interact with the other characters. His utterances are all awkward and and painful to experience. Note that this appears to be the goal of the writer, director and actor. I give them credit in that they achieved their goal. I simply do not appreciate what they have achieved.Paul is not the only fictional character to be a man of inaction. Alvy in Annie Hall. Or Hamlet. However, Paul is certainly no Hamlet and he isn't even an Alvy. Hamlet frustrates us with his inaction and digressions. However, our frustration with Hamlet is ultimately relieved. We are left with a sense of satisfaction once Hamlet finally becomes a man of action. Also, let us not forget that Hamlet is a victim. So even when he frustrates us, he has our sympathy. Paul's life is pretty crappy because he is a man of inaction, not because of some external forces operating on him. His failure to say or do anything meaningful is the cause of his crappy life, not the result of a crappy life.A movie homage to Italo genre films should have some zip, some pizazz. This has none. The movie does have great music, great fashion, great shots. But it is all for naught because at the core of this rotten apple, is an unlikable character who is too lazy to irritate us by his actions. The best he can do is irritate us with his lack of action.

Before long there's a breach in the security and the dinosaurs are running loose and man has to face them. JURASSIC PARK was recently re-released in 3-D and I must say that I really didn't think the format made the film any better or worse. There were a few nice shots in the 3-D but overall I'd say people can just be happy with the original version. As for the movie itself, I still remember the lines around the block when this thing came out and I still remember the hype of opening day. I've always thought this was a good movie but at the same time I have never fallen in love with it like so many other have. I think my biggest problem with the picture is that I just didn't find it scary enough. Spielberg spends the first half of the movie getting the viewer to let their mind go in the wonder of dinosaurs being alive. The second half of the film is when the action takes place and I just didn't find any of it scary. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I never believed for a second that any of the major characters were ever going to be harm and I won't spoil how the film turned out. Outside of that, the film is technically well-made by Spielberg who does a great job hinting at what we're about to see early on before actually bringing out the dinosaurs. Once they're released on screen you can't help but be impressed by the special effects, which hold up incredibly well when viewed today and I think a strong argument can be made that these type of effects haven't been beaten by any other film. Another major plus is that we're given a good cast but I will say Jeff Goldblum's one-liners are as bad today as they were in 1993. The music score from John Williams is another classic as it too really brings this fantasy world to life and makes you believe in the miracle of how they came to be. JURASSIC PARK certainly isn't one of my favorites but it still has a lot going for it that makes it worth seeing.

Outside of that, the film is technically well-made by Spielberg who does a great job hinting at what we're about to see early on before actually bringing out the dinosaurs. Once they're released on screen you can't help but be impressed by the special effects, which hold up incredibly well when viewed today and I think a strong argument can be made that these type of effects haven't been beaten by any other film. Another major plus is that we're given a good cast but I will say Jeff Goldblum's one-liners are as bad today as they were in 1993. The music score from John Williams is another classic as it too really brings this fantasy world to life and makes you believe in the miracle of how they came to be.

","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"10 April 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Jurassic Park (1993) *** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel about a group of people invited to an island to try out a new amusement park, which just happens to have real dinosaurs on it. Before long there's a breach in the security and the dinosaurs are running loose and man has to face them. JURASSIC PARK was recently re-released in 3-D and I must say that I really didn't think the format made the film any better or worse. There were a few nice shots in the 3-D but overall I'd say people can just be happy with the original version. As for the movie itself, I still remember the lines around the block when this thing came out and I still remember the hype of opening day. I've always thought this was a good movie but at the same time I have never fallen in love with it like so many other have. I think my biggest problem with the picture is that I just didn't find it scary enough. Spielberg spends the first half of the movie getting the viewer to let their mind go in the wonder of dinosaurs being alive. The second half of the film is when the action takes place and I just didn't find any of it scary.

No matter how many times I watch the movie, and in whatever conditions, I never cease to be amazed at this movie, at its boldness, at the fact it exists at all. The '70s are my favourite era of film, both in American and around the world, and for me Taxi Driver is one of its most magnificent achievements, so many decades later still towering over many of that decade's masterpieces, so ahead of its time the tribulations of the protagonist still disturb modern viewers by how prescient and immediate they are.Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who can't sleep at nights and drives around, and so he may as well do that for money. Bickle is lonely, socially inept, almost always wears his army jacket, his name written on the back, a part of his identity he clings to tenaciously. Bickle is the proverbial nobody, but in his slowly-decaying mind he conjures thoughts of becoming a great man, of doing something important. His thoughts, though, are as blurry as his conversational skills and he's not sure what he wants to achieve, what ideas are those. Nevertheless constantly writes in his diary that he wants to clean up the city, which is an open sewer full of filth, and the movie slowly shows Bickle changing into a megalomaniac vigilante with delusions of grandeur. The movie, and Bickle, are preparing the viewer for a spectacular finale, and they don't disappoint.Although the movie makes it clear Bickle is slightly unbalanced from the first moment we see him, applying to a job as a cabbie (in a short but memorable scene with Joe Spinell), it doesn't bother trying to give reasons, or any background on his past life. His hatred for lowlifes, pushers, prostitutes and pimps isn't a cause but just something his already deranged brain focuses to release his anger. When he tries to be an ordinary man, and find love and companionship, we see how out of his element he is. His conversations with other cabbies are always tense and awkward. And when he tries to date Betsy, a woman (Cybill Shepherd) involved in a campaign to get Senator Palantine elected as President, she breaks up with him when he casually takes her to a porn movie. When his experiments at normalcy fail, he concentrates his efforts and money to remake himself into a vigilante with a confused plan to murder Palantine on vague motives (Bickle's mind is hazy, the movie never is &#x96; it just puts the viewer right in his head, which probably makes not a lot of sense even to himself) before becoming obsessed with saving a teenage prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her smooth-talking pimp (Harvey Keitel).Every scene and line in this movie is carefully thought to show Bickle's deranged state of mind and to carefully and thoroughly chronicle his descent into suicidal madness. Few movies are more perfect than Taxi Driver in bringing together all aspects of filmmaking into a perfect whole. Lawrence of Arabia, Chinatown and 2001 A Space Odyssey before, and a handful since. It's a marvel to see it unwind before your eyes the dialogue, the performances of everyone, the shots of New York at night, Bernard Herrmann's half romantic half bleak score so often perfectly mirroring and enhancing Bickle's state of mind. Although DeNiro is to commend for this performance, undoubtedly the best of his career, all the other actors are equally excellent, from Shepherd to Foster, from Keitel to a young Albert Brooks in a short but wonderfully comical role. Martin Scorsese's direction was perhaps never this crisp and accurate again, and Paul Schrader never wrote such a remarkable screenplay again. It's clear on every scene that these men and women brought their best talent to the movie, and thanks to their hard work we've been graced with one of the best movies ever made.

But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made).People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart\/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him.Another difference, in my view, is what each film is. This version is a romance movie.

Swift's perspective was that the illogic of favoritism only lent itself to inequity, and who could argue against so fine an observation.But we aren't given the entirety of Swift's saga regarding the humble physician from the English coast, but rather a children's rendition of one of the more popular episodes of Lemuel Gulliver's Travels; i.e. the part where he's a giant among two warring factions of miniature populations.The characters are apt for the audience, and the artwork and animation on all levels comes from a time when labor wsa a bit cheaper and hence more care could be injected into the works produced at the time. It matches a lot of Disney quality art, but even so you can certainly see where Disney's rivals, (Harmon and Ising for example) still lacked a certain something. Gulliver's Travels, and the short films derived from it, has been mistreated here and there, and forgotten, with poor dupes appearing on UHF and independent VHF stations in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. It's a miracle the print survived to this day so well intact. And thanks to the people at a variety of companies who came together to preserve this masterpiece, the full film can now be seen in all of its original glory, with a color corrected print and remastered soundtrack.Not being a parent, just a film enthusiast (and animation as well), I can't say how well this will hold up to today's offerings for young audiences. I really can't, but, even so, I still think it a fine piece of animated film making, and I think the children will forgive it for not being a CGI experience by the quality of the art and vibrant colorful visuals.Again, the story is essentially an episode of the Swift's saga, but it does entertain on a basic level. Give it a shot, and maybe try watching it with the family.Enjoy.

Gulliver's Travels, and the short films derived from it, has been mistreated here and there, and forgotten, with poor dupes appearing on UHF and independent VHF stations in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. It's a miracle the print survived to this day so well intact. And thanks to the people at a variety of companies who came together to preserve this masterpiece, the full film can now be seen in all of its original glory, with a color corrected print and remastered soundtrack.Not being a parent, just a film enthusiast (and animation as well), I can't say how well this will hold up to today's offerings for young audiences. I really can't, but, even so, I still think it a fine piece of animated film making, and I think the children will forgive it for not being a CGI experience by the quality of the art and vibrant colorful visuals.Again, the story is essentially an episode of the Swift's saga, but it does entertain on a basic level. Give it a shot, and maybe try watching it with the family.Enjoy.

All the major plot points correspond, insofar as Road Trip actually HAS a plot. What plot it does have hangs together like a soggy potato chip.Frankly, if you have seen Overnight Delivery, Road Trip suffers miserably by comparison. The comedic action in the body of the film is related to the plot in only the most precarious degrees, and throughout most of the middle action the equivalent of the original's female presence is absent - rendering the conclusion far less logical.Overnight Delivery was a comedy, but it was a smart comedy, and it had a very deep meaning for the out-of-state college freshman. When you finish high school, often you think you are so sure of what the world is going to be like and how your life is going to turn out - and whom you are going to spend it with. The main characters - both the nebbish faux-conservative male and the pseudo-rebellious strippeuse - end up learning that life isn't that predictable, that impulses get in the way... and that there is so much left to discover in the world outside the childish confines of an insular suburban-strip mall education.Road Trip, on the other hand, is nothing more than a sex-raunch comedy. I'm not necessarily allergic to those (Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber remain two of my favorite guilty pleasures), but the problem is basically this. When you imitate a story that has meaning, and you reduce it to vulgar toilet-bowl humor without making an outright parody, you leave those habituated to the original product feeling... empty, cheated, even.Story archetypes abound, sure, but Road Trip is both too unoriginal to bring forth anything meaningful from its source material and too self-unaware to become an overt caricature of the source. As is often the case, the original is far more palatable by any standard.

However, as it progressed, it got a bit more exciting and I enjoyed watching the heist occur.The cinematography was good. I especially enjoyed the bit of editing done where the viewer saw what the shooter of the horse was aiming for. I like how it was like we were seeing it all magnified. I also thought the scene at the end with the money floating all around was beautifully shot, even though in the movies context it was an unfortunate thing to happen. The different characters were interesting. I enjoyed how they all had distinct personalities and they were relatively easy to differentiate. The actors did a fantastic job as well, especially in the final few scenes. However, something in this movie just didn't do it for me and I can't even pinpoint what it was. I think that the strong ending made it a good film, but it didn't entirely make up for the slow start.

A plot that is called ridiculous, characters that are called uninteresting and a film that is regarded as the most unnecessary addition to this franchise makes for clearly low expectations.I absolutely hate the first Star Trek movie. It was paced horrendously, the characters were extremely one dimensional and the story was not immersive. It truly was one of the worst franchise openers and I wasn't looking forward to the next ones. Gladly, the trilogy that followed was fantastic! Critics such as legend Roger Ebert have stated this is the worst of the bunch so I went in with the most horrible expectations and surprisingly, this movie shocked me in a good way! I honestly don't get the complaints given to this film. Sure, it isn't a great film but it had a story that was decent, some good characters and added a bit of depth to a few of the characters and provided a few emotional scenes. Sure, the ending to this film was unsatisfying and sure the story was ridiculous but I find this to be a guilty pleasure.The movie truly suffers with some ridiculous scenes at times such as singing 'Row, row, row your boat' and a glimpse at a romance between Scotty and Uhura but for the most part, the story was rather well done and it had a few good moments. The film's pacing is good and I thought that William Shatner did a good job at directing this film considering how much stress it could've been to play a main character and be the director. I know Mel Gibson did it with Braveheart! Despite being a guilty pleasure, I can understand how people say that this film truly was an unnecessary sequel. It doesn't offer much new content apart from a scene where we discover a bit about Bones' past. That scene was well done and provided some emotional depth to his character.People say that this film isn't funny. They say the comedic level of this film is extremely low compared with the previous trilogy. I agree but the comedy still works in this film unlike in the original film. The acting was mostly good and the new characters did a good job, especially the character of Sybok, whom I particularly liked.Star Trek V The Final Frontier is one of those movies I'd take as a guilty pleasure and an unnecessary addition to the Star Trek franchise yet certainly an enjoyable and fun film. This film truly has gotten better as time passed by. Back in 1989, it was viewed ridiculous and I am a little understanding of that, but by 2013, that so called horrid mess this film was has been forgotten with some fantastic sequels to this so called atrocity.
