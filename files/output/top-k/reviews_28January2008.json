I found myself for the next ten minutes thinking up various excuses I could use as reasons but eventually settled for 'Curiosity'.Yes; when a film is so bad it motivates you to actually think up reasons you're going to have to say to people when they ask you why you watched it, it's struggling. As it was with Thunderbirds, I was curious as to know what the hell it was all about. I was old enough to remember the Spice Girls and old enough to dislike them but distinctly recall this film getting released. Following the break up and now apparent reunification, Spice World as a film doesn't even hold together as a piece of nostalgic nonsense that should be good enough to kill a few hours as we watch global female icons strut around in little costumes and sing silly little songs. Spice World does not even give us the luxury of having a plot; instead it is more of a documentary-come-spoof of not only the band in question but certain generic films of yesteryear. This means it plays out more like Epic Movie than anything else.Spice World is really just one massive contradiction. It contradicts itself, its characters contradict what they want to be and how they want to be seen as and even the immediate ending contradicts whether or not it is a film within a film. At the time of the Spice Girls, there was very much an atmosphere of the band wanting to take over. The title of this film 'Spice World' suggests a world full of 'spice'; the video for the song of the same name is set in a dystopian future where everything is exactly that; the 'V' sign the girls use to signify girl power is commonly associated with 'victory', ie; Victory, girl power rules'; there is also the familiar sight of a band cashing in on consumerism and globalisation as they make their presence more known around the world. But rather than Spice World posing as some sort of political\/musical version of Battleship Potemkin; its scenes play out more like a retread of films that we've already seen. Roger Moore was James Bond and he spoofs the Bond villain persona; Richard E. Grant sits and listens to film pitches al√° The Player and the final incident involving a bomb blowing up not only means the film is confused as to whether its fiction or not but whether or not it thinks the fourth wall is reparable once it has been broken.The worst example of contradictory content in the film comes very early on when the girls are sitting in a bus, that looks more like an actual room than anything else, discussing how they hate being seen as the 'baby'; the 'posh one' the 'scary one', etc. Fine you think, maybe they are getting sick of that but what follows is an immediate counteraction to their complaint in the form of a montage showing each of the girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe and then of each other. The girls go from wearing their clothes, acting dumb and stating that there's more to us than just our persona tags to..........wearing even more clothes and costumes and acting in an even dumber manner. You can imagine the thought process so Ginger Spice doesn't like to be called Ginger Spice anymore; Ok, I know; I'll dress up like Wonder Woman and crack a whip. Yes, I can see there's so much more to you than your generic tags. The other glaring example of contradiction in this film that the girls fall foul of comes in the form of their allegiances. Nearer the beginning of the film rather than the middle, the girls talk about how important their fans are to them; this idea returns to haunt them since the actual final third revolves around a dilemma the girls face stay with a friend as they give birth and shun fans waiting at the gig or vice-versa. There should be no argument they've established their fans come first but what happens is they counter balance their priorities by staying in the hospital with their pregnant friend.Spice World is a film that does absolutely no favours for anyone and that includes the girls themselves. The Spice Girls come across as plastic, one-dimensional and rather stupid; frequently getting their priorities, beliefs and ideas mixed up with one another; never giving us the impression these are smart and good people making smart and good music. The film's portrayal of Italians and homosexuals is disappointing as is the incompetent film crew consisting of a black man and a fat person; the way the bad guy is a fat, spitting Australian bent on magazine sales who has an English assistant is horrible; the film's narrative wants us to believe that stuff being printed in the newspapers by a man who gets the scoops in an impossible manner is entertaining and realistic but it's just silly. There just isn't enough space to cover all the things horribly wrong with this film but I am surprised this didn't destroy the Spice Girls when it first came out. Cheap laughs; a nasty narrative; horrible archetypes and so many times in which the focus band of the title come across as incompetent is enough to label this trash, 'trash'.

I happen to live in the area where it was filmed and that's one of the reasons I enjoy watching it. Having said that, and being a Hitchcock fan, I definitely don't think this was anywhere up to his standards.I don't expect there to be a reason given for the bird attacks. That's a mystery and will remain one. What I can't get behind are some of the incredibly cheesy situations and silly dialogue. The conversation between Melanie and Annie for instance, after Melanie returns from having dinner with Mitch and his family. Annie goes into this whole explanation of Lydia's character and why she behaves the way she does. Yet, she says, Lydia is not a jealous, possessive mother????? When she relates her own experiences with Mitch and Lydia, Melanie makes the comment 'that adds up to a jealous possessive mother', or something along those lines. 'No', says Annie, she's not afraid of losing Mitch, she's just afraid of being abandoned'. Did I miss something here? I can't believe that Hitchcock allowed such senseless, pointless dialogue between his characters.Later Annie is found dead in front of her house, yet she manages to push Cathy inside, and Cathy doesn't have a scratch on her. Okay, maybe there is a way this could have happened but it does stretch the imagination a bit. Speaking of Cathy, I found the kid to be irritating beyond words. Fortunately for her, Veronica Cartwright's acting has greatly improved in the intervening years but she sure couldn't act in this film.Nevertheless, I find this film to be enjoyable and I watch it time and again.

While more mainstream works such as Lost Boys and Near Dark took a grittier, fast paced, and overall more fun approach at the subject matter, The Hunger went for something more patient, character driven and throuly more 'arthouse' like. It's style can be easily tracked down in films such as Harry Kumel's Daughters of Darkness and the works of French filmmaker Jean Rollin, famous for his avant-garde lesbian vampire films such as Lips of Blood and Fascination. Never mainstream hits, Rollin's work gained a cult appeal as some of the most stylish, unique and haunting horror films of the 70's.

It's been a few years since I have seen this movie, but I have not forgotten much. Of course, there is great special effects in the battle sequences and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, especially the Japanese-themed music, but that is not enough to redeem this film from the bad points.DIRECTION Not too impressed. The camera angles were not so bad and it would look like it is well-filmed, but there were times when the camera just shook way to much and was not in the right position (I will talk about that later). It looked like the scenes were filmed in one take. It looked as though the director was not doing much directing at all. It seemed liked he told the actor\/actress to do or say something but not how to, which might be one reason for the horrible acting.CAST\/ACTING Also pretty bad. Why was Ben Affleck chosen for the main role? In my experience he showed one of the worst performances I have ever seen! He looked like a puppet being pulled by strings. He should have won his Razzie Award nomination for worst actor! As for Kate Beckinsale, she was not a bad choice, but mainly because of her good looks. Her acting was okay but would not win an Oscar.SCREEN WRITING Quite bad. Actually the emotion and settings would make this script closer to average, but thanks to the unbearably simple dialogue and historical inaccuracy and pointless love triangle, it makes this screenplay much below average. I understand that romance was put to reveal an anti war-like message, but that is not powerful enough. It is just so weakly portrayed. And war was not just about leaving your loved ones, but also about children losing their father and ladies losing their boyfriend\/husband. They insulted that truthful reality by making Americans look invincible in the second half. I say that if Randall Wallace included something more realistic, and the second half of the movie was edited out (when the Japanese are bombed) he might be able to redeem this film, but sadly he didn't. Another problem is that you don't even care about the characters because they don't seem important. Josh Hartnet's character was decent, but Ben Affleck's character was wooden. The movie is simple American propaganda. It makes them look like invincible heroes and Pearl Harbour their victory. 4 planes shot down expertly by 2 American pilots and them making evasive manoeuvres to clash the Japanese planes. That is not how the battle went. This is not a documentary, but to make a good script about history, you need to stay true to the facts. This is why we should not respect Hollywood films like this for their style.CINEMATOGRAPHY\/CAMERAS I did not last see it at my house so I don't know if the TV had wide-screen, but if it did cameras were not well-positioned. The angles were fine, but in the beginning when Capt. Rafe McCawley reports to his commander at the airfield the camera is aiming at him from his front-right and cutting almost half of his face. Who in the world could think of doing that. Also, earlier on when the kid at the field runs and follows his dad. The crane shot for only one second has the kid in view at the left then it just shows the field itself for a few seconds more. Seeing all this it probably was the TV, but regardless of that Michael Bay should have studied these scenes better and try to make the camera shoot at the right position.I won't say any more because all I wanted to list were the really bad points. So trust me, there are much better films worth 3 hours of your life which are a little bit less than 5.3 stars. Not to mention even better ones.

Upon viewing in a contemporary context, even over 80 years after its initial release, the recognition of Metropolis, director Fritz Lang's masterpiece, among such a list proves indisputable. The catalyst for all ensuing science fiction films and tremendously influential even outside of the genre it essentially pioneered, the sheer imagination and vision behind Metropolis prove its indisputable quality decades after its time.A tremendously ambitious and controversial feat when first released, the political and thematic content riddling the film's impressively complex storyline are astounding, proving an early testament for the potential of big budget films to resonate with strong thematic content as opposed to being simply entertaining. Taking notes from Marx, among other prominent schools of thought, the revolutionary dystopian vision of a colony of workers rebelling against the alienated upper classes proves a daring and fiercely compelling watch even to this day, let alone for a film made in Germany in the 1920s. Similarly, the film makes a particularly effective science-fiction piece by proving frighteningly prophetic from grander themes of commodity culture to smaller touches, with ideas which would have seemed outlandish at the time such as video phones and machine men starting to become disconcerting realities. While parts of the original film may be lost, as they are summed up by title cards in the same way dialogue was conveyed, the occasional lapse in pacing hardly distracts from the gripping and astonishingly powerful narrative.Similarly, the film's dynamic visual style is equally laudable, and the entire film captivates with a hypnotic, entrancing beauty. The expressionist influenced futuristic sets and buildings and surprisingly advanced visual effects never fail to captivate, and the frequent moody lighting is an aesthetic delight. Sequences such as the opening scene of columns of repressed workers trudging desolately to work to Freder's cinematically innovative hallucination of death striking the city to mad inventor Rotwang's construction of the iconic Machine Man to the allegorical tale of the tower of Babel prove utterly unforgettable, with Lang conjuring up a dramatic intensity essentially unparalleled in its time. Such seamless quality both technically and thematically has scarcely been glimpsed to such a degree since, and the film's incredible influence becomes increasingly clear in other works after viewing it.While the film is seldom praised for its acting, considering the expressionist conventions of over-exaggerated facial expressions and movement to express inner sentiments, the film comes as across as far less melodramatic than one might expect, though the distinctly different performance styles may prove unsettling or unintentionally comical to a contemporary audience. Gustav Fr√∂hlich is a suitably engaging and charismatic lead as the young son of the city's founder who becomes increasingly disgusted with the harsh mistreatment of the working class denizens. As his distant father, Alfred Abel turns in a poignant performance as Frederson, founder of Metropolis, consumed by his own ambition to the point of losing touch with the world around him. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is unforgettable and enormously entertaining as twisted inventor Rotwang, setting the standard for countless 'mad scientist' figures to follow. Similarly, Brigitte Helm is both luminous and horrifying in turn, portraying both the earnest figurehead for a working class resistance movement who attracts the attention of the impressionable Freder, and a 'demonic' incarnation of herself portrayed by Rotwang's devious Machine Man.Visionary, innovative and desperately socially relevant, Lang's disturbing and captivating labour of love holds its own against the ages, proving nearly as staggeringly impressive an achievement in a current day context as its initial release over 80 years ago. At the risk of lapsing into clich√©, they simply do not make movies like this anymore, and upon viewing such a masterful work, it is an increasing shame.-10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 January 2008","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Certain films will always be recognized as standing the proverbial test of time, making their mark in the pantheon of the most influential, memorable and near flawlessly crafted films in the history of the industry.

The expressionist influenced futuristic sets and buildings and surprisingly advanced visual effects never fail to captivate, and the frequent moody lighting is an aesthetic delight. Sequences such as the opening scene of columns of repressed workers trudging desolately to work to Freder's cinematically innovative hallucination of death striking the city to mad inventor Rotwang's construction of the iconic Machine Man to the allegorical tale of the tower of Babel prove utterly unforgettable, with Lang conjuring up a dramatic intensity essentially unparalleled in its time. Such seamless quality both technically and thematically has scarcely been glimpsed to such a degree since, and the film's incredible influence becomes increasingly clear in other works after viewing it.While the film is seldom praised for its acting, considering the expressionist conventions of over-exaggerated facial expressions and movement to express inner sentiments, the film comes as across as far less melodramatic than one might expect, though the distinctly different performance styles may prove unsettling or unintentionally comical to a contemporary audience. Gustav Fr√∂hlich is a suitably engaging and charismatic lead as the young son of the city's founder who becomes increasingly disgusted with the harsh mistreatment of the working class denizens. As his distant father, Alfred Abel turns in a poignant performance as Frederson, founder of Metropolis, consumed by his own ambition to the point of losing touch with the world around him. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is unforgettable and enormously entertaining as twisted inventor Rotwang, setting the standard for countless 'mad scientist' figures to follow. Similarly, Brigitte Helm is both luminous and horrifying in turn, portraying both the earnest figurehead for a working class resistance movement who attracts the attention of the impressionable Freder, and a 'demonic' incarnation of herself portrayed by Rotwang's devious Machine Man.Visionary, innovative and desperately socially relevant, Lang's disturbing and captivating labour of love holds its own against the ages, proving nearly as staggeringly impressive an achievement in a current day context as its initial release over 80 years ago.

Upon viewing in a contemporary context, even over 80 years after its initial release, the recognition of Metropolis, director Fritz Lang's masterpiece, among such a list proves indisputable. The catalyst for all ensuing science fiction films and tremendously influential even outside of the genre it essentially pioneered, the sheer imagination and vision behind Metropolis prove its indisputable quality decades after its time.A tremendously ambitious and controversial feat when first released, the political and thematic content riddling the film's impressively complex storyline are astounding, proving an early testament for the potential of big budget films to resonate with strong thematic content as opposed to being simply entertaining. Taking notes from Marx, among other prominent schools of thought, the revolutionary dystopian vision of a colony of workers rebelling against the alienated upper classes proves a daring and fiercely compelling watch even to this day, let alone for a film made in Germany in the 1920s.

Furthermore, they tell us that this person is guilty and continue to try and get us to sympathize with them. I may be against the death penalty, but that in no way means that I'm going to feel for a man who raped a teenage girl and savagely murdered a teenage boy. It felt almost like an insult that Tim Robbins shoves this sympathy and religion down the viewers through in an attempt to make me feel for this character.On the other side of the film is it's huge religious method, which only furthered my disconnection with it. It's just the same old preachy, sentimental stuff we've seen a thousand times before mixed with an attempt at forced sympathy for a rapist\/murderer. The entire film felt like some kind of bizarre joke, because I couldn't even sympathize with the families of the victims. They were just blood-hungry, despicable human beings as well. Add that to what is potentially the worst score I've heard my entire life and the film is close to torture.I don't understand how Susan Surandon won an Oscar for her performance but maybe that's just because I loathed her character. Another thing that displeased me is the fact that the film moves like a snail. It drags constantly and every scene without Sean Penn felt like a chore to watch.
