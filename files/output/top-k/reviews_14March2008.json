[{"date":"14 March 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dog Park (1998) * 1\/2 (out of 4) Andy (Luke Wilson) is a down on his luck, self described loser who has just lost his girlfriend to another man but to make matters worse she has taken the dog with her. Andy doesn't understand why she would take the dog since she hated it so much but thankfully he's got a friend (Janeane Garofalo) to explain life and its problems to him. The friend tries to explain to Andy that he hasn't been single since the eighth grade so he has no idea what life is like to be single and that he will continue to have bad relationships until he realizes how to get along without others.To get the sorrow out of his heart Andy decides to go to a singles bar for some onion soup when he bumps into Lorna (Natasha Henstridge), someone also suffering from a bad relationship. The two do some small talk and decide to have a one-night stand but after puking in his lap, the two go off in separate directions dating other people. In this time Andy starts dating a wild woman who wants nothing more than rough sex but he keeps thinking back to Lorna knowing that she's the right woman for him. He keeps going to the dog park where he hopes to meet her again while at the same time hoping to get his beloved dog back.Dog Park is another film in a long line of movies that tries to get a message across about love but anyone who has had at least one date in their life will come away rolling their eyes in disbelief because the film is so incredibly bad that you can't help but be thankful this turkey only spent a few weeks in theaters after sitting on a shelf for over a year. I'm a die-hard Woody Allen fan but I'm beginning to think he put a curse on the world because he's the reason so many bad films have been made because other's try to recreate what he does but usually falls flat on their faces.The films message is the typical one that if you keep trying you'll eventually find love yet the characters are so poor one doesn't have to wonder too hard why they can't keep a relationship going. As with other films of its type, Dog Park features a loser guy, a loser woman and their wonderful friends who give wonderful advice yet the losers never seem to listen to them. The first eighty-minutes of the movie features tears, heartache and dating but in the end we've seen this countless times before and we know how things will work out. As I've said before I'm often curious if these type of films use the exact same story outline and only slightly change character's professions and the color of their hair.Luke Wilson gives a rather bland and completely forgettable performance, which isn't a good thing for your lead actor. There isn't a single moment in the film where he gives off any energy, which just makes the film all the more unbearable to get through. He delivers each of his lines so slowly that you can't help but think he's reading them off a cue card. Natasha Henstridge gives another bland performance but for some reason she feels her smile will carry us the way. Put the two stars together and we get no chemistry whatsoever, which again, doesn't help matters. Janeane Garofalo, usually very reliable, doesn't add anything either because she isn't given anything to do. Harland Williams is the only bright spot in the cast but he's only here for a few minutes.This was written and directed by Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall fame and he shows nothing original in either department. Various scenes go on and on without any direction and I personally couldn't see a point in any of them. There an incredibly stupid scene with a dog psychologist, which seems to be taking itself way too seriously even though what's being talked about is so silly that one must wonder how any producer could have taken it to heart. The screenplay offers nothing new and nothing original so if you want to see a loser try to make a rebound then check out a Woody Allen film or just buy a dog to talk to. Either one would be more entertaining than this film, which certainly needs to be scooped up and thrown away.

Her parents feared she'd never get married or amount to anything in life but one day her father makes a joke that she'd make a good hitchhiker. Sissy takes that advice and heads off in the world thumbing a ride to wherever she can get. As a teenager Sissy finds a modeling job in NYC for feminine hygiene advertisement, which claims she smells as good as she looks.After being the champ of feminine hygiene for five years running, Sissy finds herself back on the road traveling across the country. She eventually gets a phone call from the drag queen known as The Countess (John Hurt) who has managed to get her a new job up in Oregon.This job is working on a ranch, which has been taken over by a group of cowgirls who seem to be fighting exploitation. With Sissy there, the girls have a new fighter as well as possible lover.Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is based on a novel from Tom Robbins, which I haven't read.Perhaps had I read it I would have understood what this film was trying to say or trying to be about but as it is, I really have no idea. My only guess is that director Gun Van Sant was trying to recapture the exploitation films of the 1970's like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls but he fails miserably here and makes a film that's a bigger disgrace than his future remake of Psycho.The biggest joke running throughout the film is the stuff dealing with feminine hygiene and the fact that Sissy smells better than any other woman around. This stuff here is simply unfunny and I'm sure many would be offended by this humor. Since it's doesn't work and manages to be somewhat offensive I've got to wonder who this humor was meant to entertain. The other big joke is the huge thumbs, which lead to various dialogue scenes dealing with the joys of hitchhiking but once again, who in the world is suppose to find that entertaining? I've always enjoyed watching Uma Thurman because she's one of the most enlightening actresses out there. She can certainly handle comedy, which was proved in Mad Dog and Glory but it's clear she has no idea what to do with the material given to her. There's not a single moment in the film where I believed this was a real character and instead of any insight we are given two fake looking props to tell her story. What attracted her to this project is anyone's guess but what's even worse is the fact that the director got an all-star cast to appear in the film. Lorraine Bracco, Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Angie Dickinson, Sean Young, Heather Graham and Roseanne are among the many familiar faces and none of them bring anything to their roles. My only guess is that these folks forgot to read the script and just thought the idea of being in a cameo would be cool.I remember watching this film opening day in Louisville, KY where the theater was fairly packed Before the movie opened you could tell there was a loud buzz about the film due to the director's previous films, which included Drugstore Cowboy. As soon as the film started you could feel that entire buzz leave the theater and for the next two hours there was a complete silence that was rather haunting. No one was fascinated by what they were seeing but instead every single person was in a state of shock. Was this film some kind of job? Did Van Sant make a bad film on purpose? That's my only guess because there's nothing going good for this turkey, which would give anyone the blues.

Two creatures are created one being a Golden Retriever who has been taught pretty much everything a human can do. This includes answering questions, being able to type and best of all he can retrieve his own food. The second creature is a Bigfoot type creature known as an Oxcom. The secret is that the dog would go into the enemy's camp to find targets then the Oxcom would follow and kill whatever is by the dog.However another government agencies tries to destroy this project and blows up the building where the two are being held but neither are killed and they both head off into the woods. The dog has the advantage but the Oxcom is close behind and ready to kill whoever the dog goes near. The dog eventually ends up with 16-year-old Travis (Corey Haim) who takes a liking to the animal and also understands how smart it is.

The executive producer was Roger Corman so that there should tell you what type of film this is going to be. If you've seen any of the low-budget drive-in shockers from the 1950's then you've pretty much seen this film.

The dog in the film is so darn lovable that you really can't take your eyes off of him and the scenes between him and Haim seem like something you'd see in a Disney film and not a gory horror movie. I'm actually a fan of Haim but he's also a problem here due to the rather silly performance. Most of the time he's trying to act tough but it comes off laughable especially the silly ending, which seems like something Rambo should be doing.As I mentioned earlier this film plays out just like the monster movies from the 1950's and this is a problem. The director uses Corman's trick of not showing the monster too much throughout the film, which is fine if the movie runs a little over an hour but coming in at 92-minutes the film simply runs out of steam very early making the rest of the film drag along without anything interesting happening. The story is laughable and not too believable but this could have been overlooked had the viewer ever feared the actual creature.

Maybe it would look or sound better on DVD. When I saw it on VHS, I couldn't understand half of the sentences because of the strong Cockney accents. None of the characters were appealing, including the two leads, and there was too much usage of the Lord's name in vain. Bob Hoskins has been guilty of that in many of his films. He seems to play a lot of very loud, obnoxious and profane thug- type characters, for almost three decades since this film. In fact, the last movie I saw him in - 2005's Unleashed (a.k.a. Danny The Dog) - he hadn't changed a bit. As for this film's story Hoskins, as Harold Shand, is ably cast the boss of the docks in London. One day is bragging about how things have settled down since he's run the show, and the next minute his favorite pub and his Rolls Royce are blown up. Whoops, things aren't so peaceful. Things get worse.However, the film, as twisted filmmakers like to do, almost make Harold a sympathetic character even though the guy obviously is a obnoxious, sadistic con man.For those who like rough characters and high-energy films, this is your ticket. For those turned off by boorish, irritating characters like Hoskins usually plays, skip it and save yourself some aggravation.

Maybe it would look or sound better on DVD. When I saw it on VHS, I couldn't understand half of the sentences because of the strong Cockney accents. None of the characters were appealing, including the two leads, and there was too much usage of the Lord's name in vain. Bob Hoskins has been guilty of that in many of his films. He seems to play a lot of very loud, obnoxious and profane thug- type characters, for almost three decades since this film. In fact, the last movie I saw him in - 2005's Unleashed (a.k.a. Danny The Dog) - he hadn't changed a bit. As for this film's story Hoskins, as Harold Shand, is ably cast the boss of the docks in London.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"14 March 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Everybody ought to know by now that director Alfred Werker's semi-documentary police procedural He Walked By Night, with Richard Basehart and Scott Brady, inspired Jack Webb's classic radio and television crime series Dragnet. The evocative, film noir photography of the late great John Alton, who also lensed a couple of John Sturges films Mystery Street and The People Against O'Hara as well as Richard Brooks' Elmer Gantry, gives this lean, mean 1949 thriller an edge that neither its budget nor its action could have achieved in tandem. Alton's photography makes He Walked By Night the memorable experience that it remains. Good acting by all involved bolsters the film's credibility, especially a low-key Basehart registering brilliantly as a contemplative homicidal killer with a pet dog. The dog humanizes Basehart's elusive killer. The most overlooked performance is Whit Bissell as the timid electronics factory owner. Other commentators have provided relevant historical background for this atmospheric melodrama and they are worth reading if the historical background appeals to you. The noted film scholar Jeanne Basinger in her exemplary book about director Anthony Mann writers settles the issue of the directorial authorship of He Walked By Night. She points out that Werker received final credit for He Walked By Night, but Mann helmed all the scenes with Richard Basehart. Clearly, He Walked By Night qualifies more as a Mann film than a Werker effort. Critics have never ballyhooed this low-budget, superbly made, minor urban crime thriller, and this lack of critical recognition is really unfortunate. He Walked By Night provides top-drawer suspense entertainment in virtually every department. The only objectionable scene here involves a couple of detectives grilling a Chinese suspect. Not only does the man not know English, but also the detectives look like idiots for questioning someone that clearly doesn't understand English.He Walked by Night unfolds with several long shots of a Los Angeles city map. Racket Squad actor Reed Hadley delivers the prototypical description of L.A. that would open each Dragnet episode over similar shots. Afterward, Mann takes us first to the Hollywood Police Division where we learn that He Walked By Night is the case history of a killer. The scene shifts to a dark, quiet. tree-lined street late one evening in Hollywood. An immaculately dressed Roy Martin (Richard Basehart of Moby Dick) is prowling dark streets and casing an electronics shop. Equipped with lock-picking tools, he is about to commit burglary when an off-duty cop heading home, Office Robert Rawlins (John McGuire of Flamingo Road), spots him. Rawlins pulls over and questions him. When he asks to see some identification, Rawlins isn't prepared for the reception that he receives. Martin produces a gun from his suit and blasts away. Swiftly, the killer scrambles to his car, while Rawlins struggles to fire shots at him. In a desperate bid to stop Martin, Rawlins guns his sedan. Swerves it across the street and smashes into Martin's stolen car before he can get it cranked. Witnesses provide the authorities with a description, but Martin shaves off the pencil-thin mustache and begins on his next criminal endeavor. Later, we learn that Rawlins has died from his gunshot wounds.When he isn't committing crimes, Martin modifies his stolen equipment and then rents it out to Reeves Electronics Laboratory run by Paul Reeves (a bespectacled Whit Bissell) who urges Roy to join his firm. Roy brings in his television projection set and leaves before the original owner arrives. The owner identifies the equipment and calls the police. At this point, Captain Breen (Roy Roberts of My Darling Clementine) assigns Sgt. Marty Brennan (Scott Brady of Dollars) and Sgt. Chuck Jones (James Cardwell of The Sullivans) to the case and they question Reeves. Martin calls up and Reeves tells him that he has sold his television projector. Jones gets Reeves to tell Martin that he has his dough ready and to come in that night and pick it up. Later, Martin surprises everybody that night and shoots Jones, paralyzing him and knocking Brennan unconscious. In the process, however, Martin is wounded by Jones. In a scene that predates First Blood, Martin digs out the slug himself with sterilized doctor's tools. Meanwhile, the crime technician, Lee (Jack Webb of Dragnet) gradually pieces together information about Martin until Brennan suggests that he use something that allows witnesses of Martin's robberies to create a picture of him. It seems that Martin has been on a robbery spree and uses the storm drainage system underneath Los Angeles to escape from the authorities.Anyway, Captain Breen relieves Brennan from the case since the latter has made no headway in capturing Martin and Breen is feeling the heat from his own superiors. Later, during one of his visits with the recuperating Jones, Brennan learns that the Breen is trying to rattle him enough to come up with a fresh approach to the case. Brennan starts looking where he didn't before&#151;in the surrounding police departments. Eventually, he uncovers Martin's secret and his real name Roy Morgan. Breen masquerades as a milk man and finds where Morgan lives. The long arm of the law assembles with cops, guns, and tear gas to flush Morgan out. Predictably, Morgan flees to the storm drainage system with the LAPD in hot pursuit. They don't aim to let him escape their clutches again! This tightly-knit thriller is pretty good, even by 1948 standards. The police are depicted like idiots during the first hour because they constantly underestimated the resourceful adversary who even keeps a shotgun stored in the underground drain system. John Alton creates a marvelous sense of atmosphere with images that highlight the area above the heads of the participants. The photography in the storm drainage system is terrific stuff! Scott Brady is good as the cop determined to bust Morgan, and his Sgt. Brennan's one characteristic that is emphasized is his shortage of matches for his cigarette habit.
