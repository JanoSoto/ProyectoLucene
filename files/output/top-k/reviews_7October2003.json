Had I seen it, though, I would probably have rented it for an evening where I just wanted some standard entertainment.This movie is about a salvage crew on the ship Sea Star which suddenly comes upon a (seemingly) deserted Russian research ship while escaping into the eye of the hurricane they were trapped in.Entering the Russian ship - primarily driven by greed for the salvage they might collect - they soon discover that the ship isn't deserted at all but is inhabited by some kind of alien life form.This movie is pretty standard - there's no real surprises here when comparing to other sci-fi horror movies ... also the characters are nothing unusual. There's the heroes - Jamie Lee Curtis and William Baldwin - the only ones in the crew capable of thinking straight. On the other side there's the dubious captain - played by Donald Sutherland - obviously driven quite mad by the loss of his precious cargo in the hurricane. Besides these three there's some unimportant cannonfodder characters.Overall, the movie's alright ... the acting is fine for this sort of movie - it ain't Shakespeare. I was wondering why the captain spoke with different accents in some scenes, though  ... !! The alien life form is also okay - I found them quite scary, although they should have emphasized on the psychological horror of the alien ways instead of the physical.So the movie is worth watching if you like this sort of movie - just don't expect any great surprises. Wait ... there is one surprise ... not many one-liners or humorous scenes ... that's really great in my opinion. Usually they ruin the movie for me.***** SPOILERS BELOW *****One of the weakest points of this movie is probably the captain and his actions. Why does he ally with the alien life form? Well ... my best guess would be that he has lost everything (in the hurricane), and maybe even the possibility of collecting salvage for the Russian ship if the others will defeat the alien. I don't think he expected to be made into a cyborg ... he probably hoped that leading the alien to port would make him stand alone with the salvage pay while someone else (the military or whatever) could destroy the alien. After all, he didn't have much to loose since he was already on the verge of suicide.

Austin Powers is a one trick pony that probably doesn`t deserve to be a mega money making franchise but somehow is . WAYNE`S WORLD  works okay as a five minute TV spot but probably doesn`t deserve a full length feature film based on the characters never mind a sequel . In short I dislike the comedy genre and will only watch a comedy movie if there`s nothing else on . Nothing else happened to be on so I sat down expecting to suffer tedious American ninties expressions like  Party on dude  and  Excellent I must admit that while WAYNE`S WORLD 2 didn`t exactly have me rolling on the floor it was by no means an ordeal either . The loosely written plot revolves around Wayne trying to impress his girlfriend by holding a concert called Waynestock . There that`s the plot in a nutshell but makes the comedy so entertaining is that it`s politically incorrect while at the same time doesn`t go overboard on trying to shock and offend . Compare this amusing movie with FREDDY GOT FINGERED to see what I mean . It was also nice to see a few cameos too .If you`re not expecting too much I can recommend WAYNE`S WORLD 2  ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2003","score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I`ve nothing against Mike Myers , but I fail to see why his movies are sure fire hits .

If you're watching it as a horror film, PEEPING TOM will look very self-indulgent and needlessly melodramatic. Personally speaking, I didn't buy the story for one second. It looked more like a cleverly constructed homage of the director's career than a real horror film. The film is mostly a pity fest tortured, misunderstood artist who's totally possessed by his need to express himself through, in this case, a most deadly artform of capturing death on film by killing the women (and only women) he meets. As usual in these kind of tortured artist stories, there's a woman who falls for Mark and the thing sorta becomes a tragic love story (thank god Alfred Hitchcock didn't write a love interest for Norman Bates in PSYCHO). The idea of Helen (wonderfully played by underrated Anna Masey) falling for Mark is ridiculous and totally forced. The clunky premise isn't helped much by the unconvincing psychology behind the killer's motivations his father tortured him when he was a kid and yet Mark, as an adult, only kills women. Okay. Things only got less subtle, with Helen's mother being a blind woman who's all seeing and wise which SCREAMED to me that the film was more of a not-so-subtle symbolic exercise from Michael Powell about himself and his career as a filmmaker than anything else. The fact that Michael Powell himself played the domineering father in the black and white home movies and that the kid who plays young Mark was Michael Powell's real son and the fact the home movies were shot where Powell grew up as a kid only reinforced the whole self-indulgent aspect of the movie me, me, me! This obvious self-indulgence in the story and direction killed ALL attempts at horror.But if you watch PEEPING TOM as a tribute to Michael Powell's career, made by Michael Powell himself, well, the movie is suddenly fitting and brilliant. Fitting as a tribute because PEEPING TOM  suddenly became Powell's last major movie after the uproar it created when it was released. PEEPING TOM, or the controversy surrounding the movie, basically killed Powell's career as a serious filmmaker. The elaborate behind-the-scenes moments or the scenes with Moira Shearer (who worked with Powell in THE RED SHOES) dancing around the studios say more about the famed filmmaker than the film's tortured character. Watch PEEPING TOM as some sort of elaborate post-modern tribute to the director. Don't watch it as a horror movie. It's just too melodramatic and self-indulgent to create anything close to disturbing or creepy.
