came in 1994 i was 4 but if i was older i would have loved to see this in the theater but now thanks to the disc it provides good entertainment,Keanu did some films before this but hardly anyone knew him until director Jan De Bont made his directorial debut in united states,this film put him onto the world map.Many filmmakers also took inspiration from this film including Indian Cenima in 90s but none comes close to this stunt fest filled carnival ride.The PlotJack is a policeman who is at race against time to save the city from disasters first the elevator,then second thing is a bus which is going to its destination with passengers inside it there is a bomb planted if the speed slows down below 50 the bus will explode & later the underground train all this is happening because of one man Howard Payne who feels cheated by L.A police department as they fired him and did not gave him enough money.The Castgreat cast i must say all the cops,passengers & Dennis Hopper was a weaker villain but way better then joker in the dark knight 2008,Keanu Reeves did an amazing job here he looks fit & sexy in the role as for Sandra Bullock she was simply stunning her reaction when she is driving the bus & hits a baby carriage filled with cans is excellent.I wont go in much detail because there is not point i have to say one thing only that this movie includes some of the best stunts ever this is not a john woo film as woo is a action master but this director created a great impact in Hollywood & elsewhere worldwide in 90s.Overall this is way better then die hard series any time Bruce

Midnight introduces Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and his partner, 'Ratso' Rizzi (Dustin Hoffman). But how did thay' could possibly have scored distinction? The term 'distinction' I used was me referring to the ability of scoring being different; not to be perfect or marvelous. Buck stays with his appalled cowboy-texan outfit, while Ratso always sleeps with his black, gelled hair and seductive American-Italian accent. They do stay consistent with their characters' elements, and hence it made them unforgettable. Joe Buck? He is that cowboy. Ratso? The thick black haired guy with the accent.Joe Buck, a Texan dishwasher, makes his way to New York City to seek a fortune by becoming a male prostitute for women, some kind of a 'hustler', but instead, he only gets an uncomfortable friendship with a cripple con-man named Ratso. Instead of winning success in the city like how he first though he would get, he only wins a rotten apartment in a condemned building that Ratso offered after aimlessly living in the city for some time. The words that a friend of Buck used during its one of the opening sequences already quite have summed up the film Oh, I bet you it's a mess back there (New York City).Joe Buck is naïve, why? Surely he had only spent his life in a small town of Texas and rarely engaged to the outside world and he is probably the most charming lad in Texas which led to an idea that he is that 'most-goodlooking-man' in the world, but undoubtedly he is not. His biggest flaw would be his ability to not notice that his beliefs are completely as a whole, is a mistake; only the public sees, and 'Ratso' Rizzi sees. Self-esteem being misplaced perhaps? Maybe. The worst fact about being naive is that you wouldn't be able to notice it for yourself, and Midnight able to show that thoroughly. The film's study on naivety is spot on.The plot's structure is simple and incredibly easy to follow, but the little details are the ones that are very difficult to adhere. The smaller stories will be thrown around throughout the film, and I have to help myself to fix the details that are being scattered. Upon my first viewing, through its flashback moments, I am only able to notice that Joe Buck was very lonely as a child; but Joe Buck goes for far more than that. Joe Buck is a character with depth and complexity, and Midnight rewards repeat viewings.The friendship between Joe Buck and 'Ratso' Rizzi is a pure breeze. The tie stays as a fun entertainment and a backbone of the picture; a miss will prove that the film will be less successful. The praise is supported by perfect performances and a suave screenplay written for the characters. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely superb; the chemistry between the two talented stars stays in transcendence in modern cinema.Jon Voight flawlessly captured the sheer innocence of the character. His voice, and the intelligent navigation of facial expressions did help the character to appear natural or genuine. Hoffman on the other hand, succeed in becoming a crippled but yet charismatic loser. Oscar nominations for the two leads speak volumes.If you are a lazy movie audience, then it would be tough for you to enjoy the Midnight trip. I mentioned that the movie suggests enjoying throwing its stories around and having an expectation to fix them. Midnight never tells, but shows, and with that idea, you have to slightly be hard on yourself.

Barbara Stanwyck in an eye popping performance, played against the goofy baggy pants clown sidekick. I adored seeing Pinky Lee, he of the TV show of my childhood. Black and white is not my favorite, but it had to suffice.Stanwyck gave the illusion of bumping and grinding, ala the Hays Code which forbade such graphic realism. 1943 was smack in the middle of World War Two. This was a good performance for all those fighting servicemen (was this movie shown overseas in their duty stations?). Apparently the War Code plus the Hays Code did a number on the depictions and performances, but the direction was smooth and exacting.Mae West also was an author and widely censored. I thought of her when I was reading about Gypsy Rose Lee's authorship endeavors. Both women are still household names, and evoke visions of sultry sexiness and vampy delivery. Both women had brains, and were very shrewd and inventive performers -- knowing what the public (read men) wanted.1940s was also a time of movies about bucolic rural-type small town and historical situations, Meet me in St. Louis, etc., State Fair, The Best Years of Our Lives, National Velvet, Lassie Come Home, not to mention the late 1930s classics Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Then there were the gangster bw noir movies, but that's another story. Some more late 1930s early 1940s movies were Stage Coach, Alexander's Ragtime Band and Weekend in Havana.Lady of Burlesque was about a sleazy, brassy, cheap jewelry, dyed hair, backstage world of a former opera house that was recently converted to presenting cranky, trashy, vulgar, vindictive, bitchy bump-and-grind female performers in very little garb. If I say bitchiness, I am only copying other reviewers. Men really liked this type of entertainment better; they wanted to see a lot of skin. (Did I mention sin?). In those other movies above mentioned, people kind of kept their clothes on. Barbara Stanwyck's character here was not trashy; she managed to have some class.Barbara Stanwyck? No other name star in the movie. She was the lead. Pinky was the only other actor I had ever heard of. Could Barbara be sexy? YESSSSSS!!!!! To wit, remember her in The Thorn Birds mini series. She was an elderly wealthy woman in love with the handsome priest. She pulled out all the stops to come on to the way-younger Father Ralph de Bricassart (Richard Chamberlain). Barbara was jealous of the young ingénue female lead.Barbara was a gas in Ball of Fire. Indeed. Showing those geeky nerds how to dance. She had the legs to go with all of the steps. Talk about her opposite Fred MacMurray. I would rather see her in Lady of Burlesque.I am impressed. She could play against type. She could play any part. She knew the score. She had a very good, low singing voice in Lady of Burlesque.More observations These women performers in this movie were not housewives. They did not wait on husbands and children all day, serving them cocoa and washing their faces. The women were called girls, which was appropriate for 1943 but way sexist by our current ideals. With all of their gangster boyfriends, can you imagine how many abortions they had in order to continue their careers? Abortion is the oldest form of birth control. Side note girls could have killed each other, and probably did in real life, without waiting on the male murderers to do the job. There was so much jealousy and literal and figurative back-stabbing, perhaps, behind the scenes.Barbara as Dixie\/Gypsy (rhymes, sort of?) Be happy Dixie Daisy (Daisy = Rose) was there. She had the best legs. She had breathtaking, ladylike yet sultry costumes. She obviously made more money than the other performers. She was the Headliner. Yes, one of her songs said she gave tons of money to Mother every week.I am a movie historian, and student of the lives of stage\/movie\/vaudeville\/burlesque actors, dancers, singers, directors, producers and impresarios in history and of the current day.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 August 2014","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Some of my observations I give it a ten.

Barbara Stanwyck in an eye popping performance, played against the goofy baggy pants clown sidekick. I adored seeing Pinky Lee, he of the TV show of my childhood. Black and white is not my favorite, but it had to suffice.Stanwyck gave the illusion of bumping and grinding, ala the Hays Code which forbade such graphic realism. 1943 was smack in the middle of World War Two. This was a good performance for all those fighting servicemen (was this movie shown overseas in their duty stations?). Apparently the War Code plus the Hays Code did a number on the depictions and performances, but the direction was smooth and exacting.Mae West also was an author and widely censored. I thought of her when I was reading about Gypsy Rose Lee's authorship endeavors. Both women are still household names, and evoke visions of sultry sexiness and vampy delivery. Both women had brains, and were very shrewd and inventive performers -- knowing what the public (read men) wanted.1940s was also a time of movies about bucolic rural-type small town and historical situations, Meet me in St. Louis, etc., State Fair, The Best Years of Our Lives, National Velvet, Lassie Come Home, not to mention the late 1930s classics Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Then there were the gangster bw noir movies, but that's another story. Some more late 1930s early 1940s movies were Stage Coach, Alexander's Ragtime Band and Weekend in Havana.Lady of Burlesque was about a sleazy, brassy, cheap jewelry, dyed hair, backstage world of a former opera house that was recently converted to presenting cranky, trashy, vulgar, vindictive, bitchy bump-and-grind female performers in very little garb. If I say bitchiness, I am only copying other reviewers. Men really liked this type of entertainment better; they wanted to see a lot of skin. (Did I mention sin?).

With that pedigree, I was really looking for a good roller coaster film and maybe it was those expectations that ultimately left me wanting a little more.My first problem is that the movie was in dire need of more character development.

I get the idea that he was struggling to cope with his loss of manhood and identity and that this sets up the theme that will be explored in the finale of the movie, but there was never a time where I ever liked the main character, or saw that he truly loved his wife at any time, so I never developed any care for either him or his relationship.The biggest problem is that nothing ever really happens in this movie. I know that that is going to be considered sacrilege by the devotees and that's fine. We all have opinions. The first half of the movie is nothing but angst filled scenes of our hero coping with his shrinking problem. Doctor visits, arguments with his wife, exploitation by the media, all of this is used to again further the theme of the movie, which is really that once all identity has been lost, man truly finds himself, but it's all just talking and more talking.

A lot of the rest of it is just flat and empty. The two pivotal scenes of the chase with the cat and the final battle with the spider are both good and provide some tension, but they didn't do enough to make me want to watch this movie again.I will give a lot of credit to the special effects.

Jaws 2 is more or less a mediocre sequel, but one that doesn't destroy and tarnish the appeal of the Jaws franchise(until Jaws 3-D and Jaws The Revenge).Jaws 2 picks up about four years since the original events of the first film. Amity is barely recovering financially, Brody's kids are older, and they frequently go sailing with their friends, and oh by the way a new shark claims the territory of Amity Island once again. This movie is by all means not perfect, and it sorely misses the presence of Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw, but it is quite enjoyable. What makes this film work is Roy Scheider. His performance as Brody is arguably better than the first film mainly because of how the script develops his character. In the film he's very paranoid, scared, but he is certain that there is another shark out there and is upset that Mayor Vaughn(Murray Hamilton) and Len Peterson(Joseph Mascolo) or no one at Amity Island believes him. There are wonderful moments of doubt and fear Brody displays and a touching moment with him and his younger son Sean when Brody shoots down a school of blue fish, mistaking it for a shark. Roy Scheider is able to bring depth and complexity to his role, making him very believable and one can't help but feel sorry for him. His wife Ellen Brody played by Lorraine Gary is more fleshed out here too and she provides a great supporting role. She and Scheider have a nice banter among each other and you believe them as a couple. The teens are pretty much throw away characters that are in this film to be shark food, they're quite irritating and they scream a lot, especially by a female named Jackie played by Donna Wilkes, but for a movie like this it comes within the territory. A few including Mike Brody(Mark Gruner) have more to do than others. Jaws 2 also had a troubled production like the original Jaws. Give credit to direct Jeannot Szwarc for doing the best job he could, he even butt heads with actor Roy Scheider quite a bit. What Jeannot Szwarc smartly does was to show the shark a lot more than the first film did. He wisely knew repeating what Spielberg did was just a cheap repeat and rehash of the original. I liked the idea of seeing the shark's point of view in certain shots of the film, and he shoots all the action scenes with care and they are quite impressive. The score by John Williams is also excellent. It's very different from the original film, but still contains some elements of that original shark theme. The problem with this movie is that, while the script has decent moments, it ultimately is a slasher\/murder horror film, mainly because there is much emphasis on the teenagers who we don't care for, but like I stated it comes within the territory, but it very much has that been there done that type feeling. I was much more intrigued and entertained with all the character moments. As impressive some of the shark scenes were, they're could have been less, at times it gets overwhelming and sort of drags the movie quite a bit messing with the momentum of the film, and frankly quite boring. Overall this is a decent film, it's not as horrible as other's might say it is, it feel that way because this film, as I've stated before has that been there, done that, feel.

I'm a fan of the witty, intelligent, British humor, though I know from experience that puts me in a group that very few people fit into. However, I think this movie has a bad rep because of its fans. Being one of them, I know that quoting lines from it all the time can really get on people's nerves. As a result, many people whose local Python fan convinces them to watch the film have already heard each line a hundred times apiece. So lots of people watch this movie with no small degree of prejudice, but there are a few scenes that I feel could be humorous to most people. I've seen non-Python fans enjoy the Tale of Sir Lancelot, the Black Knight scene, the witch burning, and the Holy Hand Grenade. The rest of the jokes and such leave lots of people confused or wondering how it is supposed to be funny. Even with modern ratings, it would retain its PG rating, though it is certainly not a kids movie. There is some crude humor in it, but not like you see in some films. Most of the humor is just puns and ridiculous lines that are somehow even funnier because of the British accent. Even though the producers had a low budget to work with, they definitely got a good bang for their buck. Everything that comes as a result of budget cuts creates some of the elements that the Monty Python group is famous for, like the coconut horses and the blood that resembles Kool-Ade more than anything else. The acting is very good too from the annoyance of Graham Chapman, to the smiles of Eric Idle, and the versatility of John Cleese that is rivaled by few. The performances of Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gillman are also impressive. On a slightly religious note, I feel that the scene with God reprimanding Arthur for groveling is a great example of how the Church of today is rather too wordy and falsely flattering in prayers. The only point in this movie that I don't like that much is when Sir Bedevere and King Arthur are traveling from the Bridge of Death to the Castle Arrg. To conclude, I would recommend this movie to anyone in a passing bad mood to let them know that the craziness of the world is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for a movie to watch for continuous laughs, find something else.

On a slightly religious note, I feel that the scene with God reprimanding Arthur for groveling is a great example of how the Church of today is rather too wordy and falsely flattering in prayers. The only point in this movie that I don't like that much is when Sir Bedevere and King Arthur are traveling from the Bridge of Death to the Castle Arrg. To conclude, I would recommend this movie to anyone in a passing bad mood to let them know that the craziness of the world is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for a movie to watch for continuous laughs, find something else. To all avid Monty Python fans, I would say, enjoy this movie as much as you want, but quoting it among people that will respond to it negatively is a bad move.

All of them are excellent.

This is compounded by the film's debunking of many of the myths of the old west. The moral and ethical shape of the film is also more interesting, and indeed realistic, than other westerns because there are no goodies and baddies here, just several shades of grey.All of the technical aspects of the film are handled with outstanding skill. Cinematography, lighting, sound, makeup, costumes and set design are all first rate as is the score which includes a contribution from Eastwood.To sum up, 'Unforgiven' is a film that has received a great deal of critical praise and it's deserved every last bit of it.

No, I say, I don't have any religious beliefs and it was something far worse than blasphemous. It was inhuman. For the record, this film is a blatant and obvious con-trick, and was always meant to be that. By making schoolboy jokes about supposed Christianity, and the clichés of Biblical epic movies, the Monty Python gang could pretend that they were being terribly daring, that they were prepared to risk their reputations by taking on the might of the Church. They did nothing of the sort. The jokes are just stupid, and often very nasty, demeaning to common humanity; they're not in the least satirical or brave or savage. They're also not funny. But, because jokes about religious matters were uncommon in dumb comedies in 1979, the brain-dead idolaters of the team could tell themselves that it was real cutting-edge stuff, and then the Pythons could add to their unmerited lustre by pretending they were somehow more than merely funny. More than funny? Come off it. I smiled momentarily maybe four times, mostly thanks to the uncredited Spike Milligan, who, in a few seconds of screen-time, was better value than the whole of the rest of the cast.

It's because of this, and the ridiculous controversy that surrounds such a practice, that, I believe, the amount of interracial relationships in Hollywood are shockingly little and the idea is so frequently underexplored that, if it were just given a bit more exposure, could free us from the shackles bestowed upon us by lame and incredulous romance dramas. With the right marketing, proper writing, and strong acting, a film about interracial relationships could be defining for a large, underserved demographic.Marc Forster's Monster's Ball is an efficient and substantial film concerning interracial relationships and how grief can transcend even the biggest boundaries in our lives, especially those built by our own parents and relatives. It concerns Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a quietly racist widower who works with his son Sonny (Heath Ledger) in a corrections office and takes care of his ailing, openly racist father (Peter Boyle). Hank often oversees executions that occur in his corrections department, and often doesn't appreciate the hard work and dependency of his son, criticizing him that he's too soft and too weak-hearted to handle his job. After a confrontation at their home, Sonny proceeds to kill himself right in front of his father. Hank moves on with his life by burying Sonny in the backyard and quitting his job at the corrections office.Early in the film we also find ourselves meeting Leticia Musgrove (Halle Berry), a woman who has been struggling while raising her overweight, artistic son Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun) while her husband Lawrence (Sean Combs) was in prison and subsequently executed by Hank. Hank sees Leticia in a local diner quite frequently, but one day on his travels home, sees Leticia crying while holding Tyrell in her arms after he is struck by a car. Despite prompt efforts by Hank and Leticia, Tyrell dies in the hospital, leaving Leticia distraught and without two of the biggest people in her life.A heartwrenching scene takes place between Leticia and Tyrell early in the film. Leticia has been concerned about Tyrell's weight for a while, and finds that he keeps eating chocolate and not trying to stick to any kind of diet. She is so frustrated about his disobedience that she winds up physically abusing him, forcing him onto a scale and slapping him around repeatedly. The scene is devastating because not only do we know that Leticia is just acting out on momentary stress, but we see that Tyrell, who already seems to have very few friends and opportunities to exercise his artistic passion, is simply confined to physical abuse and upsetting, emotionally scarring treatment. One wonders if the real life story of Calhoun was similar to the one he conveys on screen (I say was because Calhoun was listed as missing following the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and there have been no subsequent reports of him being found, leading me to believe he's missing and presumed dead as of 2014).It almost goes without saying that the performances are spectacular all across the board, from two low-key, beautifully nuanced performances by Thornton and Berry to a wonderfully tender and often saddening performance by Calhoun. And together, they make the somber and often tonally-rich screenplay of Milo Addica and Will Rokos work, by carefully constructing the right scenes and never overplaying others for emotional manipulation. Both Addica and Rokos do a beautiful job at showing how in a time of grave uncertainty and untold sadness that even two people with nothing remotely in common, bearing two separate views on life, can come together and miraculously find solace in each other - even the way the film handles sex is in a deeply human, respectful way. Monster's Ball shows that without overplaying its core emotions nor turning into a pile of cliché-ridden drivel; it's a carefully-crafted, somber film concerning heavy topics explored in a mannered way.Starring Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, Coronji Calhoun, Peter Boyle, and Sean Combs.

Both Addica and Rokos do a beautiful job at showing how in a time of grave uncertainty and untold sadness that even two people with nothing remotely in common, bearing two separate views on life, can come together and miraculously find solace in each other - even the way the film handles sex is in a deeply human, respectful way. Monster's Ball shows that without overplaying its core emotions nor turning into a pile of cliché-ridden drivel; it's a carefully-crafted, somber film concerning heavy topics explored in a mannered way.Starring Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, Coronji Calhoun, Peter Boyle, and Sean Combs. Directed by Marc Forster.
