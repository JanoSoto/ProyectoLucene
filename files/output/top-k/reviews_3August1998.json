[{"date":"3 August 1998","score":"44 out of 55 people found the following review useful","review":" David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts which include Airplane!, Top Secret!, and  Naked Gun, the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take Mafia!, please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries. By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.

This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  One  reason it was so funny was because they decided to take the risky path and  go for an R rating.  You do not see many R rated comedies anymore  because everyone is trying to make money.  They do not care if the jokes  are lame (ala Mafia!), they just do not want to rate it R because they  will be limiting their audience.  I respect David Zucker for bringing us a  movie with crude humor not meant for children.  Sure the movie won't make  as much as it would if it would have been PG-13, but it sure keeps you  laughing the whole time.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job in the  film considering this is their first big acting jobs.  Nobody else could  have played these parts except those two.  They work extremely well  onscreen together and keep you laughing.  Between the cheerleaders, the  cameos, the team names, the sight gags, etc. this film will keep you  laughing and never let up.  David Zucker has done a great job on this film  and I look forward to whatever he has in store for us in the future.
