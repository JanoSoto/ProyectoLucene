Cons  A too comical villain, illogical plot holes, and obvious special effects.  First of all, if you seriously intend to watch SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, I highly encourage that you watch it on DVD. The VHS and video store rentals do no justice to the vision of this movie. I recently rediscovered this movie when I bought it on DVD and I was astounded by how much I missed watching it on video. As I mentioned before, Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography is gorgeous. There are places where there is a beautiful glow to the scenes that make the movie even more magical. I love the Smallville scenes. I especially love the scene with Clark and Martha Kent standing in the wheat fields when he is saying good-bye to her.  The beauty of this scene continually takes my breath away. The DVD version is also in wide screen and the rescue scenes are even more breathtaking. Especially notable is the infamous helicopter scene. When Superman catches the helicopter, in the wide screen version, we are able to see the full length of the helicopter as well as Superman and Lois Lane. In the pan and scan version, you don't see the entire helicopter. It truly takes away the effect of the scene. Of course the DVD has also enabled Superman's outfit to truly look red, yellow, and blue in all shots. The picture quality is crisp and clear. If at all possible, see the DVD version!!!!! As wonderfully entertaining as this movie is, it is the kind of movie that serious critics may never admit to liking. For this reason, it is overlooked and under appreciated.   After rediscovering this movie, I think there are so many wonderful things about this movie1) SUPERMAN as an epic.  It takes its' time setting up the story. We have three very distinct settings Krypton, Smallville, and Metropolis. Many people may feel impatient, waiting for Superman to show up and start saving people but I loved the back-story and the very humane and respectful way his character was treated.  He was less of a caricature and more human.2) Christopher Reeve as Superman I suppose every generation will have their Superman. Christopher Reeve will always be mine.  His acting is very understated and natural. He not only fits the part physically, he does justice to the characters. He has given Clark Kent and Superman a notable difference that other actors haven't been able to manage.  I think he made a wonderful decision to give these two characters outwardly distinct personalities.  His ability to switch between the two is amazing. His Clark Kent is sincere and  awkward; his Superman is modest, humble and authoritative. I will always associate Christopher Reeve with Superman. He elevates this movie way above sheer camp and gives this movie a decency, seriousness, and light touch that it may otherwise not have. Believe me, he is the ONLY reason SUPERMAN III and IV should be watched.  Without him, this movie would likely have been a failure.3) John William's musical score.   John Williams has composed many memorable themes but if the opening credits don't get your blood racing just a little bit, there must be something wrong with you. Who could not hum the theme to this movie after the opening credits? I can't remember another theme that has been able to capture the unspoken story of the hero so well. All in five minutes before the movie even begins. This movie has two very strong themes intertwine throughout the whole movie the Superman theme and the love theme. The score is so popular that Rhino\/Warner released a 35-track re-release of this movie last year. It has every imaginable music cue from the movie and alternate tracks. It is selling for $29.99 and is worth every penny for the die-hard fan. It has all of the musical cues in the movie as heard in the movie in chronological order. The alternate tracks are at the end of each CD. Every movie soundtrack should follow suit int he way Warner\/Rhino has put together this soundtrack for the fans. The fact that this movie opted for original instrumental music instead of any cheesy period pop song has helped it to achieve classic status. The movie feels less dated as a result.4) The movie has what many comic book adapted movies don't heart and soul. This is evident from the very beginning to the very end of the movie. Jor-El's love for his son as he is sending baby Kal-el to earth, Clark's love and respect for his Earth parents, Superman's feelings of vanity and pride, and finally Superman's love for Lois that leads him to ultimately defy his father. Not to mention his anguished scream... it still gets me every time. These scenes offset the comical scenes that I feel bring SUPERMAN down a few notches in quality. 5) Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography and John Barry's production design. The first two parts of this movie are majestic and beautiful. I daresay the wheat fields of Kansas and the shot of Clark and his mother in it as he is saying goodbye to her is breathtaking. John Barry did a wonderful job giving each setting a distinct look. As a child, these settings remained ingrained in my mind.  My brother waves away SUPERMAN's  idealism and prefers BATMAN's darkness and humanity. I understand his point of view. How fun is a superhero that hardly has any weaknesses and is virtually invulnerable? What is the appeal and fascination with Superman? After reading about him, I find him fascinating. Superman is fascinating in many ways and he is ultimately an American Mythological Icon. Although I couldn't go into detail about everything, here are some of the things about him that are interesting1. Superman is an immigrant.  He is from another planet and he is ultimately an alien and an immigrant. This mirrors every American's story here in America. 2. He is a Savior. SUPERMAN THE MOVIE can essentially be seen as a Christian metaphor. Superman as Jesus sent to Earth to save humanity.  Jor-El as God. `I have sent my only son. They (humans) have a capacity for good. They only lack the light to show them the way.' In fact, there is an excellent website that talks about this aspect of  SUPERMAN.  There is an essay on him that goes so far as talking about SUPERMAN II and how SUPERMAN giving up his powers is his death on the cross and when he gets his powers back, he is resurrected.3. Superman is an orphan and a loner. Superman will always be alone. He will always fight his battles alone. 4. Superman's innocence and idealism.  It may be corny to some. His gee whiz, golly, wide-eyed innocence is very endearing to me. In a time when we can't even claim that our children are innocent, this is refreshing.5. Superman's high morals. Given his invulnerability, he has set an extremely high standard for himself.  6.. Superman\/Clark Kent\/ Kal-el I find this identity crisis extremely fascinating. I found it especially fascinating in SUPERMAN II when he gave up his powers and he was a mortal with Lois Lane. Who was he then? He wasn't Clark, Superman, or even Kal-el.  I also found myself asking if Lois Lane really loved this `new' man or if she really loved him as Superman. I suppose she can never love him truly until she knows him as all three personas and she loves all three. Perhaps it also speaks to the majority of us that we want to be acknowledged and loved as `Clark Kent' even though we do need Superman. Or do we?In the added scene to the new version of  SUPERMAN, we are allowed to see that Jor-El warns Superman that his identity must be kept secret because humans would ask of him things that they can very well do for themselves. SUPERMAN, then,  is ultimately an agent of change; someone who can show us who we want to be and who we CAN be. Perhaps there is a SUPERMAN and a hero within us all. The staying power of Superman is that he represents our deepest wishes to serve a higher goal and to live by a higher standard of  responsibility and excellence. He represents that hope and capability in all of us. I may be a hopeless romantic, but I'll take Superman's hope over Batman's despair any day. Besides, what happens when we lose all hope?Of course, you can very well walk away and say this is all pretentious BS. I think SUPERMAN is very clever in this way. It manages to entertain children while raising some serious questions for those adults who even care to think about them. There is so much more to say about this movie. To be sure, SUPERMAN THE MOVIE is not without it's faults. I respect Gene Hackman as an actor but his Lex Luthor made SUPERMAN campy and it is probably this part of SUPERMAN that people remember when they wave it away as kiddie fare and easily forgettable. On certain days, I forward past all of his scenes. Perhaps, his comic villain is what makes this movie more appealing to children than the average adult filmgoer.  If you haven't figured it out, I am a fan of  Superman and an admirer of the mythology of Superman. I've never collected comics but I am fascinated by the human condition and Superman addresses this in a very subtle way. If this disqualifies everything that I've said thus far, so be it.I would be very interested to see how Superman will be interpreted for the new millennium. However boring it might seem to some, I think it would be fascinating to see a more mature Superman dealing with his responsibilities and his new viewpoints of life and humans. On the other hand, would this more adult telling of Superman essentially destroy the story of Superman?

This is one film that we watched over and over and over again. I've watched it again recently this year after not having seen it for almost fourteen years. Do you know what? It's still as funny today and when I first watched it long ago. I'm still as obsessed about this movie today as I was about it then. I practically got all the lines memorized.What is amazing about the movie is the star himself, Paul Reubens. As a kid I actually believed there was a person named Pee-wee Herman. When you watch him, you don't see an actor playing the character of Pee-wee, you actually believe he is Pee-wee.After watching the movie again, I was so surprised to see that Danny Elfman did the score for this film. It's pretty obvious. It's reminiscent of the music for the Simpsons. Danny Elfman's score was amazing! The music so fit the type of character that Pee-wee is. The music is manic and crazy just like Pee-wee.I was also surprised to see that Tim Burton directed this film and that it was his first directorial debut. I love his use of colours in the film. It made the whole movie seem like a cartoon, a lunatic's version of a sideshow.One of my favourite scenes is the Mr. Breakfast scene. Here we see that Pee-wee is a demented fellow, possibly with a history of mental illness. He talks to his pancake breakfast (Mr. Breakfast) and he eats Mr. T cereal. I loved his imitation of Mr. T's voice. We see him using oversized cutlery and toothbrushes and he has a scotch tape fetish which he uses to mold his face into bizarre contortions.Then when he embarks on his Big Adventure, and meets all those crazy people (like Mickey the escaped convict, Simone the waitress, the hobo, the Satan's Helpers), you actually begin to see that he is actually pretty normal compared to them and that is where the humour lies.This movie had plenty of visual gags and many cool catchphrases by Pee-wee himself. Also, if you were a child in the Eighties, you'll understand all the 80's stuff (like radical, BMX bikes, Mr. T cereal, Twisted Sister).All in all, it's a great movie and really funny. One of my most favourite comedy films of all time. Get the DVD version as there are many extra treats in it for fans of Pee-wee.

The music is manic and crazy just like Pee-wee.I was also surprised to see that Tim Burton directed this film and that it was his first directorial debut. I love his use of colours in the film. It made the whole movie seem like a cartoon, a lunatic's version of a sideshow.One of my favourite scenes is the Mr. Breakfast scene. Here we see that Pee-wee is a demented fellow, possibly with a history of mental illness. He talks to his pancake breakfast (Mr. Breakfast) and he eats Mr. T cereal. I loved his imitation of Mr. T's voice. We see him using oversized cutlery and toothbrushes and he has a scotch tape fetish which he uses to mold his face into bizarre contortions.Then when he embarks on his Big Adventure, and meets all those crazy people (like Mickey the escaped convict, Simone the waitress, the hobo, the Satan's Helpers), you actually begin to see that he is actually pretty normal compared to them and that is where the humour lies.This movie had plenty of visual gags and many cool catchphrases by Pee-wee himself. Also, if you were a child in the Eighties, you'll understand all the 80's stuff (like radical, BMX bikes, Mr. T cereal, Twisted Sister).All in all, it's a great movie and really funny. One of my most favourite comedy films of all time. Get the DVD version as there are many extra treats in it for fans of Pee-wee.

This is one film that we watched over and over and over again. I've watched it again recently this year after not having seen it for almost fourteen years. Do you know what? It's still as funny today and when I first watched it long ago. I'm still as obsessed about this movie today as I was about it then. I practically got all the lines memorized.What is amazing about the movie is the star himself, Paul Reubens. As a kid I actually believed there was a person named Pee-wee Herman.

So all that annoying jibber-jabber turned out to be necessary for that one joke in which the character breaks character to talk to the narrator, who is apparently not the real Emperor or he would've known what the other Emperor was already thinking . . . oh, forget it.  It's a little funny simply because it's not expected, but it's not really original--I think Woody Allen did it a few times, and I know stuff like that happened in Looney Tunes on a regular basis.That's another problem.

Simply put, there are more (and better) jokes in just about any one of the better Bugs Bunny shorts (e.g. What's Opera Doc?, Rabbit of Seville) than there is in Emperor's New Groove.  In fact, the only jokes I laughed out loud with were the repeated shoulder angel scenes and the reaction the villain and the Emperor have to Cronk talking to his shoulders (but even that was merely a one-step-farther parody of an over-used Looney Tunes gag).This is an annoying change in direction that I hope Disney will not continue--Disney has been far too interested in comedy lately instead of character and story.  Even the old Disney shorts (such as the Sorcerer's Apprentice piece from Fantasia) usually had a certain character depth that Warner Bros. cartoons often lacked (they relied on neat sight gags and movie parodies).Worst of all, the animation is only so-so.  There is absolutely no depth to the world they have created--no interesting camera angles or neat little touches like animals or insects or shafts of light or anything.  The backgrounds are just there, instead of the characters reacting to the backgrounds as if they're in that world (for examples of location depth, take a look at My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, or Bambi).  If I remember right, only a few scenes even shaded the characters according to the background (i.e. darker in forests or in buildings, much brighter when in the sun, spots of light that come in between leaves, etc.).  The characters are animated very smoothly, but occasionally suffer from the previously mentioned Looney Tunes syndrome.Eisner, I've made this plea before please making important chases\/ decisions\/growth spurts\/training sequences into quick-cut musical montages.

He was very believable as an alien in an unfamiliar body, with all the nuances of body language finely honed to convince us in almost subliminal fashion. The ultimate fish out of water.

And beautiful, as always, in her wide-eyed vulnerability. Her performance was the equal of Bridges', with the subtle development of her character's relationship with the starman from puzzlement to terror to trust to understanding to love. The only problem I have here is that sometimes her (Hayden's) deep understanding of the human psyche (Define love.) seems a bit out of character, although she (Allen) tries to compensate by delivering these lines in halting fashion.But that's Hollywood! If the movie was true-to-life realistic, it would be too dull for words!I admire Carpenter's restraint in avoiding the typical schlock humor typical of the fish out of water genre.

Aunt Claire seemingly has a green thumb as she transplants her housekeepers to the ground and plants a pine tree over them.  As we see in the first part of the film, there are at least three pine trees before we see the first woman bashed in the head with a rock and then planted. We then see another housekeeper, Edna Tinsley, killed in similar fashion with a shovel.  Now, five pine trees in the desert.  Enter Mrs. Dimmock, a woman in disguise as a housekeeper out to find out what happened to her long-time friend Edna.  This cat and mouse relationship between Claire and Mrs. Dimmock serves as the basis of the film.  This film was produced by Robert Aldrich, who was responsible for bringing us films like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and Hush..Hush, Sweet Charlotte.  Aldrich made films that had older female protagonists popular in the sixties by giving these starring roles to ladies that were a bit aged and considered passe.  Geraldine Page stars in this film as Aunt Claire, and if you had any doubts about her talent as an actress prior to seeing this film, no doubts should have remained afterward.  Page is simply stunning.  She has an aura and charm about her.  She has a wonderfully sadistic and maniacal laugh.

I had heard that the all-Japanese version was much better than the one with the scenes with Raymond Burr, and only recently was able to make that judgment for myself.The American version includes all the monster footage from Gojira, (though the sequence of the shots sometimes varies) except for a few extra shots of the jets attacking him just before he returns to the sea after his second and most lethal attack on Tokyo.  There is a little more discussion with Dr. Yamane explaining his findings with slides at the open forum and more discussion in Serizawa's lab with Emiko and Ogata, and aside from a few additional shots here and there, thats about it.  However, what separates the two films is being informed exactly what is being said in Japanese, whether it involves a scene that is in both versions or just in Gojira. For example, we learn in Gojira that people and livestock were killed on Oto Island when the monster came ashore during a storm at night.  In the American version, it's unclear whether anyone was killed at all.  The legend of Godzilla is played up more on Oto Island, and the belief in the need to sacrifice maidens to the creature.  At the forum, we learn that according to Dr. Yamane, Gojira is 50 meters tall, which is a considerable discrepancy from the American version where the scientist is dubbed as saying the monster is over 400 feet tall.  Very importantly, we find out what that big argument is about when some women really get into it with some government officials.  It seems the politicians want to keep Gojira's existence a secret from the general public, while the women think everyone should know about this prehistoric menace.  We also learn Yamane anticipates before any battles are fought that it is unlikely that Gojira will be able to be killed by conventional weapons.  We also obtain much more information about 'why' Dr. Yamane feels Gojira should not be destroyed. Gojira (and Godzilla) is probably the most successful example I've seen of a man-in-a-suit monster.  Somehow, the two night attacks on Tokyo are extremely effective.  In fact, Gojira's slow, methodical and deliberate manner of annihilating everything in his path, including people, buildings and military weapons, comes across as wanton and sadistic.  The music is a slow, hopeless, melancholy dirge that accompanies Gojira during his almost casual incineration of the city.Overall, I'd say Gojira has the edge over Godzilla, mainly because you have so much more information about what is being said in Japanese, which of course gives you far better character development.  Gojira is a dark, gloomy film that is very unsettling to the point that even the eventual defeat of the monster is somehow not particularly reassuring.

One could say that those who love the game will manage to enjoy the movie, even those people would rather sit through Super Mario Brothers or Wing Commander twice over again before finding something nice about this $100 million joke.Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft, a rich British woman with big breasts who also happens to go hunting around in temples and caves all around the world in search of treasures and archeological antiquities. The quest for this film is some triangle that will allow the bearer of the piece to travel back and forth in time. Lara wants to use it to visit her father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), who mysteriously departed this world in 1985. Of course, there is a nemesis to deal with and he comes in the form of Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), who looks more like a European hairdresser than he does an archeologist. He's working for some organization called Illuminati, who of course wants this mysterious piece for their own devious use (BWA-HA-HA!). The device only works during some sort of galactic lining up of the planets, so the ticking clock theory is in effect for the story (one could only wish for a countdown clock in the corner of the screen so we could find out when we could leave the theater).I would really love to meet the blow monkeys who keep giving director Simon West steady work. Seriously, this guy has made three movies now (this pile of bile and two other trash heaps, Con Air and The General's Daughter) and they have all sucked really hard. He can't tell a story to save his life (let's give part of that blame to Michael Colleary and Laeta Kalogridis, the two chimps credited with the script), has no sense of character or pacing (to make up for this, he edits his scenes even more than Michael Bay does if you can imagine that) and he shoots his action scenes so close up that it is almost impossible to make out what is going on. There is plenty of action to be had, but who really cares about it if you can't see it? Where is the fun in that?As far as the cast goes, it's simple no characters to work with equals no performances to speak of. The one-liners that are given to Jolie, Noah Taylor as Lara's sidekick Bryce and Chris Barrie as her butler arehorrendous. Jolie herself looks the part, but she shows less life as Lara Croft than her videogame doppelganger does. Jon Voight has only a few scenes, and I am sure he is thanking God right now for that lack of screen time.When a film like this sucks this hard, you can usually say that the visual effects at least are really cool. Not here. For a one hundred million dollar film, the budgets look like they cost about $3.00 (they must have spent the rest of the money on Jolie's padded bras).It makes me sad to see a film like Moulin Rouge, one that shows enoughenergy and life to fill three dozen Tomb Raiders, struggle to make $30million dollars while this revolting film will probably make double that in its first week. There will be people, namely those who fantasize about the videogame Lara Croft (she's only zeroes and ones. She's NOT REAL!), that will defend the film saying, What did you expect? The film is based on a videogame! You don't know how to have fun! To them, I say this Get a life. Put down your joystick, walk outside your parent's house and instead of walking to your local brainwashing plant (multiplex), go out and meet a real human being that may interest you. Get to know them and discover a world beyond videogames and the revolting movies based on them.

The movie manages some cool scares and cool deaths. The acting is very good, the almost newcomer Marley Shelton gives a great acting and knows something to be thrilled, althought Denise Richards gives a such moderate bad\/good acting. The script would have been better with some better dialogues, but Jamie Blanks' directing is extremely excellent like his previous film Urban Legend.

I must admit i loved Gladiator, not just because of the action sequences, because i do feel that there have been far greater action pieces.  Gladiator had a gripping story.  When Crouching Tiger was nominated for Best Picture, i felt certain that it would be of the same caliber as Gladiator and even hearing reviews for the film i felt it might even surpass. I finally got the opportunity to see it and i found it to be subpar. First of all i know many people that dislike the movie do so on the basis of the flying. However i felt that this was adequately explained by the film as being part of the Wudan training.SPOILERSThere is a scene where Jen is in her room and Lo comes in, a character that we had previously not been introduced to.  What ensues is a long flashback scene in which Jen pursues LO all over a comb.END SPOILERSI felt that this scene was actually quite Dull and LO's character has no real place in the film, he appears to be merely added on and actually hurts the fluidity of the film.  Further more i found the idea of pursuing a famed criminal through a dessert to be very idiotic.  This scene adds nothing to the film but detracts much. The romance between Lo and Jen also appears to be rushed and has no true emotional impact. Finally, the ending was a bit of a let down in that you are expecting a massive confrontation between Jade Fox and Master Li, and everything appears to build to it and in the end it is very short and not very impressive compared to the other action in the film. The ending is also something that i found unfulfilling, it left a lot to be desired. And the Dialogue...what can i say about the dialogue, it was dull and moronic at times.  During the first confrontation between the undercover police officer, his daughter and another individual the dialogue is painful. The movie was overhyped and fails to live up to expectations.  This is all of course my humble opinion, but i found myself strongly disliking the film.

This subject (child abuse\/incest) is one of the most uncomfortable for our society to acknowledge, and it has too often been treated luridly on screen -- the sensitivity displayed here by all involved is welcome and refreshing, and it should give us hope.  I wish this incredible film had seen a theatrical release, so that more people could experience it. The screenplay, carefully rendered by Anne Meredith from Dorothy Allison's moving novel, is one of the best adaptations I've ever witnessed.  Some parts of the book were necessarily omitted -- the film could only be so long -- but Meredith shows intelligence and respect for her base material by not tinkering with it.  The story is a hard one,  told well in the book -- and the translation to the screen has retained that impact, with all of the horror and pain of Bone's childhood there for us to see and feel.   The cast is simply amazing, especially Jena Malone as Bone.  It' very rare to see an actor so young turn in such a performance -- it must have been extremely difficult for her -- her courage, as well, should be applauded.  If she can show us work like this at such a young age, what does her career hold in store...? To those who feel there was too much brutality in this film -- this is real.  This is something that occurs far more often in our 'civilized' society than most people would be comfortable admitting.  The horror and disgust we feel at witnessing such actions, even in a film, are as nothing compared to the pain and scars (both physical and psychological) that such crimes leave on innocent children -- pain and scars that can last a lifetime.  Shame on you if you cluck your tongue and decry such an important film because it 'makes you uncomfortable'.  That's exactly what it should do.  I would also recommend Tim Roth's stunning film THE WAR ZONE. Kudos to Anjelica Huston and everyone involved in bringing this moving work to the screen.
