Fight club is not for everyone and I would recommend viewers should be at least 16 to appreciate the level of depth this film has to offer as well as the violence being a bit to gracious for younger viewers. Many critics and audience members have complained about the level of violence in The film and how it can have an effect on viewers. However I believe that the this film has something to say and that is not carry out the messages in the film, it isn't saying start a Fight Club yourself and beat your friends to a pulp, it's simply a metaphor for young people to do something with their lives, don't just sit around becoming a couch potato and let yourself become another Jack.This film works on so many levels, First off as a Black comedy, then as a Thriller mixed with action and strong conventions of a drama genre. The acting in this one is just incredible, Edward Norton has been robbed twice before at the Oscars and once again being Robbed by not even being Nominated. Brad Pitt has also again proved that he is a very talented actor (One of the most underrated actors around).In my opinion David Fincher is one of the best directors of all time and quite possibly the best around at the moment. I love the dark, harsh lighting he brings to his films, He uses a wide range of different techniques in the film, to help and confuse the audience. I love the CGI shots he uses through out the film.  This is one of those Films where the CG shots actually add to the film rather than just there to make it look visually good.Fight Club is very well scripted and although different form the book is just as good, Which is quite a compliment considering books are usually much better.

I saw the preview for Coyote Ugly so many times that I was sick and tired of the movie before it was even released. I was unable to decipher any kind of plot from the preview, and the reason is simple. If the producers had allowed the preview to reveal the extensively recycled and re-done and re-made and used up plot, no one would have bothered to watch the movie. From a business point of view, that's very understandable, and I respect the decision not to reveal how shallow this movie is too early on. However, after seeing the entire film, I have realized that Coyote Ugly is packed full of every cliche ever created by every unoriginal and boring film ever made in cinematic history.(spoilers) Young kid decides to leave home to pursue wild dreams in the big city. Encounters difficulties, gets robbed, decides to go home, father encourages her to keep trying, success is inevitably and laughably attained. I accurately predicted at least 80% of everything that happened in this film. Did anyone not know that there would be a robbery at her new apartment in New York? Was anyone surprised that she would have some sort of superficial problem getting her music heard? Is it that hard to predict she would succeed at the end? Okay, I'll admit that if she failed, the movie probably would never have been made (what a relief that would have been). You can't put a Fight Club ending or an Arlington Road ending on a movie like this. But look at the way the entire movie panned out. Violet was completely isolated from reality during the entire film. Think about the logic here. Violet goes to New York to become a star, but obviously has trouble getting a record executive to listen to her music. She goes home one day to find her apartment robbed. This is the pathetic attempt to make it seem like the real world, but even if it did do that, this is where it stopped. For the rest of the film, everything worked out perfectly. The first guy she meets becomes her wonderful new boyfriend. The first group of girls she overhears in a diner are talking about the lucrative jobs they have, and how one is leaving and there will soon be a difficult effort to replace her. This very same bar happens to be the hottest bar in town, and when Violet inquires about the opening, she is hired within minutes. You gotta be kidding me.Besides all that, everything that happened in the plot is just recycled garbage that has been seen dozens of times before. Violet finds a cute new boyfriend. They get in the usual fight somewhere in the middle of the film, and when she tries to call thinking she wants to apologize or something, she hangs up a split second before he grabs up his receiver, anxiously saying Hello? Hello? to the usual dialtone. She goes to his house to make things right, and just as she shows up, he's got some girl walking into his apartment (THAT was the most predictable element of all). But wait! He's not sleeping with her, he's showing her the apartment to see if she might want to move in! He's a sweetheart after all! How about Violet's job? Obviously some problem has to come up (the suddenly lonely parent, as always, winding up in the hospital), and she has to get fired at least once. When she does, she decides to get a job at a quiet little restaurant (which, for some reason, doesn't seem to have electricity), but eventually goes back to her old job. The bar scenes were both laughable and ridiculously exaggerated. No bar in the world looks like that, and even if one did, there would not be scantily clad female bartenders dancing on the bar every few minutes, and even if there were, there would be about 50 bouncers, not just one. You would think a policy or two would change when the airheaded blonde Cammie was pulled into the crowd and fondled by a bunch of drunks. I guess nothing came of that because she didn't seem upset about it at all. Every bar scene in this film was the result not of skillful filmmaking, but of audience manipulation.What a pathetic waste of time. Everything in this movie has been done before, and it has never been done worse than it was done here. Even though New York City is portrayed terribly, at least they thought to throw in an acute bit of stage fright for Violet so she would have a problem that coincides slightly with reality, even though this was also ridiculously unoriginal (ever see Runaway Bride? EXACTLY the same thing). Coyote Ugly is an awful movie. It follows a formula that is more easily decipherable than the script, and it is the kind of film that will probably be hugely entertaining to you if you have never seen a movie.

The plot was written in a way to make the characters very believable and real. Spader plays a tragic hero that needs the bad guy (under-played to perfection by Reeves) to come back into his life in order to find closure with his past and come to terms with the present. Neither Spader nor Reeves played to stereotypes common to this genre, and as a result, their performances were gritty and powerful without coming across as over-the-top.  Stereotyped performances are a common weakness in many other similar movies, which are also good movies, but they rely on star performances from their marquee actors. This becomes a troublesome thing when the acting tends to define the movie and hides weaknesses and implausibility within the script. Recent examples of this are seen in The Bone Collector, Copycat, and Kiss The Girls. I liked each of these movies for different reasons, but The Watcher was more real to me because the actors weren't playing a type. Spader showed a reluctant vulnerability and a controlled intensity that was very true-to-life in my experience. And Reeves was so spooky as the serial killer because he tried to show a small sliver of his Evil each time without ever overdoing it. Another great surprise was Tomei, who came out of semi-retirement to also give us a dead-on performance as Spader's psychiatrist. She, too, acted emotionally in a way that filled the role without ever becoming a movie stereotype. Visually, her hair, make-up, and clothes helped downplay her character and allowed her to become just another real person who arbitrarily became involved in things.

There have been only a few football movies which were very well made and resulted in quality films (Unnecessary Roughness was fairly well-done, and especially The Program, probably one of the best), but it seemed that The Replacements was an effort to either revive that genre (which is pretty much worn out) or to cash in on its past success. The story is loosely based on and an updated version of the 1987 pro-football strike (I doubt that the bullet riddled Porsche was a 1987 model), but the majority of the film is made up of an unimaginative story about replacement players. Almost the entire movie was put together using scenes that were disturbingly familiar to scenes from other films. For example, the actual replacement players were introduced exactly the same way that the 'replacement astronauts' were introduced in Armageddon. The actual football scenes require no imagination at all, and could have come from anywhere, and the cheerleaders were a tasteless element of the film in the tradition of BASEketball. Besides that, how about the ending? (spoilers) The team needs heart in order to win the big game, coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) says to the television reporter. He is obviously sending out a message specifically to Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), the team's 'star' replacement quarterback. How touching. Needless to say, Falco decides to head down to the stadium to save the day, and boot the pro quarterback who had recently re-joined the team. Falco walks into the locker room at half time, everyone cheers, they go on to win the game. Does that sound familiar at all (Remember when B-Bobby Boucher showed up and the M-M-Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl, do ya?)? Yeah, so Falco saved the day in true Waterboy form, and the movie ends just like every other football film ever made has ended.Despite the lacking story and the many unlikely events that take place (Is that your ride? Yeah. BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!), The Replacements was barely saved by some surprisingly good acting. I was sick and tired of Keanu Reeves (until I saw The Matrix, where he delivered an excellent performance), and I expected a disappointing turn from The Matrix to a routine football film, but he was very convincing as the disillusioned quarterback who is suddenly faced with the chance to reverse his shabby reputation. Even Brooke Langton provides a good depiction of the only original cheerleader who is suddenly surrounded by strip club airheads and has some pretty good on-screen chemistry with the monotonous Keanu. The Replacements is a fairly good football film which doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done before, but at least it wasn't as terrible as Varsity Blues.

Perhaps some people were just expecting 90 minutes of non-stop explosions or something.The film does have its moments of introspection, which is part of its charm. This isn't just about a couple of hard nosed cops out to collar a criminal. Instead we're treated to classic SF themes such as What does it mean to be human?  Self-doubt about identity.  The consequences of technological advance ahead of developments in ethics and philosophy.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this film has anything particularly original or important to say as these are pretty standard SF\/cyberpunk themes to people who read books in the genre.  But compared to your average Hollywood SF product or the usual anime flick, this one is a standout.I also appreciated a few scenes that perhaps dragged on the pace a bit, but ultimately added to the visual experience of the film.  Such as the Walking the City chapter (track 8 on DVD) which is basically a music video which allows us to explore the city where the action takes place.  This scene not only functions as eye candy, it also gives us a generally positive feeling about the future city (and perhaps the future in general).  Why should we care about this place?  That sequence is the answer.The real problem with the film is its complexity, which will only become clear on repeat viewings.  Even as a hard core SF fan, I really didn't get the whole film the first time through.  It made a lot more sense the second time.  For people who saw it in the theatre, this might have been a problem. Owners of the rather short DVD can easily see it twice.  Heck, you'll even want to.

One of the reasons why this film is so memorable is because of the Chicago locations. For the past 25 years or so there have been lots of good movies shot in and around Chicago (as well as the suburbs) such as Risky Business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and The Fugitive just to name a few. But Adventures in Babysitting is probably my favorite movie to be made in Chicago. I saw this movie when it first came out in the summer of 1987 (a year after Ferris Bueller which Adventures bares somewhat of a resemblence to) and while I was watching the film it felt to me like I was part of the adventure. Today, this is still a very entertaining picture, and a lot of fun. Elisabeth Shue is terrific in her first leading role as Chris Parker, a 17-year-old high school senior who prepares for a big date with her boyfriend at the beginning of the film. But he cancels the date, and since she's now free for the night, she's asked to babysit for the Anderson kids. She agrees. Once she gets over there, she gets a frantic phone call from her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who's run away from home and is now stranded at a bus station in downtown Chicago. Terrified after witnessing a shooting, Brenda asks Chris to pick her up because she blew all her money on the cab ride to the bus station. Hesitant, Chris has no choice but to take the two Anderson kids Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan) with her to pick up poor Brenda. Also going along for the ride, Brad's horny best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp). Once they get on the expressway, things start to go wrong. Very wrong. This is where Adventures in Babysitting turns into a fun movie. The foursome experience car troubles; run-ins with a friendly car thief, a mob group the thief works for (who spend most of the movie chasing the kids through the streets of Chicago), and two gangs on a train; a short trip to a hospital (when one of the kids is slightly injured by a member of one of those gangs); a brief stop at a frat party; a chase to the top of a high-rise building; and a show stopping classic scene in a blues bar. And much more happens as the hapless Brenda continues to wait and wait and wait for Chris to come get her. Adventures in Babysitting was directed by Chris Columbus in his directing debut after writing screenplays for a couple of Steven Spielberg produced movies (Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes). Since this film, Columbus has gone on to direct some of the biggest box office hit comedies of all-time such as Home Alone, Home Alone 2, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Adventures in Babysitting was nowhere near as big a hit as those films, but it did modestly well. I would have loved to see a sequel to this. It would have been interesting to see what kind of misadventures were next for Chris and company. Shue, Brewton, Coogan, and Rapp all seem to be having a blast on screen, and I would too if I were up their on the screen. Even though Miller doesn't seem to be having a good time, she's a scream as Brenda (she would later show off some real good acting in Kindergarten Cop and Awakenings). And Vincent D'Onofrio (of Men in Black and currently The Cell) has one of his first film roles in a very small part as the owner of a auto repair shop (where the broken down car gets fixed).
