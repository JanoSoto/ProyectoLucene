Helmed by Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director responsible for such other balls-to-the-wall action sci-fi classics as Robocop and Total Recall, Starship Troopers is both an intelligent parody of American fears and a take no prisoners, blood and guts war movie.At first, it's easy to see how much in this movie has been changed from it's source material, the book by acclaimed science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlien. It seems to share only a handful of things with the mentioned novel the title, the names of our hero and several other characters, and the main story arch of Earth going to war with a race of vicious, bug-like alien beasts. But if you look closer, you'll see that the movie is more successful in accomplishing the message of Heinlien's book than the book itself.The movie is set in the future, with no given time or date, and we see a society that is much more conditioned and under control than the world of today. Like most sci-fi Earths of the future, our planet is governed by a single body, a Terran Federation, and everyone on the world falls under their hand. Only military veterans are allowed to become citizens of the Federation, and only these veteran citizens are allowed to vote. Jail is no longer much of a consideration in this future; corporal punishment is the law. Don't worry about paying a 200 dollar fine for drunk driving about ten lashes at the local whipping post will do the trick. All of this is presented to us by Verhoeven in ingenius propaganda shorts which intercut periodically throughout the movie, detailing every aspect of the world in an indirect and strangely effective manner.Our main story involves a young man named Johnny Rico, his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, and his buddy Carl Jenkins. After graduated from high school, the three go into the service; Johnny joins the Mobile Infantry, a Marine-like troop of battle-hardened soldiers, Carmen signs up to become a pilot in the Galactic Navy, and Carl goes into Military Intelligence. All three of these characters are good-looking young kids, strapping and confidant, more like Beverly Hills 90210 cast members than rifle-toting grunts. But as we follow Rico through MI Boot Camp, and ride along with what he experiences, we see that these bleached-teeth young 'uns transform from naive, to scared, to blood-thirsty harbringers of destruction.And destruction comes in the form of an attack by a race of hideous insect beings hailing from the far-away world of Klendathu. Now Verhoeven has his chance to send our young friends, hungry for death, into the cold night of unblinking combat. The special effects in these battle sequences are nothing short of amazing, with fantastic CG renderings of looming Federation starships, vicious bug drones, and gigantic beasts which launch nuclear fire from their antennae. These scenes are gory, spectacular, and above all wicked cool.Starship Troopers is a film which is more complex than meets the eye. The aw-shucks hopefullness of youth, representing mankind in all its glory, taking on and crushing their Godless opposition can't help but call to mind a time when America had such enemies to turn to as Communism and Facism, and the ability to say, Our boys will take care of you. That idealistic era is a far cry from the United States of today. Our boys aren't fighting, because we have no bugs.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and recommend it to anyone with a love for great sci-fi and intelligent action films.

Jonze is to Music Videos what Steven Spielberg is to movies.  Two videos in particular, Weezer's Buddy Holly and Sabotage by the Beastie Boys have become classics.  Holly spliced footage from Happy Days with Weezer playing in a mock-up of Arnold's.  Sabotage was a skillful parody of 1970s police dramas a la Starsky and Hutch.  My personal favorite, though, is Bjork's Oh, So Quiet which was an affectionate homage to Fred Astaire dance musicals.  All of his videos are known for their creativity and visual flair.So one would expect a lot of flair from Being John Malkovich.  Strangely enough, not in this film.  Being John Malkovich has enough chutzpah and imagination from its very strange story.John Cusack plays a down-on-his-luck, and facial-hair covered, puppeteer named Craig.  In any other movie that may sound like a cliche, but in a hilarious opening sequence, Craig performs a beautiful yet highly erotic puppet show.  And of course the only people watching it are a very traumatized nine-year-old and her outraged father.  Said father then punches Craig.  Our puppeteer hero is married to Lotte, an almost unrecognizable and homely-looking Cameron Diaz.  Lotte is a pet store owner who keeps most of the pets in their cramped apartment.  It seems the young married couple are experiencing financial woes and Cusack must go get a real job.  Since he's good with his fingers, he gets a job as a filer in an office building....on the 7 1\/2 floor.Things get stranger.  The floor has incredibly low ceilings so everyone must spend their time hunched over.  The film does a great subtle job in the weirdness.  Brief reactions of bemusement are given by Cusack, but nothing over-the-top.  Weirdness filters in and out of life after all.  Why do you need to act surprised?  It is on this floor that Craig first lays eyes on Maxine (Catharine Keener) and falls in lust with her.  Maxine is not impressed with our puppeteer and is even less impressed when he tells her his talent.  You still play with toys?Things couldn't get any worse, right?  But they do get weirder.  As Cusack is filing one day he happens across a little door behind a file cabinet. Curious, he enters the door and finds a portal that leads into John Malkovich's consciousness.  Yes, John Malkovich.  Otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense.  The catch is that he can only spend 15 minutes in the body before being spit out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Why New Jersey? Why not?Later he tells his wife about the metaphysical ramifications about this particular Pandora's door.  She tries it out anyway and finds she enjoys being a man.  Meanwhile, Cusack tells Maxine about the door and she comes across a capital idea of turning in some profit from people who want to be a celebrity.  That distinction is important.  A great running joke of the film is that everyone knows who John Malkovich is but they can't recall any of the films that he has done.  Everyone just wants to be someone else for fifteen minutes.Things get more complicated as each member of our trio wants to use Malkovich for their own means.  Then Malkovich gets wind of the door and enters into his own consciousness.  And if that ain't weird enough, don't worry.  You'll have plenty to go Wha? about.Kaufman has got his own brand of logic to this illogical story.  There are certain subversions to classic character traits.  For instance, Malkovich the victim comes up with the most logical idea  Seal the damn door.  But it lasts for only three minutes as his humane plea goes unheard.  I felt sorry for Malkovich the character.  Then there is our hero.  He at first tries the door out, then feels reluctant to share this information citing metaphysical inconsistencies that could prove irreparable.  But when Maxine begins to show interest in Malkovich, Craig goes ahead just to be with Maxine.  In fact everyone in the film is suffering from some form of obsession; even Lotte disregards Malkovich's right to exist as an individual because she wants to complete her self-actualization as a man and consummate with Maxine as Malkovich.That I think prevents this film from being four stars.  The first thirty minutes are farce funny as it piles on layers and layers of strangeness. Then things take a dark turn as Malkovich becomes Cusack's ultimate puppet. I get the sense that nothing went unheeded with detail.  Everything makes sense in the story; nothing is weird for weirdness's sake.The cast does an excellent job.  Especially John Malkovich for allowing himself to be in on the joke.  He seems to be having fun.  Cusack proves himself in another wonderful performance as a nobody schnook-hero who turns into a monster. Keener makes a great bitch.  And Diaz is terrific as a homely wife who finds her happiness by pursuing masculinity in Malkovich.But Spike Jonze provides intelligent restraint.  One can almost imagine what Hollywood would do with a story like this, probably add some computer effects for the portal and the expending on the New Jersey Turnpike. Again, the story is fantastical enough that added effects would underscore the artificiality of the film.  In other words, there is a nice sense of realism in the details.I actually had a nightmare after the film in which I dreamt there was another consciousness dwelling inside me.  So that must say something about what kind of effect it had on me.  The scary thing about Being John Malkovich is that if there was a way for people to change their identities, they probably would.  The question is would they want to go back.  Would you?

The first thirty minutes are farce funny as it piles on layers and layers of strangeness. Then things take a dark turn as Malkovich becomes Cusack's ultimate puppet. I get the sense that nothing went unheeded with detail.  Everything makes sense in the story; nothing is weird for weirdness's sake.The cast does an excellent job.

One can almost imagine what Hollywood would do with a story like this, probably add some computer effects for the portal and the expending on the New Jersey Turnpike. Again, the story is fantastical enough that added effects would underscore the artificiality of the film.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"5 March 2000","score":"","review":"  If Music Video Auteur, Spike Jonze's first feature-length film is any indication, this will be someone to keep an eye on.  Jonze is to Music Videos what Steven Spielberg is to movies.  Two videos in particular, Weezer's Buddy Holly and Sabotage by the Beastie Boys have become classics.  Holly spliced footage from Happy Days with Weezer playing in a mock-up of Arnold's.  Sabotage was a skillful parody of 1970s police dramas a la Starsky and Hutch.  My personal favorite, though, is Bjork's Oh, So Quiet which was an affectionate homage to Fred Astaire dance musicals.  All of his videos are known for their creativity and visual flair.So one would expect a lot of flair from Being John Malkovich.  Strangely enough, not in this film.  Being John Malkovich has enough chutzpah and imagination from its very strange story.John Cusack plays a down-on-his-luck, and facial-hair covered, puppeteer named Craig.  In any other movie that may sound like a cliche, but in a hilarious opening sequence, Craig performs a beautiful yet highly erotic puppet show.  And of course the only people watching it are a very traumatized nine-year-old and her outraged father.  Said father then punches Craig.  Our puppeteer hero is married to Lotte, an almost unrecognizable and homely-looking Cameron Diaz.  Lotte is a pet store owner who keeps most of the pets in their cramped apartment.  It seems the young married couple are experiencing financial woes and Cusack must go get a real job.  Since he's good with his fingers, he gets a job as a filer in an office building....on the 7 1\/2 floor.Things get stranger.  The floor has incredibly low ceilings so everyone must spend their time hunched over.  The film does a great subtle job in the weirdness.  Brief reactions of bemusement are given by Cusack, but nothing over-the-top.  Weirdness filters in and out of life after all.  Why do you need to act surprised?  It is on this floor that Craig first lays eyes on Maxine (Catharine Keener) and falls in lust with her.  Maxine is not impressed with our puppeteer and is even less impressed when he tells her his talent.  You still play with toys?Things couldn't get any worse, right?  But they do get weirder.  As Cusack is filing one day he happens across a little door behind a file cabinet. Curious, he enters the door and finds a portal that leads into John Malkovich's consciousness.  Yes, John Malkovich.  Otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense.  The catch is that he can only spend 15 minutes in the body before being spit out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Why New Jersey? Why not?Later he tells his wife about the metaphysical ramifications about this particular Pandora's door.  She tries it out anyway and finds she enjoys being a man.  Meanwhile, Cusack tells Maxine about the door and she comes across a capital idea of turning in some profit from people who want to be a celebrity.  That distinction is important.  A great running joke of the film is that everyone knows who John Malkovich is but they can't recall any of the films that he has done.  Everyone just wants to be someone else for fifteen minutes.Things get more complicated as each member of our trio wants to use Malkovich for their own means.  Then Malkovich gets wind of the door and enters into his own consciousness.  And if that ain't weird enough, don't worry.  You'll have plenty to go Wha? about.Kaufman has got his own brand of logic to this illogical story.  There are certain subversions to classic character traits.  For instance, Malkovich the victim comes up with the most logical idea  Seal the damn door.  But it lasts for only three minutes as his humane plea goes unheard.  I felt sorry for Malkovich the character.  Then there is our hero.  He at first tries the door out, then feels reluctant to share this information citing metaphysical inconsistencies that could prove irreparable.  But when Maxine begins to show interest in Malkovich, Craig goes ahead just to be with Maxine.  In fact everyone in the film is suffering from some form of obsession; even Lotte disregards Malkovich's right to exist as an individual because she wants to complete her self-actualization as a man and consummate with Maxine as Malkovich.That I think prevents this film from being four stars.

Despite a clunky title and an unlikely leading man (even Shandling himself seems stunned by the reality of it), this movie manages to just barely pull off a decent performance.The premise seems much more suited to an hour and a half of repetitive penis jokes (and, in some ways, it gets close to that) Shandling plays Harold Anderson, an alien from a planet inhabited by impotent, super-intelligent men bent on universal domination.  Led by a stiff-lipped Ben Kingsley (whose neck seems to have disappeared) this race of uber-men has lost all semblances of emotion, let alone sexuality.  In their quest for universal rulership, they have chosen Earth as their next target.  Their goal?  To impregnate a human woman and begin populating the world with their kind.Of the millions of available aliens, Shandling is chosen as their ambassador, and after being fitted with an artificial and somewhat dysfunctional penis (it hums when erect), he travels to Earth in a glowing white ball and immediately begins incorporating the lessons he learned about the delicate art of female seduction.  For instance, he has an endless bevy of nice footwear and nice perfume remarks, including some slang Kitty likes to scratch!Sounds like a one-hour one-liner, huh?Fortunately, it's not.  It's safe to say the movie would have fallen flat on its alien face if it weren't for the stellar performance of Annette Benning as the one woman who finally falls for the bumbling alien's charms.  She manages to take this ludicrous premise and bring a touching dose of reality to it, giving a normally crass idea a glimmer of merit.  She is what diversifies Shandling's occasionally monotonous character, and it is through her eyes that the film sheds its hokiness and becomes a real movie.Co-stars John Goodman and Greg Kinnear, to their credit, do a great job as well, both of them displaying an untypical amount of restraint.  As far-fetched as it seems, it is the undertones and quiet moments in this film that render it watchable.  Likewise, those moments are what keep the joke from getting old.  Director Mike Nichols (who gave us such gems as Catch-22 and The Graduate) has combined the quiet soul of his Regarding Henry with the flamboyant ditziness of his The Birdcage to come up with something truly remarkable  a Garry Shandling movie that works.It certainly has its flaws, like most flicks, and many times the plot seems to stop and start just like Harold's malfunctioning member.  However, although the jokes reach levels the man from Nantucket would be proud of, they mostly act as reminders that, no matter how much we poke fun at sex and marriage, most of the jokes are true.
