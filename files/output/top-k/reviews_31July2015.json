I loved it in my first viewing and have continued to love it in subsequent viewings. Why? Well, visually speaking, it was ahead of its time, and by today's standards, its imagery has remained unmatched. A film like this would have never been able to get made today, one in which a studio would put millions of dollars into an R rated film that could turn the audience off due to its perverse visuals. Only Tarsem Singh could have created such beauty and disturbing imagery in a directorial debut. But what about the story, you might ask. Yes, I have to admit the story may be secondary, reminding one of The Silence of the Lambs, but remember, this film did dream heists before Inception did.With all this talk about the film's visual execution, some may say that The Cell is merely style over substance. However, I'd argue the style *is* the substance. The film is like an empty canvas where we can witness Tarsem's crazy and absolutely beautiful imagination. Still 15 years later, the visuals hold up incredibly well, provided without some dated CGI, but those are easily forgiven with the many things the film gets right with visual storytelling. Even scenes that take place outside the dream world are shot meticulously, every frame a painting (thanks Tony Zhou for the phrase). The film's cinematographer, Paul Laufer, should be given some recognition as well, providing some of the film's unconventional camera movements. It's a surprise to learn Laufer hasn't shot a film since The Cell, only working on music videos. Sadly, he's a talent untapped by Hollywood.The soundtrack by Howard Shore nicely complements the look of the film, providing a necessary momentum that slowly builds towards an explosive finale that is emotionally compelling as much as it is visually stunning. Despite the flack she gets, Jennifer Lopez is quite good in the film, who gives her character enough layers to be engaging. A young Vince Vaughn is also very good in his role as the FBI agent with an intriguing past the film doesn't delve too deep into. Lastly, Vincent D'Onofrio is outstanding as the film's complex antagonist, effectively playing the different facets of what could have been a forgettable, two dimensional villain. Overall, The Cell is an incredible film, unforgettable in its visual execution. Although the story is familiar, it is nonetheless involving with good performances from the actors who carry it. One wonders whether the film would work better today due to the vast progress of technology, but for now, The Cell is irreplaceable, with no other films that can rival it.

I am a big fan of the entire franchise, and even though the latest part (Furious 7) currently gets the highest ratings out of all, the 1st is still my favorite. It has a certain charm that all the sequels lack. As a movie on it's own, much has been said before The story is rather shallow, it has plot holes-a-plenty and the dialogue makes you cringe, but if you like fast cars and action, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Nothing new there. But I would like to point out why for me the original The Fast & The Furious is still the highlight of the franchise.First of all, next to being a movie buff, I'm also very much a car guy, and from that point of view I can appreciate The Fast & The Furious' efforts to try and portray genuine car culture. An aspect that for me has really been missing from the later additions in the franchise. Admittedly for the car-tuning community this movie probably did more bad than good, and car enthusiasts love to rip on all the technical mistakes in this movie, but compared to the later F&F movies, this one actually does quite alright. For example, when Dom (Vin Diesel) shifts his car (a Mazda RX7) into gear at the start of the first race we get to see an elaborate CGI sequence that takes us through the entire drive train of the car. It's a fancy gimmick at first, but re-watching this sequence some time ago I noticed that the engine of the car didn't have pistons. Instead it has rotors. The filmmakers actually took the time to research the fact that RX7's are powered by rotary engines rather than your standard piston engine. We don't see this kind of attention to detail in the later movies and for all it's technical mistakes the 1st Fast & Furious also gets it right in many places.But even apart from these technicalities, The Fast & The Furious has got more redeeming qualities. I find that the original Fast & Furious has the most believable characters compared to the other installments in the franchise. Here we have a group of high-school drop-outs, who grew up together doing their car-thing. They're clearly a close-knit group of friends (a family) kept together by Vin Diesel's leader\/father figure. In this context Diesel's character and the entire I got family thing makes sense. This isn't so much the case in the later movies (especially 5, 6 and 7), where Dominic becomes this stuck-in-the-past guy going on and on about his so called family who are actually just a group of loosely associated characters that come together on occasion and then go their separate ways again. Don't get me wrong, the all-star ensemble is fun in the action-blockbuster franchise F&F has become now, but below the surface the original still provides most of the drive behind the characters 6 movies later.In a similar way The Fast & The Furious has the best bad guys from the series as well. I always found Johnny Tran and his gang much more intriguing than any of the other bad boys in the sequels. In every other F&F film the crew rises up against some mafia figure (Verone, Braga, Reyes, etc.) who is evil for the sake of being evil, and who's ultimate downfall is always underestimating this crew of street racers because, you know, they're just street racers, right? It gets rather formulaic. Johnny Tran on the other hand isn't this ultimate bad guy. In fact his actions are rather well motivated. He's not even looking for trouble, like he says You stay away, I stay away. Everybody stays happy. But then this Torreto guy shows up in his turf again, some guy steals his engines, his whole family gets raided by the police, and to top it off he wins a pink slip fair and square, but the guy drives off. So he's righteously angry and retaliates. Johnny Tran has a reason to be the bad guy, unlike those in later installments.Further more the dialogue is actually one thing that I like about this movie. For better or worse, this movie has become one of the most quoted movies among my friends and family. Like many have pointed out before, the dialogue (especially the tech-talk) isn't the best written, but unintentionally this also adds to the believability of the characters. Go to any car meeting and you're bound to hear guys talking like they know all about cars and engines, while in fact they don't. Just like Dom's infamous victory speech. A lot about this movie is all show and no go, but that's also very much the tuning scene it tries to portray, in such a way that by now this movie often feels like a time-document, an homage almost, to the ridiculous car-mod culture in those days.Lastly I think The Fast & The Furious deserves a an extra credit for the original score by Brian Transeau (BT). He perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with his scoring, particularly taking influence from his groundbreaking debut album Ima. The later films lack this quality especially whenever Ludacris is involved and the entire soundtrack is full of cheesy pop-rap\/club music that really doesn't fit the style of the movies at all.So there you have it, 8\/10 for the original Fast & Furious film. Well deserved and still the best of the bunch!

Actually, its not a very old genre. You never saw John Wayne hockeying on ice, nor James Dean. Rob Lowe is actually pretty good, and the film is made with the absolute maximum amount of seriousness available, which seems to be a lot. Everyone seems to be into Ice Hockey, its just that also assume their audience is too. There's not a single bit of effort put into making us like or appreciate the sport. Its more played as a human drama, with the sport and its coaches providing tension for the protagonist. Its like the real bad guy is the sport itself. Its pretty funny. I know I said Rob Lowe was pretty good, but the other funny thing about this movie is when Rob Lowe is called upon to act tough.

Tatum, once a big-city journalist in New York, now has been stuck in Albuquerque, New Mexico for over a year, his sole resolution is to seize a sensational story as the springboard to get his old job back, or it turns out, he can also create one, he is astute enough to sense the opportunity and unscrupulous enough to capitalise on it even if it is a man's life at stake. Flaunting with his smart-ass elitism, Tatum is bluntly unlikeable from the start to the mid-stream where he and Gus, who appears to be a more stereotyped scum, exploit and intervene the rescue schedule to serve their personal interest, this is not pure evil, it is human frailty, which is so common and widely rooted in every corner of the world, that is why such deeds can be rudimentarily harmful to our society and the movie should be enshrined for its boldness alone which can cultivate generations of audience about the integrity of a reporter and more far-reachingly vital, advice us, billions of onlookers, how to take a lucid stand when facing sensationalism on a daily basis.

How can we be wise enough to discern it and outsmart it? In a perfect world, the movie should be introduced in every high school classroom. Kirk Douglas, who is still with us today and one-year short of his centenary, the oldest living star from the Golden Era, is utterly fitting in this role, harsh, masculine, misogynous, only belatedly let his remorse and desperation surface when the comeuppance cannot be redeemed. Also, Jan Sterling stuns in a top-notch performance as Lorraine Minosa, the wife of the trapped man Leo (Benedict), who takes the accident not just as a windfall to earn some quick-money, but as a getaway from her dead-end marriage and the bleak land.

It is high time to justify this film's classic esteem since ACE IN THE HOLE was a critical failure in Wilder's output when it came out, it was even renamed as THE BIG CARNIVAL out of despair to lure audience into a revealing cautionary tale, while unfortunately, it was too realistic to those who are looking for escapism in the theatre, critics are strident too, maybe the fiasco did alter Wilder's orbit, since then, his works, as masterful as they are, are ultimately less pertinent and trenchant to social realism, and a comedic overtone would supersede the bleakness, that's another reason why this film is so exceptional and still relevant till this day.

But is he really? Because behind this mask of success there are real demons, skeletons in the closet and heads in the freezer.To some adepts of Stanley Kubrick, even comparing their beloved masterpiece to anything else would be a sacrilege. But those films are indeed strangely similar. Even though the former bathes in a cosmopolitan decadence and preaches about a conflict between a citizen and a state, while the latter is more about an American mission of the world's guardian and a conflict between a person and a society. But both of these films choose a very peculiar means of delivering their messages - a sheer and unobscured violence, gore and sexual narcissism.To be honest, A Clockwork Orange didn't work for me. Partly because it lost most of its shocking charge over the decades, and the scenes that must've been extra provocative in the 70's are now nothing too special. But it's not just that.

The film is one of those one's you can imagine watching on a Sunday afternoon, and this can be enjoyed too but maybe it just isn't so clinical.The comedy side of the movie is really kind of non existent, it tries it really does but by the end your kind of feeling disappointed. The story I'll give it is not boring, it has it's moments where you actually are maybe rooting for Richie and his fellow friends and butler(Jonathan Hyde), but in truth it's hard to like Culkin. Our main star in this is just too unbelievable and wastes any talent he has by being a dull main character, top that also with a poor script and you have Macaulay Culkin acting and sounding like some kind of badly built robot actor. Donald Petrie directs and he is pretty average really, doesn't do enough to make the story or actors better but also the general direction Is just well, not done well enough really. Now I'm not the biggest fan of these kind of comedies, in fact most I watch I don't expect much in terms of laughter, and here is another example.

And on that point the end, actually not too bad but followed up just too poor a beginning and middle, Culkin also seems to get better but when he is sad, he just can't act at all!. Now don't watch this and expect to hate it, some could definitely enjoy it, some will hate, but always remember if this movie made you laugh because this movie labels itself as a comedy.And what about the other cast?, well not everyone is necessarily bad, Jonathan Hyde as the butler is pretty good and when he features the film can be a slight bit more interesting. John Larroquette as the scheming Van Dough is also not that bad, should have played into the jokes a bit more and maybe even have been a bit more in to what he is actually doing, kind of looks bored in this movie really.So overall a movie I found to be well, just not good really, it isn't awful just not acceptable, the kind of movie only a few will like but at least there isn't only one person who likes it.

He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake.

I mean this movie was ruined not only by the white bashing but it was the talentless Chris rock! This guy drives me crazy and every time I see him, I'd like to punch the TV. I just have to ask why must a racist African American even be brought up? This movie was fine without him and besides he serves no comedic purpose except to make the viewer wish he was killed during the end fight scene. Now I don't expect you to agree with me about whether Chris rock is funny or not I just wish people would understand that race bashing should be outlawed. Come on whites get called racists because of this how come black people could get away with this?! Anyway the movie was very good it had a very good cast, with the exception of Chris rock.

It has a talented cast ,with Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, E. Emmet Walsh, Joe Mantegna, Faye Dunaway and William Fichtner. The film asks the dramatic question Would you kill an innocent person to save your life? It's an intriguing question that deserves a much better screenplay. It also deserves a much better answer than offered by the filmmakers. The screenplay is a mess. What should be a character-driven story seems largely driven by unlikely coincidences.Much of the action occurs off screen. A burglar alarm is tripped, a character commits suicide and a character commits murder &#x96; all off screen. These are three points that alter the course of the plot, but the audience doesn't quite know why they happened. The burglars seem to have tripped the alarm trying to gain access. If so, the police wouldn't be able to charge them with much, unless they have prior warrants. They could have simply split up and walked away in separate directions. They might have dropped their weapons and lock picks down a sewer grating. Instead, they call attention to themselves by speeding away in a stolen car. The character motivations are unclear. An international criminal arranges a meeting at closing time in a basement bar with no back exit. The person he is supposed to meet never shows. A possible exit has been covered over with cinder blocks. Unless the cores are filled with concrete and steel bars (which is uncommon), cinder blocks are fairly easy to break with a sledgehammer, claw hammer or anything reasonably hard. With enough shells, they could break through with the shotgun. But they don't even try. The police procedures make no sense at all. The plan for escape made sense in the Bill Murray comedy Quick Change, but not in a serious drama, although the trope worked reasonably well in 16 Blocks. The least sensible and least satisfying part is the answer to the dramatic question. One character commits suicide, presumably because he's been betrayed and he refuses to kill innocent people. One person is a sociopath, so doesn't face a moral dilemma. One character is given a revolver and given a choice between killing an innocent victim and going free, or dying. But one would think holding a loaded weapon would offer a third option. This is the climatic moment, but it occurs off screen. The characters who choose to kill an innocent person do survive, while those who do not die. Buried was produced four years later with a much smaller budget of $3MM. It was gritty, compelling and effective. AA is not nearly as effective. The difference is primarily due to the caliber of the scripts. The film looks more like a stage play than a feature film. Most of the exterior shots could be eliminated without severely damaging the story. Since the exteriors really show the budgetary limitations, the film might actually have been improved. The movie has a good cast. It's not sufficiently compelling to engage the audience, but neither is it sufficiently egregious to completely alienate.

Those who find this movie weird, I guess the reason is because it's dated or your not a hardcore John Carpenter fan. I really like EFNY, to this day, yes it's dated; but that's because it came out in 1981 and who knew what 1997 would hold. If the dates 1988 and 1997 were not included, younger viewers; and others might enjoy it more. To me it's a cult classic, up there with the original Star Wars trilogy, JAWS, and E.T.. The story begins with Snake Plisskin being taken into custody to the Manhattan Maximum Security Prison. In 1997 since to crime rate grew to 400 % all of Manhattan Island is a Maximum Security Prison for the U.S.. Plisskin is an ex-special forces officer, who was convicted of a bank robbery. His character Snake is the ultimate bas A##. Once in you do not come out, the head of the prison is Hauk( Lee Van Cleef). Hauk discovers that Air Force 1 has been hi-jacked and Hauk needs help finding the President inside NYC.. Hauk calls in Snake Plisskin( Kurt Russel), after hearing the distress signal. Hauk gives Snake an offer, to go in and retrieve the President( Donald Pleasance). If he is successful he will receive a full pardon; but Hauk has a catch. When Snake gets ready to leave Hauk fits him with a tracker, and puts two capsules into his system. Plisskin has 22 hours to complete his mission; and there is no way for him to escape. In 1997 NYC looks like a demilitarized zone. Snake has to move swiftly, and carefully due to the crazies that live outside. These are people who have become lost and now work for the Duke of New York(Isaac Hays). Once Snake is in he gets help from Cabbie(Ernest Borgnine), Brain( Harry Dean Stanton, and Maggie( Adrienne Barbeau). To save the President he will need there help, and he will have tough trials while he faces The Duke of New York and his minions. He has 22 hours to complete the mission, and bring the President back safely.The reason why I liked this movie is it's futuristic approach, and when you see it for the first time at age 8 in 81, it stays with you forever. This film is action packed and Snake Plisskin is the true anti-hero you cheer on from beginning to end. I also liked the excellent cast they all meshed well, and some have worked with Carpenter before. The movie unites old school actors with new school, a great cast indeed. As I watched the movie I put myself in the shoes of Plisskin. A total thrill ride from the beginning to the end for the viewer.I love John Carpenter films and even though this is more sci-fi than horror, it has style. Watching this movie and looking at some of the parts makes me wonder what the future has in store for us. Meaning if our crime rate where to ever hit that high would we be prepared, would our big cities fall apart; and would humanity live like savages. It makes me wonder, maybe you too? BTW a remake of Escape From New York is in development as of 2014\/2015. If it is green lighted I can't wait to see what it holds. I'm sure the time line will be spaced father apart; like 30 years into the future, story line might be the same with some differences.

It is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"}]
