[{"date":"2 June 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" After Roland Emmerich's Universal Soldier (1992), the series was capitalized on its success by producing sequels to it that were released on TV. However, these sequels as they were called, were received poorly due to fans' lack of interest and a far less entertaining cast. Then 1999 rolled around and Universal Soldier fans were surprised to see this come to their TV informing them trailer style that Van Damme was returning. It's curious to say what the title to this actual sequel just meant the return of. Was it the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux? Or was it that the plot to this installment revolved around Deveraux returning to a similar station where Unisols were created just like him? Maybe it wasn't even that deep. Perhaps the producers just meant it was the return from the TV productions back into actual theatrically released movies. No one will know and probably not many will care either because this installment barely qualifies as a sequel.The reason why it is difficult for this movie to be called a sequel to the 1992 original is because of how flimsy the writing connects to its predecessor. After the 1992 film, there wasn't anybody left working on the Unisol project. Everyone except Deveraux had died because of how badly the project turned out to be. Yet, here we are (with no perception of how much time has passed between both films), Deveraux is now one of the leads of operation at a new Unisol factory. Apparently he acquired his humanity back from two meaningless scientists that have very little importance later on in the film. During a regular day, the main computer system (S.E.T.H. - voiced by Michael Jai White) becomes self-aware and decides that it's time he takes control. So who exactly approved the Unisol program? Plus, all the scientists were dead. Who knew how to regenerate more dead soldiers? It was a tiny select group of people.But this is the least of the problems. First of all, why is Deveraux assisting in the creation of more Unisols? What's his motivation behind this? What possible benefit could he have from this if he knows exactly what could go wrong? It doesn't make any sense. There's even a scene where Deveraux has a flashback to his death and the kind of treatment he was given when he was a Unisol. This almost hints at that Deveraux isn't passed his own stress, but it's never visited again. Deveraux even has a daughter named Hillary who he named after his wife of the same name - wait what? In the 1992 movie, the nosey news reporter was named Veronica and most fans can safely agree that it looked like the future couple was going to be Deveraux and Veronica. Where did this Hillary girl come in? Even more insulting is how obvious and obligatory it becomes when Deveraux comes in contact with another thickheaded female reporter, guess where that goes.These issues alone amount to a very confusing, poorly written main character that feels like a totally different person. Forget trying to even understand anyone else that's brought in because his or her development is given far less attention. The villain played by Michael Jai White brings up multiple questions as well. Just because a computer system becomes self-aware does not mean it all of sudden knows how to perform martial arts. S.E.T.H.'s motivations are also unexplained besides him wanting to rid the world of chaos. I assume this was apart of the fad for 1999 - making all computers self aware and ready to massacre mankind. Then there's Bill Goldberg as the skull-smashing wrestler turned Unisol. The only thing audiences will know about him is that he hates Deveraux. Why - no will know because it's never explained. What's the point of creating a personality if there's nothing to back it up? I enjoyed him more as the silent type in Looney Tunes Back in Action (2003).William Malone and John Fasano are the writers behind this. Fasano was probably the man behind all the parts to the film that tried to recollect on what made the original as good as it could be. For all that, it seems like Malone's parts were favored more, which is what made this story so inconsistent. Malone is also the director behind the illogical Creature (1985) film. Just horrendously bad. What's even stranger is that these two writers tried to incorporate comedic lines that are as subtle as the ones of the first. For example, going back to Goldberg, he would be flattened by something and say I hate that guy in a cartoony way. What made the first movie funny at times was that of how deadpan it was delivered. Here, it just sounds silly.Mic Rodgers whose real profession is in stunt coordination directed the film. It's also very obvious because this movie contains a lot of action scenes involving stunts so it fits that this would be what he focuses on most. However, this doesn't fix anything. The action is generic and again, cartoonish at times. It's mindless action - nothing complex. Surprisingly for 1999, there aren't many special effects either. Cinematography isn't great either because very little of this movie takes places outside a building, and if it is, it's in the dark. Lastly, Don Davis' score has some quality to it but again, it's nothing that's really memorable considering several times hardcore metal is put in from time to time. Metal is fine but it has to be used in the right manner. This wasn't it and Davis isn't a newbie at composing. He scored the Matrix trilogy!It's practically nothing like the 1992 original. For a title that supposed to signify the return of greatness - the return is far less than even minimally acceptable. Continuing stories do not contain writing like this.

Tony Curtis is great as Lesile whom is so perfect it's nauseating, he's pretty much a parody on our amount of expectations on what we want our protagonists to be which is to be all so perfect. Lesile is that in spades all so perfect, yet all so dull, simply because this protagonist has that fundamental problem of having a lifestyle but no real life.Natalie Wood is great and hot as Maggie Dubois whom is almost a Lois Lane like reporter that is just so determined by all means to get her point across. And I just love how high she is on her feminist beliefs, which makes her all the more funny because of the double standard to some of them which she is consciously not entirely aware of. It's funny how she delivers grief or unintentional grief toward both sides of the spectrum. Though the only bad thing in the film for me, would be who she falls for in the end, I kind which it was Professor Fate she fell for since he's more interesting and would of made more sense. But then again that might have deterred the villain quality for Fate unless she converted to being a villain, so I can't complain too much about that.But of course the main attraction is Professor Fate played brilliantly by Jack Lemon. This character is my favorite role from him, he's literally a live action cartoon villain. He looks like Snide Whiplash from the cartoon Duddley Do Right with that mustache and wardrobe. he was also a partial inspiration to villain Dr. Horrible in the web mini series Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog.He's character is pretty much a blowhole but a fun one that just simply wants to beat or kill Lesile by any means necessary. It's just funny how much he just puts it out there, not even bothering to keep himself undercover even though logically that is what villains should do, at the rate of exposure it's surprising that he's hasn't been arrested yet.I even like his back and forth with his flunky played by one of my favorite actors Peter Falk and yes for the record I'm a Columbo fan; his character himself is hilarious because of how dumb he really is, but a little touching because of how loyal he is to Fate and is probably the Fate's only friend.It's just funny how many tricks he's trying to pull to sabotage and beat Lesile in the race almost more than those power ups you'd get in the Mario Kart video games.

It's sort of like with us where some of us have to work hard or exercise a painful amount of patience to get what we want, while there are some in a higher class that have things handed to them and not always appreciated it.

Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. Shawshank slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really, he tells Red. Get busy living' or get busy dying'. The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.There wasn't much going for it It had a terrible title, it was a prison drama and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value Shawshank so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal.

SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS! Based off the original trilogy (or more books?) Mary Poppins was about a magical no nonsense nanny who looks after the Banks' children and they encounter all sorts of adventures in the simplest places like parks, shopping, and visiting relatives. I've been reading the books and I'll admit I wish I could have seen Disney do more like the zoo at night, a traveling compass, and so on, but for what we got it was terrific. True that Mary Poppins, herself, has been disneyfied, but the directors don't leave out the fact that she's a grumpy character who for some reason is into magic, but later denies it ever happened. Aside from Emma Thompson (who probably wasn't available at the time - but played a different Mary Poppins) I can't think of anyone better to play the role other than Julie Andrews. She was excellent. I love Bert (even if he can't pull off a good British accent). Next to Mary Poppins, he is so charming and imaginative. I still love his one man band, and any of the song and dance numbers he's in. The kids are great, the father - oh I love him! Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, I'M GONNA DIE! Nobody could play a better flying, laughing guy than him! Oh and that laughter is CONTAGIOUS! If I go through the whole cast it will be too much, so in short, the cast was perfect! Don't ask me what my favorite scene is because it's too hard to choose! Almost every scene is my favorite! I love the kids with Mary Poppins, getting to know the family, the bank, chimney sweepers, and the kite scene. Every moment of the film had me wishing I was there, it even made cleaning up my room look fun (too bad snapping fingers won't help)! The songs? If you mention one verse from any of the songs to someone else then don't be surprised if they start singing the whole song out loud! They're hilarious, they're catchy, they're sweet, they're nostalgic, they're touching, they're upbeat, they're sincere, they're adorable, and so on! It keeps the balance of having cheerful moments but also having tender realistic moments. In fact Walt Disney's favorite song was Feed the Birds, because it talked about showing your care for other people. So as you can see it has a mixed message, but it keeps it in a perfect balance it lets kids be kids, while at the same time teaching everyone young and old to not take life for granted. For example, there's a scene when Mr. Banks refuses to give tuppence to an old lady to feed birds, but scenes later when he decides to, she's gone. Not sure if that's suppose to indicate that she died or just left, but it shows that when you find a chance to show kindness you should take that chance because you may not have another chance. Yes the film didn't quite follow the expectations of the book, but in this case I say that it was almost captured the heart of the story even if there were added songs, scenes, and characters, but hey at least there are no forced morals or added villains. It's actually nice to see a movie without villains. Overall it's a great adaptations and one of few (or many) that stayed true to the heart of the story. It was practically perfect in every way.

","genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"2 June 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" My personal favorite of the classic Universal horror films. I saw this for the first time at age 14 and was hooked on classic monster movies from that point on. The story, for those of you living under a rock, is about a scientist named Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) obsessed with unlocking the secrets of life. To this end, he pieces together a body out of parts taken from corpses. He then harnesses the power of lightning to bring this creature (Boris Karloff) to life.Boris Karloff's monster and Colin Clive's Frankenstein are the versions by which all others are measured. Career-defining roles for both actors and they can't be praised enough, in my mind. This movie, along with Dracula, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Frankenstein's monster for decades to come. I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film did more for Frankenstein's popularity than the source material ever did. This is certainly a very different story than the one Mary Shelley crafted, which was more philosophical in nature. In recent decades there have been attempts to produce versions of the story more faithful to Shelley but, so far, they have not been particularly successful endeavors. I have to wonder if that's not because decades of Karloff and Karloff-inspired monsters have left audiences not only expecting this version of the story, but preferring it.In addition to Karloff and Clive, the excellent cast includes Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, who were both in Dracula. Frederick Kerr provides most of the film's humor as Baron Frankenstein. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancée Elizabeth. She would be replaced in Bride of Frankenstein. Boring John Boles is the film's only weak link, playing the guy trying to break up Henry and Elizabeth so he can have her to himself. This was probably a part of the plot insisted upon by the studio for demographic reasons. It adds nothing to the film and Boles' character is dropped completely from the sequel. The tired triangle plot would be reused by Universal later in Werewolf of London with nauseating results. Striking direction by James Whale, who crafts great scene after great scene.

I saw this for the first time at age 14 and was hooked on classic monster movies from that point on. The story, for those of you living under a rock, is about a scientist named Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) obsessed with unlocking the secrets of life. To this end, he pieces together a body out of parts taken from corpses. He then harnesses the power of lightning to bring this creature (Boris Karloff) to life.Boris Karloff's monster and Colin Clive's Frankenstein are the versions by which all others are measured. Career-defining roles for both actors and they can't be praised enough, in my mind. This movie, along with Dracula, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Frankenstein's monster for decades to come. I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film did more for Frankenstein's popularity than the source material ever did. This is certainly a very different story than the one Mary Shelley crafted, which was more philosophical in nature. In recent decades there have been attempts to produce versions of the story more faithful to Shelley but, so far, they have not been particularly successful endeavors. I have to wonder if that's not because decades of Karloff and Karloff-inspired monsters have left audiences not only expecting this version of the story, but preferring it.In addition to Karloff and Clive, the excellent cast includes Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, who were both in Dracula. Frederick Kerr provides most of the film's humor as Baron Frankenstein. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancée Elizabeth. She would be replaced in Bride of Frankenstein. Boring John Boles is the film's only weak link, playing the guy trying to break up Henry and Elizabeth so he can have her to himself. This was probably a part of the plot insisted upon by the studio for demographic reasons. It adds nothing to the film and Boles' character is dropped completely from the sequel. The tired triangle plot would be reused by Universal later in Werewolf of London with nauseating results. Striking direction by James Whale, who crafts great scene after great scene.

They turned to Roland Emmerich, the man responsible for turning old B movie genres (alien invasion, otherworldly adventures and genetically enhanced soldiers) into big blockbuster hits. Hoping that he would do the same for the giant monster movie. To that end, Hollywood gave him Godzilla, the much beloved Japanese giant monster, to remake to his vision.Americanized, neutered and changed beyond recognition, GODZILLA came out as a decent monster movie, but a disappointing Godzilla movie. That issue lies in the portrayal of the titular Titan. Gone is the thought provoking nuclear disaster allegory, replaced by a feeble man is the real monster Aesop. Nuclear tests in the 1960s gave rise to a giant mutant bisexual lizard. This creature makes a beeline for Manhattan where his arrival is met with mass hysteria and chaos. Named Godzilla by the media (thanks to a misinterpreted comment from a dying Japanese sailor), America sends wave after wave of military hardware against the beast, causing more destruction than ever but failing to bring it down. Into this chaos comes dr Nick Tatopolus, an expert on radiation mutations. As the military tracks the monster through new york's concrete jungle, nick discovers that the creature may not be the only one of its kind for much longer. The hunt is on with French secret agents, a budding romance with a wannabe reporter and a parody of some well known movie critics all thrown in. The first thing that stood out for me in this movie was how enjoyable the scenes with the human characters were. Like INDEPENDENCE DAY, Roland Emmerich peppers this movie with a healthy dose of humor. This makes the one dimensional characters less of a pain to sit through. Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Henry Shearer, all renown comedians, shine in their respective roles, delivering appropriate drama and laughs. Even Jean Reno does well as the offensively stereotyped French agent Philippe. Their scenes are fun, making an overall cliché ridden story more enjoyable than it is. Only the lead characters turn out a tad flat. Dr Nick, played by baby faced Matthew Broderick, brings his best wide eyed expressions to play as a man child caught up in the wonder of this giant beast yet running for his very life so he does not become dinner. Wide eyed shock, wide eyed awe, wide eyed terror, that seems to be his only expression. And the redundancy of Maria Pitillo's character Audrey cannot be understated.Of course, the true star of any Godzilla movie is Godzilla himself. This leaner, faster, velociraptor inspired look by designer Patrick Tatopolus is a terrific looking beast brought to life by cutting edge special effects. For a 1998 production, the effects still hold up well till today. The creature is elegant yet menacing, grand yet grim, with twin rows of fierce spikes on it's back, unbelievable agility and that trademark big chin that is common in Patrick Tatopolus' designs (eg underworld's Lycans, pitch black's creatures, outlander's moorwen). However, it just isn't Godzilla, the unstoppable force of nature. It shows none of Godzilla's powers, nor his intelligence, nor his durability. Where the original Godzilla would be unfazed by missiles, smash tanks and planes out of his way, and carry on, this remade Godzilla squeals, runs and hides! Perhaps it would not have gotten that much hate had it been billed as a remake of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, rather than a Godzilla movie. The basic plot of a lost giant creature drawn to New York and ultimately taken down by sheer luck and superior military firepower already mimics the broad strokes of that stop motion classic. Godzilla can easily pass off as a redesigned Rhedrosaur. But alas, here it is billed as a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, Roland Emmerich's multi million dollar blockbuster would rank in the lower thirds. Better than the likes of GODZILLA VS MEGALON, GODZILLA's REVENGE, GODZILLA FINAL WAR and GIGANTIS THE FIRE MONSTER. But compared to the rest of the Heisei era Godzilla movies, the early millennium era, and especially the original 1954 classic, this American remake is a disappointment. So disappointing in fact that the titular Titan of a lizard has been officially renamed Zilla by the original creators of the Godzilla franchise.

Responsibility for communist crimes is ascribed an ideological source. But when one draws attention to the millions who died as a result from capitalist globalisation, from the tragedy of Mexico in the 16th century through to the Belgian Congo holocaust, responsibility is largely denied. All this seems just to have happened as the result of an 'objective' process, which nobody planned, and for which there was no 'Capitalist Manifesto'. - Zizek Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. - Marx Warren Beatty stars in, produces and directs Reds, a 1981 epic about the life and career of journalist and activist John Reed. Diane Keaton co-stars as Louise Bryant, a feminist, activist and Reed's lover.Odd for a Hollywood production, let alone one released at the dawn of Reaganism, Reds both deals with the Russian Revolution and is sympathetic toward communism. Much of the film thus watches as Reed mingles with unionists, communists and documents the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the subject of his 1919 book, Ten Days That Shook The World.One of the most ballsy moments in human history, the October Revolution essentially saw different Marxist factions allying to usurp monarchy, feudalism and nascent capitalism. After their victory, Russia found itself surrounded, invaded and then essentially sequestered for the next 70 years. Utopian dreams would collapse and she quickly become a curious hybrid an Imperialist nation like the then-contemporary Western Empires (though much less violent, by dint of much smaller colonial holdings), a giant socialist state (bringing genuine improvements to the lives of millions), a state capitalist command economy (and so antithetical to Marxism) and a brutal dictatorial regime (which would incrementally dissolve after the death of Joseph Stalin).A similar movement happened in the 1780s, when the disparate forces of the French Revolution, influenced by thinkers like John Locke and Jean Rousseau, toppled monarchies, late-feudalism and cooked up many of what we now term democratic principles and civil rights. They also enacted numerous radical policies (abolishing feudal dues owed to churches and landlords, nationalising land, creating constitutions etc) which we today take for granted, as well as popularising new political terminology (and even slang; the communist term of endearment, comrade, comes from the French Revolution). Like the Russian Revolution, these victories were won through much violence, before their gains were set back by reactionary forces. Marx would call this Bonapartism, a term he used to refer to any situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and then use selective reformism to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. The term was used by Leon Trotsky to refer to Stalin's regime.From the perspective of the lower classes, the French Revolution was ultimately lost, but it instigated countless positive changes across Europe. On the flip-side, it also forced the ruling class to morph, adapt and develop new means of control. The Russian Revolution (and German Revolution of 1918) was likewise lost, communism crushed across Europe and left-wing parties or labour movements murdered in the millions across most of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and even at home in America. Still, out of these ashes, and the ashes of crushed labour groups, came minor positive changes women's and minority rights, the shortening of work days, the end of the old Empires, the rise of nationalist\/independent movements etc. On the flip-side, the ruling class once again morphed and adapted.So Reds charts broad movements which are as old as time itself. Each human epoch tends to find humanity constructing giant energy accumulation systems (feudalism, chattel slavery, theocracy, monarchy, capitalism etc) in which social hierarchies are set up and in which man exploits man. Those with power tend to win these class conflicts, with, arguably, minor benefits coming at the end of each cycle of conflict.Most of Reds deals with a rocky romantic relationship between Reed and Bryant. He's dedicated to his social activism and ignores her, she's seeking some semblance of independence but wants to be noticed. By the film's end, both have learnt to simultaneously pursue their own dreams whilst also giving to others. Their relationship symbolises the film's overall message, a message which Reed explicitly lays out toward the end of the film. You don't think a man can be an individual and be true to the collective! Reed yells, You don't think a man can speak for his own country and speak for the International at the same time, or love his wife and still be faithful to the revolution! You separate a man from what he loves most, and what you do is purge what's unique in him! And when you purge what's unique in him, you purge dissent. And when you purge dissent, you kill the revolution! Dissent IS revolution! In other words, Reds condemns the neurotic control society which the USSR became, but nevertheless advocates a kind of hybrid of collectivism and independence, which of course was the the theoretical intention of 19th century communism anyway.Though interesting, Reds is slow, overlong and at times too conventional. The film also missteps by ignoring the brutal conditions of American workers, the Russian peasantry and so forth (even contemporary capitalism has 76 percent of Western workers living paycheck to paycheck, 1.3 billion globally in extreme poverty, 850 million in starvation, and roughly 80 percent of the world living on less than ten dollars a day), which has the unintended effect of painting Beatty's band of agitators and rabble rousers as hermetically sealed academics and intellectuals without a Cause. Jack Nicholson steals the show as Eugene O'Neal, an Irish-American playwright.7.5\/10 &#x96; See The Spy Who Came In From the Cold.

Like the Russian Revolution, these victories were won through much violence, before their gains were set back by reactionary forces. Marx would call this Bonapartism, a term he used to refer to any situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and then use selective reformism to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. The term was used by Leon Trotsky to refer to Stalin's regime.From the perspective of the lower classes, the French Revolution was ultimately lost, but it instigated countless positive changes across Europe. On the flip-side, it also forced the ruling class to morph, adapt and develop new means of control. The Russian Revolution (and German Revolution of 1918) was likewise lost, communism crushed across Europe and left-wing parties or labour movements murdered in the millions across most of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and even at home in America. Still, out of these ashes, and the ashes of crushed labour groups, came minor positive changes women's and minority rights, the shortening of work days, the end of the old Empires, the rise of nationalist\/independent movements etc. On the flip-side, the ruling class once again morphed and adapted.So Reds charts broad movements which are as old as time itself. Each human epoch tends to find humanity constructing giant energy accumulation systems (feudalism, chattel slavery, theocracy, monarchy, capitalism etc) in which social hierarchies are set up and in which man exploits man. Those with power tend to win these class conflicts, with, arguably, minor benefits coming at the end of each cycle of conflict.Most of Reds deals with a rocky romantic relationship between Reed and Bryant. He's dedicated to his social activism and ignores her, she's seeking some semblance of independence but wants to be noticed. By the film's end, both have learnt to simultaneously pursue their own dreams whilst also giving to others. Their relationship symbolises the film's overall message, a message which Reed explicitly lays out toward the end of the film. You don't think a man can be an individual and be true to the collective! Reed yells, You don't think a man can speak for his own country and speak for the International at the same time, or love his wife and still be faithful to the revolution! You separate a man from what he loves most, and what you do is purge what's unique in him! And when you purge what's unique in him, you purge dissent. And when you purge dissent, you kill the revolution! Dissent IS revolution! In other words, Reds condemns the neurotic control society which the USSR became, but nevertheless advocates a kind of hybrid of collectivism and independence, which of course was the the theoretical intention of 19th century communism anyway.Though interesting, Reds is slow, overlong and at times too conventional. The film also missteps by ignoring the brutal conditions of American workers, the Russian peasantry and so forth (even contemporary capitalism has 76 percent of Western workers living paycheck to paycheck, 1.3 billion globally in extreme poverty, 850 million in starvation, and roughly 80 percent of the world living on less than ten dollars a day), which has the unintended effect of painting Beatty's band of agitators and rabble rousers as hermetically sealed academics and intellectuals without a Cause. Jack Nicholson steals the show as Eugene O'Neal, an Irish-American playwright.7.5\/10 &#x96; See The Spy Who Came In From the Cold. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"2 June 2014","score":"","review":" Our blindness to the results of systemic violence is perhaps most clearly perceptible in debates about communist crimes. Responsibility for communist crimes is ascribed an ideological source. But when one draws attention to the millions who died as a result from capitalist globalisation, from the tragedy of Mexico in the 16th century through to the Belgian Congo holocaust, responsibility is largely denied. All this seems just to have happened as the result of an 'objective' process, which nobody planned, and for which there was no 'Capitalist Manifesto'. - Zizek Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. - Marx Warren Beatty stars in, produces and directs Reds, a 1981 epic about the life and career of journalist and activist John Reed. Diane Keaton co-stars as Louise Bryant, a feminist, activist and Reed's lover.Odd for a Hollywood production, let alone one released at the dawn of Reaganism, Reds both deals with the Russian Revolution and is sympathetic toward communism. Much of the film thus watches as Reed mingles with unionists, communists and documents the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the subject of his 1919 book, Ten Days That Shook The World.One of the most ballsy moments in human history, the October Revolution essentially saw different Marxist factions allying to usurp monarchy, feudalism and nascent capitalism. After their victory, Russia found itself surrounded, invaded and then essentially sequestered for the next 70 years.

Without a sophisticated movie casts and over-complicated story-line, the selling point is the sequential order the story is presented. Similar to his later masterpiece, memento, Christopher Nolan didn't portrayed the movie in a chronological order, instead it is displayed in a well-planned random manner. Although, the movie may seem to be hard to grasp( it seems to me that is shifts more randomly than memento), Nolan leaves ample puzzles and traces for audience to figure out what is happening after-all. The last 10 minutes of the movie is the essence where bits and pieces in the first 50 minutes build up to the explosion of excitement,events follow one by one , leaving you no time to digest the rich context. The climax is outstanding, especially the twist at the end. Nolan also cleverly uses the conservation between the police officer and the protagonist in the beginning that corresponds with the ending where the young man finally walks out of the mist of truth. This movie probably sets up the definition of a though-provoking movie. The crime scenes are well set up, giving you a sense that you are fooled around throughout the movie despite your effort to figure out what is going on. I see the villain, Cobb, as Nolan who wants to set up the audience to a  thought experience, leaving us spellbound in the cinema.
