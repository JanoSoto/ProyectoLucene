Baby is just about to start college, and Lisa is a little older (although how much isn't specified). Once they arrive at Kellerman's, they are greeted by the owner Max (Jack Weston), and Lisa catches the eye of busboy\/bellhop, Robbie (Max Cantor), a med student working there for the summer. Unfortunately for Baby, she is set up with Max's grandson, Neil (Lonny Price), a student at the Cornell School of Management with a higher opinion of himself than seems warranted. After spending her first evening there as an unwilling magician's assistant, Baby takes a walk to get some much needed solitude. She accidentally wanders down to the staff quarters, and ends up helping Billy (Neal Jones) carry watermelon to a staff party. At the party, she meets the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), to whom she is instantly attracted. Over the next few days, she finds out that Johnny's partner, Penny (Cynthia Rhodes) has gotten pregnant and Robbie is the father. When Baby confronts Robbie, he denies any responsibility for his deed, and shows absolutely no willingness to help out. Baby borrows money from her father to fund Penny's abortion (not telling him what it's for, of course), but when she goes to give it to Penny, she finds out that Penny can only see the doctor on the night that she and Johnny have a big gig at the Sheldrake, another hotel about twenty minutes away. And then Billy comes up with the idea of Baby taking Penny's place. As Baby learns Penny's dance routine, she starts to fall for Johnny. The performance goes well, but Baby and Johnny return to Kellerman's to find that Penny's abortion was not performed by a skilled practitioner, and she is in really bad shape. Baby gets her father to tend to Penny, revealing her dealings with the staff, Johnny in particular, to her father, who is understandably upset, and forbids her to have anything to do with them. Baby, of course, has her own ideas, and goes back to visit Johnny that night, intending to apologize for her father's behavior towards Johnny. She ends up spending the night with Johnny. Delighted as she is over her new romance, Baby still has a big problem - how can she tell her father that she loves the man he has forbidden her from seeing? Worse yet, how can she explain to Johnny her need for secrecy. The delicate balance is upset when an ex-lover (Miranda Garrison) of Johnny's accuses him of stealing a wallet, and only Baby can provide an alibi. Should she speak up and help Johnny? Or stay silent and protect herself? Her choice is her first adult decision. What will she choose? The story is beautifully written, using the resort as a backdrop for showing the disparity between guests and staff, which mimics the class struggle of society itself at the time. Almost all of the major characters grow in some appreciable way by the end of the film. Jake learns that by only observing the appearance of things he can miss the truth behind the appearance. Johnny learns that not all rich people are users, and that there are people who will stand up for him no matter what the personal cost. Baby perhaps learns the most, learning that hard work pays off, that you can find love in the most unexpected places, and that standing up for what - and who - you believe in sometimes requires painful choices, but that doing so is ultimately its own reward. Even Lisa appears to grow. The scene where she comforts Baby and Johnny has been sent away is one of the most touching in the movie. My only real complaints are that Jake's apology to Johnny is a little flat and the ending isn't really that believable, but given the rest of the film, I can forgive both of those things pretty easily.The dancing is phenomenal. Swayze's early training in dance is put to good use in this film. Rhodes and Grey are equally adept on the dance floor. The dance sequence at the end is amazing - especially the long awaited lift.The acting was also excellent. The chemistry among the cast creates believable relationships on the screen. Grey is wonderful as Baby, playing the part to perfection. Swayze does equally well with Johnny. Rhodes plays Penny with a complexity that brings her humanity to the forefront. Orbach's concerned father is good, if a little over the top at times. Brucker does a wonderful job of showing Lisa as a ditz who spends most of her time focusing on herself to the exclusion of others, but manages to make her support for her sister at the end both believable and touching. Weston is good as the stuffy, overbearing Max, and Price's Neil is wonderfully annoying. Jones' Billy is a likable, if not overly bright, young man. Even the bit parts were well done.All in all, a well put together movie that takes you back to the time before America lost its innocence. And a fun one to watch, be it the first time, or the hundred and first.

Something goes wrong during its suspended animation voyage; of the four astronauts aboard, one, a woman, dies; the other three find themselves unable to control descent and having to land in a large lake. Their ship inks; they paddle their escape raft to shore with what gear they can save. Then they must cross a forbidding territory, in their space suits, without knowing what planet they are on, what its races and animal life are, and even where they ought to go. They find ape-skins nailed to X-shaped structures; and without knowing they are scare-humans, they continue on and find a verdant zone with a waterfall, fresh-flowing water and green growths. Forgetting their regrets, for the Earth of their time--only one, the leader Taylor has none since he never liked his time not trusted its leaders not to blow up the planet--they go swimming and hurry back to shore too late to find their clothes; someone or something has stolen them. Continuing on, they find humans, strangely silent, furtively stealing food; they are primitive, rather dirty and obviously frightened specimens. The viewer and the three astronauts soon hat they are watching for; gorilla's dressed in army uniforms riding horses come along, blow strange signal horns and use great nets to capture the food thieves, the astronauts along with them. Taylor tries to fight back but a whip is wrapped around his throat, depriving him of speech and he blacks out. He wakes up in a pen with many others; There he notes Cornelius, a young chimpanzee scientist and his fiancée, Zira, who are kinder to him; but they too regard the humans as an inferior species, under the watchful and hostile eye of their boss Dr. Zaius. Only Zira believes humans are not animals. Taylor tries to write her a message--she calls him Bright Eyes; but Dr. Zaius erases it. She has him brought indoors to a cell and introduces a pretty human girl for company. Finally, Taylor, frustrated and still unable to speak, escapes and leads the camera in a chase through the ape city, until he is finally caught and netted again, and cries, Take your filthy paws off me--you damned dirty ape! He is taken to Dr. Zaius. And he learns the history of the world. Weapons destroyed it, apparently atomic weapons, since there is a Forbidden Zone. Gorillas are soldiers, chimpanzees are scientists and orangutans are the leaders. Taylor finds out one of his men is dead, the other had his brain removed by Dr. Zaius to hide his humanity--he is now an exhibit in the Museum. Once more, Taylor, who is interrogated by a group of leaders and not believed, has to escape. He takes Zaius with him and Cornelius and Zira have to go because they helped him avoid death. They travel into the Forbidden Zone, to a cave where they seek evidence that in the past, man could talk and had a civilization; that they were those who built and destroyed the world's centers, and the apes only came afterward. Learning the truth, Taylor takes Nova, the girl, on horseback with him. They flee the apes and journey along the edge of the ocean. And there he makes a terrible discovery. You finally did it--damn you! he screams, as the camera pans back to reveal the Stature of liberty all-but-buried in the sand of a desolate shore; he and his crew mates have come back to the planet of the apes--and find it is Earth. Franklin Schaeffner directed this remarkable sci-fi work.The script from a thin Pierre Boulle novel was written by Michael Wilson and Serling. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, the ape makeup designed by John Chambers and the costumes by Morton Haack are very-well realized; the art direction by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith with set decorations by Norman Rocket and Walter M. Scott are classically good. Jerry Goldsmith supplied the sensationally eerie music. In the surprisingly small cast are Charlton Heston quite good the acerbic Taylor, Kim Hunter as Zira, Roddy MacDowall as Cornelius, Maurice Evans toweringly fine as Dr. Zaius, and such luminaries as James Whitmore, Woodrow Parfrey, Wright King and James Daly as leaders of the apes. Sci-fi movie makers have seldom been given so much to work with. But all people remember about the film are the ending, the apes and the attempt by Taylor to talk without success for a long while. This is however not just another pseudo-religious anti-individualist rocket takes off and crashes back to Earth movie; It has a luminously-intelligent way of dealing with what ought to be human and what is not. Its writers give the negative human qualities they think are less-than-human to the apes; and introduced a rational man among them--Taylor...And this makes all the difference. The film was given three sequels, and it became a one-season brilliant television show. But as an allegory for the position of the man who thinks for himself in an empire of postmodernist public-dictator and unselfish-obedient minds operating by appearances and prejudices, it has seldom been equaled, never yet surpassed.

The problem I see with it as a writer is that the bravura production has obscured the script's values. People love this movie, for all the wrong reasons. In outline, it is simply another of those starship is sent out by hopeful, mentally-under-civilized humans narrative lines. Something goes wrong during its suspended animation voyage; of the four astronauts aboard, one, a woman, dies; the other three find themselves unable to control descent and having to land in a large lake. Their ship inks; they paddle their escape raft to shore with what gear they can save. Then they must cross a forbidding territory, in their space suits, without knowing what planet they are on, what its races and animal life are, and even where they ought to go. They find ape-skins nailed to X-shaped structures; and without knowing they are scare-humans, they continue on and find a verdant zone with a waterfall, fresh-flowing water and green growths. Forgetting their regrets, for the Earth of their time--only one, the leader Taylor has none since he never liked his time not trusted its leaders not to blow up the planet--they go swimming and hurry back to shore too late to find their clothes; someone or something has stolen them. Continuing on, they find humans, strangely silent, furtively stealing food; they are primitive, rather dirty and obviously frightened specimens. The viewer and the three astronauts soon hat they are watching for; gorilla's dressed in army uniforms riding horses come along, blow strange signal horns and use great nets to capture the food thieves, the astronauts along with them. Taylor tries to fight back but a whip is wrapped around his throat, depriving him of speech and he blacks out. He wakes up in a pen with many others; There he notes Cornelius, a young chimpanzee scientist and his fiancée, Zira, who are kinder to him; but they too regard the humans as an inferior species, under the watchful and hostile eye of their boss Dr. Zaius. Only Zira believes humans are not animals. Taylor tries to write her a message--she calls him Bright Eyes; but Dr. Zaius erases it. She has him brought indoors to a cell and introduces a pretty human girl for company. Finally, Taylor, frustrated and still unable to speak, escapes and leads the camera in a chase through the ape city, until he is finally caught and netted again, and cries, Take your filthy paws off me--you damned dirty ape! He is taken to Dr. Zaius. And he learns the history of the world. Weapons destroyed it, apparently atomic weapons, since there is a Forbidden Zone. Gorillas are soldiers, chimpanzees are scientists and orangutans are the leaders. Taylor finds out one of his men is dead, the other had his brain removed by Dr. Zaius to hide his humanity--he is now an exhibit in the Museum. Once more, Taylor, who is interrogated by a group of leaders and not believed, has to escape. He takes Zaius with him and Cornelius and Zira have to go because they helped him avoid death. They travel into the Forbidden Zone, to a cave where they seek evidence that in the past, man could talk and had a civilization; that they were those who built and destroyed the world's centers, and the apes only came afterward. Learning the truth, Taylor takes Nova, the girl, on horseback with him. They flee the apes and journey along the edge of the ocean. And there he makes a terrible discovery. You finally did it--damn you! he screams, as the camera pans back to reveal the Stature of liberty all-but-buried in the sand of a desolate shore; he and his crew mates have come back to the planet of the apes--and find it is Earth. Franklin Schaeffner directed this remarkable sci-fi work.The script from a thin Pierre Boulle novel was written by Michael Wilson and Serling. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, the ape makeup designed by John Chambers and the costumes by Morton Haack are very-well realized; the art direction by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith with set decorations by Norman Rocket and Walter M.

And yes, I would really like to write that. The problem is that I believe as a critic you should try to give a film as fair a review as you can.In fact, The Man With The Golden Gun starts well for three reasons - all three of these reasons are linked, as the film starts with the three best characters.Firstly we have the Man with the Golden Gun himself, Fransisco Scaramanga. One of this film's undeniable strengths is the presence of Christopher Lee as the main bad guy. This character is truly the dark side of Bond, a man with the same tastes of good food, good drink and damn good women, and someone who must kill for a living. But Lee plays it as an obsessed cold-blooded killer, with no apparent care for his girlfriend. Speaking of which, may I introduce the second good thing about this movie, Maud Adams as Andrea Anders. A sort of updated version of Domino from Thunderball, Adams is beautiful and also a very good actress. We can tell that this is a kept woman, starved of real love and affection. The scene in the bedroom with Scaramanga is suitably chilling, particularly Lee's face when she does not give in to his toying around with his golden gun. It is a pity that she becomes a sacrificial lamb when she does, and does not carry on in the script. The third good thing about this film is Nick-Nack - it's a great contrast to see the very tall Lee up against the petite Herve Villechaize. He has that wonderfully devilish look in his eye whenever he is plotting something, and it is great that the script constantly keeps us guessing as to which side he is really on.After the opening sequence however, it goes downhill very quickly. Moore is good as Bond, but the scene where he interrogates Andrea seems rather cold and Connery-esquire. Moore has a certain style for Bond, as have all the other actors who have portrayed him, and so the script should have stuck with Moore's interpretation.The script is not great, though several elements are intriguing. The relevance of the secondary plot - the Energy crisis - is still strong today, though I don't think the producers had guessed this when making the film. M has a few wonderful put-downs as well, and in fact seems increasingly exasperated by almost everything Bond does in the film.The script turns truly awful with the introduction of Mary Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland. Ekland could have been a very good Bond Girl, but the script takes the original character - the strong, secretary-type woman from the Fleming novels - and completely weakens her. She is, without a doubt, the weakest Bond Girl in the entire series. Her only relevance seemingly that to provide Bond with a woman at the end of his mission. He has other reasons to fly to Scaramanga's island - he has the Solex, though this is thanks to the incompetent Goodnight.The return of JW Pepper is not a welcome one either - why would he want a test drive in a car in Bankock when he lives on the other side of the world? Leutentant Hip is the second most bumbling person next to Goodnight, and even Q is told to shut up by M twice. The script does pick up dramatically well when Bond and Scaramanga meet. The dialogue between them at the dinner table is superb. The duel at the end of the film is also very good, with quite a bit of tense atmosphere; though after watching the pre-titles sequence we know how Bond will eventually get rid of Scaramanga. The music is okay by John Barry standards, and this is rather worrying, considering the rather lacklustre score provided by George Martin in the previous Bond film, Live And Let Die. The opening theme is truly dreadful, the lyrics grating along with their cheep sexual innuendosHe has a powerful weaponThat sort of thing.Perhaps the reason for the poor quality of this film was the fact that the relationship between Albert Cubby Brocolli and Harry Saltzman was disintegrating rapidly - an interesting discussion about 200 or so elephant shoes springs to mind, as well as a planned elephant stampede. Maybe it was Guy Hamilton's fault - he had made two Bond films already, and in my opinion Thunderball, Terrance Young's third Bond film, had been Young's weakest. Maybe it was the original source material - the book is an interesting but short novel, the last full story Flemming ever wrote, and it would not have had enough to fill more than an hour, perhaps an hour and a half at most. They needed something to fill in the gaps as it were.Whatever the reasons, The Man With The Golden Gun is perhaps the very worst of the Moore series. But don't let this stop you from watching it. Every Bond film has it's positives, and this film is no exception - it is perhaps one of the best performances by Christopher Lee since his first Dracula and until the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond 007 and truly one of the worst James Bond movies in the series...is what you would probably expect me to write.

But Lee plays it as an obsessed cold-blooded killer, with no apparent care for his girlfriend. Speaking of which, may I introduce the second good thing about this movie, Maud Adams as Andrea Anders. A sort of updated version of Domino from Thunderball, Adams is beautiful and also a very good actress. We can tell that this is a kept woman, starved of real love and affection. The scene in the bedroom with Scaramanga is suitably chilling, particularly Lee's face when she does not give in to his toying around with his golden gun. It is a pity that she becomes a sacrificial lamb when she does, and does not carry on in the script. The third good thing about this film is Nick-Nack - it's a great contrast to see the very tall Lee up against the petite Herve Villechaize. He has that wonderfully devilish look in his eye whenever he is plotting something, and it is great that the script constantly keeps us guessing as to which side he is really on.After the opening sequence however, it goes downhill very quickly. Moore is good as Bond, but the scene where he interrogates Andrea seems rather cold and Connery-esquire. Moore has a certain style for Bond, as have all the other actors who have portrayed him, and so the script should have stuck with Moore's interpretation.The script is not great, though several elements are intriguing. The relevance of the secondary plot - the Energy crisis - is still strong today, though I don't think the producers had guessed this when making the film. M has a few wonderful put-downs as well, and in fact seems increasingly exasperated by almost everything Bond does in the film.The script turns truly awful with the introduction of Mary Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland. Ekland could have been a very good Bond Girl, but the script takes the original character - the strong, secretary-type woman from the Fleming novels - and completely weakens her. She is, without a doubt, the weakest Bond Girl in the entire series. Her only relevance seemingly that to provide Bond with a woman at the end of his mission. He has other reasons to fly to Scaramanga's island - he has the Solex, though this is thanks to the incompetent Goodnight.The return of JW Pepper is not a welcome one either - why would he want a test drive in a car in Bankock when he lives on the other side of the world? Leutentant Hip is the second most bumbling person next to Goodnight, and even Q is told to shut up by M twice. The script does pick up dramatically well when Bond and Scaramanga meet. The dialogue between them at the dinner table is superb. The duel at the end of the film is also very good, with quite a bit of tense atmosphere; though after watching the pre-titles sequence we know how Bond will eventually get rid of Scaramanga. The music is okay by John Barry standards, and this is rather worrying, considering the rather lacklustre score provided by George Martin in the previous Bond film, Live And Let Die. The opening theme is truly dreadful, the lyrics grating along with their cheep sexual innuendosHe has a powerful weaponThat sort of thing.Perhaps the reason for the poor quality of this film was the fact that the relationship between Albert Cubby Brocolli and Harry Saltzman was disintegrating rapidly - an interesting discussion about 200 or so elephant shoes springs to mind, as well as a planned elephant stampede. Maybe it was Guy Hamilton's fault - he had made two Bond films already, and in my opinion Thunderball, Terrance Young's third Bond film, had been Young's weakest. Maybe it was the original source material - the book is an interesting but short novel, the last full story Flemming ever wrote, and it would not have had enough to fill more than an hour, perhaps an hour and a half at most. They needed something to fill in the gaps as it were.Whatever the reasons, The Man With The Golden Gun is perhaps the very worst of the Moore series. But don't let this stop you from watching it. Every Bond film has it's positives, and this film is no exception - it is perhaps one of the best performances by Christopher Lee since his first Dracula and until the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"14 July 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond 007 and truly one of the worst James Bond movies in the series...is what you would probably expect me to write. And yes, I would really like to write that. The problem is that I believe as a critic you should try to give a film as fair a review as you can.In fact, The Man With The Golden Gun starts well for three reasons - all three of these reasons are linked, as the film starts with the three best characters.Firstly we have the Man with the Golden Gun himself, Fransisco Scaramanga. One of this film's undeniable strengths is the presence of Christopher Lee as the main bad guy. This character is truly the dark side of Bond, a man with the same tastes of good food, good drink and damn good women, and someone who must kill for a living.

In terms of violence it is the goriest Halloween of them all, and on the basis of sheer thrills, it should already get at least 6\/10. Having said this, i didn't enjoy Jamie Llyod getting knacked like that. But then again, that sets the tone for this film - it is a very dark and unsettling one. Halloween 6 did do one great thing-confuse the heck out of everyone. It certainly is far better than the rubbish Halloween 5. I was little puzzled at how Jamie had her baby- what i mean is, who was the father? And did the infamous Man in Black set up her death. Oh, and where was she for the last six years. I mean, surely if she disappeared along with Michael at the end of the last film, he would have killed her then, wouldn't he.Anyway, there are far greater aspects in the film to cover up for this little plot hole, such as the amount of scares and clever deaths. Michael's mask is by far the best in the series so far, and the cinematography, in terms of lighting, helps provide that dark atmosphere of this film. the performances are very good- they convey a lot of emotion and fear. The film ends nicely with a respectful dedication to Donald Pleasance, and leaves room open for another sequel. I am thoroughly upset however, that H2O simply went on by ignoring all the events that took place in episodes 4-6. I mean, Michael still has another living relative. His niece, Jamie Lloyd's baby. I mean really, that seems like a pretty decent aspect to center another sequel around. Instead, they go on and mess up the series completely. However, Halloween Resurrection wasn't a bad film, despite Busta Rhymes terrible performance.I just hope they finish off things with the 9th installment, and that they tie up loose ends, such as what happens with the baby. Afterall, Michaels entire inspiration for killing is to murder all the members of his family, and those that stand in his way. If anyone has anything to say about my comment, please write back.

In terms of violence it is the goriest Halloween of them all, and on the basis of sheer thrills, it should already get at least 6\/10. Having said this, i didn't enjoy Jamie Llyod getting knacked like that. But then again, that sets the tone for this film - it is a very dark and unsettling one. Halloween 6 did do one great thing-confuse the heck out of everyone. It certainly is far better than the rubbish Halloween 5. I was little puzzled at how Jamie had her baby- what i mean is, who was the father? And did the infamous Man in Black set up her death. Oh, and where was she for the last six years. I mean, surely if she disappeared along with Michael at the end of the last film, he would have killed her then, wouldn't he.Anyway, there are far greater aspects in the film to cover up for this little plot hole, such as the amount of scares and clever deaths. Michael's mask is by far the best in the series so far, and the cinematography, in terms of lighting, helps provide that dark atmosphere of this film. the performances are very good- they convey a lot of emotion and fear.

Id like to know what you think ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"14 July 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Following the success of 1989's 'Batman', Tim Burton and Michael Keaton released a second movie in the franchise Batman Returns. Gotham City retains the Gothic look of the first film, only this time the city is in the midst of an icy winter punctuated by the arrival of two new villains on the scene Catwoman and the Penguin.As a kid I loved this movie and the original Tim Burton 'Batman' movie, however after re-watching it over a decade later it doesn't quite hold up as well as I wished it would have. Part of this reason is the fact that Batman seems almost external to this plot which revolves around Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gotham businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Batman (Michael Keaton) seems to only step in momentarily to throw a few punches before exiting back to Wayne Manor.All four lead actors, especially Danny DeVito, deliver great performances in this movie, but it is a real shame that the scriptwriters chose to not continue the analysis into the Bruce Wayne\/Batman psyche. Instead, we are left with a fairly routine 'bad guy trying to overthrow the city' story; the Penguin character was well developed, but the action scenes in the movie are nothing memorable. Another complaint is the lack of resolution that is given to the Penguin's attempts to turn Gotham city against Batman. Surely the mislead public would be angry at Batman for the crimes that they believe him to have committed, however the Bat-signal at the end of the film gives the impression that this is not the case.On the positive side though, the movie has a great feel to it; from the visual appearance of the winter Gotham, through to Danny Elfman's musical score. You can't help but feel some of the special effects - computer and real-life - are a little outdated 13 years down the track though.Overall, this childhood favourite of mine is worth a look and a film that I will revisit in the future, but upon reflection should have been better. I'm glad that the newly released 'Batman Begins' dives head first into the exploration of the Bruce Wayne\/Batman characters that this film avoids.2.5 stars \/ 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Following the success of 1989's 'Batman', Tim Burton and Michael Keaton released a second movie in the franchise Batman Returns.

His cousin says that's the devil's music, and Jerry Lee agrees--but to him that's a good thing.In the 1950's, Jerry Lee is performing that 'devil's music', and quite good at it. We see him go to Sam Phillips, the man who made Elvis a star. Will he be the next Elvis? He might very well be that talented. Phillips is very impressed, and his record becomes a hit.Once Elvis goes into the army, Lewis has his chance to become as big as the King, if not bigger. What may have been his downfall, if this movie is accurate, is his marriage to his second cousin Myra. The English do not approve, and Americans aren't much more receptive.Dennis Quaid does a great job, although it is apparently Lewis himself doing the singing. But Quaid pounds that piano and behaves wildly and shows a lot of passion and energy. I did enjoy the music, even though I usually like my music softer. It's amazing Lewis' music was banned by radio stations, because his songs get played on the station where I listen to Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Nat King Cole. Winona Ryder is a delight, especially when Myra goes shopping after the wedding. Steve Allen looks surprisingly young playing himself, and he seems to be having a good time. Elvis appears briefly several times, played by Michael St. Gerard, who portrayed the King in a 1990 TV bio. Elvis doesn't say much, but he does look the part. In one scene he and a girl are in bed together watching Lewis perform on TV, and the girl seems to want to do 'a whole lotta shaking'. Footage of others watching Lewis is shown (though they are probably watching something else). Included are a shocked Ward and June Cleaver.'Patricia' by Perez Prado seems appropriate for the scene where Jerry Lee and Myra wonder whether to tell Myra's parents. The organ has the whimsical, playful quality that is such a big part of Myra's character, the trumpet section reflects Lewis' wild streak, and the trombones sound like Myra's father probably will after he gets the news.While there were negatives in Lewis' life, this movie doesn't really make these look as bad as it could have. I found the movie entertaining as a whole.
