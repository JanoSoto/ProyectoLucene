When Hanks's annoying child (and he is extremely annoying) catches the flight from Seattle to New York, Hanks finds out and chases. As we are shown that the flight hasn't arrived at NYC when Hanks sets off (as shown in the dashed line illustrative cut), logic would dictate that Hanks would phone the airport ahead, to make sure that the kid was picked up (probably by the police) when the plane landed. In fact, the cabin crew would be alerted and be ready for the police on landing. There is no way that Hanks as a responsible parent wouldn't do this, as who would want their 6 year old child walking around NYC by himself?It's quite a fun film, but it's not a 10\/10. The director keeps trying to make excuses for why the film isn't a great movie, by insinuating that it's a chick flick, therefore fellas won't get it (by creating the analogy with An Affair to Remember), thus invoking a sense of feminist camaraderie about the movie, which in turn possibly makes women want to like the movie more in the spirit of all things feminine. Unfortunately, that doesn't wash, as there are some fantastic rom coms and romance movies out there. (such as Le Mari de la coiffeuse, which was release 3 years before this film, possibly the greatest rom com of the 90's). When Harry Met Sally is also considerably better.Not wanting to knock it any more, it still a good film. If only that kid weren't such a pain in the ass!

All the characters are amazing, and it will leave you thinking about it for a long time after you have finished watching it, believe me, plus Tom Cruise(especially), Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz are all simply incredible in this, and Kurt Russell is amazing!. I have not seen the original Open Your Eyes yet, but I found this film to be simply incredible ,and Tom Cruise delivers another dynamite performance, as he pulled off an incredibly difficult role with perfection, plus I found this film to be extremely creepy for some reason (but in a good way). Cameron Diaz also deserves tons of props with her incredible performance as she was also creepy, and The car crash scene is especially disturbing, plus the ending while confusing was absolutely brilliant as it blew me away!. It's brilliantly made and written, and all the characters are extremely likable, plus Cruise had outstanding chemistry with both Diaz and Cruz. However if you don't pay strict attention you will get lost, as it is a very hard film to follow, and Cruise's smashed up face was extremely creepy but wonderfully done and realistic looking, as I don't know How Cruise managed to pull that off but he did,plus it's very, very complex as well. This movie will especially not be for everybody, as it really is one of a kind film, and is an acquired taste, plus the psychiatric scenes with Cruise and Russell were fantastic. I really loved the incredible angles Cameron Crowe did, and This film has plenty of disturbing and shocking moments as well, plus that mask Cruise had to wear was very chilling. Even at 136 minutes it was never overlong, and I would put this in Cruise's top 5 best performances, plus this should be way higher then 6.8 in my opinion. It's also a brilliant Sci-Fi film as well, and The opening dream Cruise had was really cool, and somewhat creepy, plus I loved the script as well. I will be definitely checking out the original, since I loved this one, and dare I say this should be in the top 250?, plus I think it's quite cool that Penélope Cruz decided to play the same role twice as she played the same role in the original!. Everybody was just perfectly casted, and all the stars look just great, plus while I am a huge Cameron Diaz fan I wasn't sure if she could pull this off or not as it was quite a difficult role, boy did she ever prove me wrong. I don't know if anyone could have played his role as well as Cruise did,and as far as remakes go (even though I have yet to see the original) this is as good as it gets, plus Cameron Crowe proves here why he is considered one of the best directors out there!. I'm going to say anything more, because I want the viewers to go in without knowing anything. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely mind blowing, with a mesmerizing story, and stunning performances,and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, every movie buff should watch it!. The Direction is incredible!. Cameron Crowe does an incredible! job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, giving it a really dreamy like feel to it and keeping the film at and incredibly engrossing pace.The Acting is simply stunning!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he had to play an incredibly difficult role and he did it with perfection he was also extremely likable, very charming, and you will feel for his character and what he is going through, he simply blew me away in a lot of scenes, especially when he is horribly disfigured just his walk, and his reactions it was amazing, he is especially incredible near the end,but fear not Cruise fans that smile will be seen often throughout the film, this is one his absolute best performances! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Penélope Cruz is also incredible here in her scenes as Sofia, she is incredibly gorgeous, very sweet and charming, had outstanding chemistry with Cruise, and was wonderfully energetic I loved her! (Cruz Rules!!). Cameron Diaz is amazing as always and is also incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, but also very creepy here, the famous suicide scene with her gave me the chills she was just so convincing, it really shocked me, she also plays the obsessive type extremely well too! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here as the Doc, he is extremely likable intense, had some great scenes with Cruise, I just wished he had more screen time!. Jason Lee is awesome as Cruise's best friend he was funny and intense at the same time I really liked him. Rest of the cast are fine.

The first time i heard of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, i was holidaying in America. Living in England I had never heard of the cross over artist named Selena. I decided to watch the movie anyway not expecting too much to be honest but within the first five minutes i was captivated.The movie begins with a young boy band trying to make it in the industry but they are faced with prejudice because they are Mexicans in America. As the movie develops we establish that one of the young boys in the band is Selenas father Abraham, played brilliantly by Edward James Olmos.Although Abraham still yearns for his musical past he now has other priorities such as a wife, three young children and a number of jobs. Abraham is very head strong and determined in any thing he sets out to do and we understand this as we see how he was treated as a young boy.One day Abraham begins strumming on his guitar playing a tune which captivates a young Selena's attention (Rebecca Lee Meza). As she sings along with her father, Abraham realises just how good Selena is, which gives him yet another idea...he will start a band involving all his family.As the story develops we see Selena, her brother and sister being ordered to practice which they do not want to do because they want to play like the other kids but Abraham persists. Along with his band, Abraham also opens his own Mexican restaurant and asks Selena to provide the entertainment.Being Mexican in America and a female, a young Selena was finding it very hard to establish herself as a serious artist. The charts were dominated by male country singers but Abraham never gave up hope. As he tells Selena, he only wants the best for her and finally Selenas mother agrees to give her full support to Abraham. On the beach front, Selenas mother teaches Selena to dance...a dance Selena would later perform on stage to thousands!!! The movie quickly jumps from this point in to Selena as an adult played superbly by Jennifer Lopez who has a remarkable resemblance to Selena. We see Jennifer perform on stage in identical clothing worn by Selena, doing the same dance moves and simply giving it her all in the style of Selena.We also get to see Selena the person, her relationships with her mother, father, brother and sister and most importantly her husband. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) was hired by Abraham to play guitar for Selena on tour and soon a romance began against her fathers wishes. He sacked Chris and this hurt Selena so much she used to sneak off to see Chris alone. They decided in a heat of the moment to get married. Selena knew this would upset her father but she decided to see him and explain but a radio announcement of the shock wedding changes her mind. She does explain to her father the next day who apologises for not letting her make her own choices and accepts Chris in to the family. He also allows Chris back on the Selena tour which begins the next day.Along side this storyline we see Selena branch out in to other projects such as her fashion and beauty business in which she hires Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as her financial manager of her fan club. This proves to be a fatal mistake for Selena. As the movie develops, Selena and Chris decide once the tour is over they will start a family and have a farm which has always been a dream for Selena. On top of this Selena has just won a Grammy for her album. Yolando gives Selena a present of a ring she claims she payed for herself but we know she has stolen the money. We realise now that Yolanda is not all she seems and we discover she has been floundering money from Selenas fans. Abraham and Selena confront her and she denies it. She asks Selena to give her time to prove it. Selena allows this and a few days later meets up with Yolando at a motel and the rest they say is history! This meeting proved to be the last for Selena as Yolanda shot the singer in a motel room. Suddenly the movie changes to actual news footage of the reporting of the shooting. Then we follow Selena to the hospital and in a pointant moment, the camera only focuses on Selenas hand and we see shes clutching something...the ring given to her by Yolanda...she drops it to the floor. We see the doctor deliver the news of Selenas death to her family and Chris and as a viewer you get a lump in your throat. The director cleverly mutes the sound so you can not hear the doctor or the crys of Selenas family but you just simply see the emotion and pain in their face and body language.Then the song 'Dreaming Of You' by Selena begins with its dreamy melody and pure lyrics. We see her on stage in a white dress looking like an angel with footage of her fans in a memorial for her, holding pictures and lighting candles in tribute to a wonderful woman.This is a real tear-jerker and Jennifer Lopez gives an excellent portrayal of Selena.

This movie is some decent and pretty looking entertainment. It's a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's a movie made without any potential and in the long run it's a pretty good and entertaining enough movie.It's very simple to say why this movie 'flopped'. Reason for this was Leonardo DiCaprio. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no Leo hater, that's not my point. My point is, you have to consider the fact that this movie was released in 2000, 3 years after his role in Titanic. Most of the male audience couldn't stand DiCaprio after his sappy role in this movie but most girls loved him. That's why the guys didn't went to see The Beach when it was released and also females didn't went to see it because this is a totally different movie and role for DiCaprio. So it was the wrong timing or the casting, both are possibilities, which caused this movie to not be a very successful one at the box office and among critics because they were not at the time quite ready yet to see DiCaprio in a totally different role, even though in the past he already had played a wide diversity of roles.Too bad because the movie really deserved a better faith. Granted that it's no masterpiece but than again it doesn't really try to be one. The story doesn't really try to go deep, even though they could had easily gone that way with it. Instead it's a movie with multiple layers in it that go in good into some certain issues handled in the movie. The movie tries to be as realistic as possible even though the story at times certainly isn't. A reason why The Beach is just a good movie and not a great one.The movie is beautiful looking and has some nice settings. The directing is quite original at times which helps to give the movie its own unique feeling. Also the story helps to make this movie an original one and it's quite thought provoking at certain moments.Leonardo DiCaprio shows with this movie once more that he is more than just a pretty face. He's a real talented actor and this movie truly shows his, by many yet undiscovered, talent. Robert Carlyle is also great in a fairly small but still important role. A nice surprise in the movie was Guillaume Canet. This is a great French actor, who mainly only makes French movies and already has been nominated twice for a César Award. (Let's say the French Oscar for French movies.)A simple entertaining movie made without any potential. Would it had been released let's say 5 years later it would had received a better faith and a more wider audience.

With that iliac garland and that modest bosom? I just question her presence.

The photography is first-rate too. Savannah has never looked quite so -- Southern.And that's about it.The story is so intricate that it's hard to follow. The script makes everyone except Travolta and Stowe into a suspect. People lurk in shadows. They peer intensely at a pair of general's stars (which have nothing to do with the movie) while ominous music slowly builds. Some speak elliptically, hinting at horrors, and it leads nowhere. Red herrings all over the place. The moment one is identified as some sort of villain, he's revealed as innocent and someone else comes under the magnifying glass, until he too is discarded, and we wind up with the one guy who has never been shown to be involved in any way in the crimes and who has been nothing but a cooperative friend to the two investigators. And even this revelation (involving a slow-motion explosion -- what else?) is anti-climactic because we have yet to get to the REAL villain! What the hell is the movie supposed to be about anyway? Is it an exercise in surrealism? It begins with Travolta asleep in his bed. An assassin creeps into his houseboat and shoots the place into little pieces before Travolta jumps him and they fall in the water and somebody starts an outboard motor in the middle of an underwater fight and the spinning screw fortuitously Cuisinearts somebody's face up and the water turns red and no satisfactory explanation for the fight to the death follows.Or -- let me put it this way. If you were a woman who was gang raped and beaten and your father visited you in the hospital, kissed your forehead, assured you of his love, and advised you to never think of the incident again, would you be willing to destroy your life in order to destroy his?Not to argue that the father -- in this case James Cromwell -- is morally right in taking his career into account. That's pretty selfish and his lack of righteous anger at his daughter's rapists is a big hole in his character.But his daughter, an Army captain of delicious aspect, tries to get her revenge by sleeping with every guy on the base in order to make him seem a fool. She succeeds and he finally tells her she must see a therapist or resign her commission.Now -- get this -- and this is seven years after the original brutal rape, which is implausibly presented to begin with -- she enlists the help of her friend and mentor (James Woods) who ties her spreadeagled and naked on the ground. And she arranges to have her father drive out to see her in this position, alone at night, and screams at him, something like, Do you see what they did to me? Do you feel guilty NOW? She tells him that she is going to remain in this position until everyone on the base knows about it and her father's career is torpedoed. Well -- the best advice she ever got came from him. (1) Try not to think about the original rape. And (2) get help.There is no help in the direction either. Lots of closeups of faces with tears or agonized expressions. (Except for Clarence Williams, who can produce tears but no expressions at all.) I suppose, in the end, we are supposed to find ourselves brimming over with the self-righteous anger that Cromwell's general lacks. A woman in the Army has been foully mistreated and we are enraged. The problem is a real one. There seem to be more sexual assaults on women in the military than is usually assumed, although it's doubtful that many of them are officers.

The photography is first-rate too. Savannah has never looked quite so -- Southern.And that's about it.The story is so intricate that it's hard to follow. The script makes everyone except Travolta and Stowe into a suspect. People lurk in shadows. They peer intensely at a pair of general's stars (which have nothing to do with the movie) while ominous music slowly builds. Some speak elliptically, hinting at horrors, and it leads nowhere. Red herrings all over the place. The moment one is identified as some sort of villain, he's revealed as innocent and someone else comes under the magnifying glass, until he too is discarded, and we wind up with the one guy who has never been shown to be involved in any way in the crimes and who has been nothing but a cooperative friend to the two investigators. And even this revelation (involving a slow-motion explosion -- what else?) is anti-climactic because we have yet to get to the REAL villain! What the hell is the movie supposed to be about anyway? Is it an exercise in surrealism? It begins with Travolta asleep in his bed. An assassin creeps into his houseboat and shoots the place into little pieces before Travolta jumps him and they fall in the water and somebody starts an outboard motor in the middle of an underwater fight and the spinning screw fortuitously Cuisinearts somebody's face up and the water turns red and no satisfactory explanation for the fight to the death follows.Or -- let me put it this way. If you were a woman who was gang raped and beaten and your father visited you in the hospital, kissed your forehead, assured you of his love, and advised you to never think of the incident again, would you be willing to destroy your life in order to destroy his?Not to argue that the father -- in this case James Cromwell -- is morally right in taking his career into account. That's pretty selfish and his lack of righteous anger at his daughter's rapists is a big hole in his character.But his daughter, an Army captain of delicious aspect, tries to get her revenge by sleeping with every guy on the base in order to make him seem a fool. She succeeds and he finally tells her she must see a therapist or resign her commission.Now -- get this -- and this is seven years after the original brutal rape, which is implausibly presented to begin with -- she enlists the help of her friend and mentor (James Woods) who ties her spreadeagled and naked on the ground. And she arranges to have her father drive out to see her in this position, alone at night, and screams at him, something like, Do you see what they did to me? Do you feel guilty NOW? She tells him that she is going to remain in this position until everyone on the base knows about it and her father's career is torpedoed. Well -- the best advice she ever got came from him. (1) Try not to think about the original rape. And (2) get help.There is no help in the direction either. Lots of closeups of faces with tears or agonized expressions. (Except for Clarence Williams, who can produce tears but no expressions at all.) I suppose, in the end, we are supposed to find ourselves brimming over with the self-righteous anger that Cromwell's general lacks. A woman in the Army has been foully mistreated and we are enraged. The problem is a real one. There seem to be more sexual assaults on women in the military than is usually assumed, although it's doubtful that many of them are officers. As a social problem, it deserves a more thoughtful and skillful treatment than you can find in this movie.

As expected, Grodin's deadpan and matter-of-fact humor compliments De Niro's hot-headed, sarcastic witty humor perfectly. The plot is interesting, though the pace seemed odd to me. It gets going faster than you'd expect it to, and then proceeds to take it's good time getting to where it's going. Maybe it's just too long since I've seen a movie of this period. There's no doubt about it; the film is very 80's. Around half-way through the film, I thought to myself There is no doubt as to the fact that this movie was made in the same decade as The Blues Brothers. It starts out 80's, continues 80's and ends 80's. The music, the tone, the dialog... everything. Any fan of the movies and culture of those years should love it. Heck, I'm not... and I thought it was pretty darn great. The score consists heavily of jazz and blues, which both fits and just sounds, well, damn good. The action is somewhat... well, close to non-existent, but that's not what this film is about. It's about the characters - the people we follow. True, only the two main characters are well-developed... but they all seemed credible, and what back-story was provided was excellent. The acting is all good. The humor mostly works... though there were two characters who seemed to only be there to provide comic relief, and of the worst kind. They were inexplicably daft, and this was just hit on every single time we see them... no depth whatsoever to them. Some of the jokes and gags try too hard to be funny, and a few are added in at points in the movie that are too busy, too much going on for us to find them funny. To the director and the writer, I say this Remember, less is more. You can't cram in jokes wherever. Like action, humor needs pacing and timing to work. Finally, De Niro fools the same character not once, not twice, but three times with the exact same trick. It turns out to be a setup, but still. Still, this is one of the best films of its kind, and it's a lot better than many, if not necessarily all(The Blues Brothers and Trading Places definitely top it) 80's comedies. I recommend this film to most people who can enjoy a film that is a little older than brand new... it has, most definitely, aged quite well. Watch it for De Niro, watch it for Grodin, watch it for some good laughs and a good film experience(thought it would be a lie to say that it's exceptionally well-made, from a purely technical standpoint). 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2006","score":"","review":" From the moment I heard of this film, I knew I had to watch it... a buddy comedy pairing up Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro, that's simply too good, to golden an idea to miss.

I grew up knowing who Coppola was because of famous movies that he had done such as The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, The Godfather Part 3, Apocalypse Now. The Conversation was not a movie that I was familiar with but I was open-minded because of Coppola. I also noticed that it had some accomplished actors in the leading roles. Gene Hackman plays the main character, a professional bugger named Harry Caul who spies on people for money. The film also featured John Cazale as Caul's assistant Stan, Cindy Williams as Ann, the women on whom Caul is spying, and a young Harrison Ford playing Martin Stett, assistant to the business executive who is paying Caul. There was also a pleasant cameo appearance by Robert Duvall playing the business executive.The film begins and progresses slowly and begins with the conversation that gave the film its title. Not much is known from the beginning about what the conversation is about or about the characters themselves. We finally get to know Harry a little bit when he goes home to his apartment. When we see him go to his door, he unlocks several locks in order to enter his apartment. Immediately we get the feeling that this person is extremely paranoid. He finds a wrapped bottle of wine inside his door and immediately calls whom we assume is the landlord to complain about how she entered the apartment. Harry tells her that he wants the only key to him apartment and no one else. We can tell that Harry is paranoid, secretive, and he does not trust people. This seems very ironic because his business is robbing people of the same security that he treasures so much. This irony becomes more prominent as the film progresses.Eventually, Caul makes a startling discovery when listening to the tapes of the conversation. He hears the words, He'd kill us if he got the chance. Hearing this, Caul wrestles with whether to give the tapes to his employer. He does not want to be an accessory to murder. Finally, the tapes are taken from Caul while he sleeps and they are given to the director. Caul goes to pick up his money and we finally meet Caul's employer, the director (Robert Duvall) and her learns that Ann is the director's wife. Now Caul must decide what he is going to do about the information he has received. Does he try to stop the murder he thinks will happen? Is the murder even real? Is he reading too much into the conversation? All of these questions plague Caul up until the end of the movie.As it turns out, Caul did misinterpret the conversation, but it was not about whether there was going to be a murder, but rather who was going to be murdered. He learns that it was not Ann who was killed but the director. Ann, and her acquaintance Mark (Frederic Forrest), set up the director and killed him, making it look like a car accident. With the director's death, Ann gets everything he had. The whole thing was a ploy by a greedy wife, her lover, and an executive assistant. After learning the truth, Caul realizes that there is not much he can do about the situation. He decides to go home and, while playing the saxophone, he receives a phone call from Martin Stett telling Caul that they know he knows and they will be listening to him. Caul, being paranoid, rips his apartment apart searching for bugs and he does not find any. The final scene is haunting with Caul, sitting down, playing his saxophone, with his apartment in ruins, a victim of his own way of life. He spied on people to make a living and now he is the one being spied on, probably for the rest of his life.The film, technically speaking, is very well done. Coppola does a great job directing and writing an interesting and engaging story. He also creates an interesting character in Harry Caul. Caul seems paranoid, secretive, and unwilling to let people get close to him. This is why I believe that Caul will be alone for the rest of his life. The film was made during the Watergate years where the surveillance tactics of the government were in question. Many people were afraid of there civil liberties were being infringed on, not unlike the situation today with terrorism. Today, we are dealing with the same problem when deciding whether we want to give up civil liberties in order to be safe from terrorists. The cinematography of the film is interesting. In Caul's apartment, the camera-work is done to make us believe that we are in the camera that is spying on Caul and, indeed, that is the case when the film ends. The sound in the film, as one might expect, is superb and the acting is great as well. You truly believe that Gene Hackman is Harry Caul. The Conversation is a great film of the 1970s, one of Coppola's greatest films, and not one that should be missed.

When it came out in 1936, the Depression was at its height and unemployment was rampant. Because of this, Socialism, Communism and unions were all on the rise. Considering how poor everyone was, these seemed like pretty attractive alternatives. This film was actually a radical political\/social message wrapped up in comedy set in the very near future--if it had been presented as a drama, there's a good chance Hollywood would not have made the film. It's about the dehumanization of the worker and this movie as well as Chaplin's political leanings would later come back to haunt him during the Red Scare.But, back to the movie. This film is essentially a series of vignettes all strung together with a schmaltzy plot. It's a shame really, as all the vignettes are good but the plot that connects them is by far the weakest part of the film--partly because Paulette Goddard was NOT a teenager (she was just way too old to play the part) and partly because the moments between her and Chaplin tended to be the slowest and most saccharine in the film. Now I am not saying it's a bad film--far from it. It's just that this element is not the best aspect of the film. Chaplin's timing and athleticism is actually the star of the movie. The film is incredible to watch as he roller skates, glides through AMAZING looking machinery and almost dances through the film. It's a wonderful film technically and fun to watch.PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"24 March 2006","score":"","review":" This is the way you do romantic epics, okay? One thing I absolutely loved about Gone with the Wind is that it doesn't start slow. It gets right into the center of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and portrays her as a selfish, spoiled brat. She loves the well-mannered, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man she cannot have and he will be soon marrying the naive Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). She meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is far from who Ashley is &#151; he is no gentleman at all but he loves Scarlett, only Scarlett does not have the same love for him as she does for Ashley. Every character in this film is memorable, even Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), the black woman who is loyal the O'Hara household. Even though the DVD edition of the film is roughly 3hrs and 58mins long, time goes fast when you're actually watching a good movie. This is what romances are all about It doesn't matter if you don't have explicit love scenes, all that matters are characters that are true to the story itself.What is wrong with the actresses today? Why can't they be more like &#133; Vivien Leigh? I think one of the best female performances I have seen so far has to be Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the selfish, beautiful, spoiled, and rather manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. This is what Hollywood lacks today Amazing actresses who are able to carry a film role all by themselves and be permanently remembered by it. This is what makes Leigh's performance so amazing because every time someone mentions her name, they would instantly think of the film. Even though this was Leigh's time to shine, the other performances weren't too bad Clark Gable was absolutely charming as Rhett Butler and makes you believe him if he was drunk or pretending that he is drunk. There is another very underrated performance here that I would like to mention, and that is of Olivia de Havilland as Melanie. This is one very likable character and I keep hoping that Scarlett would accept her at the end, and fortunately she did, but I don't want to spoil too much of that for those who hasn't seen this classic. There is also Leslie Howard as Ashley, who was not as amazing as his co-stars but was able to muster up Ashley's blank expressions towards Scarlett and perfects moments of uncertainty. Hattie McDaniels also made Mammy &#151; who could of had been quite a simple character &#151; memorable.Most beautiful movie ever made? Everything from the cinematography to the costume design was just breathtaking. With an estimated budget of $3,900,000 (at the time, that was a big movie). Compared to the films we have today, where Peter Jackson uses about one thousand green screens, it is even more of a wonder to watch. Gone with the Wind is still a true masterpiece and it is still truly unforgettable. If only our tech-systems can improve plots by just typing in the screenplay &#133; Final thoughts.I adored this film and everything about it. I have little to complain &#151; even though this film is over 65 years old, there is nothing to hate about a true classic that can make you remember it for it. The final scenes in the film are just priceless and I don't think any other film can succeed the ending that Gone with the Wind provided for its story. I think I really like films that end with regret and tragedy, I think it's probably my favorite genre of ending. This is also probably my favorite romance because of the ending, and for those who know me I dread romances &#151; but not this one! Well, I might improve my tastes and look for happier movies, but I'll think about it tomorrow. After all&#133; tomorrow is another day. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2006","score":"","review":" This is the way you do romantic epics, okay? One thing I absolutely loved about Gone with the Wind is that it doesn't start slow. It gets right into the center of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and portrays her as a selfish, spoiled brat. She loves the well-mannered, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a man she cannot have and he will be soon marrying the naive Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). She meets Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is far from who Ashley is &#151; he is no gentleman at all but he loves Scarlett, only Scarlett does not have the same love for him as she does for Ashley. Every character in this film is memorable, even Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), the black woman who is loyal the O'Hara household. Even though the DVD edition of the film is roughly 3hrs and 58mins long, time goes fast when you're actually watching a good movie. This is what romances are all about It doesn't matter if you don't have explicit love scenes, all that matters are characters that are true to the story itself.What is wrong with the actresses today? Why can't they be more like &#133; Vivien Leigh? I think one of the best female performances I have seen so far has to be Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the selfish, beautiful, spoiled, and rather manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. This is what Hollywood lacks today Amazing actresses who are able to carry a film role all by themselves and be permanently remembered by it. This is what makes Leigh's performance so amazing because every time someone mentions her name, they would instantly think of the film. Even though this was Leigh's time to shine, the other performances weren't too bad Clark Gable was absolutely charming as Rhett Butler and makes you believe him if he was drunk or pretending that he is drunk. There is another very underrated performance here that I would like to mention, and that is of Olivia de Havilland as Melanie. This is one very likable character and I keep hoping that Scarlett would accept her at the end, and fortunately she did, but I don't want to spoil too much of that for those who hasn't seen this classic. There is also Leslie Howard as Ashley, who was not as amazing as his co-stars but was able to muster up Ashley's blank expressions towards Scarlett and perfects moments of uncertainty. Hattie McDaniels also made Mammy &#151; who could of had been quite a simple character &#151; memorable.Most beautiful movie ever made? Everything from the cinematography to the costume design was just breathtaking. With an estimated budget of $3,900,000 (at the time, that was a big movie). Compared to the films we have today, where Peter Jackson uses about one thousand green screens, it is even more of a wonder to watch. Gone with the Wind is still a true masterpiece and it is still truly unforgettable.
