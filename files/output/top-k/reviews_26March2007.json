It's been said already, but this film really does combine the best of both worlds. It's silly and slapstick enough to make the kids laugh, and has enough subtle and sophisticated humour for the adults too. In fact, the comedy is what makes this film so special. The jokes are consistently excellent, and it's highly unlikely that anyone can keep a straight face throughout. It's funnier than the Disney\/Pixar efforts, save Toy Story, and in fact it's better than most comedies you'll see.The characters are great too. Hogarth Hughes ( Eli Mariental) is actually not that annoying for a Hollywood kid. His double-act with the Giant (Vin Diesel) is entertaining and endearing. Halfway through, Beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jnr) is added to the mix, and together it's a highly amusing triumvirate. However, the show, and the best lines, are stolen by FBI agent Ken Mansley (Christopher McDonald). Mansley is the ideal kid's movie villain, just bumbling and stupid enough to be humorous, but with enough menace to get by. His interrogation of Hogarth itself is chilling, as is his hate of the giant, demonstrated during the finale. The other character of note is Hogarth's mum, Annie (Jennifer Aniston). She isn't a prominent part of the story, which is strange given that Aniston is the biggest name in the cast list. But thankfully, she doesn't wreck the film either.The film is at it's weakest when it's trying to be profound, and there are certainly a few cheesy lines as a result. However the film carries a decent anti-war message, as well as preaching acceptance to those who are different, which is to be applauded in a kid's film. In particular, the Giant's initial refusal to allow himself to become the weapon he was designed to be is well done. Even better is his subsequent rage and rampage at Hogarth's apparent death at the hands of the army, which shows us we can all go off the deep end sometimes. That's pretty deep for a U-rated picture.Other things to note are the animation, which is excellent, different from the Pixar style, but impressive nonetheless. The 50's soundtrack is great too, adding authenticity.In conclusion this is a film that really punches above it's weight, providing great comedy and a decent message that anyone of any age can enjoy. It's said often, but this really is a film that the whole family CAN enjoy. Highly recommended.

Although you can't go back to this film and state that it was too near the beginning of his career to warrant any criticism (He'd already done 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'), I got the feeling you don't have to as it manages to stand tall all by itself.A few days after seeing Thelma & Louise, I slowly began to realise how much it broke away from typical Hollywood storytelling. Although this is, after all, a 'road movie'; that didn't detract from the eerie realisation I started to feel when I realised this film carried certain neo-realistic qualities. What that means is that it emphasises the everyday and unspectacular; a feeling I certainly got once they were deep into the middle of the desert during which the film hits a segment of pure unpredictability, in a very entertaining way. The acting talent is also pretty close to un heard of with Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Geena Davis all still relatively unknown in Hollywood; how quaint then that the two heavy weights of Keitel and Sarandon do most of the bantering when things get really tight and whilst the 'unknowns' of Pitt and Davis develop their own relationship.The film is suspenseful, but suspenseful in its own unique way. Little battles, problems and dilemmas the two women face along their journey are dealt with in an entertaining, if not unspectacular and often logistical way but it doesn't detract. What adds to this unpredictability are the little love stories that open up about a third of the way in. The character of Louise (Davis) is developing the whole time as friendship\/love relations with another man other than her obnoxious husband open up; not only advancing the character in a satisfying way but also paving the way for the next event to occur that kick-starts their adventure once again.What's more, as each situation that comes along (The meeting of J.D. (Pitt), the fact they loose all their money and have to do something about it and the interaction with the state trooper; to name a few) the better it gets. The two women grow in their confidence and ruthlessness whilst the scenarios grow more and more intense. The reactions of the two women to these scenarios also escalates to the point that they do something so extreme; it threatens their lives.With plenty of things going for it, the film almost seems scared to veer too far away from its roots. The overuse of cheery music of the pop and country variety adds to my theory that the director wanted to keep everything fairly light-hearted. As each desperate situation occurs, I feel less of the light music and more of a darker decent shown by the two women would have suited the film much more. Alas, the film remains in its 'happy' state and the closing montage before the credits signalling the 'best bits' from the film\/the two character's relationship only adds to my point.Ridley Scott had Sigourney Weaver defying female film stereo-types in Alien as she went around saving the day and acting as the hero\/focus; in Thelma & Louise we have an equally good example of that from the same director, only this time there are two.

The movie instigates a psychological response while it inavertadly wanders into the unexplained areas of the mind. It's a film that is meant to be experienced not watched. Although Peter Weir is an Australian director the feature cannot be categorized into any specific national style or genre. It has all the qualities of an independent\/experimental film with none of the shortcomings that can sometimes get dragged along with those kinds of pictures. The overall approach is unpretentious and eerily believable even though the plot and story are far out and imaginative.Cinematography, sound and lighting are what give this movie its hallucinatory rhythm and substance creating an entire atmosphere of mystery. Although the film comes off as slow paced it just requires a little patience to adjust to its unique style. Some notable scenes are when the girls are climbing Hanging Rock and there are over lapping shots of birds flying that dissolve in and out with their faces. There is a good variation in different methods of shooting employed by the cinematographer in these particular parts. Although through most of the scenes there are a lot of shots when the characters are captured in the center of the frame, later in the film there is a great contrast to this simple approach. One example is the more low angle photography when filming Hanging Rock. Since it is so large and vast and the camera is placed more below, it projects the image of a superior force that should not be reckoned with. These shots of the rock create a feeling of uneasiness to the point were it becomes a character in itself; some of the rocks even take on a human presence because they look like faces. These shots just linger in the movie constantly reminding the audience that there is a mysterious element of danger prominent. Sound and music tie a lot of elements together in the film too. When the girls are making their way up the music also seems to coincide with the pace of their ascent towards the top. The classical numbers also seem very appropriately placed in the film because it matches with the prim Victorian attitudes. The incorporation of silence has an equally important effect as music does in some cases. Early in the film when they first arrive the only things noticeable to the ear is the harmonies of birds chirping and other natural sounds that are to be heard in a setting such as that. This gives the audience a feeling of cinematic realism while it still does not compromise the intended fantasy and surrealism. Sometimes a lack of sound can even enhance and accentuate feelings of apprehension.There are also a few different genres going on in this picture. In one light it is a period piece seeing as it takes place in 1900. The costume design and recreation of the times look very natural and accurate. There is also an adequate portrayal of Victorian attitudes while the picture never becomes over indulgent like some period films (Fellini's Casanova, Zefrelli's Jane Eyre). It's important however that one not be led on by this soft exterior it starts out on because it slowly snowballs into a very psychologically startling storyline that also borderlines into the horror genre. Even though there are no knife wielding maniacs or ghouls swallowing people up doesn't mean that it can't be frightening. Actually, the lack of things like that is what gives the film its originality. Peter Weir seems to be one of the few directors (if not only) that can make a movie where tragedy falls upon attractive young women without being exploitive; everything throughout the picture is done in good taste. It's good to see a filmmaker fearlessly blend different styles into one work. It's pretty safe to say that Picnic at Hanging Rock is not one particular kind of movie because it has many different elements combined into one. Since there is nothing that legitimately explains what happened to the girls who disappeared it was important for the director to uniquely craft that aura of mysticism. It makes the viewer aware that the option of something supernatural is responsible for what happened. There are no answers led on by the director throughout the movie, it's entirely up to the audience to draw their own conclusions, now although this may frustrate some it also peeks interest in others.

There is a progression in the Jack Ryan series that shows him rising higher and higher in National Security circles until he reaches the Oval Office himself culmination in The Bear and The Dragon which I was hoping to see made into a film.

Sometimes, even without the 20\/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story-telling I have ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind-bender. The Prestige, which was considerably stripped down in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven. Even in a jaded enterprise like the Batman series did Christopher Nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarn-weaving tricks, breathing new life into the dark knight.Following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes, and finally sees an end no one could have expected. Having never heard of Following before, I had no idea what I was to expect. At every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me. Since the mystery angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next. And that is where I think the film succeeds so well. The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.The film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines, both of which are considered gimmicky these days. Following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is, but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride. The lack of pretension or self-aware arrogance is what makes this style of story-telling work. Highly recommended!

Both are looking forward to getting out, but Nick most of all as he is going to meet up with his penpal girlfriend for the first time. However when Nick is stabbed to death on the day before his release, Rudy takes his identity as well as bedding the attractive and trusting Ashley. What Rudy doesn't know though is that Nick had told Ashley in a letter that he used to work in a casino and had joked about aspects of the weak security. Ashley's brother has read the letter and he and his gang decide to snatch Nick (or Rudy as he claims to be called) and force him to help plan their robbery. Obviously though, Rudy knows nothing of this casino and faces a no-win scenario of coming clean about is identity (and being killed) or giving them false information about the layout (and being killed).Despite the arresting opening scene that sees a group of dead Santas lying in the snow, this job gone wrong thriller actually is pretty ordinary and perhaps it is understandable why it made comparatively little money at the box office. I'm not saying it is a bad film because it isn't, it is just very much par for the course in terms of the genre. It engaged me for most of the first half because I was sticking with it to see where it would end up but once the twists starting coming then it all got increasingly silly. The biggest twists are not just silly &#150; they are out and out ludicrous and the script doesn't even bother to really explain them. This damaged the film because it just seemed lazy writing (which of course is probably what it was) and it just stopped me caring (which is just as well considering how poor the ending is when it finally comes).The cast features lots of names but nobody really has much to work with. Affleck is pretty average; I don't really have anything against him but he just didn't fit the character. Sinise is a better fit while Theron gets naked and, seemingly unable to work out who her character is, just overplays any chance she gets. Support is solid enough from Trejo, Hayes, Williams, Farina and a few others. None really have much to do in regards the material but they fill out the gang the genre requires.A nondescript genre film then. At best it ticks all the boxes but as it goes on the twists become increasingly silly and any viewers still gripped by it at this point will be likely to stop caring.

Before long a more famous photographer on the L.A. scene, Rex Webster (Paul Bartel) is threatening to swoop down and take him away from Billy before he gets to finish his photo shoot.Much of the film is consumed with Billy's self-doubt about his relationship with Gabriel &#150; is he merely engaging in fantasy projection of his desire onto an apparently straight man (who assures us at every opportunity that he has a girlfriend in San Francisco) or has he fallen in love with the improbably handsome busboy? There are some moments of slight humor but nothing that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the characters just became obnoxious to me, particularly Billy's straight friend Georgiana (Meredith Scott Lynn) who for unexplained reasons spends time with a very very obnoxious drug addict musician type on Catalina Island. The drug addict character is an example of how the film tried to woo favor with the straight audience by projecting its unfavorable stereotyped images onto select straight characters and allowing the other straight characters to join in on ridiculing those characters' behavior along with the gay characters.I mostly watched the film to see Paul Bartel, honestly, and his work was fine here but not exceptional. There wasn't anything distinctive enough about the character, a sort of hackneyed artist\/queen, that would have enabled Bartel to show much of his talent. Since this was one of Bartel's last roles that's kind of disappointing.I did enjoy Hayes' work, I thought it was fine within the limits of what he was given for the character.Not really a terrible movie but really just not funny enough to be worth it.

Its a slap stick comedy with a couple of scenes with Reeves in the blue tights to justify the name of the movie, and the money he was paid.The introduction credits are case in point, but I am more offended by the skit in which Gus is drunk and operating the computer. You know the scene, where the guy at the ATM keeps getting all that money and starts stuffing down his pants, the old dude stuffs an orange or a lemon or something into his wife's face (well she was annoying). However the worst part of this sequence was the part in which the lights go bung and the red (or stop) light man starts fighting the green (or walk) light.I swear on my left foot, and my right one as well if it helps,at this point in the movie, when I was watching this movie when I was 7 or 8, I thought I had accidentally changed the channel or dosed off for an hour and not noticed, because I was convinced I was not watching a Superman movie. I swear.As everyone else says, the bad guys sucked, the love story sucked, Reeve was great, the effects were the same, he story sucked, except for one part which was gold.The bad Superman idea was gold, GOLD. So good I consider the Superman vs Superman scene as the best in any of the Superman movies. I just wish the rest of this movie lived up to this one scene's goldness, yes thats right GOLDNESS.Hang on, don't forget the random scene where Superman blows out the Olympic Candle, a random skit that was made for cheap laughs.

Despite medical advancement, sad stories of an unwanted child from an unwanted pregnancy unfold everywhere, all the time.The excellence of this film is in the way it handles a subject matter that is so common that it's very difficult to touch an average audience, let alone the cynics. And yet, 400 blows tells the story in such a simple, honest way that you will sit up, pay due attention and respect, even if it doesn't break you down in uncontrollable sobs (which can sometimes be achieved through cheap contrivances).Nor does it paint a skewed, one sided picture of a life with nothing but misery for the 12-year-old. There are good moments such as when the family of three goes out to enjoy a movie just as any ordinary family would, as the step father is a reasonable and loving man who treats his acquired son very decently, almost like his own. But it is precisely these good moments that make the bad that much more poignant.There are neither total villains nor complete angels in this film. People are people as we know, that we can identify with, in other words, ordinary. They are often selfish, bullying, despicable, but not without moments of genuine goodwill. Antonie, our 12-year-old protagonist, is how any 12-year-old would be like, capable of mischievous actions but not burdened with the rejected spirit that a life of vicissitudes would have given to an adult. While we may feel sorry for him, he is too young to feel sorry for himself. Most illuminating is the interview with a psychiatrist towards the end of the movie. Observe how he answers all the personal questions in such a matter-of-course, honest way, with no uneasiness or hostility. It is most interesting, and a little ironic, that his innocence is accentuated when he talks about his sexual experience, or rather the lack of which, to be exact. But some of my friends have done it, he hastens to add, a very natural thing to do, to show that he is not entirely ignorant. Then he goes on to talks about an abortive visit to a brothel (when the one prostitute who usually agree it do it with very young boys is just too busy) with the most genuinely innocent smile on his face.It is not seeing what the boy is (a juvenile delinquent, though not a particularly bad one by today's standard) but contemplating what he could have been that breaks the heart.

We currently have in the cinemas the Austen biopic Becoming Jane, and ITV have recently produced three TV movies based on Austen novels. These include Northanger Abbey, the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. No doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. (There is, after all, her juvenile Love and Freindship (sic), the short novella Lady Susan, and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments The Watsons and Sanditon. Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers&#133;&#133;&#133;).The main character is Emma Woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in Regency England. (Not, as some reviewers have assumed, Victorian England- Austen died before Queen Victoria was even born). Emma is, financially, considerably better off than most Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, Robert Martin, believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr Elton. This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as Elton has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in love with Emma herself. The speed with which Emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. This being a Jane Austen plot, Emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications.Emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome Mr Knightley, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage. It does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one (unlike, say, that of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy). Knightley, who is sixteen years older than Emma (she is 21, he 37), and related to her by marriage, is more like a father-figure than a lover. Much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. When Emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend Miss Bates, it is Knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. (His surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam play their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances.Of the other characters, I liked Juliet Stephenson's vulgar Mrs Elton and Toni Collette's Harriet. I know that in the novel Harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character Collette played in Muriel's Wedding- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, fretting about her chances of finding a man. Nevertheless, I felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from Austen's themes.Emma is one of Austen's more light-hearted works, without the darker overtones of Mansfield Park or even Pride and Prejudice, and this is reflected on screen. We see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. Apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who make a very brief appearance, the only poor people we see are Mrs Bates and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverty is relative, not absolute. In Emma's world, poverty is defined as not having your own stately home. This is, of course, not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life, but nobody has ever claimed Austen as the Regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist. Sophisticated romantic comedy, combined with a keen eye for analysing human character, was more in her line.I would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 Sense and Sensibility or the recent Pride and Prejudice- it tends to drag a bit in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highly enjoyable Austen adaptation. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2007","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Emma was a product of what might be called by the First Great Jane Austen Cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on British television, doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the Second Great Jane Austen Cycle which started with Pride and Prejudice two years ago.

It also helps to have the director of The Wrath of Khan back in the chair. This isn't as fast paced as Meyer's previous Trek outing, but remains a classy, respectful closing chapter with the original Trek crew. Nowhere is this better apparent than in the memorable, electrifying scene with Kirk when he blurts out his preference to let the Klingons die. I remember an audible gasp emanate from most of the audience in the theater when I watched this scene back in '91. See, this was real - a sudden vocal admission by a character based on years of recorded adventures, from the 3rd Trek film and many years beforehand, dating back to the original series. It wasn't something out of left field. And it reminded us of something about real heroes - that they aren't gods, flawless; no, usually they're damaged, angry men, with years of hubris and pent-up rage - that they're, well, a lot like the rest of us, really. It's rare to see a real moment such as this captured on film, especially in a supposed science fiction adventure.The music for the beginning credits is noticeably different from the other Trek films, with an ominous quality, as if heading for an uncertain future - and that's the theme of the story. The film proper begins with a bang, as many of the better films do the destruction of the Klingon moon Praxis. We learn that Sulu finally has his own command, on the starship Excelsior (seen in previous Trek films). We then learn that the Klingon Empire is on the verge of collapse, predicted to have 50 years of life left to it. Of course, the story carries blatant parallels to political events of our 20th century, namely the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, the year before this film was released.

Fehr and Smith have a good chemistry together and, to be honest, I wouldn't mind seeing a follow-up with their characters (the movie is somewhat open-ended). They'd have to bring more originality to the table however. If you're really into the teen movies from this era, I'd say check it out. You could do a lot worse.

This is probably J.S. Cardone's best film and more than likely his biggest hit. It borrows a little from better vampire movies and that's where the film suffers. You can tell Cardone was going for a Near Dark vibe and some story elements are exactly the same as John Carpenter's Vampires. In Hitcher fashion, Kerr Smith is driving a car through the desert that must be delivered on time. Because he's short on gas money he picks up hitchhiker\/vampire hunter Brendan Fehr and the movie starts to pick up. Johnathan Schaech leads vampire clan that is after our heroes.
