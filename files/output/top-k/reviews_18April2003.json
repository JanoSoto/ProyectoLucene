After his success on `Platoon' which he won an Oscar for, this is a brilliant follow-up. Giving the rather complicated subject matter, this isn't one for those with short attention spans. But if you want something complex, then this is the one for you.The script is well timed and consistent over the two-hour plus running time. The directing styles are typical of Stone's earlier work, and there are even some nice camera angles and appropriate cinematography. For the most part of the film, there is no soundtrack and no music plays. This adds to the documentary atmosphere and increases the overall effect. The film opens to a beautiful montage of a Manhattan morning showing `suit-and-ties' on their way to work on a typical day. The cast is on top form aswell. Charlie Sheen is sufficient as the naïve rookie learning the tricks of the trade. He's better and more comfortable at comedy (Spin City) but he still does a good job. Giving he's third credited, Martin Sheen doesn't receive much of the limelight and doesn't have many scenes. Nonetheless, he proves that he can play American President Jed Bartlet and a mundane factory worker with equal oomph. But Michael Douglas steals the show and shows tremendous colour as the corrupt, backstabbing corporate shark, Gordon Gekko. He was well deserving of the Oscar he won for his performance. Daryl Hannah isn't a very good actress and she was a bad choice in this film. While she does an average job of her part, it could have been done so much better. In her second time working with Daryl Hannah, (Blade Runner) Sean Young is adequate as Gekko's wife. The rest of the supporting players include James Spader, Terence Stamp, Saul Rubineck, Hal Holbrook and John C. McGinley. They don't give award-winning performances, but they're good as the `decorations' that hold the film together. Perhaps in some scenes, `Wall Street' is a bit too techno-talk, mumbo-jumbo but that aside, all of the good things are hard to ignore. The film amounts to a tough-but-fair, but overall satisfying conclusion, which was probably the best way to go. The film that shattered the American Dream, `Wall Street' is another great film from Oliver Stone. It's a real 80's classic and one that lives up to its hype. I give it 7.6\/10.

It has great actors, a great director, and a pretty good plot...and it came off pretty good, but somehow, not great. There is something about the movie you just can't warm up to, and it's pretty evident while you watch the film.Al Pacino plays a detective sent to Alaska, along with his partner, to investigate into the death of a young woman. When he gets there, he begins a search on a foggy day, where he spots the killer and gives chase. Through the fog, Pacino mistakes his partner for the killer, and fires his weapon, killing him. Thinking no one saw this, Pacino files a case that the killer shot his partner and Pacino came upon the body. He disposes of all evidence and begins to search for the killer once more. Until he gets a call.The killer of the woman is on the phone, saying that he saw the whole thing from yesterday and that he saw Pacino shoot his partner. Now the killer (Robin Williams) has something to hold against Pacino (although the whole idea of the killer having something against him seems to wither away quite quickly).Insomnia is the next film from Memento director Christopher Nolan. He's a talented director, and Memento is one of my favorites (perhaps), so you come to expect a certain amount of talent from the director's next film. Well, he does a good job here, but unlike Memento, we can't really care about the characters as much. As the end unfolded, I found myself not really caring about Pacino's character anymore. Quite frankly, I wanted it all to end. It is a bit too long for its own good, because the plot, characters and dialogue becomes worn after a while.Al Pacino is one of the best actors out there; you think of gangster films, you think Brando, De Niro, and Pacino. But Al has proven he can play more than Al Capone and Michael Corleone, and while he gives a good performance here, he doesn't seem quite thrilled that he is in the movie. Granted, the idea is that the detective can get no sleep, but he acts drowsy from the beginning on. A sign of great acting, or a sign of regret?Robin Williams has been, apparently, trying to prove that he can act drama. Good Will Hunting, What Dreams May Come, One Hour Photo. Quite frankly, I miss the funny Robin Williams. The funny Robin Williams that made us laugh in so many films and practically made (in terms of saving) such films as Jumanji and Hook--underrated films that I enjoyed. I didn't care for Good Will Hunting very much, and What Dreams May Come was just plain weird.

However the new recruit is Danny Wallace, a white officer who requested the squad.  Wallace soon learns that he must stick close to Chen to survive in Chinatown and Chen both dislikes his new colleague and wants to protect him from the way the police must do their work.  However when Wallace is approached by Henry Lee with information, everything goes from black and white to grey.They say it is a sin to waste things, so Hollywood must be already condemned by an angry God for the useless ways they have used Chow Yun-Fat since he came from Hong Kong.  Out of all the American films he has done there are few that really get close to using him well &#150; this is the reason that I really enjoyed The Corrupter, he is really good here.The plot is, on the surface, a standard cop tale of right and wrong with the rookie cop battling between what works and what is right.  This works in it's own right and has enough little twists to deliver a solid thriller.  However beneath this is the strong relationship between Wallace and Chen.  Chow has been in plenty of films where two male leads have developed a strong, complex relationship to a background of violence (The Killer or A Better Tomorrow for example) and, although this isn't as good as those, it is in that tradition.  The dynamic between the two men and the silent battle for each other's soul is what makes this stronger than the plot synopsis would suggest.I saw this in the cinema years ago and it came across as an OK thriller.  When I watched it again last night I realised how much more there is to it and how much more involving it is than so many cop thrillers with similar plots.  After the Replacement Killers tried to keep Chow doing Woo-style action films, this film was much more standard fare.  The film is framed in Oriental flavour and we still have the traditional gun battles and two-handed gun play, however here they are a lot more sparingly used.  Also the action is unexpectedly violent &#150; not just choreographed but quite close to home with bystanders getting caught up.Although much of the strength comes from the script Chow is the perfect man to bring out the male relationship stuff and the complexity of the lead role.  His English here is excellent and he is riveting in the lead role.  He easily steals every scene he is in and brings so very much to his character.  Walberg is also pretty good &#150; keeping his character complex as well, however he is simply second best to Chow who is far and away the driving force behind every scene he is in.  The support cast all do well and are mostly recognisable faces playing the same sort of roles they usually do in this sort of film. In fact Kim Chan (who plays crime lord Uncle Benny here) may even be playing the same character he played in Lethal Weapon 4 (where he played crime lord Uncle Benny) were it not for a different surname!Overall this is a solid film.  Anyone hoping for a blazing action movie will be let down, but those looking for a good cop thriller that has emphasis on character would do well to watch this.

I had intended on seeing it for several years, but hadn't. After seeing Moulin Rouge and absolutely loving it, my interested was further peaked.  I finally had the opportunity to watch it tonite and I'm almost wishing I hadn't, because now the mystique is gone for me.Baz is famous for his flashiness, his incredible use of color and spectacle to tell his stories.  This movie had plenty of that, which I appreciated greatly.  While I am normally drawn to more subtle dramas I always welcome a diversion from that genre, and this did not disappoint.  One can tell from this production that Baz is involved in the theater because it could (and may very well have) been a musical production on the stage.  I enjoyed the quick pace and some interesting camera angles - it was interesting to see the advent of his unconventional cinematography, something I admired in Moulin Rouge.**SPOILER ALERT**Throughout the film, however, I was conflicted as to whether this movie was done with tongue firmly in cheek, or if it was supposed to be some kind of fairy tale.  Regardless, I found myself rolling my eyes during a couple of parts, especially the ending.  I kept thinking, why would Fran go back? Why would the dance partner who had been dumped several times at that point help out at the end?  What was up with the slapsticky fight scenes at the end? Why would everyone in the audience just decide that they Gotta Dance!I know, I'm looking too much into this film. I should just look at the pretty colors, be awed at the dancing and forget about the plot holes. In that spirit, I'll just have to remember that the next time I have a conflict with a future boyfriend's father I just need to let him teach me how to dance and I'm his honorary daughter-in-law forever.Having just bashed the heck out of it, I do have to say that in the moments I wasn't looking over at the book I had laying next to me, wishing I was reading it at that point, I was trying to figure out what movies this reminded me of.  The characters called to mind a couple of movies  The weird, psychotic mom was something out of A Clockwork Orange, a few of the weird looking minor characters were reminiscent of the Soundgarden video Black Hole Sun, the creepy but cool dad had Crispin Glover written all over him and the rest of the teased and primped characters (women AND men, unfortunately) were straight out of a John Waters movie.  Which made me feel like watching Pink Flamingos again.One scene I would like to commend Baz for was the bizarre flashback\/dancing scene between Scott's parents.  The ghoulish makeup, exaggerated gestures and weird blocking called to mind the scene in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet where Dean Stockwell sings his ditty into the lightbulb.  It was a very entertaining scene and pretty much saved me from turning the movie off.I can see how much Baz has grown since making this film, and the only reason why I'm not completely trashing it is because it was his first effort. One thing I have come to expect from a Baz Luhrmann film is that I'm going to be elated, wrapped up in the spectacle and then suddenly feel like I've been punched in the gut.  I guess he started that after this movie, because while I didn't quite feel punched in the gut (in a bad way, not in the aforementioned good way) I felt empty after seeing this film.  I would give it about 2 1\/2 out of 5 stars, and that's only because of its quirkiness and because I'm biased toward succeeding films.--Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 2003","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm sitting here a little confused as to what I think about this movie.

If you like him then this should be OK.  For the rest of us who fall somewhere in the `indifferent' camp, then this is passable but not much more than that.  To discuss plot is unfair as that is not what this film is about.  However some degree of narrative would have been nice.  Beyond this the film becomes a series of little sketches with a common theme. Of these, some work well and some don't.  There is just about enough off-beat, imaginative humour to keep the film going.  The majority of the scenes are amusing in a weird way, some are laugh out loud funny and some just don't work and drag a bit.  Even if your sense of humour is this way inclined it may be a little thin to satisfy.Reubens is OK, doing his usual camp clowning thing in that same suit.  I don't dislike him and found him funny when he was in a good scene.  Kris Kristofferson is simply a novelty here, he has nothing of substance to do other than be a famous face in a film.  Golino is pretty but doesn't have much humour to bring. The potentially funniest character was the pig, but he didn't get anywhere near enough in the way of lines.Overall this is one for fans, but those who are OK with Herman's humour may get a few laughs.  However, for many, this will be just amusing and may not be worth spending 90 minutes on.

It has been a long time ---at least since the 1940s that the Disney Corporation has chosen such a direction and it works so well here.  The lush colours and the lack of details (which reminded me more of the latest selection from the Legend of Zelda than it does of Disney) was refreshing. Also bold was the setting --- science fiction is very a-typical of tradional Disney fare).  The characters were also different as is the direction of the plot.  I almost expected a different ending to this picture but Disney remained true to its traditions --- at least in this one respect. Although this film might be seen in the future as perhaps the death knell of cell productions, (and I hope this is not the trend) what a masterful close to an era it makes.

I didn't like it at first, but have grown to really appreciate it, having begun to understand a little more about the character Somerset as somewhat of a modern-day Joe Friday (I realized it was deliberate when I saw his office # is Joe Friday's badge number).I liked the Game.So, when Panic Room came out, I expected I'd like it too. Au contraire.Sorry folks, but there were far too many times my wife and I had to say out loud that's so dumb. Granted, I don't know how sharp I'd be under such stress, but have you ever noticed how people in movies live as though they've never watched a movie in their lives? We all sit in a theatre and say you know how in movies this happens? Don't do this but people in movies seem to have never seen a movie, so they don't know NOT to do it.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD Among the many things that totally destroyed the credibility hence the tension in the film is the scene where the husband shows up. First of all, the man with the plan thinks he can just say sorry things didn't work out fellas, I'm outta here and literally just walk out the front door. Obviously, he doesn't understand the psychology of crime.But, as the remaining two are arguing, the husband is standing at the door...he claims his wife's call scared the sh-- out of him and he did call the cops...but as scared as he claims to have been, he certainly didn't do the smart thing and wait for the cops (who, for so many to show up at the end, seem to take a long time in getting there). Anyway, if he really was scared, why not show him peaking from a corner of the doorway? Naturally, he'd see all the blood right where he was standing, surely he'd be bright enough to understand that something is going down, stay in the shadows, call the cops again on his cell phone and say hey man, lotsa blood, get here quick but no - he's got to stand straight up in the middle of the door frame, asking nay begging for what was coming to him.Damn stupid.And, for the record, I expect that Jodie Foster is a tad petite to really haul around a sledge hammer, but if adrenaline has given her that lift-car-off-daughter strength, then a guy who gets hit with said sledge hammer, AND then falls headlong down a storey who has already had his hand crushed by a steel door that's 4 inches thick, just doesn't get up and physically beat up anyone. Sorry. Stupid.Can anyone tell me why Raoul was even there? And, why the gun? Whitaker's character had all the brains of the operation, and no one was supposed to even be there, so two guys could easily have walked in (as they did) and taken care of business.Back to the psychology of crime for a moment. From the first demonstration of what kind of guy Raoul was, my thought was they oughtta shoot him, he's out of control. SPOILERS HERE - truth be told, Whitaker ultimately did have to shoot him. Crime psych says when planning an operation, you calculate the odds of certain things happening and decide before they happen what your course of action would be. This helps you by providing both a clearer rational mind not bent by the stress of being in the situation PLUS the advantage of having the opportunity to procure resources to support any possible decisions you had planned that you might have to make. You want as few variables as possible, constants are what you want to work with. Whitaker should have stuck with his first reaction to people in the place by indeed walking out.Anyway, an out-of-control teammate threatens your chances of success, so they must be removed from the situation. Bottom line, had Whitaker removed Raoul earlier, they'd probably have  gotten away with it. As it stands, Whitaker was on his way to freedom and a morality attack brought him back inside, where he finally dealt with Raoul, but at what cost to him? Eliminate variables when you are in control, not when things are out of control.

It stereotypes them (such as the Indian ice cream vendor), and it satirises them, but it doesn't hate them, least of all its main character. Crude though it is, its good nature is a plus - alas, the real problem with the movie is that it's so sloppily written that its potential is for the most part left there; you've got a biker gang, you've got a Fabio-led cult (whose members are all called Todd or Lorraine), you've got Stacy Keibler mud-wrestling, you've got a carnival of freaks led by Verne Troyer, you've got a pair of pensionable twins squabbling over a woman, you've got a race to a wedding... but whereas something like Dude, Where's My Car? manages to handle all this without it turning into a mess, everything just winds up going around in circles like a decapitated chicken. Nice as it is to see clips of Land of the Lost on TV (our hero and his beloved both enjoy that show), Bubble Boy is the kind of movie that thinks setting a diner on fire and then dropping Disco Inferno on the soundtrack is clever. Plus, it's almost never funny - and that's the most offensive thing about this movie.

I wondered what all the hype was about. I rented the original trilogy months before The Phantom Menace was released. I liked it very much even though I thought it was a little cheesy and I alredy knew that Darth Vader was Lukes father. But i fell in love with the mythological aspect of the movie.I will never forget the summer of 1999, the summer of Star Wars. My two best friends and I raced to the movie theatre after school on May 16 and sat down to watch Episode 1. I could barely contain myself. The movie finished and I walked out of the theatre with mixed feelings about it. Something was missing. The mythological aspect was not present, in fact almost absent. Nevertheless I enjoyed the movie. I saw the movie two more times in theatres, bought it on VHS and now own it on DVD. I've probably seen it about thirty times by now, and have reached a few conclusions.Q. How does one make a movie to which there is already an ending?A. Stick to the original plan. When George Lucas first planned out his original 6 episode saga. I'm sure that the ending was the best (like in all great stories). Thus, Episode 1 is merely a building block. The story and characters are all part of something bigger. But of course, we're not suppose to know that. Anikin's destiny is not spelled out, unlike Luke's destiny.Q. Why did George Lucas decide to tell his story through political conflicts and not through mythology? Good vs Evil.A. I think the real question is, How does good become evil? I was expecting Anikin to be a poor orphan child clouded in mystery. But, then why would Qui-Gon Jinn want to train such a troubled boy. George Lucas is telling his story as if we have never seen the original trilogy. Therefore we would all assume that Anikin will turn out alright and everyone will be happy. Nothing in the prequel trilogy is black and white. There is no big Evil in Episode 1. It is merely an evil phantom's menace in a civilized era. And like any civilized era, it has its political conflicts.To me the two biggest flaws in this movie were that Anikin did not seem to have a real relationship with his mother and that we were never presented a historical background on the Sith. I really would have wanted to see more Darth Maul, he wastes no time on words. The ending duel is my favorite fight scene of all time.Anyone who blames Jar Jar for their inability to enjoy the movie, obviously doesn't understand much of anything. I am also sick and tired of hearing people say that the special effects aren't good enough. Show me one movie with better special effects.I love this movie even though it could have been better.

Sobinski is colorless. There is a disgusting scene at the end when the two Germans jump out of the plane, following the order of the Fuhrer. What a poor, cheap joke. And even that is topped two minutes later, when for no other reason then to get another cheap laugh, Bronski has to parachute out of the plane, so that one poor peasant can say First Hess, now him.Having said that you can get a rough idea how brilliant this film must be when I tell you that it is easily the best film ever made! Not only best comedy, but best period. Beating in my personal list GWTW, Thief of Bagdad, Taxi Driver. Lets dive into it. First of all there is this daring concept of having a Polish theater group in the middle of the Great War outwitting their oppressors. We have a great tight story that is much more than just a vehicle to transport jokes or funny scenes. You could make a very suspenseful spy thriller out of the plot. Then there is this terrific cast, Jack Benny who needed only this one film to achieve immortality, beautiful Carol Lombard who had the task of playing the faithful wife to the great actor Joseph Tura and at the same time being just believably enough attracted to this guy who is able to drop a couple of tons of bombs. Stack of course, must be colorless, since what we do not need in this story is any serious lover's triangle. Bressart is great, Sig Ruman is just unable of being not hilariously funny and here he can give us the performance of his life. Even the tiniest role is played by an acting genius. Lional Atwill as Rawich is perhaps the one that deserves in this cast of giants a special mentioning, because the way he portrays the actor who just cannot stop overacting is alone worth watching the film half a dozen times. But most of all To be or Not to Be is funny. There are a number of running gags that have never been topped in the history of film comedy. The Schultz thing, the joke on the Hitler ending up as a cheese joke and of course the Hamlet gag. But best of all Concentration Camp Erhardt. So far I could always resist (or I chickened out) but one of these days I will sit in row two of a Hamlet performance and I will leave at the start of the monologue. The highlight of the film is the scene when Benny\/Tura is confronted with dead Professor Siletzky the guy he is just impersonating. Even after having seen this film at least 30 times it still makes me marvel how they could come up with that. My favorite scene though is right at the beginning, when Tura tells his wife that for the next play he has thought that her name should appear above his own.And she says Oh, darling, that is so sweet of you. But of course, I do not care. He says That is what we thought. So we won't do it. And she says Oh. Not more. But this little scene is enough to set the mood for the entire film and it tells us all we need to know about their marriage. By the way, this scene is even funnier in the German version. Maybe it is just that I only recently had the chance of watching the Original (thanks DVD makers) but I really think the German adds something to it. Especially the off-voice at the beginning Lubinski, Kubinski... is more relaxed than the original and fits the mood of the film much better. And there is a great alliteration in German Welcher widrige Wind... I could ramble on forever. But now is the time to just sit back and enjoy the film once again.

This rescue was the key to Vincent's attitude and the brothers' estrangement. Up until then Vincent was in his place as the underdog; resentful (because he was the older of the two but still weaker), but accepting (in his place). When the rescue occurs, everything changes. Vincent has proven to himself that he isn't deserving of his status as inferior and Anton would have never been able to accept that his 'weaker' brother had to rescue him. This new order of things could have drove the brother's apart, which would have better explained why Vincent leaves home... So why not focus more time on this 'post rescue' conflict?2) I thought right from the beginning of the murder investigation that Anton, recognizing his brother as the suspect, would try to throw the street wise detective Hugo off track.

That fact is another (very frustrating) thing altogether and I was a bit disappointed that the film seemed to take so many shortcuts just to reach a tidy conclusion in the allotted time...sluggo  ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"18 April 2003","score":"21 out of 28 people found the following review useful","review":"  While many horror movies have strong doses of humour in them (from 'Bride Of Frankenstein' to 'Dawn Of The Dead', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to 'From Dusk Til Dawn'), there's very few actual horror-comedies I enjoy. 'Motel Hell' is one exception, Frank Henenlotter's movies, especially 'Frankenhooker' are others, but to my mind Stuart Gordon's 'Re-Animator' is by far the most original and entertaining one ever made in my opinion. This movie put Gordon on the map and also made Jeffrey Combs into a worldwide cult figure. Combs is absolutely brilliant as Herbert West, one of the most memorable mad scientists in horror history, and the rest of the supporting cast - Bruce Abbott, David Gale, and the lovely Barbara Crampton - are all excellent. Gordon uses H.P. Lovecraft's West stories as a jumping off point for some grotesque and genuinely funny moments that once seen are never forgotten, particularly THAT scene between Crampton and Gale, which is now the stuff of legend, though beware it is cut from some versions of the movie. Make sure you see the uncut version of 'Re-Animator' whatever you do! Gordon went on to make some other Lovecraft adaptations, some good, some not so good, but 'Re-Animator' was the first and is still in my opinion the best. Highly recommended fun which gets better and better as the years go by! This movie is an unquestionable horror classic!

The plot is that a plane is hijacked by terrorists with DZ-5. Problem is, the plane's in the air, and they can't let it land (they might use the DZ-5). What do you do? Well, you could blow the plane out of the sky or, as Seagal suggests, go up in an aircraft (built by Oliver Platt)that can dock onto the aircraft, and smuggle Seagal's army unit on board. The unit also brings Dr. Grant (Kurt Russell) to keep an eye on the lead terrorist's (David Suchet). However, this plan goes rather badly, and ends up with half the equipment and without a leader. Now Grant has to help the unit by leading the team (John Leguizamo & Joe Morton, among others) while getting help from a flight attendant (a pre-famous Halle Berry). The tension rides high this thriller, that plays better than any Jack Ryan movie. As a bonus, Seagal is sucked out of dock in mid-air, 40 minutes in. How good is that!
