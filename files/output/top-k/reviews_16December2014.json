[{"date":"16 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Innovative Elements The MatrixComputer programmer by day and computer hacker by night Neo, played by actor Keanu Reeves, is led down a path to discover what the matrix really is. With the help of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and a rag tag team of computer hackers, Neo makes a choice to seek the truth. This Sci-Fi action thriller is full of mind-bending chases, gravity-defying action, and kung-fu-packed fight scenes that blow your mind time and time again. Neo is contacted by a mysterious message that appears on his computer asking, Do you want to know what the matrix is? As he is following clues to the truth, the path becomes shaky, and he does not know if he is dreaming or awake along the way. Neo eventually discovers the answer, and the dream quickly becomes reality&#x97;a reality leaving Neo wondering if he really wanted to know the truth. The Matrix was filmed using a dark green filter, creating an eerie ambiance that contributes to the mystery behind Matrix. The main setting for the movie takes place in the dark side of New York's grimy subways, back alleys, and abandoned buildings. The New York backdrop makes for some great chase scenes with characters ducking in and out of buildings, leaping across rooftops, through apartment buildings, and down fire escapes. The movie is full of groundbreaking special effects that set the stage for what we see in movies today. The director uses multiple cameras, slow motion effects, computer-generated imagery, and the help of guide wires to create an out-of-this-world experience that defies physics. The tone of bad-assery is set in the opening scene where the character Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) has been captured by the police, but not for long. She explodes into the air, and the frame is frozen; the camera circles around her creating a 180-degree swooping effect before she unleashes a furious kick to one of the cop's chest and sends him flying into the wall. In another scene, Neo dodges three bullets with an incredible back bend. The scene is in slow motion, and the viewer is able to see the bullets ripple in the air, embellishing Neo's prowess as the Chosen One. The high-action fight scenes are full of gravity-defying maneuvers that to the viewer are made believable because of the amazing special effects. The Matrix was a stepping stone for modern-day special effects; compared to today's standard, they seem a little slower and not quite as polished, but it's important to recognize how cutting edge this movie was for 1999. The camera work throughout is amazing, as multiple views and cameras are used throughout the whole film. This is one of the main ingredients in creating drama, suspense, and unbelievable action. The scenes are all well thought out with meticulous attention to detail. One scene in particular, where Neo is asked to take the red pill or to take the blue pill, takes place in the reflection of Morpheus' sunglasses. You are able to see both of Morpheus' hands&#x97;one holding the red pill in the right sunglass lens, one holding the blue pill in the left sunglass lens, while Neo debates his choice&#x97;all in the reflection of Morpheus' glasses. The film is full of these little details and camera tricks that paved the way for movies today. Though the movie is fast paced, it is also long and at times hard to follow. If one doesn't have patience, or does not particularly like science fiction, this movie might not be the best choice. As in most sci-fi or action movies, the dialog can at times be a little cheesy, and the viewer might find some of the acting a little over the top. If you have been passing on The Matrix, its time you stop. The choreography and setting dance hand in hand to a techno-driven soundtrack that never skips a beat. This film is packed with action and backed by a complex story that leaves the viewer anticipating the sequel. Be prepared for your mind to be blown! This classic is cutting edge for its time, crossing multiple genres and delivering on all levels. The Matrix leaves the viewer thirsty for answers and questioning existence.

I must first say that much of this adoration comes from the beautifully sinister score by Mr. Goldsmith, and, as I very recently learned, a piece from Romance by Howard Hanson. This became Ripley's theme of defeating the Alien at the end of the film. But I also love Sigourney Weaver, who will always be Ripley. If they dare to remake this film, I won't go see it. We need to learn to quit needing to remake everything and accept the classics as they are, products of their time. I am sick to death of CGI. This film is a real classic, directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, and its cast includes Tom Skerrit as the temperamental and not-so- sensible Capt. Dallas, John Hurt as the tragic Kane, Veronica Cartwright as yes, the weepy but understandably terrified Lambert, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett, a mechanic of few words, Ian Holm as Ash, the science officer, the incomparable Yaphet Kotto as Parker, who was somewhat of a comic relief for a while here, and then went on to an amazing dramatic career, and last but not least, Jonesy (I'm a cat lover, OK?)The story is simple...a space towtruck called the Nostromo is lured by a signal to a small planet to investigate. They wouldn't bother. They are only a commercial civilian vessel after all, but their employers have ordered them to investigate via Mother their ship's computer. You know the rest, or if you don't, you need to watch this peerless film. Then follow it up with ALIENS, the impeccably acted but disappointing ALIEN 3 (mainly due to the fact that they killed off Michael Biehn! Rackin Frackin critters at 20th Century Fox!!!), and the surprisingly good ALIEN RESURRECTION.
