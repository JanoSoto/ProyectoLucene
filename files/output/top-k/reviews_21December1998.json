It is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced before.  It's a movie that I hold dear to my heart and will never forget.  I have to be honest though, the first time I saw this movie, I really didn't like it at all.  The story was too confusing, and the characters were extremely weird and twisted.  After watching it a second and third time, however, I understood what was going on more, and could spend more time looking at the visuals rather than the subtitles.  Speaking of visuals, this movie has it in spades.  The environment that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created is out of this world.  The city is very dark and the water looks as if there are secrets hidden within.  The mood the soundtrack sets is perfect for the scenery and the superb acting by everybody (including the kids) just adds to the greatness of this flick.  I highly recommend this movie, it's one of those movies that you will never forget watching, and the images will stay in your head for a very long time.

Getting pressure from Jonathan to make moves on her, Sandy does, and eventually Susan responds. This gets Jonathan interested in Susan, too. Susan puts out for Jonathan before Sandy, and since Jonathan has to tell he just got laid, Jonathan also has to tell Sandy not to tell Susan. When Sandy first asks Jonathan his girlfriends name, it leads to the funniest line in the movie...Myrtle! Jonathan and Susan stop seeing each other because the jealousy begins too much of a burden for both of them, and let's face it, Jonathan was only using her for sex in the first place.Female Ice Skater in White on the Central Park rink represents a lapse in time..insert that now...Jonathan meets Bobbie (A-M) who is unbelievably built but that bastard Jonathan STILL doesn't appreciate her cause she's doesn't have a PERFECT something-or-other. Bobbie and Jonathan soon begin a malignant relationship based on dependence, disrespect and drama (the Three D's) and it gets worse and worse every scene. Meanwhile Jonathan has married Susan, who you never see following the first appearance of the Female Ice Skater in White. But soon Jonathan wants to cheat on Susan, and gets a woman named Cindy who looks like her female part have little teeth on them as to cut off if you dare penetrate her.I've only gone over some of what happens.

I love even small moments like the way she carries her and Jack's dinner into their bedroom on a tray, remembering to bring napkins and the salt and pepper. Then when Jonathan and Sandy and Cindy are playing tennis on the roof of their apartment building, she's sitting there in a big coat and a kerchief, reading a magazine like she's having an internal breakdown, and when Jonathan puts her down once again, how she turns around and lights a cigarette. You never see anyone play tennis, you just hear it - the camera is on Cindy and Bobbie the whole time. That's what's so great, you don't often see who's talking. The camera is at times where it wouldn't be were a conventional director in charge. Nichols isn't playing tricks, he just makes it all .. fascinating.

They have also succeeded in giving him a very vividly drawn personality-- you really root for him and it's almost hard to believe that he's just a special effect and not a living being. Kids will fall in LOVE with him-- and the charming notion, presented in the movie, of being best friends with a 15-foot Gorilla.The first trailers I saw for this made it look like an action movie, but the current trailers make it look like a heartwarming, Free Willy-Type of film. It really does both, but without being too sweet. Many people in my audience cried and cheered at the end. I hope this film does well and I would love to see a sequel.
