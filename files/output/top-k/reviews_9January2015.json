The first time I saw BE, I was at a loss of words... speechless. I was moved -and trust me, I'm not one to be moved by romantic films-. The acting, direction, soundtrack, were superb. But in the end I thought maybe I'm a bit influenced, and I can't be objective enough, so I had a second view of the film. Trust me it gets better on a second view.MINOR SPOILERS (nothing key revealed)The first time you don't know what's going on, especially the first scene at the coffee house, the pat on her shoulder given by Alec, and the next one when Laura's riding the train. Those things you don't get in the beginning. You can guess or speculate, but it's better not to; let the film drive you through Laura's story. This first time, you create empathy with the characters... right until the endOn the second viewing you know EXACTLY what happened... and the speculation you had during the first viewing is not there anymore. You correctly note that the movie begins paying no attention to Alec and Laura AT ALL while they're sitting on the corner and the lousy lady keeps talking, but YOU KNOW they are there and YOU KNOW what are they talking about. Simply put, YOU KNOW what they are going through. This first scene, which the first time you saw it meant nothing to you, now means A WHOLE LOT ! The second scene, which the first time you saw it had you wondering why Laura wished that lady to die or shut up, now makes sense.This applies for the rest of the film.Of course, I still had doubts and days later, I watched BE a third time.MAJOR SPOILERS (you shouldn't read)The third time you can objectively pay attention to the characters, the scenery, the music, and every single detail. Key moments from the film that really got me1) When Alec misses meeting Laura that second Thursday and they rush to the train station. While he's on the train he yells at her Thursday? (as in, see you next Thursday), and she says yes2) When they are driving on the rented car, she says I lit cigarettes for him... (as in, it felt pointless and hurtful)3) The farewell (the one at the end), when he just puts his hand on her shoulder and just walks away. Gosh, the look on her face, she's so devastated.4) Seconds later, when she dreams of Alec not getting on his train and coming back. Again, her expression is so hopeless.5) When Alec says I know that this is the beginning of the end6) When Laura says I had no thoughts at all, only an overwhelming desire not to feel anything ever againI could go on, as I think I'm missing a few more. My point is, it is moments like these the ones that weigh favorably for the film.END SPOILERSMost people say Casablanca or Gone with the wind are the most romantic films ever. I was one of them, until I saw BE. While Casablanca and GWTW are legendary films, they have been degraded to a second position in my book. You see... when you watch Casablanca, yes, the plot is great, the acting is great, the music, the feel, but in the end, I still have the feeling that I'm watching Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in a Morroco based film. Same for GWTW; I can't help but relate to Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh. I feel that Casablanca and GWTW are kind of more Hollywood-ish films, with the happy or nostalgic ending. I'm still left with the taste in my mouth that I had just watched a movie. This doesn't happen with BE.With BE, the first thing that pops in your mind should be who are these guys? are they even actors? It just so happens they are. In fact, they are so good, you forget you're watching a film, and instead you start thinking you are watching a story. Trevor Howard is just phenomenal and terrific as Alec, but hands down Celia Johnson is the one who nails Laura to perfection.

It is a movie for kids of all ages, from two to 92. This 1964 movie was the biggest project that Walt Disney and his studio had ever tackled. It was the first big Disney live action fantasy produced as a musical. And, it was a smashing success. What's not to like about this film? It has much to enjoy, from the music, dance routines, animated sequences, fantasy special effects, and an amusing story with a message. All of the cast excel in this film. Much ado has been made about Dick Van Dyke's poor rendition of a Cockney accent. He slips in and out of it at times. It's quite obvious, but I think way too much is made of it. For a serious film or drama that would be a major detraction. But this is a film that has much whimsy, fantasy and fun in it. And, consider the rest of his character and performance. He has some good singing and comedic sequences and his dance routines are outstanding. He gives an excellent overall portrayal of Bert, and is hilarious in a second role as Mr. Dawes Senior. But for his poor Cockney accent, Van Dyke might have earned an Oscar nomination. David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, the rest of the adult actors and the kids all give very good performances. Much more should be said about Julie Andrews. Before 1964, she had appeared only in a few TV movies and series. Her lead in Mary Poppins firmly established her as a movie star. Andrews was a talented actress who later played in dramatic roles and mystery-action films. But, she was most known and loved for her singing in musicals. Four of her films will likely keep Andrews in the spotlight for the next few generations. Besides Mary Poppins, she made Cinderella, The Sound of Music and Thoroughly Modern Millie. This film competed with a host of excellent films in the 1964 Academy Awards. It won five Oscars and had eight more nominations. My Fair Lady took eight Oscars, including best picture and best actor (Rex Harrison). Among those won by Mary Poppins were best actress for Julie Andrews (see more about that below) and two Oscars for music. Richard and Robert Sherman wrote and composed all the music and songs for Mary Poppins. The Sherman Brothers worked many years for Disney and produced some of the best and most popular whimsical songs of filmdom. Three of their songs from this film became popular tunes Chim Chim Cher-ee, A Spoonful of Sugar, and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.I enjoyed watching this film again after so many years; and one of the pluses on the DVD I bought is the background video it has about the movie. It includes a snippet from the 1964 Academy Awards. Andrews had starred in the stage production of My Fair Lady, and wanted to get the part in that movie. But Warner Brothers was wary of trying a relatively new actress for a major film and instead chose Audrey Hepburn for its lead. Hepburn was excellent in her role, but it was Andrews who won the best actress Oscar that year. In her acceptance speech, she complimented Warner Brothers for its excellent movie and thanked Jack Warner for his casting choice (which led to her getting the Mary Poppins lead instead, and the Oscar). The audience burst out in laughter and the camera panned to Jack Warner who was laughing harder than most. Finally, something should be said about the difficulty in the making of this film. It is based on the first of a series of Mary Poppins books written by Pamela J. Travers. She was born and raised in Australia as Helen Lyndon Goff. She later adopted her pen name and moved to Great Britain. Three years after her first book was printed, Walt Disney tried to obtain the movie rights. But Travers rejected his offer. He tried again a number of times over the years, and it was only in 1963 that he was able to get Travers to acquiesce. She did so with many strings attached, including her right to change the script and other aspects of the production. In the end, she is said to have not liked the film at all. The controversy was over her renditions of characters as she remembered them, and over the musical score and songs for the movie. One can appreciate an author's desire for accurate portrayals of characters from her work; but in this case Disney wanted to produce a musical fantasy from a fairy tale. Thus, it was something else entirely, but based on her stories. Many movies are produced that are based on or inspired by books, but changes often are made of necessity to make them more interesting and appealing to audiences. Another English author a few years ago wrote a screenplay based on the Travers-Disney spats over producing Mary Poppins. Kelly Marcel approached Disney studios about making the film, and it wound up as a movie in 2013. Saving Mr. Banks starred Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson as Disney and Travers. Of all the live-action musicals produced by 2015, very few had larger box office takes than Mary Poppins. Chicago in 2002 holds the record with $171 million in theater gross, followed by The Sound of Music from 1967 with $163 million. Mary Poppins had $102 million in 1964. Converted to 2014 dollars, the box office take for Chicago would be $224 million, for Mary Poppins it would be $777 million, and that of The Sound of Music would be $1.2 billion.

Chicago in 2002 holds the record with $171 million in theater gross, followed by The Sound of Music from 1967 with $163 million. Mary Poppins had $102 million in 1964. Converted to 2014 dollars, the box office take for Chicago would be $224 million, for Mary Poppins it would be $777 million, and that of The Sound of Music would be $1.2 billion.

His 'dollars' trilogy made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity and pointed the way to newer, grittier westerns. And My name is Nobody was both a fitting tribute to and subtle mockery of the genre. But for his final work he moved into another traditional American medium, the gangster film. It was largely overlooked, both because of its original three hour and forty minute runtime, and a pathetic theatrical version that cut it almost in half. This is a real shame, because Once Upon a Time in America is one of the best gangster movies I've seen, almost on par with the Godfather.The film follows Noodles (Robert De Niro) a former Jewish mobster who's returned to New York after thirty-five years on the lam. He's been drawn by a cryptic message suggesting that someone knows who he is, and what he's done. While he seeks answers and catches up with old friends in the present, flashbacks take us back to the twenties, when Noodles, his buddy Max, and a couple of friends not even out of grammar school banded together to make some money, stick it to the man, and earn a name for themselves in the underworld. The flashbacks then proceed to the thirties, as the boys established themselves as some of the bigger movers and shakers in the Lower East Side, even as Max and Noodles drifted apart, leading to the tragedy that would leave one of them dead, and another on the run.Once Upon a Time in America is by turns comic, nostalgic, and poignant. It's about how a bunch of kids with lousy home lives and no real idea what they were doing rose to the top through luck, friendship, and determination. It's about a face of New York that was gone long before this movie was made, for better and for worse. It's about the price of success and how money comes between friends. And it's about guilt and regrets for past misdeeds, and trying to make amends.For someone born and raised in Italy, Leone has done a superb job of recreating prohibition era Manhattan. The hustle and bustle of peddlers' carts and throngs of people, the children scurrying across rooftops and down alleys, and the cops blowing their whistles and waving their batons are all captured so perfectly that it's as if the director were working from his own memories. And even though Noodles and his friends are up to their ears in shady dealings, and even though the streets are dirty and the neighborhood cop in on the take, it somehow seems simpler, almost wholesome as the boys plot, make promises, and chase girls. Part of me wishes I could have been there.But of course there's nothing wholesome about what they're doing, or what it's doing to them. Within a few years these boys have grown up to become hardened killers. There are murders, beatings, two rapes, and a scene where they nearly set a man on fire before finding out that their organization has switched sides and now he's their friend. Plus there's a death so gruesome it can only be hinted at. And most of this is before the betrayals start and everything comes crashing down.In the present, most of the scenes have a melancholy air, as Noodles walks through a changed city, one that has just enough resemblance to the one he knew to bring back painful memories of choices he made, and opportunities he lost. And when the answers to his questions arrive, it only brings more heartache as we discover that the lies and betrayals ran deeper and in more directions than he knew.The script is phenomenal, the production values sterling, and the acting truly exceptional. De Niro does some of the best work of his long career, bringing Noodles to life both as a young, ruthless gangster, and a tired, regretful old man. The make-up artists also deserve great accolades for their abilities to age the main characters more than thirty years. In the later scenes, De Niro looks almost exactly as he does today. And I would be remiss if I didn't praise the work of the child actors, particularly Jennifer Connelly as Deborah, Noodles's childhood sweetheart.Once Upon a Time in America is a film that should be seen by any fan of the genre, or the director.

It was the biggest thing that Disney had made up until that point and for many reasons - the voice cast was made up of a-listers (Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, James Earl Jones, the list goes on), the songs were being sung worldwide, the story was epic and most of all - it held and still holds a special place in all of our hearts and childhoods.To me, this movie was perfect - it was cute, it was funny, it was unbearably heartbreaking (for anyone that has ever truly loved their dad), it had great morals and some great songs. Recently I ordered a copy of it to see if it holds up and for the most part, it does. I still find myself laughing and crying, the songs are still great and the animation is still b-e-a-utiful. However, that being said it does have it's flaws that now the hype has died down, I don't have to overlook. For anyone that hasn't seen it, the story is basically an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet set in the African pride-lands, with animals as it's main characters. In short, lion cub Simba is the next heir to the throne, with his dad Mufasa the current king. Mufasa's brother Scar jealously feels that he should have been next in line and that is where we have our villain, and a good one at that. I can't give anything else away, but what follows is a fantastic adventure mixing good-vs-evil, great characters and a very Shakespearean story of revenge and coming- of-age.Now for the flaws. Most of it is nitpicking, but as an adult I have grown to appreciate movies for their stories and I must say that the third act (the final conflict) is a little rushed and it threw my adult mind off a little bit, having just witnessed such a fantastic build up. But other than that, I was surprised to find that none of the characters or songs annoy me as they do many other adults that saw it as a kid. Another thing that is always brought to my attention is that the message of the film is a little mixed (which I won't spoil). I personally like the morals the film has to offer, as I feel they reflect real life misunderstandings and teach children that your parents can't teach you everything about the world. There are simply some things you must discover for yourself, which is all part of growing up. It is a coming-of-age story after all isn't it?

Now, if you're not intimidated by the old school film noir, B\/W and such, you are likely to find this remake far less upsetting - and believable - than the original picture of 1962.Firstly, the build up here is all wrong though DeNiro's portrait of Max Cady is credible per se, his way of stalking Sam Bowden and his family is - by 1990s standards - a bit too crude and ungainly to become as menacing as the story suggests. The steadily increasing threat that characterizes Mitchum's Cady in the 1960s version is much more effective.Secondly, there is a certain hypersensitivity to Nolte's Bowden that kind of spoils the plot, making him a sort of a house tyrant that is otherwise out of character. Fairly unlikely, for instance, that he would be successful in locking up his wife and daughter (as if back in the old prudish days of 1962) without thoroughly informing the two of them about his fears regarding the situation, the looks of Mr.Cady, what kind of car he drives, and so on. Thirdly, Juliette Lewis is best cast of them all as the gullible teen daughter, given that you accept her lack of normal teen social life with friends, guys, parties etc. She would most likely not have been the least attracted to Cady, if the setting was different, i.e. the regular 1990s one.This version relies more on action and less on psychology than its precursor.

He ends up deserting his manager and sleeping in a bus station, where he meets the love of his life but has trouble realizing it. Most of the story involves Eddie trying to negotiate his relationship while at the same time summoning enough resources and self-respect to go at Fats again.The notion of character is important in this movie, and I credit the movie with being one of the primary constructors of this value in our society.

The notion of a protagonist finding character has become such a common feature of movies (Rocky anyone?) that we forget that the idea, especially in sports movies, first really came to fruition here.But the movie is richer than this--Eddie's pursuit of the whatever- it-is that will help him beat Fats ends up having grave consequences, and we see that the movie is also about the rewards and dangers of passion and obsession. Eddie is passionate about pool and obsessive about winning, and this makes him blind to elements of the story that are very sinister.And the movie is also about love.

I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. Based on 'Crime on the Waterfront', a series of articles that won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize by Malcolm Johnson, brotherhood bonds to blood, from gunfire to grief, from rough-'em-ups to redemption, 'On the Waterfront' holds nothing back in showing what it wants to convey to its audience. The time allotted of which we get to spend with these people, do we eventually go beyond seeing them as dock workers to actual human beings with actual emotions and burdens to bear? Let's take a look.Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen? So stated American film producer Darryl F. Zanuck who eventually came clean about his feelings toward Elia Kazan's masterful 'On The Waterfront' (1954). Decades later, the film has thus gone on to become a landmark of cinematic excellence. Shot in bleak black and white, director Elia Kazan wanted his actors to feel as miserable as their cold, flavorless surroundings on the docks.Some strong points in the film were probably the most memorable in the film history archives to date. One particular moment was at they true heart of the movie when Charley (Rod Steiger) begs his kid brother, a washed up post-boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) to take a job offer in the back of a cab and then threatens him with a pistol. Terry grins and slowly shakes his head, knowing that his brother would never pull the trigger on him. Terry knew Charley too well. And it is here where Terry confesses to Charley in a monologue about what and who he could have been.Another key aspect is the decision Terry makes in breaking the code of silence. As he begins to become more tormented by his awakening conscience amidst the violent acts around him, he increasingly leans towards testifying against the heinous crimes the powerful local Mob boss (Lee J. Cobb) and his goons have committed before. As the kid brother of his Mob-connected union boss' right-hand man, Terry admits to Charley, after he bribes him with a plum job and then threatens him with a gun in one of cinema's most famous scenes in film history, that the downward spiral of blame he had on himself he now placed on his brother, his own flesh and blood. Charley had been sent by Friendly to keep quiet, but Charley finally recognizes that he has failed to sway his younger brother into doing what he wanted him to do. Terry realized that violence and illegal acts should be spoken out for no matter what the punishment, as long as he knew it was the right thing to do in his shattered world. All his life he was brought up with not doing anything for anybody and not saying anything to anybody, for a stool pigeon he was not; a perfect metaphor being the many caged birds he kept on the roof in which he could relate being stuck in a slum existence yearning to fly far away from the guns and bloodshed one day. But inside he knew that there had to be a voice to stand up against what he believed was right. And all the crimes he and the longshoremen have witnessed could not keep hi, quiet any longer, despite the entire Mob nearly beating him to death near the end of the film. He may have been battered and bloodied, but he still possessed his untouchable, unshakable dignity.Also, another strong moment occurs was when a dock worker named K. O. Dugan was crushed by a load of Irish whiskey in a staged accident by the Mob, which afterwards the waterfront priest Father Berry (Karl Malden) shows up and delivers a fiery speech on how violence has truly gotten out of hand amidst the slums. And the big, bloody brawl near the end of the film with Terry and Johnny Friendly was yet another epic scene in the film itself as Terry barely survives it but ultimately wins. A weak part in the film is when he yells his love interest's Edie's (Eva Marie Saint) name outside her door and she tells him to go away after what he had confessed to her prior. But he eventually kicks the door open and grapples her in his arms as the couple kiss passionately.This film goes deeper than portraying sweaty longshoremen, a former boxer and Mob violence amidst a smoggy, cold oasis. It went on to become a true part of cinematic history, ultimately showing to the viewer that speaking out for what you know is right, despite trial and error, can make a world of difference and an inner peace in standing up for your beliefs.

As he begins to become more tormented by his awakening conscience amidst the violent acts around him, he increasingly leans towards testifying against the heinous crimes the powerful local Mob boss (Lee J. Cobb) and his goons have committed before. As the kid brother of his Mob-connected union boss' right-hand man, Terry admits to Charley, after he bribes him with a plum job and then threatens him with a gun in one of cinema's most famous scenes in film history, that the downward spiral of blame he had on himself he now placed on his brother, his own flesh and blood. Charley had been sent by Friendly to keep quiet, but Charley finally recognizes that he has failed to sway his younger brother into doing what he wanted him to do. Terry realized that violence and illegal acts should be spoken out for no matter what the punishment, as long as he knew it was the right thing to do in his shattered world. All his life he was brought up with not doing anything for anybody and not saying anything to anybody, for a stool pigeon he was not; a perfect metaphor being the many caged birds he kept on the roof in which he could relate being stuck in a slum existence yearning to fly far away from the guns and bloodshed one day. But inside he knew that there had to be a voice to stand up against what he believed was right. And all the crimes he and the longshoremen have witnessed could not keep hi, quiet any longer, despite the entire Mob nearly beating him to death near the end of the film. He may have been battered and bloodied, but he still possessed his untouchable, unshakable dignity.Also, another strong moment occurs was when a dock worker named K. O. Dugan was crushed by a load of Irish whiskey in a staged accident by the Mob, which afterwards the waterfront priest Father Berry (Karl Malden) shows up and delivers a fiery speech on how violence has truly gotten out of hand amidst the slums. And the big, bloody brawl near the end of the film with Terry and Johnny Friendly was yet another epic scene in the film itself as Terry barely survives it but ultimately wins. A weak part in the film is when he yells his love interest's Edie's (Eva Marie Saint) name outside her door and she tells him to go away after what he had confessed to her prior. But he eventually kicks the door open and grapples her in his arms as the couple kiss passionately.This film goes deeper than portraying sweaty longshoremen, a former boxer and Mob violence amidst a smoggy, cold oasis. It went on to become a true part of cinematic history, ultimately showing to the viewer that speaking out for what you know is right, despite trial and error, can make a world of difference and an inner peace in standing up for your beliefs.

I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. Based on 'Crime on the Waterfront', a series of articles that won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize by Malcolm Johnson, brotherhood bonds to blood, from gunfire to grief, from rough-'em-ups to redemption, 'On the Waterfront' holds nothing back in showing what it wants to convey to its audience. The time allotted of which we get to spend with these people, do we eventually go beyond seeing them as dock workers to actual human beings with actual emotions and burdens to bear? Let's take a look.Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen? So stated American film producer Darryl F. Zanuck who eventually came clean about his feelings toward Elia Kazan's masterful 'On The Waterfront' (1954). Decades later, the film has thus gone on to become a landmark of cinematic excellence. Shot in bleak black and white, director Elia Kazan wanted his actors to feel as miserable as their cold, flavorless surroundings on the docks.Some strong points in the film were probably the most memorable in the film history archives to date. One particular moment was at they true heart of the movie when Charley (Rod Steiger) begs his kid brother, a washed up post-boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) to take a job offer in the back of a cab and then threatens him with a pistol. Terry grins and slowly shakes his head, knowing that his brother would never pull the trigger on him. Terry knew Charley too well.

Mortal Kombat, simply put, is not only the best best game- to-film adaptations ever made, but one of my personal favorite movies of all time. I first seen this movie in the theaters in 1995. I was only five years old at the time! Back then it was a fantastic film, and in 2015, it's still a great film! Maybe it's nostalgia, but on the other hand compared to all the other overrated junk of 2014 and 2015, I consider this movie excellent and it is one of my favorites. This film and franchise even encouraged me to study martial arts for almost 15 years now.Mortal Kombat, simply put, is a movie rendition of the original Mortal Kombat arcade video game. It's about a group of warriors from Earth who compete in an ancient martial arts tournament for the fate of the world. In more than one way, it borrows many concepts\/ideas from Enter the Dragon, but on the other hand, it has it's own unique twist and storyline to it.Everything about this movie is awesome. Simple storyline with humor in the right spots, great casting, EXCELLENT choreography, and a fun soundtrack that still rocks today. In particular, this is one of my favorite fighting movies because the fights were excellently choreographed. Some standoffs between characters were extremely convincing and fun to watch. The fights were very dirty and not too over-the- top. They also paid homage to the video game with cool fatalities and even a funny friendship scene. Probably the ONLY weak spot in the film would maybe be some of the CGI (especially for Reptile); Reptile didn't look great in 1995 and the movie aging 20 years has not helped! With that being said, the non-CGI Goro looks better than any junk they would probably try to make today. It makes me very sad that the franchise (as far as the big screen goes) is in limbo. But at least we have this great classic filmed by Paul Anderson! If you enjoy video game films, martial arts, or the new age MK video games, I recommend you check this film out. It is a fun film and worth adding to your DVD or blu ray collection.

Richard Donner's direction and Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's acting elevate Lethal Weapon into something more than the sum of its parts. Shane Black's script is polished and professional, largely free of extraneous elements or logical leaps. But the plot it conveys is as hackneyed as crime fare gets a simple drug deal sloppily adorned with prostitutes. It has less flair and intrigue than a side mission in a Grand Theft Auto game. Happily, it's not where Black and Donner and Gibson place their focus.Even people who have not seen Lethal Weapon know it as one of the first movies in which a mismatched pair of cops are thrust together and form an unlikely friendship. And even before this gimmick became one of the biggest clichés in entertainment, it was already corny and obvious. The characters are drawn in glaring, unambiguous colors Gibson is incredibly temperamental and reckless, and Danny Glover is an equally-incredibly contented family man. Glover's birthday gathering around a bubble bath is ridiculous, but it's an efficient way to link his character in an instant to all things good and comfortable and domestic. We know what he's about before he utters a word. Gibson doesn't utter, he shouts maniacally, but his character is also defined through exaggerated imagery. He stands unflinching in a hail of bullets, then watches TV alone on Christmas with a bottle of scotch and a loaded gun. (Incidentally, count the TVs in this film. They're everywhere. And when one gets destroyed, another one turns up&#x97; twice!) Surely even Marlowe and Spade had more humanity than this cartoon-watching cartoon of a cop. But Lethal Weapon doesn't need Gibson to be real any more than it needs a great plot, because its focus is unwaveringly fixed on just one thing the chemistry between the cops.Donner is famous for infusing unreal characters with humanity. He brought out the sensitivity and aching in the Man of Steel. He's the perfect director to kindle the sparks that fly between Gibson and Glover. Donner ensures that one or both are always at the center of the action, which is not over when the bodies hit the floor or when the dust settles, but when Gibson and Glover share a quip and an affectionate look. As they grow closer, even the formless plot begins to coalesce around them, becoming an unlikely extension of their lives; after Glover and Gibson bond over their memories of Vietnam, it is revealed that the bad guys learned their tricks in Vietnam, too! When the prostitutes are finally out of the picture, Glover's beloved daughter steps into the sexualized victim role. It's absurd stuff, but very neatly and consciously done, and everyone involved commits to it in full.Unfortunately, the film ends with a small misstep. Gary Busey's superhuman villain is a third wheel to Glover and Gibson's relationship. His final, vaguely martial-artsy fight with Gibson strains credulity without adding to the central drama of the cops' friendship and rebirth.

Therefore, Men in Black is more worthy of the title I'm giving.Aside from me saying this is better than Back to the Future in some respect, this is definitely superior to the sequels and cartoon made about this.

This was more serious with funnier stuff.

They take a written test and nobody can write well because there's no flat surface, so he pulls the table in the middle of the room close to him. The scene is funny as hell, but also shows that he doesn't always wait for instructions.The rest of the cast is fabulous too. D'Onofrio is unrecognizable after the alien takes over his body.

First off, this movie is extremely deep and thought-provoking. The ending, and the whole lead up to it throughout the movie, was smart and carefully crafted. I won't even pretend that I knew what the ending was trying to say, because I probably don't. Also for a movie from the late 60's, the visuals were stunning.Both of these aspects made the movie beautiful, and at the same time made you strain your brain to determine the meaning behind every shot and every scene. However that's just the reason I hated it. I knew that when I started up the movie and was greeted to 3 minutes of blackness accompanied by a grating, ear-splitting horrible sound that they deemed music, I was going to be in for an awful ride.2001 A Space Odyssey isn't a movie, it's an art gallery. You're sitting there watching scene after scene of an astronaut or a spaceship just floating in space. Beautiful, but painfully boring. This was the first time I have ever fast-forwarded through sections of movie because I was so bored. The best part was even though I did this I never missed anything. There is so much useless fluff in this movie you could probably skip an entire scene and still not miss a beat. As I said, the effects in this movie were amazing for it's time, but it's been almost 50 years. You can't just stick a series of pretty space shots up and expect it to hold up over time without any compelling story to carry the movie. And here is the other reason this isn't a movie. There is barely a shred of a story, or characters, or excitement or anything else that you need to make an actual good movie. The plot was laughably non- existent. There was barely a moment of excitement or suspense during the whole movie. The characters were also laughably poor. Undeveloped, stale, and utterly boring like the rest of the movie. A movie should be beautiful, and it should make you think, but it also should be so many other things that 2001 A Space Odyssey just wasn't.The funny part is the only actual interesting character was an AI Robot called Hal. He provided the only interesting character and the only suspenseful and exciting moment of the entire movie. If not for the whole section of the movie Hal was in, I don't think I would have been able to even finish it. He's the only reason I thought about giving this movie more than 1 star.If you like artsy movies, or if you like movies that really make you think, you will like this movie. It's perfect for pretentious people who can go around and pretend they completely understood the ending after watching it the first time. That way they can go and tell all their friends about it and sound super smart. However, if you want to sit down to have a good time and be entertained. If you want to watch an actual movie with deep characters, a beautiful score, excitement, suspense, and emotion, then you picked the wrong movie. You will quickly find it has none of these things.

Also for a movie from the late 60's, the visuals were stunning.Both of these aspects made the movie beautiful, and at the same time made you strain your brain to determine the meaning behind every shot and every scene. However that's just the reason I hated it. I knew that when I started up the movie and was greeted to 3 minutes of blackness accompanied by a grating, ear-splitting horrible sound that they deemed music, I was going to be in for an awful ride.2001 A Space Odyssey isn't a movie, it's an art gallery. You're sitting there watching scene after scene of an astronaut or a spaceship just floating in space. Beautiful, but painfully boring. This was the first time I have ever fast-forwarded through sections of movie because I was so bored. The best part was even though I did this I never missed anything. There is so much useless fluff in this movie you could probably skip an entire scene and still not miss a beat. As I said, the effects in this movie were amazing for it's time, but it's been almost 50 years. You can't just stick a series of pretty space shots up and expect it to hold up over time without any compelling story to carry the movie. And here is the other reason this isn't a movie. There is barely a shred of a story, or characters, or excitement or anything else that you need to make an actual good movie. The plot was laughably non- existent. There was barely a moment of excitement or suspense during the whole movie. The characters were also laughably poor. Undeveloped, stale, and utterly boring like the rest of the movie. A movie should be beautiful, and it should make you think, but it also should be so many other things that 2001 A Space Odyssey just wasn't.The funny part is the only actual interesting character was an AI Robot called Hal. He provided the only interesting character and the only suspenseful and exciting moment of the entire movie. If not for the whole section of the movie Hal was in, I don't think I would have been able to even finish it. He's the only reason I thought about giving this movie more than 1 star.If you like artsy movies, or if you like movies that really make you think, you will like this movie. It's perfect for pretentious people who can go around and pretend they completely understood the ending after watching it the first time. That way they can go and tell all their friends about it and sound super smart. However, if you want to sit down to have a good time and be entertained. If you want to watch an actual movie with deep characters, a beautiful score, excitement, suspense, and emotion, then you picked the wrong movie. You will quickly find it has none of these things.

Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a film that everyone can enjoy. It is often slow at times. Also, there is very little dialogue throughout the movie. This is not a movie centered around specific characters per se, which we are so used to seeing, but rather a movie whose main character is all of us as a species. This is a movie rich with symbolism. The directing is outstanding. Stanley Kubrick's unique style seems to work best in this film. The special effects, while obviously dated, still hold up pretty well to this day. It is amazing to think what was visually accomplished in this movie considering how new space travel was at the time. The score of the film gives the movie such an epic feeling that it'll give you goosebumps. This film also has, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a film that I have ever seen. It'll make you think and puts the whole film into perspective. All in all, this film is really unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't very often give a movie a 10, but I feel that this movie is deserving of it. I highly recommend this film.

Thus, I was plunged into a movie I'd seen in bits and pieces many times but never all the way through. It felt like catching up with a school colleague you never much cared for after many years. Despite desperately trying to recreate the runaway success of Mary Poppins, this film is drab by comparison and uninteresting for the most part and it only really comes to life towards the end.Somewhere along the south coast of England in 1940, three children are evacuated from London to the relative safety of the countryside. Eldest Charlie (Ian Weighill), sister Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan) and youngest Paul (Roy Snart) find themselves temporarily living with the unusual Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) who turns out to be an apprentice witch working on a secret spell for the war effort. But after her magic correspondence course is cancelled due to the war, she and the children make off after Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson) back in London, who is revealed to be a charlatan trickster. So when nefarious forces conspire to acquire the spell before Miss Price, the four of them must work together to complete the spell and fight off the incoming forces of Nazi Germany.For the longest time, Bedknobs and Broomsticks feels like an unusual trip through the history books. Aside from the trippy effects of the magic, the film appears drained of colour and mostly shot at night. Children's films are meant to be bright, noisy and fun but this is anything but. And although the song-and-dance routines are performed with plenty of gusto, the acting is very one-dimensional. All the child actors seem to have learnt their accents from the Dick Van Dyke School of Cockney (Cor blimey, guv'nor!, Stone the bleeding crows!, that sort of shtick) while Lansbury and Tomlinson perform with a certain resigned attitude. It's only when they travel to the island of Naboomba and the film introduces its animated section that things improve dramatically. It becomes genuinely funny, almost jarringly bright and is much more imaginative and creative than anything else in the movie. Technically, the film is a triumph of effects and animation as Tomlinson's character ends up refereeing a 'soccer' game (whatever that is) between the islands anthropomorphic inhabitants.But all too quickly, the scene ends and we return to the perpetual night of sleepy England where the Nazi's - almost completely ignored by the film up to this point - turn up for the unlikely climax. It's unfair to call the film a disappointment because it isn't - the songs are first class (I was still singing The Beautiful Briny at work the next day!) and the animation sequence is one of Disney's very best and most comical. But it is inevitably compared to the aforementioned Mary Poppins and that is like sending a gerbil to battle against a pack of hungry lions. Indeed, it's no stretch of the imagination to picture Julie Andrews sailing into the air on a broomstick instead of Angela Lansbury, especially with Tomlinson in the movie. On its own merits, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an entertaining (if somewhat slow) movie for kids who will find their attention wandering before the cartoon section pulls them back in. But in an ironic twist, this movie about a trainee witch sorely lacks the magic and energy of Mary Poppins and should have proved to Disney that lightning doesn't always strike twice.
