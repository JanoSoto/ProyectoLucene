The 1990 sequel wasn't too bad, but the '88 original is the very best. Just so you know, I have never hated Bruce Willis, past or present. I just think that several of his more recent films have been turkeys.This is the film that made him a superstar, being that mostly he was known for MOONLIGHTING at this time. With striking green eyes and a memorable personality, Willis was indeed leading man material even in these early days. What makes this film a good one for Willis is that he played not a macho grunting void like what Arnie had been playing, but a real guy, a guy who ended up exhausted, battered and probably in need of several pints of blood by the time this ordeal was over for everyone.NYPD cop is invited by his old boss to come out to the West Coast for Christmas, which is also where his recently estranged wife lives. An uneasy reunion at the wife's company's Christmas bash is trying to take place when a group of mostly German terrorists (or are they???) invades the towering high-rise where Willis' cop and the ex-wife are. This renegade group is lead by one of my very favorite actors, the always delightful and amazing Alan Rickman.To make a long story short, the obviously focused and experienced group of criminals takes Willis' wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and her co-workers hostage. Willis manages to be in a position where he was undetected by the group and therefore able to separate himself from the other civilians who are know being terrorized. Being a cop, he tries his best to undermine the efforts of Rickman and company.A truly lovable ally for Willis is Sargeant Al Powell (Reginald ValJohnson), one of the few LA cop characters who has the intuition to help Willis rather than persecute him for his contributions to the battle being waged. The FBI, as per usual, is made to look like a bunch of buffoons, but Robert Davi is hilarious and I couldn't help but love all characters, even the jerks, like Dwayne T. Robinson (RIP Paul Gleason!) Even the terrorists themselves are brilliant, and there are countless moments of subtle hilarity and comedy coming from everyone.The only flaws I have ever noticed are bits of bad editing here and there, but so what? This is an action-packed, engaging, memorably written and acted, touching and often times funny film that is perfect every year at Christmas. After 20 years, it is more of a classic than ever before.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and certainly regard it as the most brutal and realistic depictions of the holocaust that I've seen. Whether or not it works as a movie however, is a whole different question. After watching for the first time I don't regard Schindler's List as perfect, but still regard it as an important piece of film because of the history it depicts so powerfully, regardless of its few faults as a movie.On an aesthetic side, the film is perfect. The soundtrack fits the themes and action on screen perfectly and memorably, creating an atmosphere suiting to the film's focus. The performances from the cast are all very well done also, with only a few problems every now and again. The photography also is flawless, using black and white with mixes of colour effectively and with astonishing results often not thought possible with the limitations of the style.The writing itself is sharp and well done, managing to recreate a dark period in human history as though it was outside our windows, ready to be filmed. My problem however lies in the writing of the tragedy and the obvious unbalanced focus on characters. You see the film does manage to convey a completely disgusting, repelling and shocking world ruled by oppressors following orders with little compassion for an entire race of people. It does this by repeatedly showing unjustified and casual killings of innocent civilians, carried out by the Nazis. I'm not saying these scenes were not well done, in fact when viewing them I was firmly on the film's side, taken in by its honesty and gruesome realism. However as the film dragged on I began to notice that these people who were dying were people I didn't know of nor really cared about (Please note at this point that I am reviewing a movie, not history). This occurs because I felt Schindler's List devoted far too much screen time developing its oppressors rather than showing more of the oppressed. So when it comes to yet another execution, I am predictably enraged and disgusted with the executioner, but am I sad or guided to feel anything for the poor person who's now lying dead? Not really. I mean, yes I find it horrifying and tragic, but show any killing on screen and you're probably going to react in this way. Here in lies where Schindler's List is brought down from superior cinema to a sentimentally bankrupt historical movie The film is extremely powerful and emotional throughout, but unfortunately it is always in a negative manner.I also found the ending to the film completely unconvincing and detracting to the events that take place beforehand. I refer here to both Schindler breaking down and fretting over how many more prisoners he could have saved, and the modern day footage of the survivors visiting Schindler's grave. Both ordeals come off as extremely misplaced, emotionally contrived and absurdly mawkish. They left me with an unfortunate sour taste after a solid couple of hours of well intentioned film.Please recognise however that despite these problems, I did find the film a good watch albeit quite a taxing one. If there is one thing I can give the film absolute praise for it is that it has opened my eyes a great deal to the suffering and injustice that the Jewish people went under whilst under the control of the Nazis during World War II. It is a film that will stay with me forever no doubt, leaving images that probably should never be forgotten.

I find it amazing that somebody who needed so much emotional assistance from friends and family could pull off a film with such amazing detail and craftsmanship. It just comes to show how much of a genius this man really is.Schindler's List is a film that stretches at least close to, or even over, three hours in length. At times there are instances where I think maybe the film could have dealt with just one less conversation between stars Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) and Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), but once I get down to the last fifteen minutes of the film, I know it couldn't have been any shorter than it is. But Schindler's List is not just a film about displaying the unjustifiable tyranny and suffering caused during the Second World War, but it also explores the man who saved 1100 innocent lives Oskar Schindler, who began caring about nothing but himself. Schindler as we first see him in the film, is married, yet he is a womanizer. He bends the law to profit during the war, he initially cares next to nothing about the Jewish people being tortured and shot by the Nazis. He's nothing more than a unsuccessful businessman who suddenly sees an opportunity to make a name and fortune for himself by benefiting from the suffering of others. And yet, as we go on later in the film and learn to understand him, the man is totally transformed, as indeed he was in real life. And he ends up giving everything he has and forced to lead the rest of his life alone and without success, to save the lives of over one thousand innocent Jewish people whose people were being tortured and killed just for being Jewish.While Oskar Schindler is definitely one of the greatest heroes...both on screen and in real life, Amon Goeth is undeniably one of the most horrifying villains of all time. Here, he is portrayed unbelievably convincingly by Ralph Fiennes. The character of Amon Goeth, as well as the entire Nazi party in the film, symbolize the vile cruelty that the biased Nazi party in real life would place upon their prisoners. We see a scene in the film, where they not only kill them for fun, but also make experiments out of their prisoners. Such as lining up a few men against a wall, sticking a rifle barrel to the stomach of the nearest one, and seeing how many of the men behind him the bullet will still strike. And then afterwards, walking up with a pistol and ruthlessly killing the survivors. Amon Goeth is even more terrifying, in some scenes, he shoots at workers for no apparent reason other than to kill time. And yet while the film explores the cruelty of Goeth, it also explores the other sides of him and how he could still be a friend and even a reasonable businessman who other Germans. The friendship that develops between him and Oskar Schindler never steers in a wrong direction, as one might expect, and they remain good friends throughout the entire film, despite their differences in outlooks upon the Jews.The music score, composed by masterful John Williams, is one of the finest scores ever composed for a film. Masterful films gets masterful music scores to go along with them and heighten the tension or drama or whatever is necessary for a scene. The opening scores of the film, as they mostly revolve around Schindler's first dives into success, are cheery and intriguing and later on, as the emotional parts begin to arrive, the soundtrack becomes heart-wrenching powerful and sad. The last fifteen minutes of the film are truly amazing and simply rips one's soul apart. And with William's amazing music in the background, you cannot ignore it or refuse to take it seriously.Schindler's List is filmed almost entirely in black-and-white and it seems most appropriately that it is. I personally can not imagine what it could have seemed like in color. Well, maybe I can, but I cannot imagine it being as pure and artistic with color. It was meant to be black-and-white, because it was meant to be as much like a documentary as possible. And by using actors and actresses who are talented, yet mostly unknown names to the public, it brings more convincing appearances to the film.This is one of the greatest films ever made. And nobody else could have done it any better than Steven Spielberg himself.

Schindler's List is a film that will never be forgotten and will probably never be overpowered by another Holocaust film in drama or purity. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" While this is not my personal favorite out of all of Steven Spielberg's films, I do have a powerful appreciation for Schindler's List and I do credit it as the best Holocaust film ever made and probably Spielberg's third-best lifetime achievement and every time I watch some of the film's most graphic and heart-wrenching or even just plain disturbing sequences, I can understand the director's emotional weaknesses he had during filming of the project and he had every right to be so. I find it amazing that somebody who needed so much emotional assistance from friends and family could pull off a film with such amazing detail and craftsmanship. It just comes to show how much of a genius this man really is.Schindler's List is a film that stretches at least close to, or even over, three hours in length. At times there are instances where I think maybe the film could have dealt with just one less conversation between stars Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) and Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), but once I get down to the last fifteen minutes of the film, I know it couldn't have been any shorter than it is. But Schindler's List is not just a film about displaying the unjustifiable tyranny and suffering caused during the Second World War, but it also explores the man who saved 1100 innocent lives Oskar Schindler, who began caring about nothing but himself. Schindler as we first see him in the film, is married, yet he is a womanizer. He bends the law to profit during the war, he initially cares next to nothing about the Jewish people being tortured and shot by the Nazis. He's nothing more than a unsuccessful businessman who suddenly sees an opportunity to make a name and fortune for himself by benefiting from the suffering of others. And yet, as we go on later in the film and learn to understand him, the man is totally transformed, as indeed he was in real life. And he ends up giving everything he has and forced to lead the rest of his life alone and without success, to save the lives of over one thousand innocent Jewish people whose people were being tortured and killed just for being Jewish.While Oskar Schindler is definitely one of the greatest heroes...both on screen and in real life, Amon Goeth is undeniably one of the most horrifying villains of all time. Here, he is portrayed unbelievably convincingly by Ralph Fiennes. The character of Amon Goeth, as well as the entire Nazi party in the film, symbolize the vile cruelty that the biased Nazi party in real life would place upon their prisoners. We see a scene in the film, where they not only kill them for fun, but also make experiments out of their prisoners. Such as lining up a few men against a wall, sticking a rifle barrel to the stomach of the nearest one, and seeing how many of the men behind him the bullet will still strike. And then afterwards, walking up with a pistol and ruthlessly killing the survivors. Amon Goeth is even more terrifying, in some scenes, he shoots at workers for no apparent reason other than to kill time. And yet while the film explores the cruelty of Goeth, it also explores the other sides of him and how he could still be a friend and even a reasonable businessman who other Germans. The friendship that develops between him and Oskar Schindler never steers in a wrong direction, as one might expect, and they remain good friends throughout the entire film, despite their differences in outlooks upon the Jews.The music score, composed by masterful John Williams, is one of the finest scores ever composed for a film. Masterful films gets masterful music scores to go along with them and heighten the tension or drama or whatever is necessary for a scene. The opening scores of the film, as they mostly revolve around Schindler's first dives into success, are cheery and intriguing and later on, as the emotional parts begin to arrive, the soundtrack becomes heart-wrenching powerful and sad. The last fifteen minutes of the film are truly amazing and simply rips one's soul apart. And with William's amazing music in the background, you cannot ignore it or refuse to take it seriously.Schindler's List is filmed almost entirely in black-and-white and it seems most appropriately that it is. I personally can not imagine what it could have seemed like in color. Well, maybe I can, but I cannot imagine it being as pure and artistic with color. It was meant to be black-and-white, because it was meant to be as much like a documentary as possible. And by using actors and actresses who are talented, yet mostly unknown names to the public, it brings more convincing appearances to the film.This is one of the greatest films ever made. And nobody else could have done it any better than Steven Spielberg himself. He did not live in a concentration camp or experience the suffering the Schindler Jews did, but he knows enough about it and brought his visions to the screen with absolute perfection.

Many years later I tried again and even though the movie made a lot more sense now, I still think it's pretty weak. The ending is a surprise and a beautiful one at that, but after more than an hour you're fed up with traveling back and forth between the past and the future. It becomes a bit tiresome to me. After a while I stopped caring whether or not Bruce Willis would complete his mission.Luckily there is still the fantastic performance of Brad Pitt which was the only thing that kept me awake when the movie hit rock bottom every now and then. He stars as a mentally-ill, manic-depressed patient with a lazy eye and does so incredibly well. His over-the-top yet exceptional acting breaths life into this otherwise pretty lackluster movie and it goes without saying that these vivid moments are also the most interesting ones of the entire motion picture.Bruce Willis, on the other hand, was handpicked by director Terry Gilliam because he had noticed how Wiliis in the first Die hard-movie could play both a tough yet vulnerable character at the same time. And this was exactly what the American director needed for the main part. For the role of the psychiatrist however, Terry Gilliam wanted a beautiful woman with an intelligent appearance in the midst of a devastated world. He chose Madeleine Stowe. I'm not particularly a fan of hers, but she does justice to this role.In short A weird and heavy movie that might not always keep your attention despite an amazing Brad Pitt, but be sure to watch the entire film for its unexpected ending.

After a while I stopped caring whether or not Bruce Willis would complete his mission.Luckily there is still the fantastic performance of Brad Pitt which was the only thing that kept me awake when the movie hit rock bottom every now and then. He stars as a mentally-ill, manic-depressed patient with a lazy eye and does so incredibly well. His over-the-top yet exceptional acting breaths life into this otherwise pretty lackluster movie and it goes without saying that these vivid moments are also the most interesting ones of the entire motion picture.Bruce Willis, on the other hand, was handpicked by director Terry Gilliam because he had noticed how Wiliis in the first Die hard-movie could play both a tough yet vulnerable character at the same time. And this was exactly what the American director needed for the main part. For the role of the psychiatrist however, Terry Gilliam wanted a beautiful woman with an intelligent appearance in the midst of a devastated world. He chose Madeleine Stowe. I'm not particularly a fan of hers, but she does justice to this role.In short A weird and heavy movie that might not always keep your attention despite an amazing Brad Pitt, but be sure to watch the entire film for its unexpected ending.

The message is the same the true nature and reality of violence, destruction, and killing is a terrible soul-killing experience that nobody should ever want to endure. While it may be fun to pretend to be a gunfighter, as Brandon De Wilde's character displays numerous times through the course of the film, when it comes down to taking the life of another man to save your own, you'd want to turn back time and start all over again and do whatever possible to avoid it. That's the real point behind the title character of Shane, magnificently portrayed by Alan Ladd. Ladd was the perfect choice for Shane. To start off, he has the weary, beaten appearance to him. He's tired of living the way he does, tired of being tempted into using his six-gun, and tired of having to depart from every place he goes into, leaving behind a few new gravestones in the cemetery.Shane almost symbolizes that when a person does choose to actually follow the path devoted to killing, then the person becomes a gun for hire. Expendable, nothing more than a machine designed to beat out the others until a newer, better design is created somewhere down the road. The character of Jack Wilson, portrayed in an Academy Award-nominated performance by late actor Jack Palance, is one of the greatest Western villains of all time. Although he isn't shown seeing gunning down a particularly large number of people in the film, he doesn't need to show his true cruelty and violent behavior, as well as his cold look on the lives of others, or maybe even his own life. And he is unique as well, displayed through out the film, particularly in his first appearance.Also starring along with Ladd, Palance, and De Wilde is a cast of entirely talented and wonderful actors and actresses. Van Heflin plays another character similar to the one he portrayed four years later in another Western classic 310 to Yuma. And he is even more convincing and realistic in this film as a tough, never-say-die rancher who only wants to prosper and to be allowed to prosper. The other main villain of the film, effectively portrayed in a new perspective by Emile Meyer, is the one who stands in his way. Neither one of them really wants trouble or violence, neither one of them wants a shot fired in their direction. But both are just simply too stubborn to allow the other to get away with what they want.Shane is a truly great Western film and one of the most important films of all time. Not only is very symbolic and pulls off with its messages very well, but it also keeps the audience drawn into the story and the characters, treating them as real people rather than just actors rehearsing their lines to perfection.

It's a highly idealized bio of a larger-than-life fictional character. I moaned when Roth, as a child, immediately learned to play the piano with great skill the day he first saw it. But, as I said, Roth plays a larger-than-life guy so anything goes; there are practically elements of fantasy here, even though this isn't literally spelled out. One has to accept the otherwise absurd premise that a man who is born on a ship, willingly spends half a century aboard it without once setting foot on land. Yet the movie is shot so well, and combined with the pleasant music (not pleasant as in puts you to sleep) it pulls you in, especially in the second half. Roth appears too aloof for a while and his character too mysterious and undefined, but his long, very interesting speech to the trumpet player at the end of the movie clarifies a lot in a strange and original way. It's always good to be pleasantly surprised by a movie that starts off not-very promisingly, and then improves so much that it's never boring and even fascinating all the way to the end. It doesn't even matter that 1900 grew up with an American foster parent, but - as Roth - developed a British accent. The movie is good, so I'll leave the nit-picking for some other time...

Many of them have undoubtedly been well-written, well-acted and highly entertaining, but I simply can't bring myself to adore them as I do many films from other genres. 'The Philadelphia Story' proved an ideal example of what I'm trying to articulate. The film has everything going for it Katharine Hepburn as a snappish socialite, James Stewart as a quick-witted reporter and Cary Grant's roguish boyish charm. The story is a bit more complex than you might expect from a screwball comedy, with three different men vying for the attention of Hepburn's wealthy and independent Tracy Lord, though only one, of course, will successfully take her hand in marriage. Each of the memorable performances are spot-on, and the screenplay is very sharp, but it's not a film I can see myself watching again in the near future; or, if I did, it would only be because I love Jimmy Stewart so much.'The Philadelphia Story' was directed by George Cukor, and adapted by Donald Ogden Stewart and Waldo Salt from Philip Barry's Broadway play of the same name. After a string of disappointing flops for Hepburn, the film proved phenomenally successful, nominated for a total of six Academy Awards and winning two (Best Screenplay and Best Actor for Stewart). Though each of the actors brings their characteristic quirks and personalities into this film, it is certainly Stewart who steals the show, and he is particularly hilarious after consuming a substantial amount of alcohol. Cary Grant does what he does best of all, playing the mischievous ex-husband (a similar role to his Walter Burns in 'His Girl Friday (1940)'), whose constant interference is really just his way of showing how much he wants Tracy back. Aside from the three main stars, other performers of note include John Howard as Tracy's undeserving husband-to-be, Ruth Hussey as Stewart's tabloid photographer, and the delightful Virginia Weidler as Tracy's nosy younger sister.The film is often described as a comedy of remarriage, a sub-genre of American comedy which was most popular during the 1930s and 1940s. The Production Code (also known as the Hays Code) explicitly forbade the cinematic depiction of infidelity, and so many writers avoided this by having the main protagonists divorced at the beginning of the story. Cary Grant was seemingly an expert in such situations, and other notable examples of this phenomenon can be found in 'The Awful Truth (1937)' and 'His Girl Friday (1940).' Another notable characteristic of 'The Philadelphia Story' is that, unlike every other screwball comedy I've seen, the conclusion was not completely predictable; I actually had no idea who was going to end up with Tracy.

A number of those friends, who'd already seen the flick, communicated to me that the film was powerful because it painted a bleak picture of America's youth. Upon completion of that overrated, simplistic film, however, I felt dirty. I felt as if I'd entered the world of child pornography, but hadn't made the final descent because the film itself wasn't X-rated. Though I wanted to trash the film and Clark's direction, I bit my tongue and gave the movie a pass, thinking it was possibly the subject matter that sickened me and not Larry Clark. After watching and being totally offended by 2001's Bully, though, I will no longer give Mr. Clark the benefit of the doubt. In my humble estimation, he is a smut peddler whose twisted vision of American teens is both reprehensible and inaccurate. While some have given him much more credit than he deserves on the grounds that he makes us acknowledge our failures as parents, I find his work to be very average. And the fact that he's so preoccupied with capturing these nude or semi-nude images of teens diminishes his work even further.There is nothing exceptional about this movie. The circumstances surrounding the murder of Nick Stahl's character provide the only interesting angle, and Larry Clark deserves no credit for that, as the film is based on true events. He takes us to places we've already been, shows us behavior we've already seen, and expects us to not see through his transparent material. There is no depth to the characters, and Clark does little to provide energy for the struggling cast. If you like watching smut, Bully won't disappoint.
