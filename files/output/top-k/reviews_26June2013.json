Even though Bueller has created a lot of tricks to pull this day off, he still has to avoid his principle (Jeffrey Jones) who has been waiting four years to bust him for skipping school. FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF comes from John Hughes and it's easy to see why so many people really love this picture. There's a certain innocent quality that comes with it that makes it something rather special and especially when you consider what other types of teen comedies were being released around this time. I think what makes the film work so well is that it really captures the spirit of what it's like really skipping school. I'm sure most people have skipped a day or two and just sat at home because they didn't have the courage or the ways to do what Ferris did so I think there's a certain fantasy appeal that people have with the character and film. A lot of credit has to go to Hughes' screenplay, which offers up plenty of great characters, fun situations and of course it just allows for a good time. More credit has to go to the cast members for being able to pull off their roles. This includes Broderick who is extremely good in the lead role. I think a lesser actor or a lesser performance really could have made this character annoying but Broderick hits all the right notes in making Ferris rather charming. Both Ruck and Sara are good in their supporting roles as is Jennifer Grey in her role as the sister. Edie McClurg adds her typical wonderful charm and even a young Charlie Sheen gets a pretty funny role, although it probably works better today knowing who Sheen became. However, it's Jones who really steals the picture as the principle who is constantly getting himself in one bad situation after another. The comic timing of Jones is quite flawless and he really makes the picture what it is.

The movie is so juvenile in its attitudes toward women, race and sex, especially homosexuality, that what should be an inconsequential, harmless caper is instead frequently depressing. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the humour was smart and had a point, but this is a movie that wants to be 'Porky's' when it grows up.The first in a series of seven films, not to mention a couple of TV series, this introduces the characters who would hang about like a bad smell for most of the sequels Mahoney (horny), Lassard (dumb), Harris (pompus), Tackleberry (militant), Hightower (big), Callaghan (big tits), Hooks (squeaky; not squeaky), and Jones (noises). The talents of the actors are variable but none of these characters is particularly endearing despite their longevity. I like G.W. Bailey, a long-underused actor, and Michael Winslow's vocal talents are impressive if stretched thin as his one and only character trait. So there's no real plot but rather a series of sort-of sketches that appear out of nowhere, carry on for a while, go nowhere, and then end, often without a punchline. This set-em-up, kill-em-off structure is a brave approach to comedy, for sure; the series' inability to present the most basic comedic idea in a way that isn't dismayingly inept has always baffled me. The gags tramp through the movie like prisoners on a death march, and when one comes along that does raise a laugh, like the bully who tries to throw a recruit's books out of an open window and misses, it's cheap as you like. The female characters are objects of lust, prostitutes and demented wives. All Leslie Easterbrook's scene revolve around her huge jugs, while Kim Cattrall is a sketchy love interest and a pair of legs. I wasn't looking for a feminist treatise, and a bit of cheesecake is expected in this kind of thing, but this is wilfully reductive stuff. Two prominent black characters (Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsay) are on the receiving end of racial slurs, and one scene takes a strangely serious turn when Hooks is insulted by another recruit, Hightower upends his car and is kicked out of the academy. Admittedly the racism comes from characters who are ignorant and stupid, but in a movie this silly and tasteless it just doesn't sit right. Most jarring of all is the jaw-dropping treatment of the movie's gay characters. The casual homophobia typical of movies like this ('Sleeping's for fags') wasn't clever even in 1984, but when we get to the scene where two cops stumble into a stereotypical gay bar replete with leather-clad, handlebar-moustachioed sex pests who can't keep their hands to themselves, the movie completes its mission to amuse sniggering teenage boys whose brains have fallen out. Obviously a 'Police Academy' movie isn't the place to come for satire, or rounded characters, or even competent jokes, but the way it shamelessly humps the leg of the lowest common denominator is dispiriting and embarrassing.Nice theme music though.

That kind of thesis for a comedy is almost always lethal because we get no opportunities for humanity or genuine laughs since the film constantly feels the dreary obligation to one-up itself. Here's a film that is so perfunctory and foreseeable in its setups and deliveries that I'd be convinced if the screenwriter and the director thought of this film over a coffee break and decided to carry out everything right then and there.The film was directed by Bob Saget, who you'd know as the whitest, cleanest, and most supportive sitcom daddy in existence on the classic program Full House. Saget is famous for leading a life contradicting to his clean-persona on the show, often performing the filthiest, crassest standup you're likely to ever hear. For this reason, it is unsurprising his directorial effort plays much like his standup in terms of predictably raunchy material that lacks heart and craft.The film follows Mitch Weaver (Norm Macdonald) and Sam McKenna (Artie Lange), two lifelong buddies who have gone their entire lives exacting revenge on people for the smallest offenses. They stage elaborate attacks on the people they can't stand in order to gain a small sense of satisfaction. When Sam's father (Jack Warden) has a heart attack and is in need of a heart transplant, the guys learn the doctor can get the man immediate attention if they pay off the doctor (Chevy Chase) $50,000 so that he can pay off his enormous gambling debt.They decide to open a revenge business called Dirty Work, which thrives off of people calling in and getting Mitch and Sam to exact revenge on people that make their callers tick. One of the reasons the film doesn't work is that the attacks are simple and, overall, underwhelming. With more intricate planning and craft, the payoffs for these offenses could've been rewarding and hilarious. Instead, they are childish and redundant.It also doesn't help that Mitch and Sam are two of the most archetypal, cliché protagonists in any comedy I've ever seen. They're so thin, wooden, and void of personality they feel like robots programmed to do and say things that are allegedly funny. Macdonald and Lange are average comedic talents, and here, they can't do too much with the script (which was somehow the product of three people) that forbids and character or development from sneaking past the abundance of clichés and predictable plot lines.Even so-called late night comedies and stoner films need to achieve some sort of quality and Dirty Work doesn't possess the characteristics of being memorable or creative enough to achieve them. It is an overly-silly, ridiculous film that gets even more ridiculous when it feels the need to allow plot lines like romance and fighting to elbow themselves into the picture.

It's easy to tell that the film was meant to counterattack Disney's growing control on the world of animation&#x85; and even easier to guess that it failed, overpowered by the mastery and incomparable magic reached by the Disney studios.Disney pushed the edge of the envelope so far, making Gulliver's Travels suffering from any comparison. Yet it would be very unfair to label the film as a wannabe Disney and let random trivia affect an opinion toward a film mostly made for children. My guess is whether for Gulliver's Travels, All Dogs Go to Heaven or Time Before Land, children wouldn't care much about the logo introducing the film or any technical consideration, no more anyway than the on-screen experience carried by the story, the images, the songs and naturally, the characters. On that level, Gulliver's Travels provides all the ingredients of the best animated classics, and it's a great entertainment for children.Now, allow me to wake up my inner child, the little one who saw the film for the first time on a crappy VHS and after that, during a nice Saturday in my uncle's home. Coincidentally, the same year, I read a comic-book involving another character who, after a stormy night, found himself on an island inhabited by little people. It was enough for me to believe that any person washed up on an island would become a giant. In my child's imagination, it had to do with drinking too much water or something like that. Pretty crazy, isn't it? But that's the way I looked at Gulliver and never thought the Lilliputians were meant to be 'little people'. Needless to say it didn't change the film's over-all effect.I remember I also loved the cute scene-stealing Gabby, the town crier, voiced by Pinto Colvig (Goofy's voice for the experts) who through his exuberance, seemed to embody the most endearing traits of the seven dwarfs. His desperate attempt to tell the Lilliputians that there is a giant in the beach was my favorite part, closely followed by Gulliver's struggle to get rid of the ropes fixing him on the wooden platform, quite impressive for its physical realism. And when I saw the film again, a few years ago, as soon as Gabby started to shout All's Well, the whole music resurrected in my mind, and I could whistle the tune all the way. As for Gulliver's first stand, I understood why I was so intimidated by his look as a kid when I learned he was animated by rotoscoping, a process involving tracing live-action forage frame by frame, probably one of the film's strengths, proving that it wasn't trying to imitate Disney.Indeed, the rotoscoping creates the perfect distinction between Gulliver and the Lilliputians, and from my adult's second viewing, I remember I was in awe when I saw Gulliver's expression, noticing the screams of Gabby in the castle's dungeon and his bewildered eyes when he realized it was a little man, not to mention his suave and low-pitched voice, that's animation at best, and it's still strange that Disney never thought of that process. Disney improved the drawing of human features with time, making rotoscoping useless, but within the context of Gulliver's Travels, it gives the film a touch of modernity that slightly surpasses Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It also highlights one of the film's unavoidable flaws, the design of Prince David and Princess Glory, who're the only 'little creatures' that don't look comical, but still feel like archetypes of the handsome prince and beautiful princess.However, the film doesn't overuse the two lovers from rival islands and the two annoyingly cute little birds who seemed to be borrowed from the 'other studio', but cleverly uses them as the hostages of their islands' enmity, even more unbelievable since it started on a disagreement over the songs to perform at the wedding  Faithful or Forever, not as memorable as Some Day, My Prince Will Come or even the catchy All's Well or It's a Hap-Hap-Happy Day that became standards of Paramount studios, but performed together, they give the film the typical classic touch, deserving their Oscar nomination for Best song. At the end, children have the songs, comic reliefs with Gabby and the three spies, and Gulliver has quite an authoritarian presence and a hidden charisma that perfectly contrast with the other characters and contradicts the golden rule of a memorable villain, established by Disney. Who needs a villain with such a larger-than-life hero &#x85; literally.Now, it's easy to let cynicism cloud the appreciation of the film. Some can picture the Fleisher executives telling their animators Listen, guys, we didn't want to make a film, but Disney proved it could work, so let's make our 'Snow White'. Then, the classic tale of Gulliver from Jonathan Swift, allows them to use similar plot devices such as a realistic person surrounded by goofy little characters, a romance, cute animals, and nice songs. But despite these similarities, Gulliver's Travels stands as a classic on its own, and comparing to Snow White is like comparing between Bambi and The Lion's King. And again, would children really do such comparisons? Gulliver's Travels deserves in my opinion, the term of an animated classic, even by Disney standards. Granted it doesn't have the status of Disney movies from the era, nor a brighter palette of colors, something that can even be pointed out by a kid, but the second animated feature of all time, the first from a non-Disney studio deserves some credit for its nice attempt to compete with the Goliath of animation.

That's a mark of a film that develops the characters well, when the audience doesn't want the film to conclude and they have to leave the characters forever. The characters in Lifeboat aren't extraordinary people, they start out dry and uninspiring. But as they live in this lifeboat together for days, they begin to change affections with each other and the audience is exposed to the beauty that lies within them. The climatic action was concluding, I looked at the clock, and was disappointed to be leaving these characters I had grown to care like.Lifeboat's is morally compelling. The screenplay shows the difference between Americans and the Nazis, and tests an individuals trust. I'm the type of person who sees the weakness and humanity in everyone, so I believe everyone is deserving of a second chance. The first act, I had the thought the film was a metaphor for Capital Punishment; the people in the lifeboat against the Nazi were the republicans and the people giving the Nazi a second chance symbolized the Democrats. The characters divide and it's interesting to see them run with the tricky plot line.The big mystery in Lifeboat is the mystery of trust. Trust is the thing that holds our lives from falling to pieces with the people we allow (or don't allow) into our lives and what information about them we chose to tell (or not tell) them about ourselves. Lifeboat, at the core of the intention, is an anti-Nazi film. It gives Americans the opportunity to offer the Nazi's semi-peace and a second chance. But like I said, once Lifeboat reveals its secrets, the message about the Nazis are cut out with clarity. Lifeboat also explores the bonds made by these characters, bonds that any survivors of an accident could possibly (and most likely) make. Bankhead is handed a meaty and fascinating character, that she wrings out a great deal from. She carries the film with little help from the actors. Bankhead is marvelous overlooked by many because of the visual effects for the time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is wonderful and on spot as one could expect. In a film that doesn't have much for the audience to figure out, Hitchcock keeps the audience on edge waiting for a big twist to come, but he allows us to get so personal with the characters that it doesn't matter that the twist never comes.The technical aspects for this movie are really quite interesting. The film was shot on a sound- stage and in 1944, the visual effects weren't up to today's standards so what we see today in 2013 looks like a simple job, well done, but really required much thought, time and effort. In the finale, especially, the visuals there are something impressive for that time period. The sound is also well-constructed.

However, a couple of days ago, I finally ordered the Tarantino box-set and sat down to watch Pulp Fiction. The phrase blown away is thrown around a lot regarding a variety of things, but I can honestly say that I am not exaggerating in the slightest. There are so many fantastic things about this film, but I think one of the film's best assets is Tarantino's magnificently woven screenplay. Halfway through the film, I was wondering how Tarantino could possibly link all of the stories together to make some sort of sense, and then he managed to spectacularly. The characters and moments he has created in this film will be remembered for years to come. He simply breathes life into all of his characters, giving them their own personalities and showing a three dimensional side to every single person in the film, even the more minor characters like Zed and Fabienne. Vincent's slightly dorky, disorganised gangster was brilliant to watch, especially when he is looking after Mia; Keitel's Wolf was seedy and yet classy at the same time; Butch's sentimental motives were humorous given that he had just killed a man for his own selfish gain; Christopher Walken's short scene as Captain Kooks made me laugh out loud. Even character like The Gimp were interesting enough to leave you thinking about them for time afterwards. Credit must, of course, be given to the performances of every single actor and actress in the film. There was not a single performance that was slightly out of place or off key to the world around them. Every line was delivered with perfect timing, and it made Tarantino's already great screenplay even better. My personal favourite was Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Jules, although I don't think that's a very original choice on my part. The cinematography in this film is equally memorable, too. There was not a single shot, just like the performances of the actors & actresses, that was out of place or drew away from the experience of the film. The long, uninterrupted shot of Jules and Vincent walking along the corridor talking about Mia's foot massage before the infamous burger sequence was one of my favourites. To top it all off, the soundtrack is pure genius &#x96; I can't help but feel like a bad-ass whenever I hear Misirlou by Dick Dale or Surf Rider by The Lively Ones after watching this film. Handpicked by Tarantino himself, I hear. An interesting point about this film is the fact that it has no clear moral story or message. This, I think, is one of the reasons that I, and many people, enjoyed it so much, because it is not trying to be something that it is not. It is pure enjoyment, and the text at the very beginning makes it clear that the phrase Pulp Fiction means, essentially, Trash Story. The mystery surrounding the briefcase is most likely Tarantino's way of letting the viewer decide what is in the case themselves, making for some very interesting speculation. Despite being very funny and very enjoyable, Pulp Fiction still has its dark, less enjoyable moments, one of the most memorable involving Marsellus, Zed and a basement (need I say any more?). However, Tarantino still manages to make these dark moments funny and enjoyable, and certainly manages to make them memorable. For a very controversial film about the criminal underworld in Los Angeles, this film is surprisingly timeless. I can genuinely imagine people still watching it for many, many years to come, and for them to enjoy it as much as the original audiences did, and as much as I did. Pulp Fiction is fully deserving of all the awards and popularity surrounding it, and manages to make the same impact on new audiences nowadays as it did to the original audiences nearly 20 years ago. Quentin Tarantino has truly made something special &#x96; a classic, you might say. It will go down in my opinion, and many others I am sure, of one of the best films of all time.

Despite being very funny and very enjoyable, Pulp Fiction still has its dark, less enjoyable moments, one of the most memorable involving Marsellus, Zed and a basement (need I say any more?). However, Tarantino still manages to make these dark moments funny and enjoyable, and certainly manages to make them memorable. For a very controversial film about the criminal underworld in Los Angeles, this film is surprisingly timeless. I can genuinely imagine people still watching it for many, many years to come, and for them to enjoy it as much as the original audiences did, and as much as I did. Pulp Fiction is fully deserving of all the awards and popularity surrounding it, and manages to make the same impact on new audiences nowadays as it did to the original audiences nearly 20 years ago. Quentin Tarantino has truly made something special &#x96; a classic, you might say. It will go down in my opinion, and many others I am sure, of one of the best films of all time. One of the only flaws about it is that I doubt whether Tarantino will ever be able to top it...

Appearances deceive sociopathic murderers look like anyone else. People who work in fancy offices, dress to the hilt, drive fancy cars and live in fancy homes still can want others dead for the sake of money, more money. No one can be trusted in the amoral world of Goodbye Lover, even those whom you love and trust the most. In fact, lovers are the most to be distrusted. Everyone is game for everyone else.The production design, sets and script work very well to bring all of this out. The movie visually shows us glitz and public relations types who deal in appearances, double crosses and murder.Scene after scene is done with a smile or a smirk, as black comedy. This is not comedy in the manner of jokes, nor is it exactly satire. It is more like people doing serious things and being affected seriously, while taking it all lightly or farcically. This is closer to farce than anything but it holds back from being complete farce. Too many serious events occur for this to be complete farce, not unless the direction and script were of the highest order, but this is not Billy Wilder and not Some Like It Hot.Neo-noir is not easily given a semi-comic treatment. Instead of a blend that suffuses all the proceedings, a constant tone, we get changes in tone as first one, then the other predominates. We do not have a central character constantly being witty, often at his own expense. No Bob Hope movie is this. The script tried to achieve this somewhat with the character of Ellen DeGeneres, but her character was so dour that her witty lines often fell flat, being more nasty than comic. The Arquette character was much more at the movie's center, but neither could what she was doing be regarded comically.The movie can easily sink between two stools, even if it does not fall. It has some heavy-duty noir and noir twists being treated farcically, but not really coming off that comically. The neo-noir side tends to predominate for me, enjoyably so as a noir fan, but for others the farce may seem to predominate. Overall, it's a decent movie. You pays your money, you takes your choice.

Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,fantastic script,memorable characters and a fantastic soundtrack,The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest films of all time and The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1990s,The Big Lebowski tells the story of Jeff The Dude Lebowski(Jeff Bridges),a stoner from the 1960s who loves getting stoned,Bowling,white Russians,his carpet rug and Creedance Clearwater Revival and lives a pretty normal life. Then one night The Dude is attacked by two thugs who mistake The Dude for millionaire Jeff Lebowski(David Huddleson)and urinate on The Dude's rug. This case of mistaken identity puts The Dude in a tale of intrigue and Mystery where he meets various characters and laughs and chaos Ensue.The Big Lebowski is one of the best Comedies of all time and is a hilarious film from beginning to end that didn't get much attention at the time. The Big Lebowski came out two years after The Coen Brothers Masterpiece Fargo which was critically acclaimed and won many movie awards and then after The Coen Brothers did Fargo they released The Big Lebowski,which did modest business at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics,most critics seeing The Big Lebowski as a failure compared to Fargo. But since it's release in 1998,The Big Lebowski has become a one of the all time great Cult Films,one of the funniest movies of all time and is now seen as a classic from critics and audiences and one of The Coen Brothers best films. One of the reasons The Big Lebowski is such great movie is that The Coen Brothers have taken the taken the Film-Noir style and influence of Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep(film and novel)and set in Los Angeles in the early 1990s where instead of long coats and a tough detective it's long hair and a stoner. The Comedy and Humor in this film is hilarious and it mostly based on the situations and dialog and the various characters that The Dude meets or comes in contact with and each character The Dude meets gets weirder and stranger and each character that comes in contact with The Dude is unpredictable and surprising. TBL has a Film-Noir influence because the film has intrigue and Mystery but in TBL the intrigue and Mystery is slightly off kilter and it seems like every character in the film including The Dude is messed up in the head and you never know what's going to happen next. It's Film-Noir told from a Stoner's point of view and it's ingenious and original. TBL also has episodic feel to it where the film and it's characters go from one thing to the next and the plot is complex but not hard to understand and it adds to the great outlandish and hilarious tone of the film. The photography by Roger Deakins is beautiful and Surreal and colorful making the Los Angeles city and landscape look amazing and bright and adds to the film's comic tone and greatness. Jeff The Dude Lebowski is one of the most iconic characters in the history of film because as soon as comes on the screen The Dude has this great presence and style and you just never forget him. What's also great about The Dude is that he is a slacker and stoner and doesn't care who knows about it and The Dude has a down to earth style all of his own and he doesn't try to be cool he just is. Although not a Private Detective in the traditional sense like Phillip Marrlow or Sam Spade,The Dude evokes the same style as those two great characters as investigates and tries to solve a mystery and the way The Dude deals with characters whether it's his friends or other characters is funny and classic. The Dude is a character that will be remembered forever. The screenplay Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and well-written with every main character saying hilarious lines and dialog that very quotable and memorable. The ending of the film is funny,tragic and ironic and is a truly classic Coen Brothers ending that adds to the greatness of The Big Lebowski.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Jeff Bridges is excellent and hilarious in his most iconic role as Jeff The Dude Lebowski,with Bridges bringing laughs and coolness to the role. John Goodman is brilliant and hilarious as Walter,a Vietnam veteran,who's The Dude's best friend and bowling teammate and Goodman has great scenes and chemistry with Bridges. Julianne Moore is great as Maude Lebowski,a painter and the big Lebowski's daughter. Steve Buscemi is wonderful as Donny,The Dude and Walter's bowling teammate. David Huddleston is fantastic as Jeff Lebowski,The Big Lebowski. John Turturro is excellent and funny in his small role as Jesus Quintana,a sex offender and rival Bowler of The Dude and Walter. Phillip Seymour Hoffman(Brandnt),Sam Elliot(The Stranger,narrator),Ben Gazzara(Jackie Treehorn),Jon Polito(Da Fino),Tara Reid(Bunny Lebowski),Peter Stormare(Nihilist#1 Uli),Flea(Nihilist#2,Kiefer)and Torsten Voges(Nihilist#3,Franz)give good performances as well. The direction by The Coen Brothers is excellent and stylish,with The Coens using slow camera movements,close ups and zooms and beautiful lighting and visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is great,fun and ominous and it fits the tone of film. A wonderful score from Burwell. The soundtrack also has songs from Bob Dylan(The Man In Me),Kenny Rogers And The First Edition(I Just Dropped In(To What Condition My Conditon Was In),Creedance Clearwater Revival(Looking Out My Back Door,Run Through The Jungle),The Eagles(Peaceful Easy Feeling),Santana(Oyc Como Va),Townes Van Zandt(Dead Flowers),Big Johnson(Viva Las Vegas),Nina Simone(I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good),Sons Of The Pioneers(Tumbling Tumbleweeds)and more.

It is a film made by movie lovers, for movie lovers, with clearly lots of fun and enthusiasm. It is as much a film-noir as it is a western, a thriller or perhaps a black comedy. Set in middle-of-nowhere Wyoming the film starts with the masculine ex-marine Michael Williams (Cage), with his muscle car on the side of the road. He has almost no gas, only some peanuts as food, and little money.He is on his way to apply for a job at an oilfield. Seemingly a friend told him this job would be a definitive. Williams, however, doesn't get hired due to a war injury. Williams hits the road again, searching for a job in another place. He stops at a local gas station, where he wants to fill his tank and ask for advice. The gas station seems abandoned and at the cash register some cash is exposed&#x85; This is one of the first in many moments where William's moral stance is put to the test. Steal the much needed money or leave it alone and stay broke? Luckily, Williams doesn't have to make a choice; the owner unexpectedly appears. Williams asks for gas and a place where he can find a job. You can try Red Rock says the man, while he fills the tank for five dollars &#x96;the last of William's money.Welcome to Red Rock reads a &#x96;somewhat unsettling- metal sign on the side of the road when Williams enters the town. It is a sign that he will encounter many more times, for it seems that leaving Red Rock isn't as easy as entering it. It is here where it all goes downhill He asks for a job in the local bar, which results in a strange twist of fate. The bartender (J.T. Marsh) thinks Williams is the killer he had hired to murder his cheating wife! The pay for it is big and Williams can't resist the temptation; he accepts the offer. Instead of killing the bartender's wife though, he explains her the whole situation, She, however doesn't seem impressed. She actually wants him to do the reverse and kill her husband for double the money! Williams, now full on cash, tries to avoid problems and take a leave from Red Rock, but by bad luck (or fate?), he keeps finding his way back to the diabolical town. When the real killer (a brilliant Dennis Hopper) shows up and the existence of even more money is discovered, Williams' search for money turns into a rat race, where lust, greed, obsession and violence are no exceptions.As you can read, Red Rock West is a dark film. Every character has its own secret agenda and even Williams'' moral is sometimes quite ambiguous. Although the film is quite funny sometimes, with enough irony and black humor, it is still one of the more serious films starring Nicolas Cage. Cage plays his character quite natural and even has few of his famous freak-outs.The atmosphere of this film is just brilliant. The film is well shot, the music is amazing (too bad I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet), the cast is great, the pace is fast and the plot is gripping. It has many great and exciting scenes and the way the thriller and western genres are combined is very entertaining. Still, somehow, the film never really delivers a form of profoundness, which more memorable and canonical films do provide. It is as if something is missing.Nonetheless, I think Red Rock West is an extremely underrated and overslept film. Don't expect a full blown masterpiece here.

He has almost no gas, only some peanuts as food, and little money.He is on his way to apply for a job at an oilfield. Seemingly a friend told him this job would be a definitive. Williams, however, doesn't get hired due to a war injury. Williams hits the road again, searching for a job in another place. He stops at a local gas station, where he wants to fill his tank and ask for advice. The gas station seems abandoned and at the cash register some cash is exposed&#x85; This is one of the first in many moments where William's moral stance is put to the test. Steal the much needed money or leave it alone and stay broke? Luckily, Williams doesn't have to make a choice; the owner unexpectedly appears. Williams asks for gas and a place where he can find a job. You can try Red Rock says the man, while he fills the tank for five dollars &#x96;the last of William's money.Welcome to Red Rock reads a &#x96;somewhat unsettling- metal sign on the side of the road when Williams enters the town. It is a sign that he will encounter many more times, for it seems that leaving Red Rock isn't as easy as entering it. It is here where it all goes downhill He asks for a job in the local bar, which results in a strange twist of fate. The bartender (J.T. Marsh) thinks Williams is the killer he had hired to murder his cheating wife! The pay for it is big and Williams can't resist the temptation; he accepts the offer. Instead of killing the bartender's wife though, he explains her the whole situation, She, however doesn't seem impressed. She actually wants him to do the reverse and kill her husband for double the money! Williams, now full on cash, tries to avoid problems and take a leave from Red Rock, but by bad luck (or fate?), he keeps finding his way back to the diabolical town. When the real killer (a brilliant Dennis Hopper) shows up and the existence of even more money is discovered, Williams' search for money turns into a rat race, where lust, greed, obsession and violence are no exceptions.As you can read, Red Rock West is a dark film. Every character has its own secret agenda and even Williams'' moral is sometimes quite ambiguous. Although the film is quite funny sometimes, with enough irony and black humor, it is still one of the more serious films starring Nicolas Cage. Cage plays his character quite natural and even has few of his famous freak-outs.The atmosphere of this film is just brilliant. The film is well shot, the music is amazing (too bad I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet), the cast is great, the pace is fast and the plot is gripping. It has many great and exciting scenes and the way the thriller and western genres are combined is very entertaining. Still, somehow, the film never really delivers a form of profoundness, which more memorable and canonical films do provide. It is as if something is missing.Nonetheless, I think Red Rock West is an extremely underrated and overslept film. Don't expect a full blown masterpiece here. Rather expect a very good and entertaining thriller\/western with a great role for Nicolas Cage.As Roger Ebert fittingly concluded his review of the film In a sense, we've been in Red Rock many times before It's a town where plots lie in wait for unsuspecting visitors, where hatred runs deep, where love is never enough of a motive for doing anything when cash is available. And we love it there.

This here not only ranks as one of the best films of the decade but I think a strong argument could be made that it's right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the greatest love stories ever told. The film is flawless from the acting to the directing to the characters and the story. I really don't think I could find a single negative thing to say about this film and what's so shocking is that a mainstream movie could be so brutally honest on so many levels. This film has quite a bit going for it and all of it works perfectly. This includes the fun scenes early on during the basic training all the way up to the darker elements of the picture. I really can't recall too many movies that have such rich characters as this one. This isn't just true of the lead characters but even the smallest ones also have an impact on the story. The real showcase is of course the love story between Gere and Winger and I think it works perfectly well and is very much believable without coming across as fake or forced. The second love story is the one between Gere and Keith, which is something that doesn't get enough credit in the picture. Of course, there's also the Gossett character and his relationship with Gere. The film is certainly all about relationships and how humans deal with one another and their emotions.The performances are certainly some of the best you're going to see. Gere never gets the credit he deserves, which is a real shame but this here is perhaps his greatest performance. Just the way he goes through the various stages of this character is pretty special to watch and he perfectly nails all of it.

Keith is the one who never gets enough credit for his part but we've also got Robert Loggia, Lisa Blount, David Caruso, Grace Zabriskie, Tony Plana and Harold Sylvester doing great work. Gossett certainly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as he turns in one of the more memorable roles of any military officer.Director Taylor Hackford really keeps the film moving at a wonderful pace but he smartly mixes in some laughs with all of the heavy drama.

She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT.All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946 the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS.Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that).One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them.Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed.This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films. Its frank sexuality is decades ahead of its time, and Ingrid Bergman, who was already well-known as one of Hollywood's great beauties, is quite frankly sexy in this film, one of the few times she was allowed to be so overtly carnal.The film has the usual extraordinary twists and turns Hitch was so fond of, and its greatest irony is that the hero (Grant), despite being in love with her, is a real bastard to her for most of the film, while the Nazi criminal she eventually marries not only loves her, his love blinds him to what she is up to.NOTORIOUS has long been a favorite of mine. Ingrid Bergman was a magnificent actress who never really gave a bad performance, but Alicia Huberman was one of her greatest roles and I shall never understand why the Academy did not even see fit to give her a nomination.I should add, in closing, that Bergman is aided and abetted here by one of the best casts Hitch ever assembled. Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible.Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic. And Leopoldine Konstantin as Alex's mother is not only right up there with Angela Lansbury's chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE for sheer evil, but the role was offered first to Ethel Barrymore, who declined it, making her possibly the most fortuitous second choice since Judy Garland won the role of Dorothy because Zanuck refused to loan out Shirley Temple to MGM.

Cary Grant delivers the goods here in a fully fleshed-out performance; his love for Alicia makes him bitter when she goes through with the marriage to Sebastian; the sexual tension between them is incredible.Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian is perfect probably no other actor in Hollywood could have played a Nazi in 1946 and actually make him sympathetic.

","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir, Romance"},{"date":"26 June 2013","score":"","review":" The 1946 Oscars finally recognized the talents of Olivia de Havilland, who had been laboring in Hollywood for more than a decade, watching her less-talented younger sister Joan Fontaine get better parts than she was getting, and winning the Oscar first in the process, while de Havilland (with the exception of GONE WITH THE WIND) had to fight against her radiant beauty as Warner Bros kept using her as arm candy for Errol Flynn.The film she won for was TO EACH HIS OWN, a rather moldy soap opera about a woman who has a child out of wedlock and then spends the rest of the film trying not to tell the young man she is his mother.It's a swell performance, but the movie is not worthy of her; the story was dated even when it was made, and today it is hopelessly antiquated and de Havilland is too good for the movie and upsets its dramatic balance as a result. She would win a well-deserved Oscar three years later for THE HEIRESS, and made a number of other films in this period that would have been more worthy, like THE DARK MIRROR and THE SNAKE PIT.All this digression is my way of leading up to presenting my own choice for Best Actress of 1946 the incomparable Ingrid Bergman in her greatest performance with the possible exception of AUTUMN SONATA, in Alfred Hitchcock's classic espionage tale NOTORIOUS.Bergman's image in Hollywood up to this point was squeaky clean she played either spotless heroines (as in CASABLANCA) or innocent victims (as in GASLIGHT, which won her the Oscar that should have gone to Barbara Stanwyck for DOUBLE INDEMNITY). NOTORIOUS must have given her fans a bit of a shock she plays Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted German spy who has committed suicide in prison. Alicia is no traitor; she loves America and harbors nothing but hatred for her father. She's no angel, either she likes to party and she drinks too much (and it is made fairly clear that she does more than that).One day after a drunken party, she awakens to find that one of her guests has not left a man named Devlin (Cary Grant), who crashed the party and managed to prevent her getting arrested when she insisted on going for a drive three sheets to the wind and a cop stopped them.Alicia realizes this is no ordinary guy. And she is immediately suspicious of him, with good reason he is sizing her up to take on the job of going undercover and involving herself with one of her father's compatriots (Claude Rains), an assignment that ends with her actually marrying the man. In the interim she has fallen in love with Devlin, which places the character in the (for its time) shocking position of being driven by the man she loves into another man's bed.This is one of Hitchcock's most sophisticated films.

Predator would later go on to become a action cult classic on video and DVD. Arnold Schwarzenegger had become a action movie star name after Conan, The Terminator, Commando, and The Running Man. One thing Arnold always did was take chances with original ideas and stories and made them work with his on screen charisma and very large screen presence. Predator is full of pumped up action men on a mission to find some hostages deep in the jungle behind enemy lines. Little do they know they will run into on of the best screen aliens ever to grace the cinema screen. The Predator was designed by Stan Winston with a little help from James Cameron and proves to be a almost unstoppable foe as it hunts down Arnold's team one by one. Predator is well filmed by action director John Mctiernan who would go on a year later to direct arguably the greatest action film ever Die Hard. Predator is fun to watch and filled with terrific one liners by all the cast. Like most films in the 80s the content is graphic and the action never holds back. It is a shame the Predator series went downhill after this first film, the second film has some great set pieces, but something just seemed missing (Arnold) hopefully one day another great predator film will be made with an original plot. I highly recommend Predator for an action \/ science fiction audience. Arnold Schwarzenegger wet on to star in even bigger Action hits Total Recall, Terminator 2, and True Lies. Cementing his status as possibly Hollywood's greatest action hero.

There is this one sick scene where when Howard is flying through his chair, he flies past another duck that is bathing. It showed the boobs of the duck right while he flew by. Isn't that sick or nasty? The other thing was that Howard's lips were barely moving and he had a very expressionless face. It was like torture watching this movie. And here is a plot hole.

Unfortunately &#x96; SPOILERS - all three of these sores survive the carnage and show up for various sequels as well.
