But I felt that what I had seen was very good. Bryan Singer and his production team have overcome pretty formidable odds - fan & studio pressure, reduced time and money, iconic source material, not to mention a last-minute actor replacement (Hugh Jackman for Dougray Scott) - to create a nicely-paced, intriguing, and well-produced fantasy adventure with strong performances, good action scenes, and well-done special effects. Almost as fascinating as the film and the hype has been the aftermath. Mainstream reviews from folks like Roger Ebert and Michael Wilmington at Chicago Tribune have ranged from underwhelmed to outright dislike.  While on the other hand, response in alternative press, sci-fi fansites and fan postings has been overwhelmingly positive. Where lies the schism, I wonder.  Comparing some reviews, I find it almost hard to believe that everyone watched the same movie.  One person accuses the film of drowning in special effects, while another says there are not enough.  A critic decries the lack of character development, while a non-X-Men-comic book fan says they clearly understood each character.I will be the first to admit, the film requires a leap of faith just to accept the initial premise - that genetic mutation would result in divergent and fantastic abilities like weather control and laser-beam eyes.  It seems that everyone's ability to suspend disbelief and buy into the film lies at a different level, a problem that also occurred with Singer's The Usual Suspects (one of my personal favorites). I will also agree that the large number of characters has resulted in unbalanced plot development, with a lot of exposition time and ciphers abounding.  Halle Berry's Storm is an especially unfortunate casualty, barely registering until the action, and then not as tough as her comic book counterpart.  I am guessing a lot of this is due to the 45 minutes the studio had Singer cut from the movie. However, those details did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film, or taking pleasure in what I regarded as its successes. The film benefits enormously from Singer's deliberate decision to play everything straight, without the camp that marred other comic book ventures. When humor does occur, it grows naturally out of the situation and attitudes (CyclopsWhere's my motorcycle;Wolverine You're a dick).  I also liked the fact that the actor's all underplayed their lines.  Amid the fantastic trappings and special effects, over-the-top villainy or histrionic heroism would have destroyed the film. When the action scenes kick in, with digital effects, explosions, morphing, and wire-work kung-fu, Singer still keeps things very straightforward and matter of fact.  He does not dwell upon the fantastic nature of what is going on, nor drag out the fight scenes for the sake of fighting.  Take the initial Wolverine-Sabertooth encounter and subsequent rescue by Storm and Cyclops.  Each being uses their powers according to the rules laid out.  Nothing is delayed for artificial dramatic effect, it just happens.  No one talks when they're fighting, probably cause in real life, no one would. This approach does remove an emotional element from the fight scenes that occurs in other films (i.e. The Matrix), but that is because Singer, as always, has goals that are more intellectual than emotional.  The climatic destruction of Magneto's mutant device and rescue of Rogue is not what interests him the most, but the aftermath and what it says about the characters  Wolverine has proven himself to the team, our novice heroes have had their first trial by fire, Magneto now knows how far Xavier's team will go to stop him.  Again, much of this is inferred.  Singer does not spell it out, which I found to be a welcome change. Though the film generally moves well, it does have an episodic and stop & go quality.  This did not bother me too much, since the original comic books tended to be episodic, though I am guessing part of this is actually due to last-minute re-writing and studio-imposed cutting. Most fascinating for me was the realization of the extent to which X-Men manifested all the fears and fantasies of childhood through adolescence. As children, we often feel small and helpless.  The origin of Magneto's contempt of mankind is traced to the boyhood trauma of watching his parents' killed, an honest fear even I can recall experiencing as a young child. Marie\/Rogue embodies adolescent terrors of puberty, budding sexuality, and the feeling of isolation (which extends to all mutants). At the same time, we see images of what we would like to be.  Cyclops is the handsome, clean-cut hero.  As Xavier's number one guy, he's the jock, prom king, guy who dates the cutest girl in school - we awkward nerds might hate him (as Wolverine does), but we also envy him.  At the same time, Wolverine is that other side boys fantasize about - tough, street-smart, rebellious, a loner.  He's the superhero equivalent of James Dean.  Then there is Professor X - wealthy, all-knowing, all-powerful,  and the guy in charge. The film is dotted with other childhood fantasies running away from home (Rogue), beating up bullies\/authority figures (Mystique to Senator Kelly It's because of people like you I was afraid to go to school), anonymity (Mystique's shape-shifting), powers contrasting one's size or limitations (Professor X is handicapped but telepathic; Toad is ugly, yet a deadly killer).  Returning to a previous thought, if we fear lack of control, then our desire for control is represented by Storm (weather), Professor X (thought), and Jean Grey (matter). Perhaps this explains the split.  Fans tend to be younger than critics; maybe the film speaks clearer to them.  I have noticed that people who have seen the film close to my age (27) or younger have enjoyed it the most. For us, we still feel a bit like X-Men.

I am a huge Hitchcock fan, some of my favorites being North by Northwest, Psycho, Lifeboat, and now this. L.B. Jefferies, known as Jeff by his friends, is wheelchair-bound in his Manhattan apartment, dealing with a broken leg. With nothing else to do but look out the window, he takes to watching the lives of his neighbors around the center courtyard the struggling musician, Miss Torso, the dancer, the eccentric couple with the curious dog, the newlyweds, Miss Lonelyheart, and of course, the Thorwalds, right across the way. Lars Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife become Jeff's focal characters to observe...until Mrs. Thorwald disappears, and Lars becomes progressively suspicious. He quickly involves his uptown girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) who opts to do some investigation, and then involves his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Helpless in his apartment, he works through them and the moderate help from his friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), a detective. Questions continue to arise, and Jeff, Lisa, Stella, and Doyle seem to be coming to a conclusion. Yet, this is Hitchcock, and our team of protagonists aren't close to just solving the case and moving on. Oh no, the last twenty minutes or so prove to unbearably suspenseful as Lisa investigates the Thornwald's apartment while it's unoccupied, and Jeff and Stella watch helplessly as Lars comes home....This truly is an amazing film. James Stewart and Grace Kelly give amazing performances, and Thelma Ritter is wonderful as the witty nurse. The vignettes on the lives of each of Jeff's neighbors are all quite interesting, and I found Miss Lonelyheart's story in particular to be absolutely wonderful. I also loved how Jeff was helpless, while the two women were off doing what one would think to be the man's role in the movie. Lisa, particular, is quite an innovative character. First of all, she's very funny. I love when Jeff is telling her the rough aspects of a traveling photographers life, and how when he asks her something in the way if she had ever been 5000 feet up, struggling to stay warm in twenty below zero weather, and she replies, Well, when I get a few minutes after lunch.... She also takes that role of the elegant uptown girl and admits her sophistication and perfection, like when Jeff comments on how she never wears the same dress twice, and Lisa notes light-heartedly, Only because it's expected of her me. And then, when she takes all those risks to uncover the truth in the end. Not only could I not sit still, I was so scared (which is rare for me with most horror movies) but I was amazed at how she proved that she wasn't afraid to risk anything. Now, that's one hell of a heroine, and perhaps the greatest Hitchcock woman ever.I also loved Stella. She had some of the greatest lines in the movie, and I love when she's commenting to Lisa and Jeff on the probable gory details of Lars's act. She was definitely memorable with all her witty lines, and had me laughing many times.And of course, James Stewart gave a great performance, conveying that feeling of helplessness, and near claustrophobia being in that apartment, unable to do anything, and just as he's safe in his apartment watching everyone, he goes through hell trying to figure out what to do when Lars comes home while Lisa is still at his apartment.

Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles were great in their roles as Hamlet and Ophelia.  Better yet, I love how this movie paid attention to and portrayed their relation.  The development of Ophelia, combined with Stiles' acting, in this movie is the best I've seen.  Ethan Hawke is a wonderful brooder, an essential trait to play Hamlet.  In addition, I like how they interpreted some of the scenes.  For instance, after Hamlet kills Polonius and is berating Gertrude, he finishes the dialogue from the scene in a phone call.  Other recognitions  The ghost is well-played and appears at appropriate, albeit not necessarily scripted, times.  The abandonment of the English accent is welcome and is of great assistance in trying to following Shakespeare's script.  And the incorporation of modern times w\/ a play written for a setting of the 16th(?) century is well-done, although it is a little overdone.As for my complaints, there really is too much script that is cut.  First and foremost, although I recognize the need to avoid a trying, 5 hour sleep session of a movie, attempting to squeeze Hamlet into 111 minutes is impossible without butchering some of the play....I mean, geez, just go ahead and make the movie 3 hours before you cut too many important scenes.  It seems as if everyone has to have either a 5-hour or 2-hour version.  There's a happy medium there, use it. If they wouldn't have cut so much, I would have loved this movie.  Second, I believe Bill Murray was badly miscast as Polonius.  He failed miserably to portray Polonius as the laughable oaf that he is.  Third, advertisements were about to make me puke.  One minute the ghost is there, the next, you're focused on nothing but a Pepsi One vending machine. Hamlet gives his To-be-or-not-to-be speech with nothing but Blockbuster videos in the backround(although it was in the Action section which was a nice touch), how inapprapriate is that blatant advertising.  I missed the entire speech cause I was so ticked about the backround.  Admittedly, these ads might be placed to emphasize the consumerism of our society, but please, it's still way out of place, destroying the mood for their prospective scenes.  And finally, the final swordfight scene was unconvincing.  Perhaps the modern setting fails at this point, but couldn't they do better than a fencing match.  How intense is that?!I've been critical, but overall I think this movie is an extremely original take on Hamlet and is a must see for any Shakespeare fan.  7\/10.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"17 July 2000","score":"","review":"  This Hamlet really has its very good points and very bad points. I'll start with the good.  Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles were great in their roles as Hamlet and Ophelia.  Better yet, I love how this movie paid attention to and portrayed their relation.  The development of Ophelia, combined with Stiles' acting, in this movie is the best I've seen.  Ethan Hawke is a wonderful brooder, an essential trait to play Hamlet.  In addition, I like how they interpreted some of the scenes.  For instance, after Hamlet kills Polonius and is berating Gertrude, he finishes the dialogue from the scene in a phone call.  Other recognitions  The ghost is well-played and appears at appropriate, albeit not necessarily scripted, times.  The abandonment of the English accent is welcome and is of great assistance in trying to following Shakespeare's script.  And the incorporation of modern times w\/ a play written for a setting of the 16th(?) century is well-done, although it is a little overdone.As for my complaints, there really is too much script that is cut.

A note to said fanatics if you want a truly pure adaptation of a comic this complex, you're talking about a five-hour film that costs 200 million dollars or more. The filmmakers have retained the most vital aspect of the comic its spirit.Going in I was concerned that, with so many complex characters to introduce and get to know, the film's creators would have trouble fitting it all in and not sacrifice story. Fortunately, Bryan Singer and writer David Hayter understood that, even though this is a team of super heroes, there would need to be a central character or two that are the story's focus. Even better, they choose perhaps the two most interesting X-Men to build the story around Wolverine and Rogue.It's no wonder that Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, is one of the most popular characters ever drawn in a comic book. For one thing, the foot-long claws made of an indestructible metal (called adamantium) that shoot out of his knuckles (SNIKT!) that he has trouble controlling at times. Along with the claws, his entire skeleton is laced with the same adamantium. Much of his life is a mystery to him--he doesn't remember how the metal got there, nor even where or when he was born. And I haven't even gotten to what his real super power is he heals really fast (but still feels pain) and has the heightened senses and reflexes of a wild animal. For my money, perhaps the coolest comic book character ever created. Like the other mutants of the X-Men, his powers are both a blessing and a curse. The claws and metal-laced bones come in handy when he gets into a tussle, but they also leave him at the mercy of the X-Men's archenemy Magneto, who controls all metals.In the film, Rogue (Anna Paquin), a teen who has just discovered that she is a mutant, runs away from home and ends up in western Canada, where she comes across Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). This struck me as a huge coincidence, the kind that only a movie can get away with. But then it occurred to me that Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart), the X-Men's leader, may have placed a hypnotic suggestion in Rogue's mind to go to the Canadian Rockies, to the exact town Wolverine was in. I figure this because, in the film's first big action sequence, the two of them run across some bad mutants, Sabretooth and Toad, and are rescued by two of Professor X's students, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry). I suppose the writer thought we'd figure all this out for ourselves. While all the other mutants in Charles Xavier's school have powers that are useful, Rogue's seem at first only a curse any person she touches, she absorbs their life force, plus their personality traits and super powers, if any. This leaves the person she touches weakened and, depending on how long the contact lasts, comatose or dead. The prospect of a life without the possibility of real human contact is unimaginable, especially for a teenager.As the story progresses, we find out that Magneto has plans for Rogue. Wolverine adopts her as sort of a big brother and swears to protect her. He has every reason to fear Magneto, but bravely faces up to him anyway (Who laced your bones with that wonderful metal? Magneto's question to Logan, is one of the weirdest lines you're likely to hear in a movie all year). Logan\/Wolverine also finds himself siding with Magneto in a way, seeing that humanity is getting ready to wage war on their kind. This is consistent with the comic, and makes Logan difficult for the rest of the team to trust. Magneto (Ian McKellan-perfect casting), is in the process of recruiting mutants to join him in his planned counter-offensive against the rest of humanity. Driving the political steamroller against the mutants is U.S. Senator Robert Kelly, who believes, among other things, that mutant teens should be banned from public schools because they can be considered lethal weapons (a very timely issue to introduce). It's hard not to empathize with Magneto's view he's seen what happens when a government turns against an entire race, having survived a Polish concentration camp in WWII (illustrated in the film's gripping opening scene). All signs point to a witch-hunt aimed at the mutants and he's not going to stand around and watch it happen. His plan doesn't even involve killing. He's not out for world domination, but merely wishes to change people's thinking. Xavier knows that bloodshed is inevitable, however, given Magneto's 'By Any Means Necessary' position.The film's not perfect. It's based on a comic, so it has to be campy at times. There's also a few story flaws. For instance, when Rogue runs away from Xavier's school for the gifted, Xavier needs to use a machine that enhances his psychic powers, called 'Cerebro,' to locate her, even though she's only a few blocks away at the train station. Cyclops and Storm are sent to find her and are again confronted with Sabretooth and Toad (a minor character in the comic, but causes major trouble for the X-Men here). Then Xavier gets the police involved, using them only as a shield and endangering their lives as a result. I'm pleased with this scene because it's almost as if the police aren't even there, just like the comic would do. The only scene where Xavier and Magneto really do battle, it's one of the film's best and most imaginative. Then Mystique, another Magneto loyalist, flies in and picks Magneto and company up in a helicopter. Why would a guy as powerful as Magneto need to escape in a helicopter? There's also a brief ode to Star Wars, seemingly for the benefit of those who actually liked Episode I, in which Ray Park, who plays Toad, strikes a Darth Maul pose. Tacky and unnecessary.Like the comic, Professor Xavier's team is still a work-in-progress, still learning how to work together and to use their own super powers. This vulnerability creates jeopardy and gives the franchise somewhere to go over the course of the series (there will be several of these films, I'm sure), they'll master their powers and teach newcomers how to use theirs.

Last night, free on TV, I spent the 90 minutes watching, hoping for something thrilling. Nothing ever came.Heather, Mike and Josh, actors, play Heather, Mike, and Josh, characters. They are students doing a project and get lost in the woods, camping there several nights. There is absolutely *zero* character development, *zero* inventiveness in dialog, and *zero* believability in their plight.

It sets out to be cold, and it is. I'm not particularly fond of the direction or the score, but the performances are solid and the overall subtlety makes it all feel real, perhaps a bit too real.Admittedly, when I watch a movie I generally expect something different. Something that I can't see in real life, or something that depicts real life in a way I find interesting (I thoroughly enjoyed The Sweet Hereafter). To me, this movie did  not deliver. It's slow, the characters are in their majority uninteresting, and I can't care about any of them or their lives. And the so-called ice storm... it was just background. IMHO the film would've been just as cold without it.Additionally, I didn't find anything in it that could make me think. It's about real people with boring, troubled lives. My own life is more interesting, and I'm better off thinking about the direction of my own life and the consequences of my own actions than about the dysfunctional lives of these fictional characters, none of which I could identify with. Surely the novel by Rick Moody must be better. I recommend this film to older people who had similar experiences during the 70's, and people in general who enjoy this kind of real-life drama. However, if you're like me and expect something fantastic, insightful, special or just plain fun in a film, go somewhere else. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2000","score":"","review":"  I don't know what to say about this movie.

I couldn't help myself )As for the movie, I was quite impressed with what, in my humble opinion, has to be the best comic book adaptation yet.  Many fans of the comics were understandably worried about this movie.  After all, we've waited a long time through rumours of it's production, stories about setbacks, even the occasional rumour that the attempt was being cancelled altogether (why does it seem so difficult to make a movie of a Stan Lee comic while DC comics are turning into movies left right and center?).However, after seeing the first teaser trailers several months ago, the X-citement (sorry again) began to build.  Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier? Ian McKellan as Magneto?  How can you go wrong with that?After seeing the movie, I was very impressed.  After all, it's often difficult to adapt such larger-than-life comic book heroes and their trials and tribulations to the big screen.  In comics and cartoons you can get away with much more, in the movies it seems to be much more difficult to suspend disbelief and yet retain the flavour of the comic.  The movie did an admirable job by taking one of the older stories of the X-Men's fight against Senator Kelly's attempted pogrom against mutants and adapting it to reflect today's current woes of racism and prejudice.The casting was terrific, from the aforementioned Stewart and McKellan roles to that of newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  He was spot-on as the surly, short-tempered maverick of the X-Men and he even looked the part, although with those sideburns, almost anyone can look the part.  We even got a look at how Magneto came to be and why he'd be so twisted by the plight of mutants.  It's a shame we couldn't see more character development for the other X-Men, but it's difficult to do when you've only got 2 hours to work with when the comic had several years to develop the history of these people.  Perhaps the inevitable sequels will give us a better glimpse at how each X-Man came to be.In all, I found the movie to be very enjoyable, I was even able to ignore for a little while the fact that it was shown in what has to be Prince George's worst theatre, worn-out seats, stained screens, overly salty popcorn, and an outdated sound system.If you're a fan of the X-Men, go see it (although, I don't really have to tell you that do I?), if you're not a fan, you just may become one afterwards.  I'm already looking forward to a sequel where we may meet some of the other X-Men, Hank McCoy (The Beast), Gambit, Morph, maybe even a cameo from Spidey himself.
