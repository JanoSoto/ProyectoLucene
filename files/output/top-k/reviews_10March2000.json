This is good but apparently the plot to this film went on another mission and left the crew of this castaway film drifting with no direction. Lots of pretty spaceships float about and cool gear fill this film but the heart of it is as cold as the vast space it occupies. All the while I was just waiting to hear Blue Danube fill the soundtrack. At one time I thought Depalma was a great director but now he has just became a Francis Ford Coppala ala Jack. What has happened to the talent that these great directors once had?  Visionaries in the seventies, demographic whores in the nineties.  All signs pointed to this film as being good.  Marketing, word of mouth, and press were all very enthusiastic about this film.  But it just goes to show what Disney's financial backing of a film can do to drive your advertising over the top.  I went into this film with aspirations of trying to relive a moment of my youth, another Star Wars moment, if you will. Immediately, I realized that this film was not going to be anything that I expected it to be.  Assembled are a good group of actors.  Sinise and Robbins, both have proven that they are good actors with critical acclaim. But really, was the rent due this month or what?  Why did they choose to be a part of this film?  I felt no emotional attachment with any of the characters.  Even Robbins and his wife seem distant, as if they had just met that day on the set.  Each character has their typical trademark.  Sinise, with his sly grin.  Robbins, with his patriotic ramblings.  Not to mention O'Connell, with his awe shucks, we're going into space attitude.  Once we have actually reached our destination of Mars,  many of the original characters are either gone, or disappear from the film for long periods of time.  Characters unravel one mind boggling conundrum after the other without batting an eye.  Come on, you're trying to tell me that Jerry O'Connell plays a part in discovering the origins of life?So in closure, avoid this movie if at possible.  But if you, like me are unavoidably attracted to car crashes, or train wrecks, then you might just enjoy seeing the tragedy that has become Brian DePalma's career.

The World is Not Enough is the second Brosnan flick that I have seen (this is actually his third) and I have to say, I don't give a damn who plays James.  Brosnan is fine, but if they replace him tomorrow, I don't care.  In this venture our hero must protect an heiress from some nasty thugs that will stop at nothing to kill her.  The typical ski chase plays out, and this time the dome in London, England is a backdrop to some hot action.  Sophie Marceau plays the heiress and Denise Richards is the Bond girl of the day, a smart doctor who helps Bond when the going gets tough. The Iron Curtain has been dismantled for years now but Russian accents still permeate the script.  Nuclear war heads are flying everywhere and James still has an eye for the trashy ladies.  What I did like about this effort was the extended use of the great Judi Dench.  Since her big Oscar turns over the past couple of years I suppose the makers of this Bond felt obligated to take her out of the Charlie Townsend role of giving the assignment, warning Bond not to go too far, and congratulating him in the end for a job well done.  This time she is partly responsible for the events that take place, and she is left to her own devices when she is taken hostage by the bad guys.  As an action film, this one tends to deliver.  As per usual, the stunts are spectacular, the chicks are hot, and of course the plot is secondary.  Bond fans will probably get some satisfaction out of this one, but I wonder how often the closing tag, '007 Will Return', will actually hold true.

The previews made this film look interesting, but with a lot of movies I have seen recently, they seemed to have put all the good stuff in the preview to get people to go. I will give credit where credit is due and say that the special effects in this film were phenominal. Even the actors did the best job that they could do with the material they had on hand. However, the plot was so full of holes that it made little sense in the end. I am a BIG fan of sci-fi movies, and I would have to compare this film more to movies like 2001 than Star Wars, which might be why I was not so entertained by it. Still, 2001 was groundbreaking for when it was made, and Mission To Mars is far from that. If they would have marketed this film as a more cerebral sci-fi film instead of a special-effects ladened adventure, I think I would have gone in expecting less and feeling better about it. My advice for this film is wait to see a matinee or until it comes out on DVD or video. Hopefully the DVD version of this film will have deleted scenes or commentary at least to explain elements of the film that left me wondering just what the script writers were thinking when they wrote it.

I could live with the story as I enjoy a mindless piece of trash as much as the next guy, but the execution sucks big time, just like the creature in the film. The screenplay is full of horrible macho dialogue and supposedly funny one-liners which only turn out to be extremely annoying. The cast does what it can, I mean, how could someone actually give an award-worthy (Razzies excluded, of course) performance in such a film? Famke Janssen looks nice, but that's all. And the effects... for a movie with such a huge budget, the effects seem really cheap. Where did all the money go? It wasn't spent on the screenplay or the cast. The creature itself is quite hilarious and I found myself laughing at points which were most likely planned to be the scary bits. And the ship, it sure did explode nicely at the end... I guess I could go on forever, but the main point is that Deep Rising is a horrible movie and that it looks like one of those stupid made-in-three-weeks TV movies.

In particular, the scene in which Gary Sinise's character was viewing home videos of his wife features a shot of the two of them in zero gravity.  Their heads might as well have been pasted onto cartoons of their bodies floating in midair.  Also in this scene, there is a close-up of Sinise in which his eyeliner and lipstick were very noticeable. He looked like Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. What disappointed me most about this movie is that I expected to enjoy it.  The concept was great, the cast excellent, and the effects well done.

In particular, the scene in which Gary Sinise's character was viewing home videos of his wife features a shot of the two of them in zero gravity.  Their heads might as well have been pasted onto cartoons of their bodies floating in midair.  Also in this scene, there is a close-up of Sinise in which his eyeliner and lipstick were very noticeable. He looked like Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. What disappointed me most about this movie is that I expected to enjoy it.  The concept was great, the cast excellent, and the effects well done.  The plodding pace and poor dialogue ruined what could easily have been an enjoyable movie experience.

There is such a f*ck-all attitude about the film with it's witches and stonehenge, and deadly masks. The music is perfect and the casts all virtual unknowns make this more fun than it should be.

The fact that a movie could suggest that the problem with America today is a profoundly spiritual one is something worth celebrating. So is a movie that forgets car chases and violent explosions and really explores the small details of our everyday lives.I found the movie so riveting that I forgot to even eat my popcorn! It was a beautiful fusion of an intelligent script, fine cinematography, and (mostly) wonderful acting. Kevin Spacey's performance was a marvel in the most economical way, just with his mouth and eyes, he conveys rage, sarcasm, despair, sneaky triumph, and yes, even tenderness. The change in his posture from slumpy to buffed was wonderful. The young actors were also brilliant, particularly Wes Bentley, who is so incendiary you just know that he has a huge career in front of him (Yeah, keep after me, Dad).  The only wrong note in the acting, I thought, was struck by Annette Benning she seemed to be overacting (except for the moments when she was drunk and was at her softest). I know her character was tightly wound, but it could have been portrayed more subtly.I thought the script had a few flaws, too.  The story was strong enough that it almost didn't need the suggestion of murder and the whodunnit' hook.  There were a few contrivances that were almost sitcom-like (for instance, what Colonel Fitts thought he saw through the window vs. what was really going on). Perhaps that's because the writer, Alan Ball, apparently got his start in TV.  But that didn't prevent the whole film, particularly the ending, from being deeply moving.  I saw this film last fall, and am still thinking about it now, months later.  That's great moviemaking!

Just because a film was made for little money does not make it a great movie(it's not how much you spend but how much you put into a film).  This movie is inconclusive when judging the directors abilities as one horror movie hit does not make a great director.  I believe that the two directors have to do more films before passing judgement on how good they how.  I think it is silly to compare them with the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Tod Browning, and other great directors of horror films as The Blair Witch Project might be the only decent movie that they will ever make.One problem I have with the movie is there is nothing to remember.  There are no scenes or lines that stand out and make people remember it for.  The movie was like a one and a half hour whale watch trip(the experience was similar to attending a whale watch as a person starts to feel sick).  What I hate about this movie was that it seemed that the directors did not any artistic vision and this is the main problem of the film as I feel that nothing emotionlly was put into it(a bad thing is when two people direct as they have different styles while one director would use a style that the crew can get familar with).  BWP is not a scary movie and anyone who says so is not a real horror movie fan who've seen real horror films but mostly Johnny come latelys.  The success of this film worldwide proves that the human being are becoming more dumber and idiotic and that no one has any taste for great art anymore(we have mostly tase for art of mediocrity). The art of greatness is dead, but the art of mediocrity is alive.
