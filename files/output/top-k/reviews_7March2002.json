[{"date":"7 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What a disappointment. Danny Boyle had recently directed one of my favorite films of the last few years, Trainspotting, and although Leonardo DiCaprio has never been between the actors I liked, I had somewhat high expectations for The Beach. It turned out that DiCaprio's acting is actually the best thing about this clunker.To say that The Beach didn't have the space to develop its ideas would be wrong. The movie is based on a book by Alex Garland, and while I never read the book, I must say that the concept the movie seems based on could be interesting. The search for a new way of living outside our society and considerations on the impossibility to find the perfect Paradise on Earth are captivating, and as a nature lover I must say that it is really rare that pro-ecology undertones don't appeal me. However, these themes were treated in such a vapid, superficial and often hypocritical way in The Beach that when the movie was over I was not just bored, I was irritated.I am not blaming the author of the book. In fact, it could be that the novel is a good read. But if the movie is a good adaptation of it, then I am sure I will skip on the book for the rest of my life.The Beach opens in Bangkok; Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American man, is here on vacation. In the hotel he meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking lunatic who shows him the map to an island where, it seems, it's possible to find the most beautiful place on Earth. Richard doesn't pay much attention to him, but when the next morning he finds that Daffy had killed himself, he steals the map and wonders if this beach really exists. Finally he decides to take a chance and, along with a young French couple, he takes a trip to the fabled island.To this point, the film is not particularly good, but it is at least interesting. But as soon as the movie gets to the beach, everything starts going downhill and it never stops, reaching the worst with the awful finale.When the three young tourists get to the beach, they get to know that they are not alone. A small village of young men and women already lives here, and although it seems like a disappointment at first (at least judging from DiCaprio's voice-over), when Richard and the French couple get to know them and their way of living, they begin to be very fascinated. The small village, it is said (more on this later), is self-sufficient and they can live without any contact with the outside. The problem is, if anything happens, they are on their own.The movie puts in some romance between the French girl, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and Richard, and some time is spent on the consequent grief of Françoise's boyfriend. The romance however, fails to generate any sparks, and the focus on Françoise's boyfriend anger is shifted off so abruptly he practically disappears from the movie. However, as uninteresting as the romance is, it is not nearly as bad as most of the rest.First of all, there is not one likable character. Most of them are either paper-thin, irritating, spoiled, and usually all things together. There is much talk about how these young people are self-sufficient, and yet we see that they are not they hardly do anything all day. Richard himself has to go on the outside world to buy goods for the island community, and most of these goods are the typical unnecessary comforts many tourists look for when going on vacation. The people on the island play video games and buy beer; it's never shown where they put their trash. In many scenes the movie looks like a Club Med commercial, and it is a pity since the problems of a small society truly living on its own never get the possibility of being delved into.During the course of the movie, two characters are attacked by a shark. One dies in a brief time, the other is left dying in the woods because, it seems, the island community doesn't want people on the outside to know about them. Deus ex machina anyone? How does bringing a man to the hospital immediately connect to revealing where the community is? And when the members of the community go to play volleyball while their friend is left dying, one would at least expect that it is a starting point to show how they will be unable to cope with their own sense of guilt. It never happens.In a completely different scene, Richard suddenly loses his mind without apparent motivation, and one has to wonder what it is all about. And after some nonsense that leads to the killing of four tourists who reached the island, he snaps perfectly awake again. Absurd.And when Richard finally gets back to 'normal' society, we see him thinking about the island with nostalgia. That's right. Puh-lease.Stylistically, this movie is a huge step back from Trainspotting for Boyle. The music is barely tolerable, the cinematography relies on the beautiful scenery but puts in some inappropriately silly scenes, such as Richard transforming into a video game hero while walking in the forest. The performances, apart from DiCaprio's (pretty good, but not very good) range from average to bad. But what's most disappointing is the treatment of the subject matter. Trainspotting had ideas, characters and story. The Beach has ideas that never get developed, irritating characters, and a story that barely stays together.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What a disappointment.

I first read the Lord of the Rings when I was seven years old. It was a book that changed my life, expanded my mind, and made me want to be a writer as well. I've reread it at least half a dozen times since, always finding something new that made me think and appreciate the trilogy all over again. So, in all honesty I would be impossible to satisfy completely, no matter how good the movie is.Just to be a gentleman, (no snickering please), I'll go over the good things in the movie first. Beyond good is Ian McKellan's performance as Gandalf. It was better than I could have expected, and nobody could have done it better. Also excellent is the scenery used, whether it's the Shire, Rivendell, Moria or Lothlorien. Most of the performances for the members of the Fellowship are also good; Sean Astin is nearly perfect as the determined, lovable, sometimes bumbling Sam Gamgee. Elijah Woods, not my favorite actor by any stretch of the imagination, did a decent job as Frodo. He came across as a little wishy-washy, but one can always hope for improvement in the following movies. Merry and Pippin came across well on screen, although they changed Merry's character into a virtual clone of Pippin, something he was not in the book. Orlando Bloom captured Legolas perfectly; everything from the way he moves, talks, and fights is exactly as it should be. Christopher Lee does quite well as Saruman, although he is perhaps given a little too screen time and weight this early in the story. The special effects, particularly in Moria and Isengard, but also elsewhere, are just about perfect. Also, I was surprised by the performance of Liv Tyler. I've always felt her acting ability to be anywhere from fair, (at best), to downright awful, but she did well in the role of Arwen Evenstar and gave some meat to the role.Next are the things I'm indifferent to. This includes Viggo Mortensen playing Aragon. Sorry, but he's just not it. Maybe it's because the only other role I've ever seen him in is Lucifer in The Prophecy, but he's just not Strider to. He captures the rougher side well enough, but lacks the nobility and even majesty that made Aragon one of the greatest forces in Middle-Earth even with no more than the clothes on his back. A younger Liam Neeson, perhaps from the Rob Roy days or even a little earlier would have been much better. The scene for the council of Elrond could have been better. The scene is a crucial one in the book, and is presented as an intelligent conversation on several levels between many different people, and also serves the function of introducing the reader to the larger picture in Middle Earth, letting us see the tide of great events taking place apart from the Fellowship's travels. This is completely left out in the movie, and is instead presented as a childish squabble that made me, at least, want to slap everyone present for it. The parts of Boromir and Gimli were overblown a bit in the way they were presented. Also, I have to wonder where Jackson came up with Elrond's seeming loathing of humans, something definitely not in the books.Now we come the stuff I flat out hated. Number one being the scenes with Galadriel. Oh my God, but Jackson screwed that whole sequence up! Instead of being wise, serene, and knowing Galadriel came off as a melodramatic witch who seemed more like an enemy of the Fellowship than an ally. Particularly bad were the mirror scene and the temptation of Galadriel with the ring. And when I say bad, I don't just mean awkward or overdone, as many parts were, but hands on your ears, eyes averted in horror bad. I watched this movie twice at the theaters, and the second time I lied about having to go to the bathroom just to avoid seeing this part. This is particular painful for me because I loved the interaction with Galadriel in the book and the foreshadowing of the end of the Elves. The second thing I hate is much more general. This is the modern clichés that were thrown in. The best examples being Galadriel's line about how Even the smallest person can change the world (oh, how inspiring!), Boromir's kissing up to Aragorn while he's dying, and Gimli's Let's go hunt some orcs! line. These represented to me a larger problem that seemed somewhat evident through the whole movie, a certain lack of faith in the books, or that the books alone were enough. Many of the moments in the book that had real heart or that were truly touching were changed and often overdone so that instead of a quiet premise or atmosphere we get it driven home with a sledgehammer. To me, this amounts to a subtle, well-meaning betrayal of the story. And for all those who bring out the tired argument that things have to dumbed down or simplified for people who haven't read the books or are new to the story, well, we were all new to the story at some point or another, and managed just fine!In short, I guess I have to say that the movie wasn't as good as I could have hoped for, but was definitely better than I feared it might be.

And for all those who bring out the tired argument that things have to dumbed down or simplified for people who haven't read the books or are new to the story, well, we were all new to the story at some point or another, and managed just fine!In short, I guess I have to say that the movie wasn't as good as I could have hoped for, but was definitely better than I feared it might be. It gets a 7.5 out of 10.

New Line's first attempt at a comic book franchise in the Batman ilk is a stylish, loud and highly entertaining escapist film, enhanced by superb combat scenes and a drastically macho performance from star Wesley Snipes.  A vampire superhero is an exciting premise for movie and comic book fans alike and fortunately Blade delivers the necessary punch required in this genre, one that often misses the mark on the big screen.Blade draws on some famous figures of popular culture, including Batman, The Crow and Dracula.  Vampires have held huge appeal for cinemagoers for decades, so coupling this with a vengeful Batman-style vigilante results in a character who we have empathy for but are also frightened by.  Wesley Snipes' hushed tough guy acting style delivers, despite his one-dimensionality near the film's end.Blade is introduced in a fighting scene at the start of the film.   This opening scene is effectively shot.  It sets the tone of the film perfectly with its pumping electronic soundtrack, quick cuts and over-stylised mise en scene.  Blade deals to the bad guys with surprisingly fluid and effective martial arts, as well as his arsenal of semi automatic weapons and throwing knives and, of course, stakes.  No gore is spared in this opening scene, in fact the whole film is a gore-fest.  It's the type of film Fangora fans would drool over.From here the story reads very much like a comic book.  The vampires are presented as an underground corporation of super-humans who live, for obvious reasons, in the shadows and conduct their business like a multinational.  Blade saves a pathologist named Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) who was unfortunate enough to be bitten by a vampire.  She comes up with a cure to make Blade a human (he currently survives on injections of serum), but just as his cure is around the corner a new vampire leader named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) plans to take over the world in a diabolical scheme to resurrect a &#145;Blood God'.  Silly is the right word, but in this genre it works well.Blade's human sidekick is Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson.  Whistler's got an air of the Old West about him and the duality between his character and the cold and urbane Blade works effectively well.  Of all the other characters apart from Blade, Whistler is the most believeable.  Wright's character is drastically underdone.  She pouts from scene to scene and does not offer much in the way of dramatic delivery.  Dorff's Frost is deliciously over the top and while the scrawny thesp holds his own, his physical presence cannot match Snipes for a second.  Udo Kier, who many people will recognise from vampire movies of the 1970s, plays an interesting role as the slightly camp Dragonetti, leader of the &#145;pure' vampires.  All characters, including Blade, are given minimal time to develop, but this is an action movie, so we forgive director Stephen Norrington for this failure.The special effects in Blade are very good as is the art direction, set design and makeup.  The film is tightly edited and shot in a series of blue, yellow and white filters and Norrington often employs a level of colour de-saturation to emphasise the Vampires' pasty complexions.  The soundtrack is effective and is generally thumping deep trance, in keeping with the violence and action the film delivers in large doses.  There is plenty of blood and guts, including some slightly disturbing scenes involving a UV lamp and a rising sun.  By the conclusion of the film we feel that any more action would deter from the film's effectiveness.

I left the theater surrounded by people complaining that they didn't get it, or that the ending was just a ploy reel us into the next two, or even that the ending was stupid, just stopping like it did and not knowing of the sequels. But, the movie ended just the way the book did. No ploy. And why wouldn't you want to see the next two? People also say the movie was way to long. I say, not long enough! Everyone is too tainted by the MTV split-second action flash bang crazy crap to have the attention to sit that long. Peter Jackson couldn't have done better with 3 hours than he did, with the books being so rich. Liberties were taken, and they have to be. What we watched was Jackson's interpretation of the books. He could not have matched our expectations, but he took a good shot at it. One very confusing thing in the movie was the two humans. They looked very much alike and i got them mixed up a few times.I admired Jackson for using the B-movie technique of force-perspective to make the hobbits short. It is completely seemless. Gandalf is towering believably over Bilbo in their scenes in the Shire. Christopher Lee stars in the role he was born for in Saruman, and Ian McKellan plays Gandalf, the somewhat tempermental but caring wizard, just the way i wanted. Throughout the movie, we are treated to massively massive outdoor shot of Middle Earth, some of armies, some of orcs hoards, and some of snow covered peaks. These are not empty special effects shots. It's not like Godzilla (1998), where it seems they just wanted to see what they could do with Maya and a bagillion dollars. These huge scenic shots do help the story. Are we going to believe that the wars were as big as Tolkien said without seeing them? Probably not. Saruman's Orc Factory would have just looked like Frankenstein's lab if not for that one amazing sweeping shot that shows all of them. This movie took the scenic shots that D.W. Griffith's  Birth of a Nation pioneered in 1915 and one-upped them. Yes, many movies use extreme long shots, but they never were as striking to me as they are here.People who thought this film was boring probably recognize a fun movie if it slapped them in the face. This is a fun movie. If you went to see without any prior knowledge of the series, you were probably left stupified. The Avenger (1998) fell flat because it was based on an obscure british tv show from the 60's, oh, and it was bad. Get in the know, then watch it again. I left the theater with a smile from ear to ear, wishing that the next film would be out the next day. I almost went to see it again, but it was getting pretty late.

It's not like Godzilla (1998), where it seems they just wanted to see what they could do with Maya and a bagillion dollars. These huge scenic shots do help the story. Are we going to believe that the wars were as big as Tolkien said without seeing them? Probably not. Saruman's Orc Factory would have just looked like Frankenstein's lab if not for that one amazing sweeping shot that shows all of them. This movie took the scenic shots that D.W.

Lestat has been lonely too long; he decided to roam the earth in light among mortals. Against all other vampires consent, he became a rock star and exposed himself as a vampire, not to mention sharing deep vampire secrets to the mortal world. If you have read the book, Lestat has exposed himself before by becoming an actor in a theatre.In the movie, Lestat was made by Marius, who left him in despair and loneliness, but not after he taught Lestat enough lessons to live in shadows amongst mortals. You might understand Lestat's loneliness and his delicious pompous b**tard attitude more if you read the book and realize that he was in fact made by Magnus, who killed himself just after he transform Lestat into a vampire. Lestat was probably one of the only vampires forced to roam the mortal world without proper introduction to vampirism.So, what is the movie got to do with the Queen of the Damned? Basically, Lestat awakens Akasha who wants to rule the earth with demonic powers again as she did in the old days. Akasha, or She Who must be Kept is well portrayed by Aaliyah, although I must say, she does not have to be in this movie. I mean, she's only appearing in probably 15 minutes of the whole movie! I think they should just call this movie The Vampire Lestat and dedicate another separate movie to Queen of the Damned. Anyway, salute to Aaliyah who is very beautiful and graceful as well as demonic as Akasha. even though she could try a more Egyptian accent instead of the usual Vlad Dracul's Romanian\/Hungarian accent...And finally, the rest of the characters. hmm. what can I say about the rest? Why oh why do you have to portray Marius to be so gay? I thought that Vincent Perez would be a good choice to play Marius, but Marius is not gay.

First of all, this movie, which is far too short than its predecessor, Interview with the Vampire, is trying to capture both essence from The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. I mean, if it takes more than two hours to describe one book in 'Interview' how could they thought to achieve 2 books in a less than two hours movie.Nevertheless, it is, like I said, a tribute to Goths and as a Goth, I truly appreciate the music, the depiction of the band, Davis' cool voice and Stuart's wonderful stage performance. Stuart, you should really try forming a Goth band!!I truly despised the depiction of Lestat's tenderness towards Jesse by the end of the movie. This is not the Lestat I know, this is not the Lestat that was portrayed earlier in the movie. The Lestat that was afraid to bite when he sees blood. hello? What's going on here? And the Lestat that fly with too many sequences, especially the scene where he took Jesse for a flight. it made me think of Superman!Oh, and the ending, where he walks hand in hand with Jesse, saying hello to David Talbot. what can I say. this movie is really just worth to watch to hear great music and see beautiful people like Stuart and Aaliyah.

He is somewhat excentric, but does have a friend named David Filby, played by Mark Addy. The interaction of Pearce and his home characters (he has a housekeeper named Mrs. Whatchit, played by Phyllidia Law) tries to give him personality but seems forced. He also has a girlfriend. When an incident changes his hope for the future with his girlfriend, Pearce becomes obsessed with changing the past.Unfortunately for Pearce's character, incidents force him to travel into the future. There he finds an Earth of 2030. His brief exploration of this time introduces him to a holographic interactive database named Vox (played by Orlando Jones). Not finding his answers, Pearce travels to the far future. Once there, he is found by what appear to be humans who now live on cliffs overlooking a river. As he finds more about these people's lives, he is exposed to a terrible fact. There is a predatory life-form that endangers these people.Unfortunately, this film has many problems. First, while boasting that it is directed by the grandson of H. G. Wells (the author of the original short story) there is very little of that story here. But, the biggest problem is Pearce. We never care about him, so we never care about his journey. The film tries to make him a maverick in the opening few minutes, but we don't believe it, or care what he has to say. His interaction with Filby and Watchit are too fleeting to really develop any sense of who these people are to him.Pearce's girlfriend, played by Sienna Guillory, is good, but their moments together seem out of place. And, the reason for time traveling is diminished, since we have no real sense of time (the director compresses four years of time) during the set-up.Once we get to the future, the native are not interesting, but they are supposed to be mystical. And, there is the dreaded cute kid, the ploy of desperation. Plus, the beasts that terrorize the native are typical to many monsters that show up in modern movies like The Mummy.Now, when compared to George Pal's 1960 version, the brilliance of Pal's creativity shines.

Pal's version of the Eloi is of innocent and unaware children, but the new natives just don't work. We liked George, saw him have dinner with friends, and care about what he did.

His interaction with Filby and Watchit are too fleeting to really develop any sense of who these people are to him.Pearce's girlfriend, played by Sienna Guillory, is good, but their moments together seem out of place. And, the reason for time traveling is diminished, since we have no real sense of time (the director compresses four years of time) during the set-up.Once we get to the future, the native are not interesting, but they are supposed to be mystical. And, there is the dreaded cute kid, the ploy of desperation. Plus, the beasts that terrorize the native are typical to many monsters that show up in modern movies like The Mummy.Now, when compared to George Pal's 1960 version, the brilliance of Pal's creativity shines. Where Pearce travels to the future because of a personal incident, the time traveler George (played by Rod Taylor) has a sense of exploration. We are excited by George's adventure. With the Pearce character, we are dragged along, hoping for an adventure. The natives in the new movie know too much, yet are unable to Pearce. Pal's version of the Eloi is of innocent and unaware children, but the new natives just don't work. We liked George, saw him have dinner with friends, and care about what he did. Pearce never gave us that in his character.Bottom line, avoid this version, see the original George Pal version, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, and Alan Young (who makes a cameo in the new movie).

Well, why does it need a genre? Isn't the whole movie about breaking down cliques, titles and stereotypes? The dialogue was awkward at times, and some said that took something away from the film (like the quality, for example) but if you were in the library that day when you were in school, would you have been comfortable and relaxed with people like Bender, who're armed to the teeth and come across hostile? Or Claire who would likely look down on you? Andrew with his inane attempts to stand up to Bender and speak to Brian even though he was laughing at him too? What if Alison was there, and she sat in silence and stared you down every time you tried to communicate with her?The film deals with a lot of teen problems, without making them seem unworthy or childish. That would have meant something to most teens when they saw it, since High School sure isn't like the Porky's series. The dancing, getting high, etc. remove realism from it, but think about it for a minute - the kids probably won't speak to each other again after that day. Getting high brings the four others into Bender's world, dancing (however ridiculous it may seem that the principal DIDN'T notice) represents Stubby's party, and hanging out with the popular kids. Claire and Alison bond through make-up, and Brian is just pulled along for the ride. The Breakfast Club probably didn't define a generation, and the tag line for it is as cheesy as David Bowie's tights were in Labyrinth, but it's like watching an episode of I dream of Jeannie - you wonder how anyone could have gotten away with making it, then feel glad that they did.I doubt the Breakfast Club is an accurate portrayal of all the problems teenagers face, but it scratches the surface of self-absorbed kids (like me! Ha!) who worry over stupid things because they don't know the real world yet. Like training worries. I really loved this movie, probably because I overlooked the flaws and just took it for what it is... whatever that may be.

If his guests were shorter than the length of the bed, he stretched them out until they fit. If they were too tall, then he chopped their feet off.All About the Benjamins, directed by Kevin Bray, is a cinematic Procrustean bed. It overextends its constricted script with excessive amounts of strained comedy and hackneyed action, and as a result it winds up sacrificing the proverbial feet of efficient storytelling and character development.Ice Cube (who co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Lang) is Bucum Jackson, a Miami bounty hunter who hopes to someday open his own private investigation agency. (In the meantime, he complains about his low-paying assignments while buying $600 tropical fish.) One of his menial jobs includes relentlessly chasing con man Reggie Wright (Mike Epps). On the same day that Reggie wins a $60 million lottery jackpot, he stumbles upon a combination diamond heist and triple homicide while being pursued through city streets and back alleys. He then leaves his wallet - with the winning ticket inside - in the thieves' van. To compound his misery, he is nabbed the next day by Bucum, who expresses interest in his plight only because he sees dollar signs after hearing about the diamonds.Benjamins is a failure on so many levels. It fails as a comedy, a buddy movie, and an action thriller, and it most definitely fails as quality entertainment, relying heavily on endless chase scenes, Epps' grating slapstick routine, and Cube's scowling facade in order to conceal the numerous absurdities and lack of suspense in the plot. Director Bray uses every means possible to (unsuccessfully) liven up the flat action sequences, such as using over half a dozen edits to show a car smashing through a window and unnecessary freeze-frame whenever someone fires a gun, the latter which causes the film to resemble a bad '70s cop show. The foot chases suffer from a combination of slow motion and weak cinematography; why show characters vaulting over a wall in the exact same manner?I didn't laugh once during the entire picture. The film's idea of jocularity consists of people aggravating a gunshot wound with a screwdriver, pointing a gun at a kid and activating a taser in a man's crotch, not to mention having two old ladies cussing up a storm and grown men engaging in bouts of unintelligible slang-ridden drivel every five minutes. Epps tries in vain to be knock-down riotous in tiresome scenes such as when Reggie horses around in a Bentley and sings loudly off-key while he imitates smoking a joint.The bad plot spells equally bad performances. Ice Cube has nothing to do here except stare angrily at Epps' overacting in between knocking a few heads. The script is loaded with racist and misogynist stereotypes. In the opening scene, Bucum arrests a redneck bail jumper who has a Confederate flag hanging full-view in his trailer window. The theft ring is led by an abrasive, scar-faced Irishman (Tommy Flanagan) who wears ugly suits and has a thick brogue that becomes a target for parody. At the same time, the N word flies left and right. Meanwhile, Bucum's accomplice Pam (Valarie Rae Miller) and Reggie's girlfriend Gina (Eva Mendes) are unfortunately nothing more than armpieces in skimpy outfits who spend time looking offended at their partners' actions.It's appropriate that a boat storage warehouse plays a significant role in this movie that ends up sinking in an ocean of implausibility. For instance, would a street-smart bail enforcement agent actually team up with an uncooperative loon who deems it necessary to act like a goofball while being pursued by killers? When a handcuffed Reggie falls forward off the top of a boat, he miraculously walks away with both shoulders still intact. After he loses his wallet, he's distressed more about his missing lottery ticket than the fact that the thieves have access to his name and address. Reggie and Bucum get into an altercation in the parking lot of the bad guys' headquarters in a display of sheer incompetence - and in clear view of surveillance cameras. (It also spawns the film's only line that contains a shred of humor You bite my nipple again and I'll kill you!)Benjamins'  greatest sin, however, is that it's a blatant insult to viewers' intelligence that's encased in a box of cheap laughs, due to the fact that it tries to make heroes out of two greedy individuals who commit murder, assault, burglary, and wrongful imprisonment, among other things, in their pursuit of stolen diamonds that don't even belong to them in the first place - and then treats their mission as if they're participating in some great cause. They're no better than the crooks they're trying to outsmart. Even worse, the filmmakers shamelessly want us to empathize with these guys during an obligatory moment in which they spill their deepest feelings to each other during a lull in the action.One of the worst films of the year, All About the Benjamins will appeal to those who have an affinity for movies with appalling storylines chock full of abysmal dialogue and repugnant characters.

A nice movie and one that I would recommend. The movie that I went to go see as a sneak preview, 40 days and 40 nights, was not.While the premise was fresh and interesting, the mere fact that in the end it had to resort to boner jokes left any credibility the movie might have had in the dust.Matt has a succesful life as a twenty something, a carreer as a dot com web artist and a beautiful and talented girlfriend whom he loves. The problem is she isn't with him anymore and he can't get rid of the spiritual loss. After going through a scene that could've been shortend Matt realizes that something needs to be done.After visiting his brother (a novice priest, who at the beginning of the movie seems to be imprisoned in the confession booth) He comes to an epiphany. Christ himself shows up and approves. No sex at all for lent. Good idea, it's something even I haven't managed, and I'm a girl, not to mention someone who doesn't believe in the whole idea of abstaining from something to torment and purify yourself.But after throwing away all the porn in his place, much to the chagrin of his room mate, Matt is heartend. This idea, vow, what have you, could work. Fine, every one is happy. But then it leaks out through who else, but the room mate.The other problem aside from the bets made on his vow is the girl he fell for at the laudromat. Here is where the movie loses it. It seems that since it can't continue forever in the attempts to get Matt to break the vow, they introduce romance into the picture.Okay, but then since he never tells her about the vow she thinks that after the second date they can consumate. Unfortunetly this isn't what happens and she becomes hurt. Deservedly so, but how can you stay hurt? And after several chances she finally gives into his sincere feelings.Finally with one day left he is a nervous wreck. Convincing himself to get some sleep and wait for his love to come and wake him, a long  dream sequence, which must have been rejected from Earth Girls are easy, comes into the picture. Flowing water and a sea of breasts ensues.This is not what i had in mind when i went to go see the movies. Unless you are an adolescent boy, or have a mind like one, this isn't even something you could enjoy on television. Much of the movie consists of the boys view of things, and while this isn't a bad thing, it also doesn't make much sense. A mans view of the world is a soft porn version of the playboy universe? Then count me out. And if only that were all.The movie takes place in San Franscisco, having never been there i don't know what the job market is like. But i'm farely sure that it no longer is mostly made up of dot com offices, which is where just about everyone in this movie works. So the whole thing comes off as strangly antiquated the same way that several other romantic comedies this year did not. Even when taking into account that those movies took place in a fantisy New York, they didn't feel retro the way this movie did.40 Days and 40 Nights felt as if someone had tried for nostalga mixed with fantasy and failed. The script, sitcom at best, did not mix well with the idea of taking the eighties and late ninties and puting them together. This is why no one has attempted to remake The Breakfast Club.
