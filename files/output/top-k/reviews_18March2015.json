Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly the movies highlight, he has proved before with movies like Twins that he can do comedy, and his performance in this is no exception, his character made me laugh the most, as he was basically mocking the films he has done the most of, action, the child in the lead role, however, is very unlikeable.

The Jungle Book was one of the first films I ever saw and is probably one the reasons I decided to pursue a career in films and I will always be fond of that. However, today, as a film, it's OK. That's not bad or good; it is just OK.For one thing, the film is very slow, which for an animated film can be quite tedious at times. My second (and probably biggest) problem with the film is that it simply plays it too safe; I can't help but wish that if this film had come out during the era of the Disney Renaissance (Aladdin, The Lion King etc.) then a few more risks would have been taken, e.g. I felt the climax between Mowgli and Shere Khan was very underplayed and could have been a lot more tense and dramatic, for example, it would have been a lot more powerful if Mowgli had defeated his enemy for good and killed Shere Khan (in the manor that heroes normally defeat their villains in Disney films) or some of the characters could have been a bit more menacing such as Kaa or Louis. I also feel that film tired much too hard to make comedic moments through out the film. The songs themselves did not really measure up to the Disney standard (with the exceptions of The Bear Necessities and I wanna be like you) and felt that they where very dumbed down. I also felt the animation was somewhat lacking and again, I felt could have benefited had this film been made during Disney's golden age in the 1990's.The film did have some positives as well, the best bit of the film is Shere Khan, and he's just a great villain. George Saunders gets the balance between Khan's sophisticated demeanor and his bloodthirsty intentions, the contrast is very effective and in my opinion, Shere Khan is one of the most memorable villains in Disney history. Baloo the bear was also a lot of fun, and it was really a shame when he appeared to have been killed at the end. Mowgli and the other characters are OK, and they all do their part.Overall, I won't say I don't like the film or it's not worth watching because I can't imagine that anybody watching it would hate it. However, I can't see anyone today putting it at the top of their film watching priorities. With two film versions of The Jungle Book coming up (one by Disney, the other by Warner Bros.)

In his third cinema adventure, the superspy's heroics and stakes are far bigger and more fantastic, and it adds up to one of the most escapist spy movies ever made.From start to finish, the film's pace is brisk, and it doesn't hold back. In one movie, Bond uses every ounce of resourcefulness, wit, and brawn against his adversaries. There is plenty of action, all really fast-paced and well-staged, if not really over-the-top and zany. Bond drives a car loaded with a ridiculous number of gadgets machine guns, a smoke screen, radar, rotating license plates, an ejector seat, and a little thingy that comes out of the wheel to jack up other cars. These are cool scenes that pushed the Aston Martin DB5 into legendary status. When he isn't driving around, Bond fights bad guys with just about everything he can - guns, fists, and things in the environment. Among these fights, he takes on a Korean dude who seems invincible, and throws a lethal metal hat that can slice through solid stone. To help him, Bond makes allies with quite a few lovely ladies, one of whom is asphyxiated when she's covered head-to-toe in gold paint. At one point, Bond is tied to a slab with a laser beam creeping towards him; how does he get out of that? The whole movie is loaded with exciting and iconic scenes, and it breezes by smoothly and concisely. Each scene is really good, and there's never a dull moment.This story is as outlandish as they come, but the film carries no pretense. It is pure escapism, and the plot's absurdities play into the tone and style perfectly. The plot progresses smoothly, and a lot of conventions are introduced that carry over to future films (especially in regards to the sheer number of gadgets, action setpieces used). Bond is as cool as ever, while the villains carry a pretty decent presence and persona. However, all characters remain simple and one-dimensional.This film has very solid and interesting photography, and snappy editing. Sean Connery is still effective as Bond; Gert Fröbe straddles a line between playfulness and angst as Goldfinger, and it makes him fairly enjoyable to watch. I could always take or leave Honor Blackman - her character may have quite the distinctive name, but I found her character borderline unlikable. Other actors are alright. Writing is not bad. This production uses some very slick and colorful sets and costumes; some of the props seem really over-the-top (the insides of the nuclear bomb looks like a giant toy for some reason), and some of the special effects show their age. Shirley Bassey's theme song is a really strange and discordant song, but for some reason it's also really catchy, and it set the trend for future Bond theme songs. John Barry's score is very energetic, jazzy, and hip.What the film lacks in plot, it makes up for in action, energy, style, and sheer iconic status.

I immediately asked, Oh yes, would that be Helen Mirren? to which he told me it was and asked how I had guessed. I said that Helen was famous for doing a revealing movie although I had never seen it and, I must admit, when I began to watch it, I was probably more titillated by the idea of seeing someone famous who I had long been a fan of naked than seeing a movie!However, as the film got under way, it became very apparent that this was no ordinary movie (whatever that is). At first, I found myself wondering what on Earth was going on but, as it progressed, I more and more began to feel as though I was at a live performance of a Shakespearian tragedy melodrama. Everything was dramatically overdone and I realised that this was completely intentional.

When Brian shows up at the radio station to thank Abby for the advice he gave her on the air, a frightfully insecure Abby asks Noelle to pretend to be Abby, but immediately regrets it when she realizes that Brian is sincerely smitten with Noelle's personality, which is really Abby's but Abby is scared that she will scare Brian off when he finds out she doesn't look like Noelle.This comedy sucks us in right from the beginning because the character of Abby is immensely likable and, as an observer to the goings-on, we don't understand Abby's insecurity about herself and we're certain she and Brian would be instant soul mates. However, the story aggravates as we realize that as much as he loves Abby's personality, he is also smitten by the package wrapped around it in Noelle. Even Noelle, not the brightest bulb in the row, realizes it is Abby that Brian wants but can't convince Abby to come clean.Audrey Well's screenplay is clever and serves its cast well. Garafalo is an absolute revelation in the role of Abby, her first leading screen role...sort of a Streisand for the 90's, the gal who may not be a raving beauty, but has enough brains and wit to make her looks seems not so important. Garafalo's performance here should have made her an instant movie star, but mysteriously, it didn't. Uma Thurman brings a substance to the role of the empty-headed Noelle that really isn't in the screenplay and Ben Chaplin is a very sexy leading man, a guy who thinks he's torn between two women, but really isn't. The scene where Garafalo and Chaplin have an all-night phone conversation is wonderful but further aggravates us as we wonder why Brian seems oblivious to the fact that the voice of radio Abby is different than the voice of Noelle\/Abby and the fact that he accepts Abby's explanation that she uses a radio voice is kind of hard to swallow, but I digress. The film is funny and smart and kept me interested until the final reel because, refreshing for a contemporary film comedy, the ending isn't really foreshadowed. A romantic comedy with a one-of-a-kind lead character that will charm and endear her to you.

In fact, looking back I probably enjoy it more now than when I did when I was younger, there is so much more to talk about such as the music, the storytelling, the voice acting among many other elements. First of all, Simba; Simba is one of the most sympathetic Disney characters, we have all been in a situation where we have felt the need to step up and rise to an occasion and Simba represents that perfectly, he (as an adult) tries to come off as confident but you can tell he is hurting and is conflicted inside but eventually puts this fear aside to do what he knows he must. The supporting characters were all great, particularly the hyenas who I find a lot funnier now, maybe because of my twisted sense of humor. Scar as the villain was awesome, one of the best movie villains ever. He is a silver-tonged devil, he manipulates his nephew and tries to get him killed then actually kills his own brother, which is a lot deeper when you really think about it. We also get some good humor out of him as well, you also see how pathetic he is when he takes over, showing how unfit he is to be king.The songs were awesome, the opening sequence The Circle of Life is the greatest sequence ever and when I'm watching the film, I always watch it at least thrice.

If you are going to represent a historical event, you must show all sides and not just the romanticized Hollywood version that kids will enjoy, if you want your kids to have a good time, take them to see a Disney film or a Superhero film, not a film depicting an important era in history.Though I did not find the acting was great, I did not feel that the actors had a great deal to work with from such a lack luster script as well as such hollowed out characters that were just walking clichés, Ben Affleck's character being the cowboy etc. And while giving these uninteresting characters the most screen time, the film takes focus away from the event it is meant to be portraying as well as actual real life characters such as Doris Miller or Roosevelt who had more of a right to have had their stories told.Overall, I am probably being too harsh to this film, but the saving graces are the technical aspects such as the explosions and the angles from the planes are actually quite good.

If you are going to represent a historical event, you must show all sides and not just the romanticized Hollywood version that kids will enjoy, if you want your kids to have a good time, take them to see a Disney film or a Superhero film, not a film depicting an important era in history.Though I did not find the acting was great, I did not feel that the actors had a great deal to work with from such a lack luster script as well as such hollowed out characters that were just walking clichés, Ben Affleck's character being the cowboy etc. And while giving these uninteresting characters the most screen time, the film takes focus away from the event it is meant to be portraying as well as actual real life characters such as Doris Miller or Roosevelt who had more of a right to have had their stories told.Overall, I am probably being too harsh to this film, but the saving graces are the technical aspects such as the explosions and the angles from the planes are actually quite good. The sad thing is, there is a good film in there somewhere but it was never realized and I hope if Hollywood ever visits this topic again, they will.

(He was later to make a gangster epic entitled Once Upon a Time in America). Certainly, he makes use of two familiar Western situations, so familiar that they might as well have been drawn from a fairy-tale. One involves a railroad company trying to force honest homesteaders off their land, a trope so well-known that Mel Brooks was to mock it in Blazing Saddles. The other involves the mysterious lone gunman out for revenge. The film is generally classified as a Spaghetti Western because Leone was Italian, but in fact it was partly shot in Spain and partly in America. The action takes place in and around the fictitious town of Flagstone; the name was presumably inspired by Flagstaff, Arizona, and the location is doubtless supposed to be somewhere in the deserts of the American South- West.Brett McBain, an Irish-born homesteader, and his three children are shot dead by a gang of bandits in the pay of a corrupt railroad boss. The railroad want McBain dead because they want to acquire his land cheaply; it lies on top of the only reserves of water in the area and is therefore the only possible route for their new line, as they need water for their locomotives. McBain is well aware of the value of his land and is holding out for a better price. What the villains do not realise is that McBain has recently married Jill, a former New Orleans prostitute who arrives in the West to find herself already a widow.Jill, however, decides to stay and fight the railroad and their hired gunmen. In this she has two unexpected allies. One is Cheyenne, another bandit whom the gunmen have tried to frame for the killings. The other is a mysterious stranger with his own reasons for seeking revenge on Frank, the leader of the gang who killed McBain. We never learn his real name; he is always referred to as Harmonica because of his fondness for that instrument.Harmonica might seem like a natural role for Clint Eastwood, and he was indeed offered it, but turned it down, and it went instead to Charles Bronson. I have in the past been critical of Bronson's lack of emotional range, but here his deadpan inscrutability serves him well, adding to his character's air of mystery. This must count as one of his best performances. The casting of Henry Fonda as the cruel, sadistic Frank has been described as against type, although this was not the only film in which he plays a villain. In another Western from 1968, Firecreek, he also plays the leader of a gang of outlaws; in both films he shows that he could play a bad guy as convincingly as a good guy. The one cast member I was less keen on was Claudia Cardinale as Jill; she was never the greatest actress in English-language movies, especially in movies where, as here, her dialogue was spoken for her by another actress. (Cardinale did speak her own lines in the Italian version). Another actor whose lines were dubbed was Gabriele Ferzetti as the crippled railroad boss Morton, but he nevertheless makes a memorable villain. Leone was keen to give an epic look and feel to his film, and Once Upon a Time in the West is quite deliberately slow-paced, much more so than his earlier Dollars trilogy, or at least its first two instalments. I understand that the film exists in three versions; I saw the 145-minute version originally shown in American cinemas, but I understand that there is also a 166-minute version made for the European market and a 175-minute director's cut. Even the short version, however, features long, slow scenes in which there is little dialogue and little action, with the action sequences themselves brief if violent. This is particularly marked in the famous opening sequence in which in which three of the outlaws wait at a station for the arrival of a train, and around ten minutes goes by in which nothing much happens other than a windmill creaking and a fly buzzing around Jack Elam's face. (This scene was inspired by a similar one in High Noon, one of a number of deliberate references to famous Westerns).Mention also needs to be made of Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score, at times discordant and plangent, at others melodious and lyrical, making use of unusual instruments including tubular bells and (naturally enough) a harmonica. This music makes an important contribution towards the film's emotional impact.Leone's direction in this film will doubtless divide opinion, with some decrying his slow-motion style as boring and others hailing it as evidence of the handiwork of a master. For myself, I lean towards the latter view; Leone may take his time over telling his story, but in doing so he adds to the film's power and grandeur. Attempting to speed up the action would only have weakened the film's impact rather than improving it. I would not perhaps rank this film as the greatest-ever Western, which is how some have described it, but it is among the best Westerns of the sixties; I would certainly rate it higher than a number of contemporary Westerns, such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, True Grit and The Wild Bunch, which have also been much praised but which for me fall short of greatness. Once Upon a Time in the West comes very close to falling within that description. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The formula once upon a time is traditionally used to begin a fairy- tale or legend, and Sergio Leone's use of it here may be intended to claim legendary or mythical status for his epic story.

Especially if you're young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the greatest movie in history did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleone's first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he can't run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new Godfather and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is it's running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but it's the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who.

During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.Shot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.Headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.Marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics.

That being said, I was curious on how they'd follow up. All I can say is, w.t.f! Every moment of plot progression from the other ship to the underground telepathic community with the nuclear bomb straight up knocked me off my ass. Some stuff was interesting, others were kind of stupid.After realizing the extinction of man, Taylor, (Charlton Heston) disappears, and his mute love interest, Nova, finds another survivor of a rescue expedition who has also landed on the planet, determined with the help of Nova to find Taylor.I gotta give this movie credit...it kept my interest. Regardless of how goofy it got at times, it made me want to figure out what was going on the whole time. It felt way more intense with the war between apes and man. It actually felt more brutal and intense than the original, though that wasn't the original's intention understandably. A few things in the writing make it sound like it was written by a hippie, talking A LOT about peace and love. I think they might have hammered in the nuclear warfare is evil, we're all going to blow ourselves up talk that was popular around the early 70's.The film doesn't get necessarily boring, but it takes a few too many risks, some work, some don't. Overall, it wasn't that bad. I felt genuinely worried about the main character's and their mission and all the conflicts going on. It does kind of dismiss the goings on in Ape City a little abruptly, but that's what more sequels are for I guess. Recommended if you watched and enjoyed the original.

First of all, it is the worst kind of foreign film, which is to say, it is French. I won't elaborate. You are either with me on this or you are not.Then I discovered it is a musical. I like musicals well enough, but when I realized that every line of dialogue was going to be sung throughout, I groaned. One of the great improvements of Hollywood musicals over operas is that in the former, ordinary dialogue is merely spoken, whereas in operas, everything is sung relentlessly, even if it is just a husband asking his wife, What's for dinner? There are a couple of real songs in the movie, but by the time it got to them, I was a little worn out from all the singing that preceded.Finally, the story promises to be a cliché. Guy and Geneviève want to get married. However, he is drafted to fight the war in Algeria. On his last night before leaving, they make love. And you know what that means. When a woman in a movie has sex with a man just once, she gets pregnant. We then figure that either Guy will forget about her and fall in love with someone else, or he will be killed in the war. Either that, or she will be so desperate about covering up the shame of her pregnancy that she will marry someone else.Much to my amazement, I actually became engrossed in this movie, especially when the story went against my expectations. After only four months, Geneviève starts to forget about Guy. She says it feels as though he has been gone for years, and that she is losing the feeling she had for him. She has to look at his picture to remember what he looks like. It is true that she has only received one letter from him in four months, but you have to figure that a man fighting a war might not have the luxury of writing regularly (in fact, he is wounded by a grenade).And so she ends up marrying another man. The movie could have given her the standard motive of a woman desperate to cover up the shame of her pregnancy, but it does not. Neither she nor her mother seems unduly concerned about the matter. And in the one letter she receives from Guy, he writes that he is looking forward to coming home after his military service is over, marrying her, and seeing their child. It is unlikely that she would have married the other man had she not been pregnant, but we still get the sense that her decision to opt for a marriage of convenience was made possible by the brute fact that her love for Guy had faded.Before Guy and Geneviève separate, they sing the song we in America are familiar with as I Will Wait for You. The lyrics in the movie are a bit different, but the thrust is the same. The two lovers express their undying love for each other. It reminds me of the movie Oliver (1968), in which Nancy sings the song As Long as He Needs Me, referring to her lover Bill, who has no need for her at all, and ends up murdering her. We have a similar irony with the song I Will Wait for You. Although the lyrics in the American version of the song say, If it takes forever, I will wait for you, Geneviève does not even manage to wait more than four months. But the movie does not condemn her. It merely states the cold truth about love, that it creates an illusion that it will last forever, and then simply dissipates, despite our efforts to hold on to it.Guy eventually returns to find that Geneviève has married another man. Eventually, he marries too. When Guy and Geneviève finally meet again by accident, we see that they still have feelings for each other, but it is more a feeling of a love that was lost than of a love that still is.
