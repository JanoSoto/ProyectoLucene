Poker is a very complex skill game and many times during the movie, Rounders will tell you this.Anyway, Rounders is about a hardcore poker player Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) who quits the game after he loses it all in a hand of No Limit Texas Hold 'Em at a shady club run by Russian Mafia man Teddy KBG (John Malkovich). When Mike learns that his newly-out-of-prison friend Worm (Edward Norton) owes several thousand dollars to a couple of loan sharks, he gets back in the game and the two set out to make a big score and settle their debts.I highly recommend this movie for anyone who's in the least bit interested in poker.

It's the be all and end all.  It truly is an outstanding action\/suspense\/thriller movie.  The thing about this movie that really blows me away is how many different things it covers.  It's NOT just a blow things up action movie, the characters are very deep, and their stories are interesting, the plot is excellent.  On top of the action you have incredible comedy.  One liners, and catch phrases that are just brilliantly written.  Of course there are always things that can be critisized about every movie.  I don't suppose that two cops could truly run around a city shooting and killing every bad guy they come across...or a cop could dive off a building with a suicidal man and not get fired, or arrested himself.  But who cares...it's fun.  It's not meant to be reality or a cop training video (unless you're the LAPD...gratuitous low blow)  Gary Busey is of course great as the killer mercenary, and the big bad boss drug dealer (that guy from Dharma and Greg) played the perfect bad guy.  This movie doesn't leave much for improvement but it does leave you begging for more Riggs and Murtaugh.  Mel Gibson is perfect.  Martin Riggs had to be one of the greatest movie characters of all times.  It's astonishing how much feeling they put into Riggs who is a man who has lost his wife in a car accident and is just begging for death to take him.  He's suicidal and on the edge and it makes him look psycotic.  He is partnered with Lt. Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover.  A cop who is nearing retirement, who plays by the rules and has a perfect family life.  Together they make the perfect team.  Gibson and Glover have the ideal chemistry and their characters, completely different, help each other in every way.  Murtaugh learns a lesson in letting loose and not being quite so uptight and Riggs learns to love life and finds himself with a surrogate family in the form of the Murtaughs.  The movie spends so much time introducing us into the lives of these two men...how different they are, and how much they needed each other.  Together they find themselves the perfect team to taking out a ruthless drug operation.  The action comes in the ending scenes, the last 45 minutes has to be one of the perfectly filmed action sequences in movie history.  Mel Gibson battling it out with Gary Busey, hand to hand, under the spouting water of a decapitated Fire Hydrant is brilliant and heart stopping.  The fight scenes were flawless.  I give this movie a perfect score making it one of my favorite movies.  Perhaps it's not the perfect movie but for me and anyone else who sees it...it will do the job for entertainment.  10\/10 **********!!!!!

So time goes by and finally the movie is released, the opening scene made me laugh, not because it was bad, just because thats jason for ya, but it made me curious as to why the hell there was a research facility right on crystal lake, and how the hell did they manage to put jason in chains *SPOILER* i still wonder how the hell he got out of the chains *END SPOILER* It seemed the good ol government became interested in why Jason wont die, how hes able to regenerate body tissue, anf of course, jason breaks free only to be frozen moments later.At the point i decided that this movie sucked was when most of the deaths werent shown, about 30 people dies and only 10 of them were actually shown, and some were quite gruesome! the first death was the best, too bad the chick was so hot! I dont think ive ever seen a movie with character development as bad as this, even the main character, Rowan, you dont give a s*** about, as much as i wanted her to live i really couldve cared less, the only characters i felt for were Kay-Em and Brodski, Kay Em was hilarious and Brodski was such a tough guy.Just as the movie is nearing its end the funniest scene ive seen in a Jason movie yet comes up, with 2 topless chicks of course but i wont spoil anything else. Id say this scene saved the movie for any liking i gave it.One of the big reasons i didnt like this was because it was non stop killing, the movie never paused for any real dialouge, or any plot development for that matter.The atmosphere was another big problem, how can you do a Jason movie without a forest? I mean, even #8 pulled it off, but this movie lacked 'scariness', at no point was i ever scared or even intense about some chick about to lose her head. No suspense whatsoever, Jason didnt even toy with any of his victims.Also the death scenes were really crappy, there were only 4 or 5 that actually had any creativity, while every other jason movies death scenes are all quite creative, or most of them at least.As soon as Jason was upgraded it was really downhill from there, too bad the movie ended 15 minutes later. *SPOILER* he didnt even kill anyone! wtf *END SPOILER*Another weakness of the movie was the way Jason was killed, i can see why they did it, but i just hope it leads to a sequel.On a scale of 1-10, i give it a 6, because its a little better than it is stupid, i wouldve given it a 3 if it wasnt for that final scene of comic relief.All in all, this remains the worst Jason movie ive seen so far, but at least it was good for a few laughs.

Throughout the whole 2 hours I did not give a damn about what would happen to the characters or who the killer really was. Just as in SH, none of the characters were able to draw the viewer's attention for more than 5 minutes. And, also a trademark of the SHS, the ending was completely unsatisfying since it made the impression as if it were hastily put together only to reveal that the murderer ***SPOILER*** was someone that you didn't give s***t about at all. ***end of SPOILER*** Well, I would still prefer SH over this bore of a movie any day. I haven't read any of the graphic novels this film is supposedly based on but if the storyline therein is as dull as what the viewer is offered here, then I doubt it would have ever been adapted for the silver screen. The plot has many holes that were seemingly just put in there to make the whole thing longer (115 minutes!!! there was enough plot for about 60).***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Why is this whole drug-addiction-vision thing so important anyway?!! It doesn't add to the suspense and the sequences aren't even interesting to watch when you're ON drugs.... I think that says a lot. What meaning or possible plot relevancy is there behind the odd lesbian relationship between some of the whores?!? I DID NOT GET IT! If anyone did, then please take the time to explain it to me!! I'd really appreciate it ;) Why Oh Why did it have to end like this?!!! It's the ending that I had been expecting since the first 30 minutes or so!!! I knew who he was all along!!! That's not what a thriller is supposed to be like! I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHO JTR WAS!!!! At least it shouldn't be someone like the killer portrayed in From Hell.Well what else is there to say? The pathetic acting (with the cheesiest part delivered by good ol' Heather G.) was not helped by the poor accents.... and usually I'm very generous when it comes to accents. The whole drama thing was about as involving as an episode of Denver Clan and Johnny D. couldn't convince me that he really wanted to make a good movie. I like many of Johnny Depp's works (especially Dead Man and Fear And Loathing... ;-) ) but I believe that he should've just skipped this one (and a few others, mind you).Ok, so to sum it up DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It may have some (very little) gore but it's not enough to keep slasher-fans interested. There's no historical correctness either, so anyone interested in the Jack the Ripper story will be very disappointed as well. And there isn't enough original plot, almost no good acting and only fairly impressive camerawork.... so it won't be a treat for any of you moviemaniacs out there either.

First of all, if the director wanted to make this a straight drama that's fine.  Just don't market it as a COMEDY!  If sentimental schmaltz with few or no laughs is your definition of comedy, then you're in for a treat.  The director is Stephen Herek, who also directed the dull, forgettable Eddie Murphy vehicle Holy Man.  Like that movie, Life... is horribly uneven, taking a serious turn way too early in the film and never recovering.  Despite extremely poor attempts, I'm pretty sure Herek intended this to be a comedy.  Herek just has no sense of timing!  And may I add, there are certain scenes in the previews that weren't used in the final cut--Why the hell do directors tease us like that?!!!!!!  For example, there's supposed to be one scene where Jolie is on the set of a TV show and a light from the ceiling falls down, inches away from killing her.  But there are no scenes where her life seems threatened.  Instead, the movie gets preachy and sentimental about the subject of carpe diem and developing the all-too-predictable love affair between Jolie and Edward Burns.  Like always, they start out hating each other's guts and about 20 minutes through the flick, they're practically soulmates.  The character arcs are so quick and stilted.    I like Edward Burns, but he should definitely stick to independent film.  I don't usually say this about directors, but he should stick to starring in his own movies.  His writing is obviously much more creative than that of Hollywood screenwriters, who get paid 10 times as much as him.  OK, he was fairly good in 15 Minutes and quite good in Saving Private Ryan, but he should try to steer clear of Hollywood.Every scene is so dull and downbeat.  Herek tries to redeem himself with pretentious fast-motion shots, identical to those of Madonna's Ray of Light video.  If Jolie weren't the star, this film would be dead in the water.  And Tony Shalhoub deserves better as well.  I'm not surprised to see him in a corny flick, but he is an underrated comic actor and I loved him on Wings.  Jolie decided she would take a break from movies after done with Tomb Raider.  Why, oh why, did she change her mind and star in this ultimately forgettable pseduo romantic comedy?

Most audiences need something in a character beyond just evil or madness to stay interested in them; a one-story personality just won't hold attention for long.The problem I had with this story is that, after the big plot twist, you're left with a main character that has not had enough exposition of his 'back story', if that's the term I'm looking for.  I got the feeling of having been led up to this point only to do the switch; the trick's the thing in this movie.  After the twist there's not enough of a character to really get interested in, the story ends abruptly, and you realize you've been following a shadow.  To me it negated most of the development that happened before.  Personally it just brought home the meaninglessness of such stories on the big screen.It's just a movie, right?

It's fun, and sure beats watching Ebert and whomever.So hopefully someone will read this and be forewarned about a kind of movie that I call 'soul-sucking'.  As far as religion goes, I'm the world's most devout agnostic.  Nevertheless there are movies that disturb me with their hopelessness and lack of redeeming character qualities.  This is one.I've been a fan of psychodramas ever since 'Silence of the Lambs'.  I thought 'Se7en' had one of the most startling and affecting endings in a movie.  This one held my attention most of the way through, then left me cold at the end.  Its antagonist doesn't have a strong personality or fascinating profile; it doesn't have any hope; and it doesn't have any uniquely interesting reason for the torment that happens to the protagonist. There's only mental illness and its aftereffects.A psychodrama doesn't have to leave people feeling hopeless.  Sad, perhaps; scared, maybe; thoughtful, definitely.  You can think about it all you want; after watching 'Frailty' you won't have gained much understanding of the human condition and you won't feel much hope.  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"27 April 2002","score":"","review":"  First off, I've been a huge Friday the 13th fan for many many years.  And I was one of the few people in the theater who was old enough to remember all of them.  (I am 29 years old...a lot of 16 year olds who said they are excited to see Jason 'X'.  I didn't have the heart to tell them it is really Jason Ten and that the X is a Roman numeral for it being the 10th Friday the 13th movie.  Ah, the state of education these days...)Anyway, before I saw the movie, I didn't like the idea of going 450 years into the future for killing in space.  I am an old fashioned guy who likes Crystal Lake and the cabins.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. There were some interesting killings, some good laughs, and some good nostalgia (mentioning earlier films to a degree.)However, I guess the Friday the 13th series is no longer a horror genre. This movie, I would not call a horror film...but a Sci-Fi slasher picture. There wasn't much scarry in the film.  Unlike the earlier films where there was suspense and even though I knew someone would die, I would jump from fear when Jason showed up.  There was none of that in Jason X.  And I think I discovered why...In earlier films, Part II, Part III, and Part IV (we don't include part I and part V since it wasn't Jason), Jason was killable and more of a man. So Jason had to be sneaky, like a boogie man who lived in the shadows. People doubted if he really existed and was just a wives tale.  (Kinda like Mr. Snufalupagus (sp?) on Sesame Street...at least in the old days.  I haven't watched Sesame Street in a long time, but people tell me that everyone sees him now.)  This made him scarry.Nowadays, everyone sees him and knows he is unkillable.  Hence, the horror suspense is not there.  He's just a constant machine who doesn't hide and doesn't seem human.  (The human characteristic was the best part in earlier movies.)Now, back to Jason X.  If this had been a pure sci-fi movie, without the slasher stuff, it would have made a great sci-fi movie.  I would've loved to investigate and discover what occured over the past 450 years of mankind. Being 450 years into the future bring up interesting technological inventions, and my personal opinion is that Jason X handled them somewhat realistically.  (Others may disagree.)  Unlike typical movies in the future where they have inventions like time travel, worm hole creation, etc.  This movie tried to be more realistic.  It would not surprise me that in 450 we have great virtual reality and the ability to re-generate body tissue or the ability to stop an cut quickly and reattach a limb at a later time.  I like the cryogenic side too.The beginning, with Jason chained up, and then switching places with the guard and killing everyone I thought was too predictable of an opening and started on a bad foot (luckily the predictable stuff ended there for a while.)  The only other badly predictable part was Jason coming back to life during the autopsy.  We saw this already at the beginning of Part IV and a somewhat similar thing in the beginning of Part VI and Part IX.  But I guess there was no other way to do it.  Except if Jason was left alone and he came back to life.  I would have loved to see a human side to Jason where he is confused by being in the future and not on earth.  But oh well.I thought the characters were interesting in this one.  They were the most interesting people since Tommy Jarvis in Part VI.  The virtual reality camp crystal lake at the end was perfect!!!  And the two topless young girls to occupy Jason were hilarious.  We gonna drink and smoke pot and maybe have some sex.  We'll just be in the sleeping bags right now.  That was classic and great comedy relief and a great tribute to earlier movies.  I was expected one of two things when the Virtual Reality camp crystal lake.  I was hoping that they would VR Pamela Vorhees (Jason's mother) to the campsite.  It would have made Jason more human again, and we know deep down Jason was a Mama's Boy.  The other thing they could have done was VR either Tommy Jarvis from part VI or Adrienne King from Part I & II or others from earlier films to confuse or occupy Jason.  But they went for the more commic relief.  Plus, I never mind seeing a couple of young girl's breasts.The ending promised our typical setup for another movie on Planet Earth 2 (I assume) at a campsite.  It was expected, but done well.  If you're a fan of the genre or just the Friday the 13th movies, I would suggest going to see it for 2 reasons. 1) It's a pretty entertaining and interesting movie. 2) If it does well enough at the box office, we are certain the see the long awaited movie Freddy -vs- Jason.  New Line Cinema has been working on the project for a while, but are waiting to see how well Jason X does in the theaters.In future Friday movies, I'd love to see a prequel of sorts.  Explain what happened to Jason's father.  What happened from the 1950s until the early 1980s when Jason started killing in Part II.  And so on.My Friday The 13th Ranking System.  (Best to Worst)1) Part VI Jason Lives.  Great story, great characters.2) Part I The original...but no Jason until the end.  But great suspense.3) Part IX The director's cut is so gruesome, but great story.4) Jason X Yes, this actually makes it up to #4 on the list.5) Part III The 3-D was campy and dated.  But this in my mind was the scariest of all the Friday the 13th movies.  I saw this when I was 10 years old and I couldn't sleep for weeks after.  I just kept seeing that scene where Chris (who was one of the cutest Friday girls ever) after she hangs Jason walks up to his dangling corpse and Jason awakes, lifting his hockey mask, and flashing that dimented smile.6) Part IV The beginning of Tommy Jarvis!!!7) Part VII I didn't get into the whole Tina thing.8) Part II Basically a re-hashing of Part I with Jason doing the killing instead.9) Part VIII Jason takes Manhattan was terrible.  I assumed this was the end of the Friday series.  Luckily New Line bought the rights from Paramount and Sean S. Cunningham came back.  This movie was so bad that Sean S. Cunningham started Part IX to begin after Part VII and just ignored the 8th. (I read also that Sean S. Cunningham said Part IX really starts after Part II...because he didn't like any of the sequels after the 2nd.  Hence that's why we don't hear any reference to Tina or Tommy Jarvis in the last two movies.)  This movie was terrible.  Jason didn't end up in New York until the very end of the movie.  The New Yorkers, one of which I am, were so cliche.  And I never saw Nuclear Waste in the sewers. Hmmmmm.10) Part V One reason.  No Jason.  Stupid plot of some guy killing like Jason for revenge.  Only good scene was the part where the guy is killed in the Port-A-Potty.

Since they switch to slo-mo when he looks back, I can only assume that the director decided that effect was more importantly than a believable scene. This neglect of the big details for the sake of catching dialogue, over dramatizing, and over the top effects was obvious through the entire move. It was frustrating, because the acting and plot were good enough to make this movie a great one.

Nyet. I don't know my Dostoevski from my Tolstoy, and for years I thought the Brothers Karamazov were a family of Soviet trapeze artists, but that did not stop Love and Death from leaping straight to the top of my list of alltime favourite films.Made in 1975 (I've always thought Allen's best work was done in the Seventies), it is the story of a cowardly Russian who (very) accidentally becomes a war hero. It is the early 1800's and Russia is at war with Napoleonic France. Allen is Boris Grushenko, the youngest of three brothers in a rural family. Madly in love with Sonia, his cousin twice removed, played by a luminous Diane Keaton, he would rather philosophise and write poetry, but is instead drafted into the army. During the height of battle he hides in a cannon. The cannon is fired and he becomes a human cannonball who happens to land on a tent killing several French generals. He becomes the toast of Moscow, desired by beautiful women and reviled by their jealous lovers. But always in the back of his mind is his cousin Sonia. He even keeps a lock of her husband's hair to remind him of her. She is trapped in a loveless marriage to a herring obsessed businessman, and she has many affairs. They eventually find each other but just when life seems perfect she hatches a plan to assasinate Napoleon.If truth be told, any review of this comic gem would only do it scant justice. One has to see it to really appreciate the humour. It has sight gags aplenty, but also some marvellous dialogue. I also loved the incongruity of Allen's New York accent juxtapositioned against the perfect Russian accents of the supporting cast. There are many memorable scenes, highlights for me being the Black Russian drill sergeant, the verbal exchanges between Allen and Harold Gould, and the meeting between the real and the fake Napoleons.Prior to the success of Annie Hall, Allen's films were generally made with a limited budget, but this was no hindrance in this film. There was good costume design and lovely cinematography. I also enjoyed the use of composer Sergei Prokofiev's music to score the film.A sheer joy from beginning to end Love and Death is a lively and hilarious comedy to be savoured again and again.

The fighting is, of course, nonsense &#150; even sillier than the first film, but with the raw emotion and use of music you can't help but get involved &#150; even if you don't want to!  At times it goes a bit far and may look a bit like ego-massaging by Stallone, eg the scene where he is out on his training run and is followed by hundreds of supportive children!Stallone is good in all his roles, the playing of Rocky as a working class bum made good is bang on.  Shire doesn't have much to do but she's good beside Stallone.  Young is good and Meredith easily repeats his tour-de-force as the grizzled trainer.  Carl Weathers is good as Apollo Creed and this is one of his best roles.Overall this isn't a classic but by repeating the basic formula of the first movie and taking Rocky back to the gutter, this remains an entertaining soap that is driven by mushy, if formulaic, emotion.

Seeing that incredible body is worth watching the movie alone.  But, in it's own right, the movie is actually very funny and has pretty interesting story.  Surprisingly enough, there are a few twists in the film that I didn't see coming and made it a great movie.  The cast is excellent for this film, you can't go wrong with Gene Hackman, Sigourney Weaver, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  This is one of the few movies that I can say that the trailer didn't do the movie justice.  From the trailers, I thought it would be an so-so movie, but I thought the film was much funnier than the trailers made it out to be.  Some of the humor is very subtle though, so you have to think about it a bit, but most of the time that is not the case.  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.
