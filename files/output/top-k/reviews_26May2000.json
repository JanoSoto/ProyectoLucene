It was said that it was going to be like Jaws on land.  Well that is unfair to put that kind of pressure on it.  After all, nothing can really compete with Jaws when it comes to summer time terror.  But having said that, Jurassic Park is a good movie with quite a few tense scenes in it.  But what Jurassic Park lacks, and what would have made it a better film is something that I think we all would have liked to see.Dinosaurs are amazing creatures.  Being that it is the year 2000, we all know what they look like now.  But picture this back in 1993.  No one had seen a dinosaur on film.  Not a good one anyway.  There were a few old television shows where really fake and synthetic looking T-Rex's would chase down it's human prey, but that doesn't really count.  The world had never been exposed to Spielberg's vision and therefore, we had never really experienced what a dinosaur looked like for real.  But if you remember what Dern's and Golddblum's reactions were when they first saw the Brontosaurus' roaming in the field, that is probably what we all felt.  A complete and utter sense of awe.  Here is a species of animal that has been extinct for about 65 million years and we are getting to witness it for the first time on the big screen.  I just wish we had more time and more shots of these magnificent beasts roaming the earth.  I wish we had more time to just watch what they do, how they move, how they interact.  I realize this isn't a National Geographic show about dinosaurs, it is big budgetted Hollywood summer film that has to contain action, suspense and humour, but it just would have been nice to see them in all their glory for just a little longer than what we did.  I guess seven years later it really doesn't matter how I feel seeing as there have been countless other films with dinosaurs in them and Jurassic Park went onto become the biggest movie ever until James Cameron came along and decided to sink some ship.  But at the time it was a legitimate gripe.As for the rest of the film, it is an enjoyable romp through the jungle.  It has enough scares and suspense to keep everyone happy.  It also boasts of a very impressive cast.  Newman and Jules have substantial roles in it as well as Dern, Neil and Goldblum.  I am not really going to say much else about it.  After all, it has probably already been said.  It's not that I didn't enjoy the film because I did, it's just that I think they could have done more with it.7.5 out of 10Jurassic Park 3 should be interesting, especially now since Spielberg has traded in his director's hat for just a producing one.

And although I can agree that the film is a little laden with what can only be attested to as the banalities of scriptwriting, I have to admit that if you watch this film perhaps for a second or third time, the plot isn't just more clear, it is quite well done. So when the second Mission Impossible was unleashed to us, the makers promised a somewhat diametric film from the first.  And that is not always a good thing because I believe this one to be superior to the sequel.  Am I going to tell you the exact plot of the film to make it transparently clear for you?  No, of course not, I don't think that is possible.  I am still confused by some of the film but just suffice to say that where I was once apathetic to the film, I am now in appreciation of it.  This is a great action film that has a heavy but interesting story to go with it.  If you can listen and decifer what is being said, I think you can have fun with it.The crux of the story is that Ethan Hunt has to prove to his superiors that he is innocent of extortion, cajolery and all those other terrible sounding international espionge words.  It seems that IMF, the network that he works for, thinks that his parents have received an unjust amount of money in their bank account.  His father has gone bankrupt and all of a sudden a large sum of money has appeared in his account.  Cruise has to clear his name without the help of agency but he can still enlist the help of some rogue agents that are willing to help him.  This is where some really great casting comes into play when Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are recruited for the job.  That is only part of the story.  The rest of the story involves the confusing stuff.  Who is the bad guy, who lives, who dies, what is on the disc, who wants the disc, why is the Bible involved and so on and so on. Do I have the answers for all of this?  No, of course not.  But I can tell you that from the opening sequence in the film it is at least fun and entertaining if not a little confusing.Mission Impossible is a pastiche of James Bond films, James Cameron films and perhaps even films like French Connection and Bullit.  But that does not mean that it doesn't have a style of it's own.  One of the most breath-taking and intensely filmed scenes is the one in the agency.  We have all seen this one in the commercials and if we remember anything from Mission Impossible, it is this one sequence.  This is a tour de force in directing and Brian DePalma should accept many kudos for his work here.  I am generally not a huge fan of his but this film is done with Hitchcockian ambiance in some ways.  And this one scene is coup de maitre of the film.Mission Impossible is loaded with great stunts, an admittedly confusing but compelling story and a buffed up Cruise doing what he does best....pleasing the audience.  If you toss in Ving Rhames with his one liners and his unmistakably Marcellus Wallace manerisms, Cruise's funny yet serious diatribes like You have never seen me angry Kitteridge. and enough spy stuff to please any fan of the Bond genre, then what you have is a pretty good movie.

That can be the only reason this movie turned out like it did. Ever since I heard a year or so ago that there was a MI2 being shot and John The Master Woo was at the helm, I've been licking my chops waiting for the second coming.  Then I heard it was PG-13.  Oh, no; spider sense tingling. That's OK, I can deal with that because the trailer looked awesome.  Tom's doing his own stunts with hints of Capoiera.  My excitement steadily grew. Then again, most crappy movies have great trailers.The day finally came when I was able to be WOOED once more by the master of disaster.  My girl and I showed up 40 min early because I didn't want to fight for the last seat in the front, ten inches away from the screen.  The lights went down on a sold out crowd and I waited intensely from the magic to begin. The first 30 min of the film had me thoroughly enthralled.  I like rock climbing so the opening sequence was amazing.  Was that really Tom Cruise hundreds of feet high climbing without a safety line my girl asked. Looked real to me.Then all of a sudden something went terribly wrong.  The film got BORING. I love character developement, plot, drawn out conclusions, the works.  But, only if they work.  The chemistry was not there between Tom and Thandie, which I might add is very hot.  A far cry from Beloved.  Tom seemed as if he was bored also just going through the BAD dialogue.Mission Impossible is about teamwork not how good Tom looks in cool duds. This movie should have been called something else because it had absolutely nothing to do with MI at all.  Where the hell was the espionage.  That was the essential ingredient to the TV series and it was totally lacking.  I hate when these Hollywood hacks think they can re-write history and totally destroy everything that was good about the show in the first place.John Woo making a PG-13 movie should have been a dead give-away that I was in for a disappointment.  You can not edit his carnage to get a PG-13.  You will undoubtly piss off the LEGIONS of WOO fans as this message board has indicated.  Hollywood should be good for one thing, providing talent with financing, that's it.  Keep your ideas to yourself.  I am a filmmaker whose first release The American Dream will be released Fall 2001 and I can't tell you the ridiculous scenarios producers have told me to add to my film. It's a sad situation.  Hollywood is slowly sucking the life out of John Woo. He hasn't made an American film as good any of his HK stuff.  Face\/Off was about the closest he has come.  And that couldn't match The Killer, Bullet in the Head, Hard-Boiled.Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins should really have done something else with their free time.  These guys are great actors who deserve better than to be put in the background with BS dialogue.Here's a hint Hollywood.  The next John Woo flick better not have PG-13 rating.  His films are NOT for children by any means.  Remember The Matrix made over 400 million worldwide and counting and it cost about half of what MI2 cost.  And as far as MI3 goes, the plot is not supposed to be on a 3rd grade level.  So many people complained that MI1 was too complicated. THAT'S THE POINT.

His action scenes are choreographed like dances--Bullet Ballet, if you will.  He's also known for effective use of slow-motion photography, and all of his films have a very stylish look.  His best films were made in Hong Kong--rent Hard Boiled, The Killer, or A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 to see what I mean. None of his Hollywood films have lived up to that standard, but MI2 stands alongside Face\/Off as his best American work to date.The original Mission Impossible made a ton of money, but the plot also made a ton of people say huh?.  The nearly incomprehensible story took the steam out of the action, the cool score, and the even cooler gadgets. (Although I did find the 'chopper in the tunnel' finale a little too ludicrous.)  Thankfully, MI2 has simplified the story, and improved upon the score and the gadgets.  And the action sequences are visually more impressive and much more exciting.  In MI2, a fast-acting, lethal virus has fallen into the hands of villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) needs the help of a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and his computer genius buddy (Ving Rhames) to get it back.  That's it--that's the plot.  Not 25 lines.  Just one sentence!!  Perfect for an action film. In fact, rumor has it that the story was finished only after they decided on the action sequences.  I'd believe it--this isn't exactly an epic story a la Doctor Zhivago or Ben Hur.Let's start with the action sequences.  They're amazing.  Woo is certainly the master of creating action scenes with the added benefit of great style. His use of slow-motion enhances the frenetic fights and chases, and there are many fights and chases.  To me, the original MI lacked the full-out action that I expected from the Impossible Mission Force.  MI2 did not leave me wanting.  It's certainly the most exciting film I've seen this year.  Many bullets fly, cars and motorcycles chase each other, there is hand-to-hand combat, and several different objects find ways to explode. The motorcycle chase finale is on par with the boat chase in Face\/Off, and the final fight seems to take up the last 25 minutes of the film as it transitions from one locale to another.  An extra bonus you'll recognize Cruise in most of the scenes--he did a large amount of his own stuntwork. An early climbing sequence (you've seen some of it in the theatrical trailer) is especially impressive in this regard.Cruise is an underrated actor, but maybe that's changing since his well-deserved Oscar nomination for Magnolia.  I count this as Cruise's first all-out action film, so it didn't require too many of those skills. But I'm sure it was quite a workout.  Several of his films have had action sequences, but he's not flying a jet (Top Gun) or driving a race car (Days of Thunder) in MI2.  And he's really quite good.  His role in MI was more dramatic than aerobic, playing the cold and impersonal Agent Hunt.  Cruise actually gets to show emotions this time, making Hunt a much more enjoyable character.  He also does the main thing I wanted to see him do in MI--kick a lot of butt.  He's like an American James Bond charming, intelligent, and ruthlessly lethal when necessary.  Newton's character is similar to the best of the Bond girls she's sexy, has attitude, and brings something to the table other than just screaming help me.  Newton debuted to great reviews in 1991's Flirting, but this should be the film that gets her widely known (except for the 25 people who saw Beloved in 1998). Unfortunately, I really didn't sense a lot of chemistry between her and Cruise, and her role pretty much disappeared in the final quarter of the film.  Rhames is excellent as always.  He's been good every time I've seen him--a filmography that includes Bringing out the Dead, Entrapment, Out of Sight, Con Air, Rosewood, and Pulp Fiction.  This movie also has some humor, with most of the good lines going to Rhames and a helicopter pilot who might remind you of Murdock on The A-Team.  One thing I'll say for Woo's American films--he's always had a showy role for the villain. (Lance Henrikson in Hard Target, John Travolta in Broken Arrow, and Nicolas Cage\/Travolta in Face\/Off).  And MI2 is no exception--Scott (probably best known as Drew Barrymore's Prince in Ever After) really chews the scenery as the villanous Ambrose.I've made a few James Bond references because this film has all the elements of a good Bond film.  Dastardly villain threatens the world, and it's up to the daring secret agent to save the day and the girl who's in the clutches of said villain.  He must defeat the 'bad guys' through fights and chases in exotic locales, helped by numerous gadgets and a few trusty allies.  In fact, MI2 reminds me of Thunderball (1965), one of my favorite Bond films.With all that praise, why does it get 3.25 stars instead of 3.5 or 4?  For a few (fairly minor) reasons.  I've already mentioned the lack of chemistry between Cruise and Newton--they're certainly easy on the eyes, but the relationship wasn't really believable.  They 'met cute', and their interactions never grew more interesting after the first 15 minutes.  Also, the first 45 minutes were plagued with way too many slow-motion shots of people walking.  That's it--just walking.  I can understand it for action sequences, but just watching Cruise or Newton walk through a room or down the street?  It actually got a bit annoying.  Anthony Hopkins appears very briefly as Hunt's boss, but their interaction didn't interest me as much as the usual M sending 007 off on the mission scene at the beginning of the Bond films.  The first 45 minutes are worth 2.5 stars, but it ends big--raising the overall film to 3.25 stars.Buy your popcorn and prepare for a real thrill ride, and I don't think you'll be disappointed by MI2.  Note make sure you see it in a theater with a huge screen and high-tech sound so you get the most of the impressive sounds and visuals.

I think most of Scorsesse's films are about obsession.Travis is obsessed with cleaning the filthy streets of New York,mobsters are obsessed with money and power, and so on but in this film he goes far beyond because Pierce is obsessed with dead and that is a big issue in human life, probably the biggest. So he portrays a life saver, and he makes it clear when Pierce explains in his off-voice how good it is when one of his patients lives,how everything floats and how the only way to take it when someone dies is to put the blame on something else, and finally he gives shape to Pierce's obsession in the person of the girl he could not save and which face haunts him all the time. I understand the movie is built pretty much according to the book so Scorsesse must have been very enthusiastic about making this film. There is really no plot in this film, conventionally speaking, because the real plot is in Pierce's mind. It could be shocking for some people to see how the only way to rest for Pierce is to do the opposite of what he is so hard trying to do all the time, it really is out of morals and ethics patterns, but in the end what he is doing is to let things happen and by acknowledging that he is allowed to recover his peace.Nick Cage did a good job but it kind of reminded me too much his characters in Leaving Las Vegas and the US version of Wings of Desire, I see that as a concession to the audience and I don't like it but I understand audience is an important part of the business. Anyway I would have liked to see somebody else in that role. Patricia Arquette was really good too, she was really outstanding in her portrayal of the beaten up by life woman.If you like Scorsesse go and see it, you will not be disappointed, after all he does not make bad films.

So he portrays a life saver, and he makes it clear when Pierce explains in his off-voice how good it is when one of his patients lives,how everything floats and how the only way to take it when someone dies is to put the blame on something else, and finally he gives shape to Pierce's obsession in the person of the girl he could not save and which face haunts him all the time. I understand the movie is built pretty much according to the book so Scorsesse must have been very enthusiastic about making this film. There is really no plot in this film, conventionally speaking, because the real plot is in Pierce's mind. It could be shocking for some people to see how the only way to rest for Pierce is to do the opposite of what he is so hard trying to do all the time, it really is out of morals and ethics patterns, but in the end what he is doing is to let things happen and by acknowledging that he is allowed to recover his peace.Nick Cage did a good job but it kind of reminded me too much his characters in Leaving Las Vegas and the US version of Wings of Desire, I see that as a concession to the audience and I don't like it but I understand audience is an important part of the business. Anyway I would have liked to see somebody else in that role. Patricia Arquette was really good too, she was really outstanding in her portrayal of the beaten up by life woman.If you like Scorsesse go and see it, you will not be disappointed, after all he does not make bad films. If you don't like him definitely don't see this one.

It's surely no coincidence that the first sound we hear &#150; before the titles have even begun to roll - is that of The Ink Spots singing If I Didn't Care. The shot pans out to Tim Robbins in an old-fashioned automobile and then to a courtroom where his last words to his wife were I'll see you in Hell. No profanity from a bitter man in 90's cinema, though expletives do flavour the piece, with 24 uses of the f-word and 48 minor swearwords.A few minutes into the film and part of the reason is given the setting is 1947. However, the oldstyle trappings of the piece never leave it violence and sexual activity are never laboured on. Beatings are delivered in shadow, or, in the case of Andy's first, the camera discretely pulls back and turns a corner while we just hear the sound. Note we are never shown that Andy is raped, we are just told that he is by Morgan Freeman's narration. That's another strong point of the film, and also an historical device, that of first person narration. Freeman adds a constant magnetism to the film; his voice-over a necessity considering it takes place over 20 years. Refreshingly, the ageing process is used subtly, if at all, rather than using unconvincing prosthetics. A little grey to Morgan's hair and the power of persuasion is all that is needed to carry out the illusion of time passing.Another interesting point is that of race. Someone once told me they didn't like the film because they saw the black\/white male bonding between Robbins and Freeman as too contrived and worthy. I told them that this showed a suspect attitude on their part as Ellis Redding's skin colour hadn't occurred to me, nor is it ever mentioned throughout the film. It isn't an issue that Redding is black, he just IS. Ultimately, the redemption of the title comes from Robbins' humanitarian intellectualism against the warden's fundamental religious beliefs. But the ultimate testament to erstwhile cinema is that of two things plot and character. It's this strength of character, not to mention two superb understated leads, which mean you can watch it again and again, even when one viewing reveals the twist in the tale. All the characters are three-dimensional, breathing human beings that get not lines, but emotions and beliefs. Occasionally some &#150; not much, but some &#150; of the dialogue can strain towards the overly sentimental. Perhaps this is what produced the nauseating tagline Fear can hold you prisoner &#150; hope can set you free. Yuck! But generally this pleasantly paced, well-told tale hits the target in it's own relaxed way. Far from pedestrian, the timing of the film is like that of drinking a cool beer on a hot summer's roof, or a whole yardful of inmates standing stock still to the beauty of Mozart. The Shawshank Redemption was released the same year as Pulp Fiction, yet both of them were disgraced at the Oscars by the forgettable Forrest Gump. A great oversight.

Ridley Scott's directing is breathtaking and very innovative, the acting is very solid throughout the entire cast, the sound is wonderful, the production design is terrific, the editing is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful; all of the elements of filmmaking in this movie are perfect textbook examples, with the possible exception of the screenplay.  The plot of this movie is very simple a Roman general, named heir to the empire, is robbed of his position before he can accept it, and must escape his death only to be captured and sold as a gladiator.  He then must try to exact his revenge on the new emperor from his lowly position of gladiator and slave.  And now for the possible SPOILERS, so those of you who haven't seen the movie may want to stop reading.However, despite the simple plot, this film is actually quite deep.  It is a drama, not a melodrama, which means that the movie is driven by the characters, not the plot.  This film focuses on Maximus and Commodus, the gladiator and emperor.  I have heard complaints that the female lead did not play a very big part in the movie.  Well, no, she doesn't; that's why we call her part a supporting role.  The spotlight in this film belongs only to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, who deserves much more credit than he has been given for his role in the film.  Crowe is excellent in his role as the main character, but his character is a very straightforward one.  He is the perfect good guy, strong, courageous, loves his family, intelligent, and has good sportsmanship in a sport whose sole purpose is cruelty. Maximus is a true hero, one that can inspire the audience, but his character is not nearly as complex as that of Commodus; I think that Commodus' character is the most interesting aspect of this movie.First of all, regarding Commodus, (and here is a very big spoiler), the most common complaint I have heard about the movie is that it is just ridiculous to have Commodus fight Maximus in the Coliseum at the end of the movie.  However, if any of you go and do some research on the real emperor Commodus, you will learn that he actually fought over a thousand matches in the gladiator arena.  Of course, they were all set up so that he would win, but that's also exactly what he tried to do in the movie, isn't it? Commodus is so fascinating because he is not your stereotypical I love being evil and I hate everybody and I want to conquer the world villain. He is very mentally disturbed, having been raised in a sheltered, silver spoon childhood in which he basically taught himself his own set of values and virtues, which are not the same as what the rest of the world's values and virtues are.  He is evil, but in his own mind he does not believe he is evil.  He thinks that he is a victim, and that he is only trying to achieve the love and respect that he believes are rightfully his.  He is insanely jealous of Maximus, who commands the love and respect of everyone who knows him, seemingly without any effort, while Commodus himself tries so hard to be liked and still he gets himself nowhere.  He also wants desperately to be loved by his father and sister, who love Maximus instead.  Maximus has taken Commodus' place in his own family, and because of this, he feels justified in his cruelty.  This jealousy also explains why Commodus would fight Maximus in the arena.  Maximus has been a better brother and son than Commodus, and so to prove that he is better than Maximus, he must be a better warrior than Maximus.I went into this movie expecting to see an action-packed epic, but I quickly found that I enjoyed the film more when I began to watch it as a character study about Commodus with some very cool fight scenes, rather than a fighting movie with a sadistic, weak bad guy.  I suppose that in this respect it is very much like Fight Club, which also tells the story of the mind of a man who turns to a life of violence and destruction.  So if you like to watch action-packed movies with violence and great fight scenes, you'll love Gladiator.  If you like to watch movies that make you think, you'll love Gladiator, provided that you actually do think.  And if you like to watch excellently made, beautiful movies, you'll love Gladiator.  This is definitely a must-see for all movie enthusiasts.

I once walk in the rain to see it, I took my first date to see it and I have probably seen it 100 times on TV and Video.With all that said I think I have the right to critique the sequel. I remember waiting 3 yrs for part II, I remember hearing there might be one in 1977 and I was so excited.  Well, I remember I thought something was going wrong early in 1980 when I herd reports they wanted to call it  Smokey and the Bandit have a Baby But I was still eager to see it, I rushed to see it the first night it was released, I remember it was a packed house and I was really excited. Then it happened, while watching it I couldn't help thinking this thing was awful!It had nothing what so ever from the first one, they went for nothing but laughs, goofy plot, goofy gags, goofy jokes and transporting an elephant for $400,000 was so stupid! At first you might say, well wasn't the first like that? NO!!. Watch the first one again after watching the sequel, First - The Bandit was cool thru the whole movie, never lost his cool, never went for just a laugh, He was kinda the straight man. Even Jerry Reed (Snowman) had a really cool seen where he gets beat up (and this was a serious seen) and then runs over all the bikers bikes, that was great!! I remember the audience cheering when that happened. You even believed the Bandit and Frog really fell in love.

People think horror is simple because many of the horror films that they think of are films from the 80's that seem to have low production costs and a non existent cast.  But look again at some of the good horror from the last 40 years and you will see that fine tuning the craft of horror is just as difficult as any other and that when you have a good horror film, they are some of the best films ever made.  Personally, I place Jaws and Halloween on my top ten list of best FILMS ever made.  Even look at films like SIXTH SENSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD and Hitchcock's PSYCHO and you will see not just good horror films, but good films.  You can add FINAL DESTINATION to that list of films.  There is enough chills and scenes of true terror to make you jump and to satisfy any serious horror buffs craving an increase in pulse.To start off, the film has what has to be some of the best (and scariest ) fifteen minutes to open a film.  It involves a dream sequence that tells Devon Sawa that something terrible is going to happen.  He dreams of an airplane crash.  But not only does he dream of the crash itself, he dreams of details.  The camera manipulates us into feeling what he feels as it circles frantically around his room and then it gives us the details of impending doom which is imminently lurking in the shadows.  Then in real time, he tries to tell everyone that the plane is going to crash and he gets kicked off the flight just before it takes off.  And then, in one of the best scenes in horror film history, we watch as the plane, visible from the window, blows up.You know a film has achieved it's perogative in scaring you when you have seen that particular scene in the trailers and it still scares you.  That is powerful film making and James Wong should be commended for his awesome vision.  Wong worked on some small movies like TRICK OR TREAT in the 80's and he is an X-FILES veteran.  But here he shows us that he has the same vision that made some of the greats from the past so stylistic.  I know I am heaping a load of praise on the film and the director when I mention names like TEXAS, HALLOWEEN, and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it is well deserved praise.Final Destination doesn't have a true killer, not a tangible one anyway.  There is no man with a hockey mask, or a dream figure with long finger knives that attack the kids in this film.  But what we get are subtle shots of unstoppable signs of death.  Winds gust up, shadows envelop the walls, the camera plays with us to make us think or in some cases lets us know that death is imminent.  An unforeseen deity? spirit? demon? is approaching and there is nothing that anyone can do to stop it.  The casting is quite interesting as well.  Devon Sawa plays the main character and he is a wise choice even after his disasterous IDLE HANDS, but it is the supporting cast that is best part of the casting director. Kerr Smith sheds his sensitive gay persona from DAWSON'S CREEK and here plays a tough guy\/jerk.  And he plays it quite well.  Stifler, from AMERICAN PIE, suffers the worst death in the film and although he is good, he is basically just another character.  I would have liked to see him play more of a role, the producers of Road Trip got it right when they basically gave him the same role as the one he played in American Pie.  But I guess this is a horror movie and that is of little consequence to the film.  Ali Larter from VARSITY BLUES fame ( and a stint on Dawson's Creek ) is the one that shines here the most.  Another reviewer in here noted that she was one of the best young actresses of her generation and although that is lofty praise, I have to concur.  She carries the film when Sawa is absent and I expect to see great things from her in the future.Final Destination is one of the scarier films to come out in the last 40 years.  And yes I am serious.  This is one that is definitely worth checking out.  And for any of you horror buffs out there that haven't seen it ( and this is especially for you M.A. Rogers from New York, who is as big a horror movie buff as I am and I enjoy your reviews in the IMDb immensely ) really should get the time to see this.  It is well worth your time.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Horror has to be one of the hardest genres to master.  People think horror is simple because many of the horror films that they think of are films from the 80's that seem to have low production costs and a non existent cast.  But look again at some of the good horror from the last 40 years and you will see that fine tuning the craft of horror is just as difficult as any other and that when you have a good horror film, they are some of the best films ever made.  Personally, I place Jaws and Halloween on my top ten list of best FILMS ever made.  Even look at films like SIXTH SENSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD and Hitchcock's PSYCHO and you will see not just good horror films, but good films.  You can add FINAL DESTINATION to that list of films.  There is enough chills and scenes of true terror to make you jump and to satisfy any serious horror buffs craving an increase in pulse.To start off, the film has what has to be some of the best (and scariest ) fifteen minutes to open a film.  It involves a dream sequence that tells Devon Sawa that something terrible is going to happen.  He dreams of an airplane crash.  But not only does he dream of the crash itself, he dreams of details.  The camera manipulates us into feeling what he feels as it circles frantically around his room and then it gives us the details of impending doom which is imminently lurking in the shadows.  Then in real time, he tries to tell everyone that the plane is going to crash and he gets kicked off the flight just before it takes off.  And then, in one of the best scenes in horror film history, we watch as the plane, visible from the window, blows up.You know a film has achieved it's perogative in scaring you when you have seen that particular scene in the trailers and it still scares you.  That is powerful film making and James Wong should be commended for his awesome vision.  Wong worked on some small movies like TRICK OR TREAT in the 80's and he is an X-FILES veteran.  But here he shows us that he has the same vision that made some of the greats from the past so stylistic.
