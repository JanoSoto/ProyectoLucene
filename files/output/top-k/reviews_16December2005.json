I wouldn't recommend anyone waste 77 minutes of their life viewing this because it's lifeless, pointless and (beyond a certain yuk factor) ultimately very boring.Yes, it's true that it's shocking at a certain level to see the sex and violence that appear in this film, but there's no depth to that shock, there's nothing to provoke an emotional response because it's almost impossible to believe the events are linked to reality. We have no sympathy or even empathy with the characters in the film so at the emotional level we feel nothing.In a way, this is the art-house cinema world's equivalent of those Hollywood blockbusters which rely entirely on special effects and spend no time at all on plot or characterisations. Baise-moi relies entirely on predictably shocking situations and is plot less and character-free. Who are these people being murdered, and who are these people doing the shooting? And why is this happening? None of these questions are answered, so all you're left with are some uninspired and unoriginal visuals.Baise-moi does for sexuality and violence what Jurassic Park did for the ethics of cloning absolutely nothing. It's a cheap ride which exploits serious issues without ever taking those issues seriously. Rape is supposedly central to the film, but the emotional side of rape is ignored because the emotions of everyone involved are ignored. We have no idea what motivates anyone or what affects anyone on a personal level , because the script, acting and directing never address any of these areas. Worst of all, arguably the most horrific impact of rape, its mental scars, are completely glossed over. Rape in this film seems to be an entirely physical act, when in reality the motivation is often more to do with power and instilling a submissive mindset in the victim.You'll find some people claiming the film is about a rape victim taking the fight to the rapists, but that's just a total lie. This film consists of a series of random murders of absolutely anyone without any pattern however twisted men, women, rapists, non-rapists, pimps, prostitutes, complete strangers, anyone, almost all with no provocation whatsoever.You also get the feeling that if this film had been made by an American man instead of a French woman, no film festival or TV channel would have touched this with a barge pole. It's a sad state of affairs where the quality of art is pre-judged not by its contents but by the gender and nationality of its creator. Didn't any of them dare to say The Emperor Has No Clothes when they saw the preview tapes?In fact it's interesting to note that most of the people defending this film seem to display snobbery towards anyone who didn't like it.The Snobs imply that anyone who criticises Baise-moi must automatically be against all art films in general. They seem to think an attack on Baise-moi is an attack on art itself.Not so, and that kind of attitude is identical to and just as misguided as George W. Bush's You're either with us or against us philosophy.Anyone who has ever experienced the poetry of William McGonagall or the cinema of Ed Wood knows that an inflated opinion of one's own artistic abilities is no substitute for actual artistic abilities. McGonagall and Wood both had an absolute belief that they were creating high art which people would take seriously, yet they both failed to ever do this even once in their lifetimes. There is poor quality stuff out there as well as good quality, and it is completely okay to say some art is worthless while still being a fan of art in general.Baise-moi is worthless not because it's controversial, not because it's explicit, not because it's violent. All those things can and regularly do form part of some of history's greatest films. But not in Baise-moi.Baise-moi is worthless purely because it doesn't make you think in any way whatsoever. The only possible things you might appreciate are all superficial, and there is no depth to reach by scratching the surface. The surface is all there is, and it's a pretty ugly surface too.Maybe its worst crime is that it makes it slightly harder for other directors, directors with talent, to tackle similar themes. Baise-moi is a gift to every conservative who thinks art-house films are worthless exploitative trash masquerading as art, because, well, that's exactly what Baise-moi is.I love art films, and I have zero problem with them using any imagery or any themes whatsoever as long as they manage to make me think. This film doesn't do that at all, it just bored me. I don't want to ban it, I just want to warn people that their money and time will be wasted if they try and view this film. You'll get as much intellectual stimulation from watching a Chuck Norris film.So what went wrong in Baise-moi? I'm guessing the directors (who have never directed anything before or since) thought that simply showing a series of events was enough to make a good film. In fact good films do more than this, they show a interesting characters, or events, or imagery, or sometimes all of these things. There's always something to get hold of in good films, something to analyse or follow in your mind, but there's absolutely nothing here, nothing at all.There is no entertainment in Baise-moi, no thought, no emotion, just posturing of the worst kind. If cinema has gotten to the point where controversy alone is equated with intelligence and bravery, then there's no hope for intelligence and bravery in film-making any more, stereotypes will have triumphed over talent.

There are so many scenes in this movie that are so dramatic and really make the viewer think hard about cretin aspects of life. But the scene that sticks in to my mind most and really got me to think about the war and life is the Russian roulette scenes. I believe these scenes show how war can turn someone in to a completely different person. You also see how damaging the war can be physiologically and physically.When Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walkens) and Steven (John Savave) were taken into a POW camp and were forced to play Russian roulette, you see human nature at its lowest points and highest points. Steven loses his mind all together and has a complete mental break down, but Mike is there to help him through it. He puts his own fears aside to help his friend, while Nick just sits and watches. Nick seems to be confused about his surroundings and everything that is going on. Mike seems to be the only one realizing their reality that have landed into, and is willing to risk Nick's life and his own to see freedom once again. Before they went over to Vietnam, they would always say this was their duty to their country. It was all for their country. And I think that patriotism is a major aspect in this film, but it is very subtle. They are going to fight for our country, everything that our fore fathers built this country on and more. Mike, Nick and Steven could have given up, and said the hell with this. But they didn't. True Steven had a break down, but he still pushed his way to the end with a little help. Knowing that the next pull of the trigger might kill you and still willing to do it only proves your faith to your country and life. These three men prove their patriotism by risking their lives to keep us free.When Nick gets left behind and becomes a robot in a way, you see a darker side of war. Nick has become so angry and numb to the outside that he subjects him self to this game. The game Russian roulette is no longer a matter of life and death, it might be a punishment he puts him self though. Nick may have gotten so used to playing the game that he forgot what he was doing and it simply became part of his routine. The physiological damage that has been done to Nick is irreversible. He has reached the point where he cannot be saved. Nick decided his fate when he chose to continue with the Russian roulette, it's all most as if he was doomed to this fate from the start. When Mike returns to fine Nick and is playing Russian roulette hoping that Nick will snap out of it, you can see the hope and life draining out of Mike. It is taking all of his energy to play that game once again, and to get his best friend to realize what he is doing.I don't believe that the game Russian roulette shows their patriotism, I think that it is more about life and death. All three of them, however, do show their patriotism by going over to Vietnam and fighting. If you agree or disagree with the Vietnam or any war for that matter, you own the solders respect and gratitude. They are risking their lives so we can have the rights we have.

I had read the book back in the early eighties in the fifth grade and had never forgotten it. I always thought that it would make a good film (along with the Narnia tales and A Wrinkle in Time). The book was very engrossing and seemed a lot smarter and less condescending than some of the other books that wound up on school library 'recommended' lists. The movie contains the same wit and utter lack of condescension, making it a rarity in the world of tweenage cinema. Michelle Trachtenberg is very good. Her innate charisma and complete chemistry with Rosie o'Donnell make for perfect casting. Ms. O'Donnell herself shows once again how well she can carry off playing these quiet nurturing roles. (for another good performance by Rosie, see also Wide Awake)Harriet seems like a typical albeit intelligent kid. Her friends are like real friends they can be there for you and they can turn on you if they themselves feel under attack. This defense\/offense posture is typical in a child's world. and that's what's great about Harriet the Spy. You never feel that the film is talking down to its audience or trying to present the child world in such a sweetened watered-down way so as to placate adults. Harriet and her friends have their little quirks. there's also the other kids who have wierdnesses about them that if we try hard we can all relate to. For instance, there exists in every classroom a perfect Teacher's Pet like Marion Hawthorne. There is also a Pinky Whitehead and a boy with purple socks. (probably me back then haha) the important thing is that the movie accepts their world without whitewashing or judging them for it. Those posters who felt that the movie was juvenile must understand that it WAS written for children. That doesn't however mean that adults should avoid it. It contains several themes that can be discussed and understood by anyone Coping with school, Coping with Growing Up, Trouble with peers and miscommunication and isolation with parents and peers alike. As i said earlier, The character of Harriet was well thought-out. They could've done a little better fleshing out the character of Janie. If i remember correctly, she had a somewhat larger role in the book. But they actually improved on Sport's role.Some people have complained that the movie is disjointed and at times unrealistic. Well, try and think back to when you were eleven. wasn't the world somewhat surreal and disjointed? The movie is from The subjective lens of Harriet's minds-eye, an eye that see things with more than a little wit and imagination. Think back...then you'll get it.

I had read the book back in the early eighties in the fifth grade and had never forgotten it. I always thought that it would make a good film (along with the Narnia tales and A Wrinkle in Time). The book was very engrossing and seemed a lot smarter and less condescending than some of the other books that wound up on school library 'recommended' lists. The movie contains the same wit and utter lack of condescension, making it a rarity in the world of tweenage cinema. Michelle Trachtenberg is very good. Her innate charisma and complete chemistry with Rosie o'Donnell make for perfect casting. Ms. O'Donnell herself shows once again how well she can carry off playing these quiet nurturing roles. (for another good performance by Rosie, see also Wide Awake)Harriet seems like a typical albeit intelligent kid. Her friends are like real friends they can be there for you and they can turn on you if they themselves feel under attack. This defense\/offense posture is typical in a child's world. and that's what's great about Harriet the Spy. You never feel that the film is talking down to its audience or trying to present the child world in such a sweetened watered-down way so as to placate adults. Harriet and her friends have their little quirks. there's also the other kids who have wierdnesses about them that if we try hard we can all relate to. For instance, there exists in every classroom a perfect Teacher's Pet like Marion Hawthorne. There is also a Pinky Whitehead and a boy with purple socks. (probably me back then haha) the important thing is that the movie accepts their world without whitewashing or judging them for it. Those posters who felt that the movie was juvenile must understand that it WAS written for children. That doesn't however mean that adults should avoid it. It contains several themes that can be discussed and understood by anyone Coping with school, Coping with Growing Up, Trouble with peers and miscommunication and isolation with parents and peers alike. As i said earlier, The character of Harriet was well thought-out. They could've done a little better fleshing out the character of Janie. If i remember correctly, she had a somewhat larger role in the book. But they actually improved on Sport's role.Some people have complained that the movie is disjointed and at times unrealistic.

Everything in the movie seemed to have happened in just one day. Their initial plans were for the guy to fly to several places and for the girl to meet up with him in the following couple of weeks, but a couple of the girl's friends suggest that they both leave on the same night. Sidney Poitier does an excellent job playing the young fiancé, Dr. John Prentice as does Katharine Houghton,(who is the real life niece of Katharine Hepburn) playing the doctor's bride-to-be. This movie has some funny moments, but also has some poignant drama mixed in as well. The film also includes Isabel Sanford, who appears as the live-in maid for the girl and her family. She was great in this role. (I especially like the scene where she knocks on the door of the guest bedroom and walks in while the doctor is changing his clothes and tells him off. Whoa!!) It also includes actress Beah Richards as the doctor's mother. This movie did not do anything for civil rights (from what I learned) and was very controversial when it first came out in 1967 (this may also seem to apply to In the Heat of the Night). This was also the last movie that Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy would star in together during their careers, as Tracy died just several weeks after filming wrapped. And, for those of you who may not know, this is the only movie that Hepburn played the role of a mother in. The reactions of the girl's parents are mixed when she brings the guy home to meet them. Her mother approves of the mixed union, but her father does not approve, as the guy's parents are against the mixed union as well.

The plot does have some pretty big holes.Seriously now, just what is Kietel's character supposed to be doing? Is he really a captain? Say a crew member of that shuttle that went crazy with ideas of his own?Is he a criminal escaped in space?If that is the case, then how does he know all that earth protocol, and how does he know how to build and operate Hector, plus all the nuances of this new direct input technologies needed to teach Hector?

He has just gotten a nuclear disarmament treaty signed with the Soviet Union's leader, and it has (barely) been passed by the U.S. Senate. Both countries agree to get rid of their nuclear arsenals, and to end decades of potential nuclear catastrophe. But there are many who oppose this treaty, including Burt Lancaster, the greatest military hero of the day and head of the Joint Chief of Staff. He is in contact with several others regarding these fears, and they are planning a coup, to replace the President and his supporters and rip up this dangerous treaty. That is the background and story of Seven Days In May, except that Lancaster's closest assistant, Kirk Douglas, is appalled at the scheme and tips off March and his associates (Martin Balsam, Edmond O'Brien, George Macready). We are also aware that there is certain information that can be gotten by the President that would tarnish Lancaster's American patriot and family man image - his love letters to his mistress (Ava Gardner). Also, as the film goes on, we are aware of the spread of the coup - how Edmund O'Brien is held imprisoned by mutinous soldiers. And how Balsam may have gotten a confession out of one of the weaker links in the scheme.This film is interesting on so many levels. Not only does it include so many good performances in it, it is one of the most Oscar filled film casts one can think of - March, Lancaster, Douglas, Balsam, O'Brien, and even the uncredited John Houseman (as the weak-link Admiral Barnswell) all do well in the film. But what is most interesting to me is that the film was made when it was. Because it brings up the issue of whether a political coup can happen here or not.The subject of a fascist or dictatorial government taking over America is not new. Jack London wrote of such in The Iron Heel at the turn of the 20th Century. Sinclair Lewis did the same in 1934 with It Can't Happen Here, turning real life demagogue Senator Huey Long into Senator Buzz Windrip who seizes power. Hollywood would have an unsettling faith (to us) in fascistic politics in Gabriel Over The White House, This Day And Age, and even Harold Lloyd's strange comedy The Cat's Paw. That the Depression scared the people does not really reassure us today. But Seven Days In May was written in the 1960s. It does show how close to success such a plot may go.SPOILERS AHEADBasically, what saves the day for President Jordan Lyman's administration, and the treaty, is that the confession of one of General Scott's confederates is found. Lyman is unable to bring himself to be as underhanded towards the General as the latter deserves (he can't bring himself to use the love letters the General wrote his mistress to discredit the man). The deus ex machina of the confession saves the day, and causes the other leaders of the coup to save themselves, so that Scott is deserted and discredited as a traitor (when Jiggs, sarcastically asked if he knows who Judas was, tells Scott that he is Judas Scott realizes it's over). His collapse is completed as he hears over the radio of the resignations of his co-conspirators.The interesting thing was that Knebel's novel pushed a different slant on Scott's final collapse. Lyman, in the novel, produces the confession to Scott, and they both hear of the resignations. Scott leaves the Oval Office aware that it is over, but thinking that he might (after he resigns) start a political campaign to replace Lyman in the White House in the next election. Instead, he is confronted by Senator Clark (O'Brien) and Secretary of the Treasury Todd (George Macready)outside the Oval Office. They remind Scott that if he intends to run for the Presidency rather than resigning, there is still the matter of the love letters. Clark tells him that while Lyman is too much the gentleman to use them, neither Clark nor Todd would hesitate the opportunity of smearing him as a moral hypocrite. Scott actually is more concerned about this - and actually tries to hide behind the theoretical skirts of his betrayed wife at this moment (You wouldn't want to hurt her - that sort of thing). Regretfully they wouldn't care.In 1962, John Frankenheimer had done The Manchurian Candidate, which also suggested a threat to American Democracy (although manipulated by foreign governments and their hidden agents). Then President John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and in modern times (sixty three years since the last successful Presidential murder) violence had shaken the government. So Seven Days In May was quite timely when it came out in 1964. It has lost none of it's timelessness since then.Oddly enough, Fletcher Knebel wrote another political thriller that never did get made into a film. I'm not referring to Vanished, which was made into a television movie in the 1970s. I am referring to A Night At Camp David. In that novel, a popular American President invites his Vice President to spend a week-end in the Presidential retreat, and has a series of conversations about policy plans that reveal to the increasingly frightened Veep that his chief is an insane paranoid, who is planning moves that may lead to global disaster. The problem Only the Veep has been informed of this - nobody else. How is the Veep to get the public to realize the danger, without people feeling the Veep is only spreading lies against a popular President in order to seize the Presidency himself?

Not much, at first glance, unless you are in the head of director Pedro Almodovar. In his film Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios, Pedro mixes apparently unconnected objects and events that make no sense until the film is over. His direction and distinct style combined with good actors makes a movie as unforgettable as it is foreign. The basic plot deals with one day in the life of Pepa Marcos, played by Carmen Maura. During the day, we meet her lover, Ivan, who has a son, Carlos, whose girlfriend is Marisa, but like his father, Carlos is not loyal to Marisa but would rather kiss whoever walk in front of him, like Candela, Pepa's friend. All of the opposing motives create and tense mood, but besides everything is seems that Pepa knows what is going on and only worries about Ivan. The main subject is the destructive cycle of machismo and the women that are trapped by it. There are three girls and have fallen in love with one man that really doesn't love any of them, but only as temporary lovers. The tragedy is that the women don't realize this except Pepa who ends her relationships with Ivan. Even though she doesn't love Ivan anymore, we see with her conversation with Marisa, that she has not given up her love for machismo, but that she wants the telephone repairman. In my opinion, what makes this film good is the direction by Almodovar. I have never seen a style so distinct and interesting like his. The settings are familiar, but at the same time the colors create another world, like the world of Oz. One scene that captures this is when Pepa talks with Lucia on the phone and we can only see their faces and bright backgrounds. This is just a small example, but the attention to detail is the most important job to a director, and Almodovar has done it well. I recommend the move to anyone that wants to try something new, even though it was filmed in 1988. I think that anyone can relate to at least one role, especially because of the great acting. The film could give us a new look on our concept of love while keeping an open mind.

However, when you see the frankly fantastic model breaking the surface, it makes you think yeah this was worth the wait. The dialogue (or lack of it) is wooden, and the movie does little to explain properly the Sicilian project and its potential, but the model and its raising is fairly well represented. But have you ever considered the consequences of its raising. In the film it comes up damned fast, like the novel, except that instead of stern first it comes up bow first. Well sorry, but if that happened the stacks would be shorn off along with the masts, the film was so hurriedly put together that the film makers forgot that. Also, when it breaks surface it comes up sssssssssslllllllllllllllloooooowwwwwwwwlllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, why the massive deacceleration? One ironic thing about the movie is this, when the enormous 50 foot model was built, the leader of the team responsible for its construction was justly proud, and for good reason. When built it was finished as the ship as built, because originally the film would feature the sinking, but that footage was cut out to cut the time down. When the ship was weathered and damaged for the sunk Titanic, the movie folks bought an old liner to play the part of the raised Titanic, with a few cosmetic modifications. This old Italian liner had two mast things next to the main fore mast, and so when the model makers weren't looking, they added these to the model! The guy who built it was absolutely furious! I am a Titanic enthusiast who knows a fair bit about the Titanic story, and so watching the Titanic break surface was magic, its like a dream come true! Alas though, it is impossible in reality. And its more magical with it sunk! Bring the Titanic back to the surface and the legend becomes reality, and nobody will care after 10 years or so.Watch it for a laugh, and the raising, but be prepared for a few unanswered questions, and a poor ending, which seems to try and end the film as quickly as possible. I recommend watching, then reading the book, which is very good, so that all the questions you raise can be answered.

Because when I watched it, I had not read the novel. It was only when I obtained a copy that I realised the movies shortfalls. However, when you see the frankly fantastic model breaking the surface, it makes you think yeah this was worth the wait. The dialogue (or lack of it) is wooden, and the movie does little to explain properly the Sicilian project and its potential, but the model and its raising is fairly well represented. But have you ever considered the consequences of its raising. In the film it comes up damned fast, like the novel, except that instead of stern first it comes up bow first.

John Cassavetes also gives a memorable, unforgettable performance as her husband willing to sell his wife out for a successful acting career. You never really like the character because of his immoral actions. As Rosemary comes closer to the truth, we are equally horrified by her discovery of her husband's new allegiance and the satanists who look so ordinary like Aunt Bee from the Andy Griffith Show. You never see them as anything but ordinary and that proves that the nicest, kindest neighbors can fool you. Ruth Gordon's performance as Minnie is well chilling. I won't give away the ending but I bet everybody knows it. A Satanist was consulted on the film and he was connected to Charles Manson whose gang murdered the director's wife. It's more horrifying than the film itself. While I get goosebumps about this story, it won't just leave you. You will always wondered what happened to that baby. Polanski who survived the holocaust as a child always knows how to remind you that people even the sweetest looking people in the world can be evil too.

The rest of the cast is great with Margaret Lockwood as the woman she befriends on the train. Sir Michael Redgrave also is wonderful as the obvious love interest of Lockwood. The film is truly filled with Hitchcock's stamp all over it. He takes a simple story and makes us not only intriguing but entertaining as well. They remade the film again in 1978 more than 40 years after this film debuted in British cinema. This classic film should not be mixed up with that one. I enjoyed this film. It had its humorous moments. I think this film is really wonderful to watch without being too much. Nowadays filmmakers can take note by Hitchcock's genius and talent. You do not need grand special effects today to create a memorable film but great actors and decent writing. This film is a great film about a good old fashioned mystery without deterring the audience. This film is good old fashioned movie making at its best.
