All the characters are good enough, and the setting was certainly unusual, plus Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman are simply amazing in this!. It actually does have a couple of good little twists, and while the boat chases are exciting, I just felt it could have been a lot better, plus Randy Quid did a great job here. There is one tense scene where Slater is trapped in a cell in water, and all that rain definitely gave it some creepy atmosphere at times, plus Freeman's presence definitely helps. Slater and Minnie Driver had decent chemistry together, and I also liked the music in it as well, plus the finale was pretty exciting too. it's a perfect time waster, if your looking for something to watch that will at least keep you entertained, and all the characters are pretty likable as well, plus it's well made and decently written in my opinion. This is an above average action film, that has it's exciting moments here and there, with solid performances and a decent story, and I say it's well worth the watch. The Direction is good. Mikael Salomon does a good job here with good camera work, solid angles, adding some good atmosphere and keeping the film at a fast enough pace. The Acting is very solid. Christian Slater is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, very charismatic, had a cool character, also had some good scenes with Freeman, and proves he can be a good action star when needed to be, he also had a couple of cool one liners! (Slater Rules!!!!!). Morgan Freeman is also amazing as always and is amazing here, sure he was just looking for a paycheck, but he gave it his all, and as always had tons of presence, and was especially cool at the end (Freeman Rules!!!!!!!). Randy Quaid is pretty good here, and had a very mysterious character, as the Sheriff, I'm not a big fan, but he was very good here. Minnie Driver is cute, and does fine with what she had to do I rather liked her. Edward Asner is good in his scenes as Uncle Charlie. Betty White is amusing in her role I liked her.

So-called sophisticated comedies replaced screwball comedies with the likes of Woman of the Year and To Be Or Not To Be. One of the best directors of screwball comedies, Howard Hawks, made one last hurrah with Monkey Business which can be considered the final comedy of the genre (there were elements of screwball comedy in Some Like It Hot and other later films but these don't really fit the category completely).Monkey Business is all but forgotten today even though its cast includes many of the best actors around at the time. The only element that keeps it from being swept under the rug totally is the significant appearance of sex goddess Marilyn Monroe who was beginning to show the world that she was more than just a sex kitten. Though Hawks focuses on that aspect of her persona, she is able to rise above it with her immense comedic talents. Perhaps another reason for this movie's obscurity is the title, since one of the great Marx Brothers films is also called Monkey Business. This little gem is a winner. The writing talents of Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, and I.A.L. Diamond are utilized to create a laugh-a-minute marathon of science fiction hocus-pocus brought to life by Cary Grant, who is outrageous in his antics especially when he reverts to childhood, Ginger Rogers, who gets to cut a rug in what becomes almost a parody of her dances with Fred Astaire, the always wonderful Charles Coburn, Sex pot Marilyn Monroe adds the spice, and all threaten to be upstaged by Esther the Chimp.The lines in the script are at times saucy to say the least for a film made in 1952. When buying a sports car Dr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant) mentions adding a beaver tail. The camera pans and shows Marilyn's feet and legs, then travels upward. While Barnaby and Lois Laurel (Marilyn) are driving the sports care for the first spin, the conversation becomes titillating with Lois Laurel telling Barnaby how hot she is. When Barnaby and his supervisor Oliver Oxley (Charles Coburn) speak about secretary Lois Laurel, the camera pans from her bottom to Oxley who comments, Anyone can type. There are many other sexual innuendos sprinkled throughout including a scene when a naked baby crawls into bed with Edwina Fulton (Ginger Rogers). She thinks it is her husband Barnaby who has become an infant by drinking the youth potion. She first arrives at this conclusion when she feels the baby's butt.The story sounds simple when outlined. In reality, it becomes complex in its presentation. A brilliant chemist, Dr. Barnaby Fulton, is extremely absent minded. Consequently he continually misplaces notes to experiments and forgets at times to write down some of the main ingredients to his formulas. Working on a youth concoction and using chimps in his experiments, he is not adverse to drinking his own mixtures becoming a human guinea pig. While a monkey is loose in the laboratory, the skillful creature mixes his own potion which is accidentally put into the water cooler. This leads to all types of hilarious situations, including one scalping, with the team of scientists headed by Oxley trying to find the one ingredient that makes the formula work.The humor is fast-paced, the lines fly like a buzz saw.

Recently I bought the DVD due to the film's excellent reputation, then sat down with eager anticipation to watch. But about half way through, I turned it off. If the ending was brilliant, then I guess I made a mistake (and my apologies for reviewing a movie I did not watch all the way through)OK, so is this a serious, arty film, or parody? I never did figure it out. Excellent music in the beginning helped lead me to believe it was more of an arty film, and through an early scene in the gymnasium, I was doing OK. But then things started to go steadily downhill. First there is the disastrous relationship, which defies any logic, between Kevin Spacey's character and his wife. If you liked Raging Bull (I didn't), this relationship is for you. Because the two are at each other's throats from the very onset of the movie, one never actually gets a chance to find out what started it all. Sure they are politically mismatched, but we are also expected to believe they are sexually mismatched as well, something that was not so easy for me to understand. But at any rate, I guess we're expected to just swallow it all and believe..Soon after, we are introduced to an odd assortment of characters, some conservative and some liberal. Its obvious who the director favors, and I have no problem with his bias as I am not as fond of cheerleaders and military men as I am of arty types either. But did we really need to get hit over the head with such crude stereotypes? Ever hear of subtlety? Now suddenly the arty film is beginning to look more like a National Lampoon parody. Not only is the cheerleader a LITTLE slutty, for example, but she is the MOST slutty cheerleader you have ever seen. I guess I'd just rather this be more implied than forced down my throat. And so it went with the other characters as well. Now I'm starting to lose interest in the movie.......but then the moment came when I suddenly realized what this movie was REALLY about - an autobiographical tale about a young filmmaker, presumably the writer or director himself, at a young age. This becomes apparent when you see how much sensitivity and depth is given to the characters Ricky Fits and Judy Burnham as their relationship progresses. Yes, it was touching at times and well done.But I guess its just not what I expected to see nor why I bought the DVD. The socio-political message of a suburban family gone berserk, of alienation, of normal and crazy getting reversed - this is not exactly a new theme. This has been the stuff of Hollywood in one form or another for decades, and its no wonder as it's there that all those crazy, alienated creative people eventually end up. Watch any M*A*S*H episode and you will see cheerleaders and military men trashed, suburban lifestyles (Frank Burns) mocked, and sensitive (or crazy) souls deified. This is profound and new? And so since none of this surprised me or caused me think deep thoughts, I was mainly left to wonder what else the film had to offer besides good music.Maybe I just didn't wait long enough to find out, but then again I just couldn't handle all the screaming nor the no holds barred approach which often made it come across more like crass parody than important film-making. And as for the glowing reviews to be found elswhere at IMDb? - I think the authors are just as deluded that they are being profound as the director of this film was.

This thought occurred to me as I was watching Jacob's Ladder and realized that the only reason he is in the movie is because studio executives made them put a kid in the movie to be more relatable. He screwed up way too many good movies when he was a kid. Home Alone would have been a lot better if it was just Joe Pesci breaking into an empty house and stealing crap.But anyway, this is Jacob's Ladder, written by the fag who wrote Ghost. (by fag of course I mean an English term for cigarette, because I want to light this guy on fire) Jacob's Ladder is a lot better than that piece of crap, and is actually a really good movie. It's just that the writer tries to screw everything up with his sorta weak ear for dialogue. Thankfully, Bruce Joel Rubin (if that is your real three names), you failed on all counts. Instead, Adrian Lyne (whose name for some reason reminds me of fabric softener) makes this into one of the best freakouts in the history of movies of the films of the cinema. Shaky head people abound. And this is the first and last time I've ever seen stubby legged drooling people and breastfeeding women crawling on the same grated ceiling at the same time. I've seen them on different grated ceilings, but this is the first movie to combine the stubby legged drooling people and the breastfeeding women in the same sequence.Some of the imagery in this movie is just plain brilliant. And by brilliant, I mean Known to cause Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is what I mean normally when I say brilliant.

There were some suggestive hints about Carter having a background, but it was as if the movie left you hanging, or you got to make up whatever happened yourself.There were some bad points as well.

Yes, sometimes it's unavoidable, but then, others, you can tell he randomly jumps and slides away. Every time they try to do anything, Carter is falling down. Also, what gets to me each time I see the movie is when the stretcher hits the window. All the cast members stand there watching.

Really? Is it really that bad, worse than Manos - The Hands of Fate or Cocoon - the Return? I think most of the people who diss this film fall, broadly, in three large categories 1) those who are so attached to the original short story that they can't stand the idea of an eponymous film with a different vision (although, again, its Gibson himself who penned this script!) This is not purism, but acting like brats - just like those who criticized the film Resident Evil for not sticking closer to the original games. 2) then, there are those who have a personal dislike for Keanu Reeves, and they follow him over the 'net, criticizing him for wooden acting. It doesn't matter to them that the Johnny character is exactly what Keanu portrays - an egotistic, self-absorbed bastard, who only cares about his posh clothes, cold Mexican beer and hookers (and there are already so many out there like him, in the real world!). Then 3) there are those who are simply too stupid to actually watch what's going on on the screen, because of personal convictions, education or background (i.e. those who mention Grenpeace and anti-capitalism as if they are capital crimes, or those who think PharmaKom is a Japanese company). I was particularly amused at the user who launched a furious diatribe against the idea of the Lo-Teks being so visible in the ruined bridge, despite the fact that the only time in which they actually identify themselves as the source of anti-establishment activities is the very end, when they also announce they'll be going off the air. The list could go on. But this is supposed to be a review, not an answer to those who dislike the movie so vehemently.I believe this is *the* film which, despite its occasional artistic shortcomings, connects Blade Runner to The Matrix. It was a courageous endeavour, portraying an all-too possible near future, and reminded me of another picture, similarly vilified by simpletons who couldn't see beyond the surface - Starship Troopers. The sad fact is that the movie was mistreated, and what we ended by seeing on DVD in most of the world is not what the director intended. There is an alternative version (briefly mentioned on this site) which makes some significant changes, and it's available only in Japan. First of all, the prologue is different and more poignant. Here it is, in this exact formNew century. Age of terminal capitalism.The armored towers of multinational corporations rise above the ruins of the democracies that gave them birth.Soldiers of the Yakuza defend them.Hackers, data-pirates, LoTek media rebels are the enemy, burrowing like rats in the walls of cyberspace.A new plague convulses the cities Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, incurable, fatal, epidemic, bringing fear and misery as old as the species itself.But the most precious data is sometimes entrusted to elite private agents, wetwired to function as human data banks.Mnemonic couriers.In this day and age, in the post-Enron, post-9\/11 world, all the above doesn't seem so far-fetched anymore.The film is more somber in the Japanese version. We see more of Takahashi's inner desolation, and there are some added bits of gore and violence in the Beijing fight. Johnny himself is much more of a corporate puppet - we see it from a longer dialogue with the hooker in the hotel room, or in the scene in which he acquires the memory doubler. We see J-Bone sticking a syringe in the dolphin, sadistically commenting how the creature is a junkie.There is also more realism involved (Spoiler alert!) the hero doesn't somehow miraculously recover his childhood memories after being connected to Jones.

This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic 'feel good' must see. I can't resist watching it every single time it comes on TV. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay 'just business' for long.Rather than the plot itself, the beautiful Julia Roberts makes this movie...and not simply because of her 88 inches of leg! Always endearing in her roles, she is at her absolute MOST endearing portraying Vivian in this picture. She brings a real vulnerability to the role, showing us that just like everyone else, prostitutes do indeed floss their teeth! Richard Gere pulls off quite convincingly the role of Edward, the ruthless, calculating millionaire businessman, who takes over companies only to sell them off piece by piece, quite unmindful of the interests of any people involved. To give Gere credit, I was quite impressed that he actually plays the piano in one of the movie's scenes.Naturally, given Vivian's membership in the 'oldest profession', there is sex early on...though I, old fashioned and strict as I am, wouldn't hesitate to let my young teen see this movie. (There's worse in TV commercials today!) Oddly, the most truly intimate moment in this film is not during the more explicit sex but rather, simply a kiss.Ohhhh, lots of romantic scenes, from a picnic in the park to jetting off in a private plane for a Big Night on the Town. And etiquette lessons...Vivian displays charming, amusing, curious innocence when she experiences with Edward her first opera (all the while looking knock out gorgeous in a stunning red gown), her first polo match, and her introduction to escargots. As the movie progresses, she is transformed Pygmalion style, from the street smart hooker provocatively dressed in tall black boots and mini skirt, to a sophisticated looking, elegantly gowned and coiffed young lady. But it's merely appearance...Vivian's heart of gold and her vulnerability both remain unchanged.The status conscious snobbery of Beverly Hills dress shops and ritzy hotels, judging people by wealth and class, is well depicted here. When Vivian goes shopping for a 'more appropriate' wardrobe at some exclusive Rodeo Drive boutiques, she is not 'well received' by the sales ladies, who like all too many of us, are overly inclined to judge by appearance. You'll want these snobs to get their comeuppance. Actually, perhaps the most touching relationship in this entire film is the one between Vivian and Barney, the quite proper but kind desk manager at the high class hotel (where she is sharing a penthouse suite with Edward), who is able to see beyond appearance. He develops a genuine fondness and even more importantly, respect for her.Other characters of interest...Kit is Vivian's appealing and sympathetic room-mate, also a hooker (Vivian's a loyal friend), and Stuckey is Edward's sleazy and despicable business colleague, portrayed by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, a TV show which I must confess is not my favourite. As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of 'prostitution', Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, 'The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.'

It's basically the story of a hunt. Initially the principal characters believe THEY are the hunters, as they stealthily creep through the jungle towards a guerilla stronghold. We in the audience know that these principal characters are actually the huntED, thanks to an opening sequence which shows an alien spaceship swooping from outer space into the Amazon jungle. What we have here, in effect, is another variation of The Most Dangerous Game, dressed up with state-of-the-art special effects, tons of hardware and weaponry, insanely pumped-up heroes, and an alien baddie as opposed to a mad-man.American soldier Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is called upon to lead his crack team into the hostile South American jungle. A helicopter has crash-landed carrying some very important people, and Dutch and his boys are supposed to find them and rescue them. The mission seems straightforward enough, until Dutch's men start hiking through the jungle and come across the flayed carcasses of another American military team. Tag along team-member Dillon (Carl Weathers) claims he knew nothing of another American unit operating in the area, but Dutch is already beginning to suspect that there's more to the mission than meets the eye. Eventually, Dutch and his boys find the enemy encampment which they promptly wipe out in a lightning attack. But they learn that they have been misled about the true objective of their mission (it wasn't a rescue mission at all, but an annihilation one). As the team head off into the jungle to their helicopter rendezvous point, they suddenly fall foul of a mysterious adversary which picks them off stealthily from the tree-tops. Gradually, they realise that they up against an alien being which is hunting them for sport.... and which can camouflage itself so that it all but blends in with the surrounding environment!Predator is a solid suspense flick, which has simple intentions but achieves them effectively. It never pretends to have any deeper meaning beyond the immediate excitement, and is all the better for this lack of pretension. The testosterone-fuelled cast play their roles with the macho conviction required; there's nothing challenging or subtle about their performances, but they do what's needed to suit the mood of the film. The special effects are good for the era, and actually hold up quite well when viewing the movie nowadays. The film moves along to an exciting finale, though I must say I found it hard to swallow the fact that when Arnold was setting all his traps and crafting his weapons in the film's closing moments, the predator was unable to sense him (yes, OK, he was caked in mud.... but he was making a lot of noise, moving around plenty, and working by firelight!?!) All things considered, Predator is an enjoyable, slick, simple-minded and effective suspenser.

What we have here, in effect, is another variation of The Most Dangerous Game, dressed up with state-of-the-art special effects, tons of hardware and weaponry, insanely pumped-up heroes, and an alien baddie as opposed to a mad-man.American soldier Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is called upon to lead his crack team into the hostile South American jungle. A helicopter has crash-landed carrying some very important people, and Dutch and his boys are supposed to find them and rescue them. The mission seems straightforward enough, until Dutch's men start hiking through the jungle and come across the flayed carcasses of another American military team. Tag along team-member Dillon (Carl Weathers) claims he knew nothing of another American unit operating in the area, but Dutch is already beginning to suspect that there's more to the mission than meets the eye. Eventually, Dutch and his boys find the enemy encampment which they promptly wipe out in a lightning attack. But they learn that they have been misled about the true objective of their mission (it wasn't a rescue mission at all, but an annihilation one). As the team head off into the jungle to their helicopter rendezvous point, they suddenly fall foul of a mysterious adversary which picks them off stealthily from the tree-tops. Gradually, they realise that they up against an alien being which is hunting them for sport.... and which can camouflage itself so that it all but blends in with the surrounding environment!Predator is a solid suspense flick, which has simple intentions but achieves them effectively. It never pretends to have any deeper meaning beyond the immediate excitement, and is all the better for this lack of pretension. The testosterone-fuelled cast play their roles with the macho conviction required; there's nothing challenging or subtle about their performances, but they do what's needed to suit the mood of the film. The special effects are good for the era, and actually hold up quite well when viewing the movie nowadays. The film moves along to an exciting finale, though I must say I found it hard to swallow the fact that when Arnold was setting all his traps and crafting his weapons in the film's closing moments, the predator was unable to sense him (yes, OK, he was caked in mud.... but he was making a lot of noise, moving around plenty, and working by firelight!?!) All things considered, Predator is an enjoyable, slick, simple-minded and effective suspenser.

I first heard about this film on my freshman year in high school and I neglected it just like what I've done to European and Asian films (I was so into Hollywood before). Still, I was curious when I saw the movie poster, showing Amelie with a giggly yet mysterious smile. Often I tried to search for a copy of the film but I ended up buying poorly-written, Hollywood teenyboppers. So it was really a good experience when we got to watch this on class.I chose Amelie mainly because its theme is unique for me. I am really fond of films with very colorful characters, those who are not usually found in every society. Amelie might be very typical externally speaking. She's just an ordinary boarder working as a waitress in a ghastly restaurant. We might have seen that kind plenty of times already. But personality-wise, Amelie is unique, being curious on everything she's unaware of and trying to deal with the people around her while being herself all the time. She's childish, she throws stones at ponds to ease with her problems, but quite inspiring. She encountered certain traumatic experiences in her childhood, but still she preserved her colorful personality.As much as I've enjoyed the color of Amelie's personality, I was absolutely entertained with the color used in the cinematography. In the whole film, the yellowish tone of the color was maintained. It was advantageous for me since I am relaxed with this kind of tone, unlike those in films that are too dimly-lit or too bright. I don't know exactly why, but I think it psychologically relaxes my mind (and my poor vision).In general, I liked the film because it doesn't preach, it tends not to change our perspectives in an instant. It just clearly shows us how slowly we could improve our own lives and at the same time, try to improve others in our own little ways. There are some flaws in the film's realism, especially in the animation-side, but I still enjoyed the whole of it. It was just like daydreaming, and then waking up having a dose of heartfelt optimism.

Indeed, a tantrum is never a pretty thing to witness. But, oh! What have they done to my beloved X-men?! I'm trying very hard not to waffle on about the DECADES of source material available for the movie-makers to draw upon; The wealth of characters, the gamut of emotion, the endless high-adventure!!For all you fan-boys; no I'm not talking about the mockery of the expanded X-Franchise that these days litters the magazine-shelves of every supermarket and comes with a free holographic Pog stuck to the cover! I am, of course, referring to the Golden Age of comics, long before Marvel saw fit to suck Satans scaly member, and churn out the vacuous drivel its famous for today. No, Marvel is dead, and movies such as this one are surely the final nails being hammered into its coffin. (Mercifully, the art of the comic book is still alive and well, and flourishing in the tender hands of the poorer, independent labels, where both artists and writers still toil away for the love of the medium.)This movie, even standing alone and not being compared to its periodical counterpart, soars to new heights of mediocrity. Looking as though its been filmed almost entirely on location in someones garden-shed, it has none of the grandiose, theatrical spectacle that it seems to think it has. Even given a beautiful location, such as Liberty Island, (and was that Grand Central Station?), our intrepid film-makers still manage to find a way of shooting it, so as to make you believe your watching someones shaky wedding-video! Every effort to impart a sense of gravitas or screen-presence falls flat. And the score? Well... Do you remember seeing Rocky for the first time? Or Superman-The Movie? Remember how, on leaving the theatre, that theme tune was still ringing in your head, and did so for many years to come? Yes, well, this has none of that. Even the X-Men animated series had a catchy theme, I only saw it once or twice, but I can still hum you a few bars if you'd like? Oh, but wait, I haven't even started on the X-Men themselves yet! They had the cast. SIR! Ian McKellen! Patrick was-that-boldly-or-baldly? Stewart! Halle but-i-look-pretty! Berry! Hugh rugged-yet-charming Jackman And Anna i-was-good-in-The-Piano-wasnt-i Paquin. They had the makings of a true ensemble cast, and then sadly, had them all plod along through a story that just never seemed to get off the ground. Yes, I've seen the sequel, and yes I will watch the third instalment, but this review encompasses my opinions for both the movies thus far released.Uneventful.For example; Wolverine & Sabretooth. On paper, these two have a long history together. Ask your average Fan-Boy, and he'll surely tell you, that when these to appeared in a book together, you were guaranteed a thrilling, acrobatic and visceral encounter. Sabretooth, the savage, brutal, remorseless assassin, and Wolverine, the berserker with the soul of a samurai, struggling to tame his bestial urges! Never were two warriors more finely matched! What do we get in the movie?? Sabretooth; An American Pro-wrestler in a BonJovi wig, following Ian McKellen around like an bouffant poodle, only to fall to his death at the first sign of trouble. And Wolverine; Well, actually, Hugh Jackman was one of the few things I cant fault about this movie. (Cyclops, being the other.) Although the makers elected to portray Wolverine at his most uninteresting, Jackmans performance, given the material, is a credit to him. Magneto, on the other hand, appears as a pale shadow of his comic-book self. On paper hes not a geriatric waif of a man in a silly hat, but a charismatic, virile titan of a figure, bestride the world, a god-among-men! Some characters appear to have just been entirely re-written, Rogue being the most obvious example. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this, understanding the difficulties of bringing comic-book characters to the medium of film, but if you're going to completely reinvent such widely loved characters, at least do it well.For the most part, the X-men are all weak, watered-down versions of their comic-book originals, thanks in no small part to the fact that they have been stripped of their trademark costumes. Garish, and impractical though they may have been for the cross-over to celluloid, (cyclops' little nod to this, noted! what would you prefer? Yellow spandex?!, it does detract greatly from the overall effect of superheroes on screen. And although its true that at one time The Uncanny X-Men did sport a standardised uniform, and some X-Men rarely even employed a costume at all, imagine Spiderman, or Superman without their hallmark undies!Overall the X-Men suffers from one major and unavoidable flaw; 2 hours in the theatre simply isn't enough time. With so many years of development and plot in the comic-book, and a cast of hundreds, the move to celluloid was never going to be a successful one. So I suppose this begs the question; Should it ever have been made? On the strength of the two, (very soon to be three), already made, I have to say no. I've heard tell that a number of spin-offs are in the pipeline; A Wolverine movie perhaps. Its my opinion that this will stand a better chance of succeeding, and if its good, then perhaps the travesty of the previous movies will be justified.

Even the X-Men animated series had a catchy theme, I only saw it once or twice, but I can still hum you a few bars if you'd like? Oh, but wait, I haven't even started on the X-Men themselves yet! They had the cast. SIR! Ian McKellen! Patrick was-that-boldly-or-baldly? Stewart! Halle but-i-look-pretty! Berry! Hugh rugged-yet-charming Jackman And Anna i-was-good-in-The-Piano-wasnt-i Paquin. They had the makings of a true ensemble cast, and then sadly, had them all plod along through a story that just never seemed to get off the ground. Yes, I've seen the sequel, and yes I will watch the third instalment, but this review encompasses my opinions for both the movies thus far released.Uneventful.For example; Wolverine & Sabretooth. On paper, these two have a long history together. Ask your average Fan-Boy, and he'll surely tell you, that when these to appeared in a book together, you were guaranteed a thrilling, acrobatic and visceral encounter. Sabretooth, the savage, brutal, remorseless assassin, and Wolverine, the berserker with the soul of a samurai, struggling to tame his bestial urges! Never were two warriors more finely matched! What do we get in the movie?? Sabretooth; An American Pro-wrestler in a BonJovi wig, following Ian McKellen around like an bouffant poodle, only to fall to his death at the first sign of trouble. And Wolverine; Well, actually, Hugh Jackman was one of the few things I cant fault about this movie. (Cyclops, being the other.) Although the makers elected to portray Wolverine at his most uninteresting, Jackmans performance, given the material, is a credit to him. Magneto, on the other hand, appears as a pale shadow of his comic-book self. On paper hes not a geriatric waif of a man in a silly hat, but a charismatic, virile titan of a figure, bestride the world, a god-among-men! Some characters appear to have just been entirely re-written, Rogue being the most obvious example. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this, understanding the difficulties of bringing comic-book characters to the medium of film, but if you're going to completely reinvent such widely loved characters, at least do it well.For the most part, the X-men are all weak, watered-down versions of their comic-book originals, thanks in no small part to the fact that they have been stripped of their trademark costumes. Garish, and impractical though they may have been for the cross-over to celluloid, (cyclops' little nod to this, noted! what would you prefer? Yellow spandex?!, it does detract greatly from the overall effect of superheroes on screen. And although its true that at one time The Uncanny X-Men did sport a standardised uniform, and some X-Men rarely even employed a costume at all, imagine Spiderman, or Superman without their hallmark undies!Overall the X-Men suffers from one major and unavoidable flaw; 2 hours in the theatre simply isn't enough time. With so many years of development and plot in the comic-book, and a cast of hundreds, the move to celluloid was never going to be a successful one. So I suppose this begs the question; Should it ever have been made? On the strength of the two, (very soon to be three), already made, I have to say no. I've heard tell that a number of spin-offs are in the pipeline; A Wolverine movie perhaps. Its my opinion that this will stand a better chance of succeeding, and if its good, then perhaps the travesty of the previous movies will be justified. But until then, I suggest you satisfy yourself with The Uncanny X-Men as they were meant to be enjoyed; Between the pages of a comic-book.

Let's face it, if I was a lot older, and saw this movie when it first came out, I would've been petrified for life, but now watching it, just isn't as great as I thought it would be, everyone hypes it up to be the greatest horror movie, but it just isn't what I expected.
