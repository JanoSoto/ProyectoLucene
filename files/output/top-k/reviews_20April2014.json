This movie is one of the ones I love watching all the time. I read some of the reviews from people that disliked the movie and I would like to respond to some of those comments. Yes it doesn't seem to make sense that a woman who inherited a children's bookstore from her mother would fall in love with a rich guy who seemed to take pleasure in closing down small privately owned bookstores but neither one of them took an interest in the other until after Tom Hanks's character discovers that the mystery person he had been online friends with was the woman he had developed a heated rivalry with. Until then, they were bitter enemies. However, that discovery brought out the human side of Hanks's character. He knew he couldn't tell Meg Ryan's character that he was the one she had exchanged loving e-mails with for who knows how long. Not until he could get her to like him. He was disappointed about the discovery but then realized that it was a friendship he did not and could not end so he made the best of it and tried to be the nice guy she enjoyed e-mailing. When she finally took a liking to him, it made the meeting at the end easier for her to deal with. About the only thing I did not agree with in this movie was near the end when Hanks tries to get Ryan to forgive him by calling what he did a tiny little thing. I'm sorry but putting someone out of business is not a tiny little thing in my book. At least Hanks was kind enough to hire George from her shop. No mention of what happened to the other girl. I did not like Greg Kinnear's character though. He seemed so full of himself and acted like everything he said and wrote was worthy of a Nobel Prize.

While there were certainly other iconic horror films at the time such as The Sixth Sense and Scream, the one thing The Silence of the Lambs did that those films didn't, was win the Oscar for Best Picture. Not only that, but it also won for Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress for Jodie Foster, Best Adapted Screenplay for Ted Tally, and Best Director for Jonathan Demme. It also became the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991. So with all that, you expect something special, right? Well, is it? Let's take a look, shall we?The plot follows a young FBI trainee by the name of Clarice Starling who is pulled from her training academy to interview Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer to find another serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill under the order of Jack Crawford. After some interrogation and investigation, Bill abducts Catherine Martin, one of the U.S. Senator's daughter. Leaving it up to Starling to find Bill by dealing with the darkest of all minds, Hannibal Lecter.The appeal of Silence of the Lambs lies in its mix of realistic depictions of police investigation and serial killer antics while retaining a cinematic panache to keep things entertaining. The film depicts its police investigation very realistically with a great attention detail to the dead bodies and the way the main serial killer Buffalo Bill operates is actually pretty realistic. His motives are very opaque, never completely clear to the audience, just like how serial killers are to people in real-life. He's trying to make a dress with a woman's flesh throughout the film because he thinks he's a woman but you never get why he wants to kill people. You have to pay full attention to see what's behind his head. But at the same time, the film doesn't feel TOO realistic to the point where it's boring and dull to sit through, there's still a certain entertainment factor to this film. For one thing, the film is scary. While this isn't exactly the type of horror film you can have a good time with when you call over some friends while having a few beers, it still has plenty of good scares to keep you entertained from beginning to end(especially towards the end).But I think the main reason why this did so well was because of the characters. While most horror films would feature the serial killer as the most interesting character of the film while the main character is as dull as a rock, this film did something a little different. Clarice Starling in this film is equally interesting as the serial killers themselves because she's not just some girl who just happen to become a target for the killer somehow but instead, she's ASSIGNED to find the serial killer herself and actually has a personality and she actually goes through an arc. She starts out haunted from her childhood memory of seeing lambs being slaughtered so she feels guilty about seeing such a thing happen but not doing anything about it considering her dad was a cop and hears sounds of lambs screaming in her dreams but she overcomes this towards the end when she saves the senator's daughter and kills Buffalo Bill. And thankfully, they got a great actress to play this part, Jodie Foster. Foster has a believable intelligence to her that helps you buy her matching wits with Hannibal Lecter. It's great that the filmmakers chose not to cast the most attractive actress but instead, the one that could act.The rest of the characters are equally good. While Hannibal Lecter is certainly not a realistic portrait of a serial killer, he works well as this great, unstoppable force of evil that Clarice has to match wits with to find Buffalo Bill. Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of a lifetime here with all his creepy stares, sinister line deliveries, and wicked intelligence. Ted Levine is equally creepy and unsettling as Buffalo Bill, but in different ways. He feels a lot more like a realistic serial killer with his strange sexuality and cross-dressing habits. Scott Glenn is also convincing as the authoritative, determined Jack Crawford. Lastly, I want to mention Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin, the girl kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. I love how she starts out extremely terrified when she's captured just like anybody would but I like how her character actually tries to escape by threatening to kill Bill's dog if he doesn't let her out. Smith's fear and determination is very believable throughout the whole film.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling, disturbing film that also has some excellent performances to spare.

The title Falling Down refers to the old London Bridge that has been relocated to Arizona, and a retiring detective's wife want to move there rather than stick it out in Los Angeles. The day that he is set to retire LAPD Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall of Joe Kidd) finds himself up to his ears into a series of homicides involving an enigmatic character, William Foster (Michael Douglas of Last Vegas), who is an unemployed defense scientists. During his heyday, Foster designed missiles to protect America. Since he has lost his job and divorced his wife Beth (Barbara Hershey of Beaches), Bill has been living with his mother. Of course, he hasn't told his mom a thing about losing his job. He keeps up appearances by packing his lunch in an attaché case and heading off to work. When Falling Down unfolds, our protagonist finds himself caught up in gridlocked traffic. He blows his cool at this point when it becomes too much to handle. The air conditioner in his automobile doesn't work and Foster is about to burn up. He abandons his automobile to trudge off from the freeway to a convenience store where he tries to buy a Coca-Cola from the Korean proprietor, Mr. Lee (Michael Paul Chan of The Goonies), who wants to charge him 85 cents for the beverage. Foster has been trying to reach his ex-wife by telephone because he is coming home to help his daughter, Adele (Joey Hope Singer) celebrate her birthday. Between the time that he smashes up Mr. Lee's store until he shoots it out with Prendergast on the pier at Venice Beach, he collides with trigger-happy Hispanic thugs, an Aryan (Frederick Forrest) who runs an Army & Navy surplus store, and several other villains. Los Angeles is presented as a zoo with all sorts of objectionable people. Sometimes, depending on much of a racist you are, you may find Foster's antics rewarding. The conflict in the fast-food restaurant when Foster cannot order breakfast because only lunch is being served is hilarious. Foster's tutorial that he receives from a young African-American kid on a bicycle is fantastic, too! His encounter with the Hispanic ruffians who try to extort money from him is good. Eventually, this idiots load up in a car and come after him with an arsenal of firearms, but when they try to cut him down in a drive-by shooting, they miss him entirely, crash their car, and guess who finds them? Foster strolls up, relieves them of their armory, and shoots of the survivors in the leg. As tragic as Falling Down is, you may still find it entertaining. Initially, we feel sympathetic toward Foster until he eventually crosses the line and harms harmlessly individuals. Even then some of these people bring problems on themselves. The scene at the golf course is pretty funny, but Foster winds up killing an egotistical golfer who needs his medication. Meanwhile, our detective hero tangles with his wife on the telephone until he gets fed up with her. The performances are all memorable as is this controversial film with commentary galore.

The hypnosis sessions begin to reveal some surprises that connect Mike and Grace, and reveal the truth about the murder in the 1940s.....Branagh attempts to do a Hitchcock, but with all the red herrings and barmy narrative, it ends up more like a Brian DePalma homage, which isn't a negative, because DePalma is a genius.But Hitchcock was more of a straight director, more or less getting to the point, and never really made you guess of who, why, and where.Here it's very twisty and turny right up until the last moment, and more or less every character introduced into the film is suspect.But it's expertly done, and looks fantastic, and even though Branagh is miscast as Mike, he excels in the directors chair and as Strauss.

Yet Dalton is not the only reason why License to Kill does not work. Past Bond films had Russian secret agents, great train rides, a Bond girl painted gold, a volcano as a secret lair, thrilling ski chases, a diamond studded satellite that shoots laser beams, and an awesome space station. By 1989, however, the creators of Bond seemed to have come down with a serious case of innovation fatigue, because there is nothing fun in this picture. Instead we are treated to tired clichés like a corrupt Latin American dictatorship in Panama, a cocaine laboratory in some desert, and the most stereotyped televangelist imaginable -- three things that should never be in a Bond picture. The villain, a drug lord with the clichéd name of Sanchez, is also a big disappointment. Robert Davi, who plays Sanchez, is completely wrong for the villain role. He is neither menacing in the way that Dr. No, Spectre, Grant, Goldfinger, and Blofeld were nor is he particularly interesting. So that leaves us with the Bond girls. Carey Lowell seems to be out of her depth as the Bond girl and secret agent Pam Bouvier. Her performance can not even raise a candle to the famous Bond girls of the past, like Honey Ryder, Daniela Bianchi, Diana Rigg, and Claudine Auger. Perhaps the biggest problem with Bouvier is that I could never believe that she was attracted to James Bond. Lowell later did a much better acting job as the assistant district attorney in Law and Order. Talisa Soto makes for a much sexier Bond girl Lupe Lamora, but unfortunately she was given very little to say and do in this picture. So ultimately, License to Kill is a Bond film best forgotten.

He doesn't really fit in with the diverse groups you would expect to find in a typical American high school. Steve looks like one of the jocks, but they don't seem quite right. The jocks seem perfect with their matching jackets, hair cuts, charity work, and perfect behaviour that would make any parent proud. When Steve befriends two social misfits of the school, Gavin and Rachel, he soon discovers why the jocks are so perfect.....It's virtually a remake of The Stepford Wives, with troublesome teens being replaced, or 'upgraded' to be the perfect child.

Yep believe it or not this cult franchise started out with the first film which was ingeniously written by two fellas called Matheson and Solomon, this film was not adapted from a comicbook source.I used to watch this film when I was still in school back in the day, it was massive! I adored it and watched it all the time. The basic premise is so simple yet the film has been so well crafted I fail to see how anyone can not enjoy it. Bill and Ted are a couple of metalhead school flunks in the present day, yet through a bizarre series of events both will eventually become the inspirational 'Great Ones' that changed the human race into a peaceful utopian society...through their music. The problem is if they don't pass their history class Ted will get shipped off to military academy and this future will never happen. Enter 'Rufus' to help and assist the bumbling duo in passing their final history test\/exam thing.Watching this recently I guess the main things that stand out to me are...well actually there are a lot of things that stood out and still hold up today. The visuals are great fun, sure its not as colourful as the sequel but I'm still really impressed at how good each period looks mainly. The duo travel across a few eras and I must say everything looks pretty darn good considering this was a bit of a tacky throw away teen flick. Each period is only seen briefly but it all holds up even though you might only see a single room or street. For example when they pick up Beethoven we see a really elegant 18th Century room full of aristocrats or noble folk and it looks good, believable. There's a real castle with a nice interior for 15th Century England (God knows where), a small taste of ancient Greece with pillars and statues, a section of a wild west town etc...My point is they clearly have had to stretch and struggle to create each period but full kudos to them as it all looks amazingly solid.Not everything looks that good these days of course, some of the periods are a bit thin on the ground visually eg. Napoleon's war camp, prehistoric San Dimas and Genghis Khan's tent which is obviously an easy cover for not showing anything else. But again on the plus side all the costumes look really good and the casting is really good too. I still found Terry Camilleri's subtle performance as Napoleon to be hilarious with his little French mutterings and facial expressions, he fit this role like a glove, brilliant!. All the other cast really do look good with some nice makeup work, Abe Lincoln is especially good looks and performance wise, as is Beethoven and the almost mute Socrates. Honourable mention to Al Leong as Genghis Khan. Despite the age and silliness of this film I have no issues with any of the historical elements really. I'm just amazed it does look as good as it does because we all know how shitty these things can look with less care.I mean apart from the joyous adventure there is so much to praise here. The soundtrack is awesome, pure awesomeness, yeah its totally 80's of course but if you like 80's tunage then you'll love this selection. There are some truly electric sequences which are bitchin' simply down to the musical track that accompanies them. Add to that the full on retro vibe going on here, I just love every minute of it, the sneakers, cars, tunes, technology, clothes etc...there is one scene where Billy the Kid and Socrates try to chat up these two girls in the mall. Oh my these girls are visually the epitome of the 80's, not that that's a surprise of course but little things like this brings the memories flooding back and really helped me enjoy the film. Oh and my God one of them is super cute!.Admittedly the film does take a bit of a dive as you near the end. The whole history test thing they gotta take always did seem evil to me, what kind of high school test involves standing in front of an entire hall full of students and giving a lecture on history?! Jesus!. And lets be honest here, the presentation Bill and Ted give is pretty nondescript really, it is essentially a bunch of people giving them a pat on the back, its more of a magic show. There are bits I could pick at throughout the film like the fact they somehow manage to squeeze so many people into one phone booth and when they drop all the famous history figures back into their own times wouldn't their new knowledge and visions of the future change history dramatically?.But lets be honest here, this film isn't anything more than a wild ride that probably wasn't expected to do much more than hit the videoshop shelves and rot (many similar teen flicks over the years did just that, 'Bio-Dome' anyone). There's a reason the franchise became a cult and that's because this first film is so damn enjoyable. The cool phone booth concept is genius, the ultra cool Rufus played by Carlin, the quirky and amusing looking 2688 future humans and of course the iconic dialog which has become a part of modern pop culture and predates the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pizza surfing spiel.

Ultimately the most highly regarded among fans is the 1984 movie entitled The Return of Godzilla (though in Japan originally called Gojira, but later re titled to avoid confusion with the 1954 movie).

There's a lot to love about this movie but there's also just a tad too much to hate about it, which is why I find myself split down the middle on this one. It is no secret that the 1970s\/1960s Godzilla movies were truly bad at times but were guilty pleasures- but to see this film try to make Godzilla a terrifying natural disaster again is very refreshing. With the dark atmosphere enhanced by its Cold War setting and obvious allusions to the tensions between the US and Russia, sadly what really squanders this film's potential is the horrible direction.

The man's full name is Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900. He has a natural talent for playing piano and shows his infinite music by using the limited keyboard. The charming story is supported so well by the incredible music, the excellent cinematography, and the wonderful manner of storytelling, that I can't see The Legend Of 1900 as anything but a success in which almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be watching films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly, that was, when 1900 is challenged by jazz great Jelly Roll Morton to a piano duel, he meets the challenge and annihilates Morton with a performance that left me shaking and yelling.

To be frank, that's a matter of debate. As to me, I will choose the same way as 1900. Also there are some words impressed me deeply. For instance, in all sprawling city there was everything except an end As my honest speaking, there is no boring moment from the beginning till the very end. It's the greatest feast of emotions!

The man's full name is Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900. He has a natural talent for playing piano and shows his infinite music by using the limited keyboard. The charming story is supported so well by the incredible music, the excellent cinematography, and the wonderful manner of storytelling, that I can't see The Legend Of 1900 as anything but a success in which almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be watching films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly, that was, when 1900 is challenged by jazz great Jelly Roll Morton to a piano duel, he meets the challenge and annihilates Morton with a performance that left me shaking and yelling.

Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for The Time Machine, LA Confidential, and more recently Iron Man 3, but I think he will always be remembered for Memento. He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 April 2014","score":"","review":" This film is nothing short of one of the greatest pieces of cinematic genius I have ever seen. It shows two sides of many things. Take for example Colonel Nicholson. Colonel Nicholson is a savior to his fellow British soldiers, yet he can also be viewed as a traitor. Commander Shears who was a former prisoner at the camp, and later leads the attack on the bridge, was impersonating an officer. A court martial offense. But he also led the United States and the United Kingdom to victory by blowing up the bridge. Colonel Saito, who was the commandant of the prison camp, was a sadist and was a monster. But he was willing to make necessary compromises with Colonel Nicholson on the construction of the bridge. Anyway let's look at the plot. A new group of Royal Army soldiers have been captured by the Imperial Japanese Army and have been placed in a Japanese prison camp. In other words hell. Anyway the commandant Colonel Saito, and the commanding officer of the prisoners Colonel Nicholson, don't agree with each other. Saito wants all prisoners, including officers to work on a bridge that will connect from the island the camp is on to another island I think. But as this is against the Geneva Convention, Colonel Nicholson won't allow it. Saito retaliates by putting the British officers in confinement. And putting Colonel Nicholson in the oven. Meanwhile US sailor Commander Shears, who was already a prisoner at the camp escapes. When he makes it back to an allied base they give him a mission to blow up the bridge that the prisoners are working on. Colonel Nicholson eventually agrees to Saito's commands and officers work on the bridge as well. It end in a spectacular battle against the allied special forces, and the allied prisoners who seem to have forgotten their allegiance. I highly recommend this movie.
