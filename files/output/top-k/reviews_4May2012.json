It's no doubt the greatest neo-noir ever, and it's one of the best movies ever made. I have seen something like 10 times by now, and I can't find a single bad thing about it. Even though I have seen it many times, I still don't get the Chinamen joke... I'm going to talk about this is 4 segments, the performances\/characters, direction\/mood\/atmosphere, script and last words kinda thing.The performances Jack Nicholson plays the main character, J.J Jake Gittes. He's a private detective, who's very nosy, most of people hate him and he's a rising star. He's acts like he's somebody important, he wears nice clothes, he tries to be polite, but he still has a short temper, tells bad jokes, is quite rude and isn't that smart neither. You know private detectives in the past like Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spade. While those guys were smart and witty, Gittes is not. Don't get me wrong, he's street-smart, he's knows a lot of people and knows how to get out of trouble. But let's look at the barber scene. In this scene, a banker starts to criticism his work. Marlowe would probably talk his way out of this, but Gittes wants to fight the guy. That's kinda funny as well. While he probably has some anger issues, Nicholson is still so goddamn cool. Not Alain Delon cool, but you wouldn't fck with him. The character is written pretty seriously, but Nicholson brings some comedy in to his character, making him more human. Nicholson should have won an Oscar IMO, but I will talk about that more later...Faye Dunaway plays the biggest supporting character, Evelyn Mulwray. She is the film's femme fatale. The sexy, upper-class dame who has a secret. In her case a very, very, very disturbing secret. Don't worry, I won't spoil it. She is pretty amazing as well. She acts a lot of the time cool and elegant, but Gitter makes her nervous and uncomfortable. She seems lost a lot of the time, but trying to act like she's not. It's not like the moments you see her your thinking she has a deep dark secret, but you start to suspect that at some point. Also John Huston plays her father. And isn't just me or does Polanski really think elderly people are that scary and creepy. I mean look at his work, Rosemary's Baby, old people come off scare in that, same with The Tenant... Anyways, he's so damn good in this. Who can't love the sound of his voice! And he comes off as a good guy at first and he's acts like he's the good guy all the way through.Direction\/mood\/atmosphere. It's directed by Roman Polanski, one of my favorite directors ever. This is one of his darkest films and also one of his most atmospheric. The way he directs this is with a reasonable slow pace, a lot of classic film-noir mood and he keeps you guessing all the way through. He puts the camera behind Gittes, so what he sees, we see. Gittes never knows more than we do and we never know more than he does. Also there is a touch desperation and fatalism in this. You know that this sin't going to end well, it's just so dark movie. I think Polanski wanted to create that classic film-noir feel and shatter it with the films themes (which I'm don't want to say, because I would spoiling a lot). And BTW, he makes a cameo in this, he's the guy who cuts Gitte's nose open.Script. This was written by Robert Town. IMO, this is the greatest screenplay ever. It's complex, but subtle, keeps you guessing and doesn't disappoint you and it has great characters. Really it has everything, a great script needs. And his dialog is so wonderful. I think Chinatown is one of the best mysteries ever. And it's very unconventional noir, because it's not as simple as something the Maltese Falcon (which I love). It's not a case of a missing statue, it has something to do with water and corruption. What other noir has dealt with water and corruption other than Chinatown? The greatest screenplay ever, IMO.To sum it up or last words or what ever you want to call this. This is a movie about a mood and atmosphere. When you want to watch a cool movie, look no further. It my favorite movie, but it would probably be tied with Badlands (Malick, 1973).

Don't get me wrong, he's street-smart, he's knows a lot of people and knows how to get out of trouble. But let's look at the barber scene. In this scene, a banker starts to criticism his work. Marlowe would probably talk his way out of this, but Gittes wants to fight the guy. That's kinda funny as well. While he probably has some anger issues, Nicholson is still so goddamn cool. Not Alain Delon cool, but you wouldn't fck with him. The character is written pretty seriously, but Nicholson brings some comedy in to his character, making him more human. Nicholson should have won an Oscar IMO, but I will talk about that more later...Faye Dunaway plays the biggest supporting character, Evelyn Mulwray. She is the film's femme fatale. The sexy, upper-class dame who has a secret. In her case a very, very, very disturbing secret. Don't worry, I won't spoil it. She is pretty amazing as well. She acts a lot of the time cool and elegant, but Gitter makes her nervous and uncomfortable. She seems lost a lot of the time, but trying to act like she's not. It's not like the moments you see her your thinking she has a deep dark secret, but you start to suspect that at some point. Also John Huston plays her father. And isn't just me or does Polanski really think elderly people are that scary and creepy. I mean look at his work, Rosemary's Baby, old people come off scare in that, same with The Tenant... Anyways, he's so damn good in this. Who can't love the sound of his voice! And he comes off as a good guy at first and he's acts like he's the good guy all the way through.Direction\/mood\/atmosphere. It's directed by Roman Polanski, one of my favorite directors ever. This is one of his darkest films and also one of his most atmospheric. The way he directs this is with a reasonable slow pace, a lot of classic film-noir mood and he keeps you guessing all the way through. He puts the camera behind Gittes, so what he sees, we see. Gittes never knows more than we do and we never know more than he does. Also there is a touch desperation and fatalism in this. You know that this sin't going to end well, it's just so dark movie. I think Polanski wanted to create that classic film-noir feel and shatter it with the films themes (which I'm don't want to say, because I would spoiling a lot). And BTW, he makes a cameo in this, he's the guy who cuts Gitte's nose open.Script. This was written by Robert Town. IMO, this is the greatest screenplay ever. It's complex, but subtle, keeps you guessing and doesn't disappoint you and it has great characters. Really it has everything, a great script needs. And his dialog is so wonderful. I think Chinatown is one of the best mysteries ever. And it's very unconventional noir, because it's not as simple as something the Maltese Falcon (which I love). It's not a case of a missing statue, it has something to do with water and corruption. What other noir has dealt with water and corruption other than Chinatown? The greatest screenplay ever, IMO.To sum it up or last words or what ever you want to call this. This is a movie about a mood and atmosphere. When you want to watch a cool movie, look no further. It my favorite movie, but it would probably be tied with Badlands (Malick, 1973). But I would say this is technically a better film.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"4 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Gandhi was a great movie.

I was 12 back in 1997, but I have to admit that I liked Steel then (I also liked the big-budget adaptation of another favorite superhero of mine, Spawn).15 years later, a lot has changed. For one, I've grown up. I now realize that Steel is not a very good movie. I remember around that time, my cousin saw Steel in the theaters and told us that it was not a very good movie. The critics and most sensible audience members seemed to agree.But I digress; Steel is good for one thing and one thing only a rainy day, like today. Since I'm not daring brave the over-crowded theaters for fear of being over-run by Avengers fan-boys (and fan-girls), I decided to pop in my 14-year-old VHS copy of Steel and relive 1997 like it was just 15 years ago (which, in fact, it was).Steel is the live-action adaptation of the second-tier DC Comics character co-created by Louise Simonson and Jon Bogdanove, with NBA star Shaquille O'Neal playing the titular steel-armored, non-super-powered superhero whose real name is John Henry Irons in his civilian identity.I'm not really a fan of the movie anymore (most readers will remember that I'm largely a Marvel Comics reader), but I find the history of the original comic book character to be quite fascinating as yet another proud, positive black-American superhero in comics, John Henry Irons is a brilliant former weapons designer for a private arms-manufacturing company whose life is saved, both literally and metaphorically, by the mighty Man of Steel himself, Superman. Ironically, a later incident with the powerful super-villain Doomsday costs Superman his life, and Irons's life is changed forever when he decides to don a powered suit of armor of his own making - much like Marvel Comics' Tony Stark\/Iron Man - and fight crime himself as Steel (with Superman's logo blazoned mightily on his chest as a reminder of his inspiration) and wielding a powerful sledgehammer, too.The 1997 live-action adaptation removes any mention of Superman (or his apparent death), except for a tattoo O'Neal has on his arm, and goes forward with its own origin story. Certain aspects of the movie are faithful to the comics, but the rest of it is pretty campy and just bloody awful. This time out, Irons is a weapons designer for the U.S. Army and when an ambitious rival, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), is involved in an accident that kills a U.S. senator and leaves his best friend Susan Sparky Sparks (Annabeth Gish) a paraplegic, Irons resigns from the military in disgust.Irons (whose name is reportedly inspired by the legendary black-American folk hero John Henry) returns to his home in Los Angeles, only to discover that street gangs are out committing brazen bank robberies using the exact same, albeit heavily modified, weapons he designed. With Sparky and Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree) by his side, Irons dons a custom-made suit of armor as the armored superhero Steel. As he dives deeper into his investigation, he discovers that his old rival Nathaniel Burke (who has since recruited young neighborhood street kids to do his bidding) is behind the robberies and the deadly new weapons out on the street.Steel is pretty cheesy and campy, and I don't mean that in a good way.Unlike most people, I don't think Shaquille O'Neal is that lousy an actor. I think that if he were given the right material, he would manage out OK. At least here, I think he seems perfect for the part of John Henry Irons\/Steel; it's just a shame that the rest of the movie, as written and directed by Kenneth Johnson (V), is just not very good. In other words, Shaq just needed a better movie. The special effects, the hokey street dialogue, and the performances don't help matters much either. Richard Roundtree and Irma P. Hall do what they can, but aren't given a whole lot to do beyond offering elder-generation advice to the younger folks. Judd Nelson relishes his role as a stereotypical villain, but it's really Annabeth Gish as the physically handicapped yet resilient gadgeteer Susan Sparks who really seems to shine the most in what could have been a very limiting part.I sense that a remake\/reboot is, or soon probably will be, in the works sometime in the near future, and that is one Steel I just may (italicized) fork over $7.50 at my local movie theater to see. Until then, Steel will continue to mightily serve its purpose for rainy days (and some late-'90s nostalgia)...4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2012","score":"","review":" With all this madness about superheroes going on right now (The Avengers just opened today), I decided to go back in time to 1997, to the poorly received box office flop Steel.

This time out, Irons is a weapons designer for the U.S. Army and when an ambitious rival, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), is involved in an accident that kills a U.S. senator and leaves his best friend Susan Sparky Sparks (Annabeth Gish) a paraplegic, Irons resigns from the military in disgust.Irons (whose name is reportedly inspired by the legendary black-American folk hero John Henry) returns to his home in Los Angeles, only to discover that street gangs are out committing brazen bank robberies using the exact same, albeit heavily modified, weapons he designed. With Sparky and Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree) by his side, Irons dons a custom-made suit of armor as the armored superhero Steel. As he dives deeper into his investigation, he discovers that his old rival Nathaniel Burke (who has since recruited young neighborhood street kids to do his bidding) is behind the robberies and the deadly new weapons out on the street.Steel is pretty cheesy and campy, and I don't mean that in a good way.Unlike most people, I don't think Shaquille O'Neal is that lousy an actor. I think that if he were given the right material, he would manage out OK. At least here, I think he seems perfect for the part of John Henry Irons\/Steel; it's just a shame that the rest of the movie, as written and directed by Kenneth Johnson (V), is just not very good. In other words, Shaq just needed a better movie. The special effects, the hokey street dialogue, and the performances don't help matters much either. Richard Roundtree and Irma P. Hall do what they can, but aren't given a whole lot to do beyond offering elder-generation advice to the younger folks. Judd Nelson relishes his role as a stereotypical villain, but it's really Annabeth Gish as the physically handicapped yet resilient gadgeteer Susan Sparks who really seems to shine the most in what could have been a very limiting part.I sense that a remake\/reboot is, or soon probably will be, in the works sometime in the near future, and that is one Steel I just may (italicized) fork over $7.50 at my local movie theater to see.

I was 12 back in 1997, but I have to admit that I liked Steel then (I also liked the big-budget adaptation of another favorite superhero of mine, Spawn).15 years later, a lot has changed. For one, I've grown up. I now realize that Steel is not a very good movie. I remember around that time, my cousin saw Steel in the theaters and told us that it was not a very good movie. The critics and most sensible audience members seemed to agree.But I digress; Steel is good for one thing and one thing only a rainy day, like today. Since I'm not daring brave the over-crowded theaters for fear of being over-run by Avengers fan-boys (and fan-girls), I decided to pop in my 14-year-old VHS copy of Steel and relive 1997 like it was just 15 years ago (which, in fact, it was).Steel is the live-action adaptation of the second-tier DC Comics character co-created by Louise Simonson and Jon Bogdanove, with NBA star Shaquille O'Neal playing the titular steel-armored, non-super-powered superhero whose real name is John Henry Irons in his civilian identity.I'm not really a fan of the movie anymore (most readers will remember that I'm largely a Marvel Comics reader), but I find the history of the original comic book character to be quite fascinating as yet another proud, positive black-American superhero in comics, John Henry Irons is a brilliant former weapons designer for a private arms-manufacturing company whose life is saved, both literally and metaphorically, by the mighty Man of Steel himself, Superman. Ironically, a later incident with the powerful super-villain Doomsday costs Superman his life, and Irons's life is changed forever when he decides to don a powered suit of armor of his own making - much like Marvel Comics' Tony Stark\/Iron Man - and fight crime himself as Steel (with Superman's logo blazoned mightily on his chest as a reminder of his inspiration) and wielding a powerful sledgehammer, too.The 1997 live-action adaptation removes any mention of Superman (or his apparent death), except for a tattoo O'Neal has on his arm, and goes forward with its own origin story.

Besides its age, the film was shot in B&W, which is a huge turn-off to me, simply because color has a way of making pictures come ALIVE, no matter the age.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the film holds up quite well. I thought the creature itself was going to look like a guy in a lame rubber suit, but that's not the case. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of effort into the appearance of the creature and the way it gasps for air, swims, walks, etc. In other words, there's a reason why the Gill-man is so iconic.It's easy to sympathize with the creature,as David Reed (Richard Carlson) does at the very end, since the Gill-man's just existing in its native turf. In other words, the humans are the invaders here. So, we can understand the creature's hostile reaction, killing many, and we can also understand why it hesitates to harm Kay (Julia Adams) and, indeed, wants to take her back to his grotto! Why? Because Julia Adams is totally gorgeous in the film! In fact, it's well worth catching just for her as she fills out those short white shorts perfectly, lol! There are some quality underwater scenes shot in Wakulla Springs, Florida, particularly when the creature swims underneath Kay unbeknownst to her, symbolizing sexual union.

At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time.

","genre":"Animation, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"4 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Derided as Disney's Folly during its production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would turn out to be Disney's greatest triumph. How different the world would be had Walt Disney failed with Snow White. This was the first full-length animated feature. If it did not succeed there wouldn't be any others. At least not for a very, very long time. No Pinocchio, no Bambi, all the way up to probably no Toy Story. Because if Snow White failed there would be no Disney as we know it. And if there's no Disney the history of film, animation and all of entertainment is quite different. So much of what we have known and embraced all these decades goes back to a fairy tale princess and seven of her closest, shortest friends.Considering an animation project of this magnitude had never been undertaken it is quite remarkable just how magnificent this film looks. The colors pop, the backgrounds are fabulous, the attention to detail is tremendous. The dwarfs look absolutely terrific. Brilliant character design executed wondrously by Disney's team of animators. The personality of each dwarf shines through before any of them even speak, the visuals are so good they tell each character's story perfectly. The animals, and this film's got plenty of animals, all look great. The villainous queen, in both her incarnations, is a sight to behold. Oddly, perhaps the least visually appealing thing in the whole film is Snow White herself. She's really not all that much to look at. A flat, almost featureless face. She's an iconic film character, Disney's most famous and beloved princess. But truth is she's a bit of a plain Jane. Fairest of them all? In this case the visual doesn't quite sell that story. And her prince is a bit of a dud too. But as a whole the art and animation on display here is quite terrific, and considering the laborious process by which it was created, a little miraculous.Could the world truly be captivated by a cartoon? In 1937 most people didn't think so. A five-minute short, that's one thing. An 83-minute feature? No way a cartoon could hold the attention for that long. Wrong. Admittedly there are times when the film's story does drag. Some sequences do nothing to advance the plot, they just pad the running time to an acceptable feature length. Snow White herself is not a particularly interesting character so the film doesn't really kick into high gear until the dwarfs are introduced. They give the film its personality. They give the film a song you'll be humming for hours after the film ends. They gave the film its humor but also gave it its emotional heart. The bond they form with Snow White is what allows the film's ending to pack such an emotional wallop. Yes, a cartoon can provoke genuine, heartfelt feeling. As it is that ending may be a bit rushed. The story wraps itself up and it's The End before you know what hit you. When it's over you can look back and see there is so much to appreciate. Walt Disney gambled big and won. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is not a perfect film, some parts work better than others. But there is no denying it was a magnificent achievement for its time. It is still thoroughly enjoyable all these years later. And it is well worth its iconic place in film history.

With his new power he tries to work up the courage to talk to the girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst) but then a family tragedy forces him into crime fighting and battling the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) who just happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco). SPIDER-MAN is a very good comic adaptation that benefits from some great direction by Sam Raimi, a wonderful screenplay with real characters and actors that bring those characters to life. There's no question that there are some flaws in the movie but none of them are so drastic that they take away from the quality of the film. In fact, I'd argue that the film has actually gotten better with time because of how well-written all the characters and situations are. This here is especially true of the Peter Parker character because he's just not a dork turned superhero. The screenplay really gives him a lot of emotions to play with and I think you really start to feel for the character and then feel for the problems that come along with his powers. The romance with Mary Jane works extremely well as does his friendship with the Franco character and the problems that eventually happen in not only the love triangle but the issues dealing with the villain. Raimi does a very good job at juggling all of this stuff and he manages to make sure that the action scenes live up to the expectation of fans but at the same time they never outdo the story and characters. It certainly doesn't hurt that the casting was so perfect. Maguire has no problems playing both the dork as well as the action hero and that laid back style of his perfectly comes to life in the film. Dunst makes for a good love interest as she just has a certain charm that she brings out of the character. Dafoe is wonderful, as usual, and he never has a hard time playing emotions or anger. Franco also does a very nice job as does the rest of the supporting players. SPIDER-MAN contains some very good action scenes and mixed in with all the human drama going on you're left with a strong entertainment.

It does do a neat job of combining detective fiction with a more paranormal \/ mystical bent. Scott Bakula plays private detective Harry D'Amour, who travels from NYC to LA on a routine case, ends up caught in something far more sinister. Story threads include the apparent death of a performing illusionist, Philip Swann (Kevin J. O'Connor) and the resurrection of a diabolical cult leader, Nix (Daniel von Bargen). Harry meets assorted dubious types on his way to figuring out just what the Hell is going on, falling in love with the illusionists' wife Dorothea (Famke Janssen) as well. Nothing that happens here is terribly surprising, but Barker does make up for that with a consistently gloomy tone, overwhelming atmosphere, and effective visuals, and also by getting convincing performances out of his well chosen cast. Bakula is a likable enough lead, Famke looks fetching as always, von Bargen is a genuinely intimidating villain (it's easy enough to believe that his character is no phony, but the real thing); other vivid contributions are made by character players Joseph Latimore, Sheila Tousey, Susan Traylor, Wayne Grace, Barry Del Sherman, Joel Swetow, Vincent Schiavelli, and Barry Shabaka Henley. The movie has impressive gore & makeup effects, and in general does show off the same kind of theatricality as a good stage show, being careful to make the distinction between magic and illusions. As it begins, Barker is already layering on the tension and giving us a sense of doom and gloom to come. This is a good, meaty enough story that, even in its 122 minute long unrated director's cut, avoids any sort of filler and delivers enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. It's only too bad that Barker isn't inspired to direct his own stories more often, as the movies he turns out are a cut above most of what we see in the horror genre. Lord of Illusions is long but never boring. Seven out of 10.
