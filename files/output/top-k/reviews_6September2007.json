[{"date":"6 September 2007","score":"","review":" Shrek came out when I was in seventh grade. I didn't really pay a whole lot of attention to it then, but, when I was in ninth grade I went to a football game with my band (I played the trumpet all four years in H.S.), and Shrek was being played on the bus. I fell in love with this movie instantly. Shrek, Fiona, the Donkey, and all the other characters are totally awesome. The soundtrack rocks, too! I am so much of a Shrek fan that I saw Shrek 2, loved it, and still want to see Shrek the Third. Basically, I'm like, so into Shrek it's crazy!!! Whoever came up with the idea to put all fairy tale things, as Shrek calls Tinkerbell, Captain Hook, the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, etc., into one hilarious, funny, totally awesome movie is, like, pure genius! Whoever has not seen Shrek, you don't know what you're missing! See it once, and you'll love it, I tell you what!!!!!
