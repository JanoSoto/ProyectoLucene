No Cary Grant movie can compare with the subtle beauty and outrageous humor of this gem.  The plot seems more than a bit insane, but then again so does the main character.  Melvin Udall (the incomparable Jack Nicholson) is a mean, obsessive-compulsive, old crank who's life is turned around by his gay neighbor Simon (the excellent Greg Kinnear) and his favorite waitress (the radiant Helen Hunt).  This trio of actors perfectly fill out James L. Brooks and Mark Andrus' heartfelt screenplay.  While the direction may not be breathtaking, Brooks' simplistic style is felt throughout the movie.  Also Hans Zimmer's playful sweet score is a wonderful addition to this film, contributing to the mood without being conspicuous.  However the characters and the actors that portray them are the real reason to see this movie.Nicholson's Melvin Udall may live on to be the most famous film character of the 90's.  His disgusting sense of humor and bigotry somehow reconcile believably with his underlying sweetness and vulnerability.  I guess that sort of thing just happens naturally when you are as talented as Jack Nicholson.  Helen Hunt's Carol is a wonderful, subtle, beautiful character. Her natural charm, beauty, and humor is reminiscent of Meg Ryan, only better. Carol is a wonderful representation of the modern supermom that attempts to be as good a person as she can to everyone, and that makes her a little stressed out when it comes to relationships.  It is no wonder that she touches the heart of Melvin because she touches the heart of the audience as well.  Kinnear's Simon Bishop is the weakest of the three links, but he holds his own admirably.  Kinnear's film career was saved by this movie and rightfully so.  His monologue about seeing someone's humanity in just one instant is one of the movie's most memorable moments.  He also provides a realistic, non-caricatured portrayal of a gay man.I will not spoil the story for those who have not seen it, but I will say that every time I see this movie, the wonderful, cathartic feeling that the ending provides is one of the most delightful movie experiences ever.  In short, if you haven't seen it, then I suggest that you do as soon as you can.  This is the greatest romantic comedy ever.  It reaches out to the Melvin in all of us and tells us to open up, be ourselves, and most of all share your life with someone you love.

It was refreshing to see very beautiful African-American people on screen.

The film has been criticized by some as being too black or ethnic.  The film has been criticized for using the term n***ger.  I found the style of communication among the gentlemen in the film as cool and laid back.  There was something very eloquent in the way the characters carried themselves. I believe the film would have lost it's integrity if it had conformed to a Notting Hill like appeal.  It would have made the film seem very artificial and pretentious.  Rather, the fact that the film did not assimilate to a mainstream romantic comedy genre should be considered a credit.  It shows that African-Americans can be intelligent and purposeful in life  and yet remain integral to black culture.  The film included humor, sentiments, and expressions proudly exemplified in black America.  But then again some people like pretentious and artificial films.  Finally, I think this film is more important for white Americans then black Americans.  For black America it finally provides some equality to how the black American experience is being presented on film (not one gun or bag of cocaine). However, mainstream American society has an internalized and very limited view of what it means to be an African-American.  And anytime an African-American escapes outside of the box (as this film graceful did), it holds he or she under scrutiny.  Hopeful for white America the film will help de-internalize the mal-depiction of African-Americans in Hollywood and society.

The dance scenes are not flashy, stereotypical examples of disco like you might find in Saturday Night Fever or 54, because most people don't dance like that.  Not everyone is John Travolta.  Also, noone in this story is all good, nor all bad.  There is no good guy and bad guy - they are just people, and like in real life, they have traits and flaws.

Similar conversation was used in Pulp Fiction, but not constantly, and not beyond believability.  In this movie you don't hear even one mundane phrase (Like pass the salt, whats up?, or groovy, baby).

I had heard that it was dark and gory, but from the first moments you can tell that you're in for a reasonably tame ride. It wasn't all that gory, either.This movie means to be a Silence of the Lambs type thriller, with a smart detective after a smart killer that leaves clues that must be deciphered, but the difference is that where Silence held up under scrutiny, this film makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. It's a whole lot of fun, and seems to make sense while you're watching it, but once you walk out of the theater and reflect back, the whole thing falls into shambles. In fact, I'm kind of amazed someone adapted the book to a film without a little bit of reworking-- it's that bad.Nevertheless, this movie did creep me out. It's very New York and plays a lot on urban paranoias, and when I walked out of the theater (at midnight) and realized I was the only one on the street, I got a little freaked. I'm a big guy and I would normally walk home from the theater, but this movie made me a little paranoid. So I jumped in a cab (which is, of course, how the killer in the film finds his victims).One New York thing that made me laugh, though, is that the investigators would get a clue about a location in Manhattan, shout It's right here! and then circle it on the map. Thing is-- they'd circle about a ten-block radius! And of course the people in the field would be able to find the exact location right away. Ha!Denzel, I have to say, is pretty amazing. It's about halfway through his terrific performance before you notice that HE HAS NOT MOVED. Go Denzel, you rock.Angelina is good, I thought, though sometimes I have to remember which one she is and which one is Ashley Judd. Unfortunately the script has her do a few things that ANY CHILD in the audience would know better than. I tell you, I knew more about forensics from the first five minutes of the movie than she did, and spent the rest of the movie going She shouldn't have done that... And the fact is revealed in the movie that she was a model before joining the police force!!!! I guess this is gonna be Hollywood's new thing from now on Those models could really all be brilliant detectives and scientists if they wanted to, but the pay isn't as good!One person who is fast becoming a favorite (and most desired) actor of mine is Luis Guzman. I loved him in The Limey, and he's one of the more vital presences here. And he's hot. HOT. So that's it.

Thing is-- they'd circle about a ten-block radius! And of course the people in the field would be able to find the exact location right away. Ha!Denzel, I have to say, is pretty amazing. It's about halfway through his terrific performance before you notice that HE HAS NOT MOVED. Go Denzel, you rock.Angelina is good, I thought, though sometimes I have to remember which one she is and which one is Ashley Judd. Unfortunately the script has her do a few things that ANY CHILD in the audience would know better than. I tell you, I knew more about forensics from the first five minutes of the movie than she did, and spent the rest of the movie going She shouldn't have done that... And the fact is revealed in the movie that she was a model before joining the police force!!!! I guess this is gonna be Hollywood's new thing from now on Those models could really all be brilliant detectives and scientists if they wanted to, but the pay isn't as good!One person who is fast becoming a favorite (and most desired) actor of mine is Luis Guzman. I loved him in The Limey, and he's one of the more vital presences here. And he's hot. HOT. So that's it. I recommend that you go see it, just be sure not to think about it after you leave.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www.cinemademerde.com ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"10 November 1999","score":"","review":" I quite enjoyed this movie. I had heard that it was dark and gory, but from the first moments you can tell that you're in for a reasonably tame ride. It wasn't all that gory, either.This movie means to be a Silence of the Lambs type thriller, with a smart detective after a smart killer that leaves clues that must be deciphered, but the difference is that where Silence held up under scrutiny, this film makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. It's a whole lot of fun, and seems to make sense while you're watching it, but once you walk out of the theater and reflect back, the whole thing falls into shambles. In fact, I'm kind of amazed someone adapted the book to a film without a little bit of reworking-- it's that bad.Nevertheless, this movie did creep me out. It's very New York and plays a lot on urban paranoias, and when I walked out of the theater (at midnight) and realized I was the only one on the street, I got a little freaked.
