I know so well that this is a movie from the good old 1950s, but hold every thing ! Did you see the Heat Wave number ?!!!!! This is like the greatest sexy dance in the history of mankind! I got feelings for that one since the very first time I watched it (I was 17 by the way, too rough I know !). And still with my heartbeats in front of it I feel alive. It takes allurement cinematically to extremes. It's vivid, unrestrained, firecracker ! And most of all surprising, always surprising.Just imagine; a girl has the heaviest sexual charisma ever, dances erotically in close to bikini's custom (Ouch!) with obvious dirty moves, kisses one of the dancers during a song confirms that her anatomy makes the mercury RISE !, moreover to be (Marilyn Monroe) in the same time !! Actually everything is rampant, the fire comes in pink this time, diffusing electrifyingly from the screen to you ! However the biggest part of its strong sexiness is that it's produced in 1954 ?!!!!! That gives me the highest joy already ! It has all the hot and humid time you want. There are many sexy dances all over the cinematic history, but according to this one; they all come as a second best. I'm a huge fan of Marilyn. She's not only sexy, No, she can define sexy. And in that certain number she was MADLY SEXY. Look at her here (and I'm sure you will !!) from doing a simple quiver for her shoulder (which doesn't still simple when it's made by her !) to opening her dress, separating her legs and showing her black underwear to the half naked male dancers while talking about the hot deep south (OH MY GOD !!). Let alone seeing her setting on someone's legs. Or the way she pronounces What's Your Name Honey? or Pablo, Chico, Miguelito!, this is too wild for the 1950s or anytime ! Till declaring The temperature's rising, it isn't surprising, I certainly Can ! that makes any thermometer prove that she definitely and defiantly CAN ! This number is inordinate definition of her as inordinate sex goddess. Frankly you'll never find any hotter dance or woman. Moreover, I loved  Mitzi Gaynor' look to her supposedly brother Donald O'Connor in the start of the dance like she's saying So this is your love?, wow, too hot you wicked!, the male dancer's costumes and reactions, the song's naked Jazz, Marilyn's fervent dazzle, her cheeky moves like she was making love (in fact the whole vulgar sense of it), and her black underwear-like; that was historically expositional (she said it herself I Started The Heat Wave !). Yet nothing stands comparison with her kiss to the male dancer; which was super saucy to an extent I deeply adore. She'd make it again 6 years later at the number of (My Heart Belongs to Daddy), but not with the same steam or the gutsy antecedence, which made me deem it Marilyn's sultriest second in the movies (refer to my list of Marilyn's 10 Hottest Moments On Screen EVER! at the IMDb's pages of Something Got to Give to know that there is a too rare but forgotten moment that overcomes this one, yet not in a movie !).What did I hate here ? Hmmm, well  the fact that Marilyn's hair didn't appear (her golden ringlets can do wonders). And the paranoiac thoughts about something was deleted from it (it's evident that there were moments that the intro of the 4 other leads, then their talking, had covered !). It's hard to believe as well that Marilyn got nothing to perform in the last big number ?! Anyway, they (the censorship, the procedures, whatever..) did it already with a whole number, or numbers, for Marilyn one year earlier in (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes) ! Though let's be optimistic, because I've been craving about the fate of her lost footage from the unfinished (Something's Got to Give &#x96; 1962) to know that there was nine hours footage sat in the vaults at 20th Century Fox. And we had to wait till 1999 to get a glance through (Marilyn The Final Days). Ahhh, when will it be for the rest of her treasures to show up ?! Wanna talk about the movie ? After all of that I must say  what freaking movie ??!! Truly, was there anything else to be watched ?! Maybe MM's Lazy and kiss to O'Connor. Originally they must've named it (There's No Sex Symbol Like Marilyn Monroe). Or rather (There's No Sex Goddess But Marilyn Monroe). Yes, she's the ultimate sexy female ever appeared on the screen, and this is her zenith; beating My Heart Belongs to Daddy in Let's Make Love, the feast of kisses in Some Like it Hot, or even being nude in the unfinished Something Got to Give (at least she didn't dance there !). This exceeds the most daring numbers of that time, and still over the top of what any sex symbol of our days can do.It masterly gives a friendly warm air that moves in to the deep south! Yes, the 1950s was so wicked and you'd never find clearer or raunchier proof than this BOLD number, if not the BOLDEST. In one word  if Hollywood ever made a sex scene in the 1950s, so that was it. Thanks to everyone was a part of it; you surely made an immortal tropical Heatwave.P.S  If you are as crazy in love with MM, so this number, as me and want to talk about it?, imagine how it could be sexier?, or who could make it good in a remake?, or even if you know any hot &#x96; that hot &#x96; numbers from Hollywood of the same era..Please e-mail me.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"29 August 2007","score":"","review":" A rather well-known and deserved cult classic, The Stepford Wives is a quirky little suspense mystery that has aged very well. Katharine Ross plays Joanna Eberhart, an aspiring photographer and housewife who moves from New York City to the small community of Stepford, Connecticut, with her husband and two small daughters. The town is the epitome of the American dream - the men are successful businessman, the wives are great cooks and housekeepers - not to mention they all live in upscale homes in nice neighborhoods. But is this community just a little too perfect? Joanna begins to sense something chauvinistic about Stepford, with the men running everything and the women being as submissive as can be, spending all their time conversing about fabric softener and constantly cleaning. After befriending another woman new to the town, Bobby (Paula Prentiss), the two try and discover what is really going on behind the seemingly perfect community.A very strange but satisfying horror film, The Stepford Wives is an excellent movie. The story is based on the best-selling novel by Ira Levin (the author of Rosemary's Baby, which was also made into a film a few years earlier). I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare the two - but if the book is anything like the film, I'm sure it's great. I really can't say that I wouldn't want to read it sometime (same goes for Rosemary's Baby). The story is fairly slow-building, but there's a subtle eeriness about it that keeps things interesting despite it's forgivable slow moments. The film is set in a beautiful neighborhood, with sunny pool sides and well-kept gardens. Stepford is like the idyllic American town. But despite that overall assumption, this film also captures the eeriness of it's perfection. Something, and I'm not quite sure what it is, makes the daylight seem really scary, and the quiet and peaceful neighborhood a foreboding and uncomfortable place.The acting in particular is very good. Katharine Ross is the leading lady, and she plays her role of the intuitive woman who is playing detective in order to find out what the town is hiding. Paula Prentiss is her sidekick (but also close friend) who feels the exact same way about the Stepford women. Peter Masterson is the ignorant husband, Walter, who has gotten himself into something that is way over his head. Mary Stuart Masterson (real-life and on-screen daughter of Peter Masterson) also made her first movie appearance in this film, as one of Joanna and Walter's daughters. Overall, good performance all around. The film obviously has something to say, and underlying messages that are actually pretty easy to catch onto. The main theme deals with conformity, anti-feminism, and male chauvinism, and these elements in the story easily come through the characters themselves. The storyline is pretty clearly a social commentary on reactions to women's liberation, which was a big thing in the 1960s and '70s. The conclusion to the film is excellent and fitting, and while it may not the an ideal way to end the story, it's perfect. I won't go into any details because I don't want to give away spoilers, just see this wonderful little chiller for yourself.Overall, The Stepford Wives is a creepy little horror movie that is unique and rewarding. It has good acting, perfect atmosphere, but most importantly a very original story. This is another one of those timeless classics as far as I'm concerned, even though it doesn't seem to be recognized as one. I've heard bad things about the remake, and that it was turned into more of a comedy than anything, so I'm not even sure I'll bother seeing it.

And Director Audrey Wells picked up on this during casting, seeing in Polley (at that time of her life) someone physically perfect to play her heroine Harper Sloane. Wells needed a young woman who simply glowed in front of the camera, whose face looked better without make-up, and who projected both innocence and restlessness. With Polley she also got a bonus, one of the most talented actresses of her generation. In this sense Wells resembles Alfred Hitchcock, a director with an uncanny ability to identify actresses at the one moment of their lives when they are physically perfect for a particular role. Sylvia Sidney in Sabotage, Nova Pilbeam in Young and Innocent, and Joan Fontaine in Rebecca come to mind.Wells, who also wrote ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs'', captures that moment in some young women's lives (yes, the film could be considered a feminist statement) when they are able to break free of expectations and programming. The Harper Sloane character seems so authentic and the portrayal so lacking in glib cynicism that it most likely has a lot of autobiographical elements. Harper is tracking along toward Harvard Law School when she meets Cornelius Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), a middle-aged Irish artist who has been hired to photograph her sister's wedding. His well-practiced seduction technique and irreverent world-view causes a major attitude adjustment and she abandons her career track to become his protégé and lover.The story is told from Harper's point of view and the viewer soon learns along with her that this is not the traditional Pygmalion scenario. While not exactly a rogue and a roué, Connie is a compulsive Henry Higgins who has repeatedly played this game with repressed young women. He goes into these relationships with a five-year time limit. Consistent with the POV factor, Harper's story is told with intelligence and compassion, with a lot of emphasis on the fragility of a first love and the pain of a trust betrayed. The film's feminist slant is revealed not so much by what is explicitly shown but by its failure to bring any dimensionality to Connie's character. No clues are provided to explain his aversion to a long-term commitment, Harper discovers that his promises are empty ones but she never learns the roots of his insecurities. Although Polley's best scenes are those with Carrie Preston, who plays her best friend and confidante; the most entertaining scenes are those with her mother (Jean Smart), an unstated version of Susan's mother on Seinfeld. The dysfunctional nature of Harper's family and her mother's unfulfilled life are slowly and somewhat comically revealed, but the bottom line is that her mother is sincerely trying to shield her daughter from mistakes.

With his outrageous accent, his muscular physique, his frightening intelligence and his ability to get the crap kicked out of him and come back harder and tougher, he's completely removed from reality. But that doesn't mean he isn't fun. I mean, in the aforementioned scene where he gets the crap kicked out of him &#150; with lead pipes and bicycle chains, no less &#150; he gets to quote Silesius while adjusting his cute little hick hat. Awesome.Then there's the scene where he holds a smoking flare in his hand. Granddaddy used to handle snakes in church, Granny drank strychnine. I guess you could say I had a leg up, genetically speaking. This sort of person only exists in nightmares and movies. He's nothing like the Max Cady that Robert Mitchum played, a character who was more believable and therefore scarier.However, De Niro's Cady does have his moments. The scene where he picks up a drunk woman at a bar and then proceeds to bite a chunk out of cheek is truly shocking. But although that moment still makes me wince, I actually find the way he punches the woman more disturbing. The brutality of it is quite overwhelming.But the film's best scene is actually the one where Cady talks to Danielle Bowden (daughter of Sam Bowden, Cady's lawyer who screwed him over). He pretends to be her drama teacher and the two have a little chat. What makes the scene so gripping is the fact that we've already seen the brutality that Cady is capable of (the biting and the punching). Therefore, when you first watch it, you're on the edge of your seat. And then there's the whole queasy sexual quality it has. Cady flirts with Danielle (Juliette Lewis' reaction when De Niro asks to put his arm around her is brilliant &#150; the shyness and the excitement is completely genuine) and has her suck on his thumb. And then when they kiss you feel like Cady has violated the family in the sickest way possible. He's going to seduce the women of the family before tearing them apart.The seduction of Sam's wife Leigh (excellently played by Jessica Lange) is less obvious, but it is there. Right at the beginning, there's a scene where the married couple make love and afterwards we see Leigh applying her make-up. It's like she's not quite fulfilled, that she's waiting for a real man to turn up. And later on, when Leigh first meets Cady face to face, she seems disappointed by him. It's like she's been fantasising about him in private and the reality has failed to live up to expectations.But although of all of this stuff is great, and ultimately makes it a more rewarding experience than the original film, you do have to take a couple of silly moments. For instance, there's the bit where we see Cady tied to the bottom of the Bowdens' 4 x 4. By this point he's too much like a hick Terminator. And then there's the bit where Cady disguises himself as the Mexican housekeeper so that he can kill Sam's private detective. It just seems out of place in a film that, most of the time, tries to stay on the right side of reality. However, this killing is made worthwhile by the moment when the Bowden family slip on the blood surrounding the body. It's an absurd moment of clumsiness that would be left out by 99% of directors but which makes the events seem more believable somehow.But I do love the moral ambiguity that's present in the film. Yes Cady is a monster, but he also seems to be a monster of Sam's making. He suppressed evidence that might have got Cady acquitted. Therefore, as reprehensible a person as Cady is, you feel that he has a right to be angry with Sam. No matter how disgusting a person is, they're entitled to a fair defence. It's not up to a lawyer to make moral judgements (I didn't even know they had morals). So, to some extent, Sam has inflicted this misery upon himself.And it's telling that, in the end, Sam doesn't even get the satisfaction of killing Cady. Just as he's about to slam a rock into his face, Cady drifts off into the river and drowns. But in a way this also saves Sam. Killing Cady wouldn't cleanse him or purify his soul. It would be another nail in the coffin.But Cady's death is superbly filmed by Scorsese. Cady speaks in tongues and then begins singing as he disappears into the river. Even though he's dying, Cady behaves like he's victorious. Throughout the film his belief that he's on the side of the righteous is unwavering. And the way that he disappears into the water is actually quite creepy &#150; he's like an animal vanishing into the wilderness; his death is so inhuman that you fear he'll return at any moment.Another moment I like the way that Cady walks straight into the camera when he's released from prison. He's like a missile locked on his prey. And then there's the scene where Cady sits on the Bowdens' wall as hundreds of fireworks explode in the background. Scorsese's visual sense adds immeasurably to the film. Really, I'm not sure how anyone can claim the original is better.

With his outrageous accent, his muscular physique, his frightening intelligence and his ability to get the crap kicked out of him and come back harder and tougher, he's completely removed from reality. But that doesn't mean he isn't fun. I mean, in the aforementioned scene where he gets the crap kicked out of him &#150; with lead pipes and bicycle chains, no less &#150; he gets to quote Silesius while adjusting his cute little hick hat. Awesome.Then there's the scene where he holds a smoking flare in his hand. Granddaddy used to handle snakes in church, Granny drank strychnine. I guess you could say I had a leg up, genetically speaking. This sort of person only exists in nightmares and movies. He's nothing like the Max Cady that Robert Mitchum played, a character who was more believable and therefore scarier.However, De Niro's Cady does have his moments. The scene where he picks up a drunk woman at a bar and then proceeds to bite a chunk out of cheek is truly shocking. But although that moment still makes me wince, I actually find the way he punches the woman more disturbing. The brutality of it is quite overwhelming.But the film's best scene is actually the one where Cady talks to Danielle Bowden (daughter of Sam Bowden, Cady's lawyer who screwed him over). He pretends to be her drama teacher and the two have a little chat. What makes the scene so gripping is the fact that we've already seen the brutality that Cady is capable of (the biting and the punching). Therefore, when you first watch it, you're on the edge of your seat. And then there's the whole queasy sexual quality it has. Cady flirts with Danielle (Juliette Lewis' reaction when De Niro asks to put his arm around her is brilliant &#150; the shyness and the excitement is completely genuine) and has her suck on his thumb. And then when they kiss you feel like Cady has violated the family in the sickest way possible. He's going to seduce the women of the family before tearing them apart.The seduction of Sam's wife Leigh (excellently played by Jessica Lange) is less obvious, but it is there. Right at the beginning, there's a scene where the married couple make love and afterwards we see Leigh applying her make-up. It's like she's not quite fulfilled, that she's waiting for a real man to turn up. And later on, when Leigh first meets Cady face to face, she seems disappointed by him.

After the painful experience I had with the Two Coreys, I never wanted to lay my eyes on Corey Haim and Corey Feldman ever again, but I was interested in seeing this film. I put my anger at them aside and watched this film. I really enjoyed this movie, actually, and I think I am able to forgive Haim and Feldman over their awful reality show. They are actually pretty good in this film, as well as Jason Patric, Barnard Hughes as the unsettling but humorous grandpa. and Kiefer Sutherland. Speaking of Kiefer, I think he is exceptionally creepy in this film. He may always be creepy, but still, he was fantastic in this film. However, I do believe that Jami Gertz was a little robotic as Star, but she was overall okay. I still do not know why this film was rated R. There was nothing that bad in it. It deserved a PG-13 rating. The soundtrack of this movie is also very good and entertaining to just hear. From the Doors to the spooky theme song Cry Little Sister, this film is jam packed with memorable songs from the eighties.Here is the plot of the Lost Boys. Lucy Emerson and her two sons named Sam and Michael move in with the sons' grandpa to the town named Santa Carla. At a carnival Michael meets Star, who is a member of a motorcycle gang, lead by David. To become a member of the gang, Michael must do a number of strange things, including jumping into the fog and even drinking blood. Michael then starts to change. He begins wearing sunglasses all the time in the sun, sleeping all day and going out in the night, and more. Sam begins to think that he is a vampire after he is given a vampire comic book by two vampire hunters named Edgar and Allen. After it has become apparent that the gang is made up of vampires, they try to find the leader of the vampires. Sam suspects Lucy's boyfriend, Max, but they then doubt that. Edgar, Allen, and Sam then make a plan to kill the vampire gang. They, with the help of Michael, destroy the gang, but then find out that Max is the lead vampire. When Max tries to kill Lucy, grandpa then kills Max.Overall, this is a down-right awesome vampire movie. This is the first of its kind about teenage vampires and after a barrage of countless rip-offs, this is still the best of the best. The make-up on the vampires is fantastic, the directing by Joel Schumacher is solid and creepy, and the writing can be light-hearted, funny, and scary, not necessarily at the same time in the script, though.

It's atrociously bad on all levels. There's really no plot other than following around a geeky junior high school girl who is harassed to a ridiculous and totally unbelievable degree because she is supposedly ugly, even though there are far uglier people about who seem to do just fine. She does, however, dress very badly, but then so does everyone else in the film. I thought at first that it was supposed to be set in the 70's, and took this as an explanation for the Brady Bunch costumes and music, but about midway through the film the brother goes on the internet, and that put the kibosh on that idea. Most of the rest of the film is similarly unfathomable, and the script, acting, dialogue, and especially the production values, are atrocious. I could overlook some of these things in a better film, but this one is completely uninspired. A waste of time unless you're desperate to see another poorly made teen 'nerd' movie.

It just seemed so weird that Leopold could be so quick to fall head over heels in love with Kate, given her annoying character and the very brief interaction between the two. I also thought that the ending was too abrupt. It could've gone on a bit longer. An epilogue sort-of-thing would be nice to wrap up the whole affair.
