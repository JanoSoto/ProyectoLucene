And I think it's sweet how they love each other so much. And not many brothers are like that!! Emily (Molly Shannon) got on my nerves. She turned out to be this whole different person when she and Steve finally got together. I can't stand people like that. Anyways. This movie is funny and cute and great entertainment.

I had bought the DVD because I am Costner and a Russell fan, but when I read the reviews here i thought I had better spent my money on something else. But I've seen it now (with low expectations) and boy... this movie isn't that bad, in fact  it's quite good ! The action isn't very exciting, but the story and the characters are really enjoyable ! Seeing Costner as a bad guy is a nice change (and he is convincing!) and Russell playing Elvis -- that is just very cool to see and you can see he played it with much enthusiasm! I have seen other comments about the language in the movie (too much f*ck) but this is definitely not the case - if you have seen Pulp Fiction (and i am one of the dozen people who did not like it)  well that was a movie where the f*ck word was in every sentence. In this movie, it is mentioned once in a while but it is really not annoying or more present as in other movies nowadays. If you like Ocean's Eleven, The way of the Gun and A perfect world, then you are definitely going to like this one. Because 3000 miles to Graceland is a perfect mixture of these three movies, and it should have got more attention that it has got when it was released. It probably was criticized much before it was released, and never got a chance, like Waterworld.

This isn't that bad really.  The beginning with the part on how Jason comes back to life is really great and just goes to show how stupid people can be.  I'm not going to ruin it due to the fact that many other people already wrote it down under their summary so why bother wasting your time.  Some other good parts are the paint ball scene where Jason kills some people who work together while playing paint ball and getting some anger out; a scene where a couple is in a Volkswagen bug and the lady says, Darren we need to stop and turn around. I've seen enough horror movies to know that anybody wearing a hockey mask with an ax is not good.  Of course they get killed in gruesome ways.

Easy, the characters are fine by themselves, but when asked to be in a seen together, to communicate with one another, these characters break down. They don't mix well, it's weird to see Nora and Sheldon start having (let me put in away Smoochy might), Humpty-dumpty rumpty time... together.And the anger of Randolph, (while really funny) lets us down by the end.

The movie was dark but it felt like it wanted to be darker, meaner, but it was too nice.On the other hand Death to Smoochy is not the train wreck so many are calling it. In fact it's completely watchable. (Smoochy's song about stepfathers may be one of the funniest songs ever written). If I was to teach a film school I would use the style of this film.
