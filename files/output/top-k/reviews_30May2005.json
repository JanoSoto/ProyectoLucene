Raw seals all the cracks that appear in Murphy's first concert movie, Delirious, with the performance and material being more mature and competent in front of the audience.Murphy combines spot-on celebrity impressions with observational humour. For me, this is certainly not the laughter of recognition; my upbringing could not have been more different to Eddie's. I can only imagine the comedic effect on anyone who grew up in the poor areas of sixties America.Given Murphy's race, and the predominantly black audience, it is a relief that the show is not dominated by the racial humour that tends to let down other stand-ups, who insist on pointing out the differences between white and black guys. When Murphy does tackle this subject, he dishes it out to every race and then moves on to the shared experiences of childhood.Near the end, Murphy begins an impression of his father which turns into a drawn-out sketch, reprising the similar one in Delirious. This makes the most of Murphy's acting skills with the most suitable material; a bit like The Klumps but without the child-friendly content.Nowhere else are Eddie Murphy's talents so well show-cased, but if you like this, see also; Delirious, The Golden Child, Coming to America, and Trading Places.

Wes Craven managed to do such a thing in 1996, when he directed Scream, one of his best horror films in years. Certainly his best since A Nightmare on Elm Street.The reason why Scream is different is because it is about characters in a horror film that know they're in a horror film. Or rather the events they are being forced to endure mirror those of something right out of a stalker\/slasher movie. And they're all too aware of the clich√©s, e.g. the dumb, big-breasted blonde girl who can't act who runs up the stairs instead of out the front door. These are very self-aware characters, but that doesn't stop them from falling victim to the murder spree. That is never more evident than the opening scene. A scene that is as shocking in it's intensity as in it's audacity.A young woman, Casey, played by blonde Drew Barrymore, is at home all by herself. She is in her kitchen making popcorn, getting ready to watch a movie (probably a horror movie). The phone rings. On the line is an anonymous smooth talker, who wants to talk to her about scary movies. Watch the way she fingers with a butchers knife while she's talking! Things turn nasty when Casey's caller starts threatening her, and traps her in a potentially nightmarish situation in her own home. She sees her boyfriend tied up on the patio, and now to save both their lives, Casey must play a game. Questions about horror movies. When she gets one too many wrong, her stalker finally shows. Wearing a black costume, and a ghoulish mask, well they all have to wear masks don't they? It all culminates in Casey's boyfriend being gutted like a fish, a mad chase through the house and garden, until finally the stalker catches up with Casey, and kills her. Even in her death throes, she is still holding the phone, and manages to choke her dying breath to her parents who are on the line. Casey is strung up like macabre modern art, to be found by her mother, who fittingly ends the scene with a piercing scream.I know I sound like I've been carping on and on about this one scene, but it is that important, because it sets the whole tone of the film perfectly. By killing off a famous person that early in a film, we realise at that point this is not going to be just any ordinary horror movie. Not since Psycho and the shower scene have we witnessed such a shocking event. At this point, anything can and will happen.And this is just for starters. The stalker (or stalkers) seems to have a personal grudge against Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell). But why? That's the beauty, and the genius behind Scream. The possible motive (if any) is left up to the audience to decide. Is it because Sydney's mother was murdered precisely one year ago? Is it just some insane psycho out for kicks? Who knows?As the body count piles up, we are introduced to each one of the characters, who is a stereotype in some way. Sydney, for one, is the plucky, headstrong heroine. Like Nancy in ANOES. Then there is Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox-Arqette), the tough as nails reporter. She never actually convinced me in that role, but that could be intentional parody on the part of Wes Craven, which may have escaped Courtney's attention.Dewey, (David Arquette) is the idiot deputy sheriff. Full of his own self-importance, it's a wonder he survives the film at all. In a terrific plot twist, his little sister played by Rose McGowan bullies him every chance she gets, pointing out his inadequacies in no short order.Finally, you've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the self-appointed expert on horror movies. Always coming out with the clich√©s, expectations and rules, he is like a walking encyclopedia on the subject, such as, You never say I'll be right back in a horror movie because you won't be back.Everything about Scream is designed to comment on the horror movie genre in some respect, whether it be the actors or the situations, e.g. the sheriff was played by the same actor in ANOES who was the inept deputy, who tutors Dewey! The film is packed to the rafters with in-jokes, self-referential gags, and puns on the genre. Scream is a literal treasure trove of film references, and one of it's many joys is looking for them. Wes Craven has officially joined the ranks of self-referential irony that Joe Dante and Quentin Tarantino does so well.With a tortuous script, red herrings, and dead ends Scream is a complex maze that leads you a merry dance until the final, very bloody finale. Maybe a little too bloody, but it is added a line of invention by having a hidden camera on the premises, and the events being watched by Gale Weathers. A horror movie within a horror movie!This is horror movie making of the finest order. Scream has layers of sophistication other horror films only dream about. Wes Craven redefined the horror movie for the modern generation, and in the process spawned a series of inferior remakes. That goes for the sequels too, which increasingly became the thing the flawless original had been parodying to begin with.Scream, the ultimate horror movie buff's dream come true!

There are three stories in Full Metal Jacket the boot camp, the actually war, and the sniper.In the boot camp, we are introduced to Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R.

We meet other soldiers other than Joker; we met a man from Texas nicknamed Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and a mental impaired solider named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onifero) who is nicknamed Gomer Pyle by Hartman. I remember the conversation I had with my World History teacher Mr. MacAulay and he explained why they choose Lawrence in the war, told me that the recruits didn't care about records or who were handicapped as long as they got a bunch of young American boys to be dead soldiers.Throughout the boot camp story, Hartman picks on Pvt. Pyle, as we all know that this kid shouldn't be fighting in the war but get special treatment as throughout the story, he is beaten up after screwing up on so many of the exercise and activities that go on. Later on, Pyle can't take it, as we all know that he is now suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder where his nervous system is about to break down. His anger gives him more strength to be more focus, as the drill sergeant is impressed that he is doing much better than the recruits, which leads Pyle to kill the drill instructor and himself.Joker has graduated from the boot camp where he is now a journalist at Vietnam getting all the inside stories and the graphic images. In one scene he is questioned about the peace symbol he wears on his helmet and is ordered to get it off before the marines discharge him. Joker sees Cowboy (Howard) now a squad leader, who tells him the crazy stories about the war, even taking a picture of a dead Vietnamese.Now we move onto the third story, the sniper. After the American soldiers have sex with a Vietnamese prostitute, they receive the wrong map as one by one, a solider is wounded where Cowboy would get shot. Joker and the remaining squad go after the sniper as we see the character change once he shoots the enemy. I feared that Joker will lose his sanity and will be like Lawrence (Pyle) where he turns against his squad. We may never know.Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films of the 80's that should have received more recognition, but Platoon did come out first where it showed how American soldiers were unscrupulous, but what makes FMJ a better movie is that it shows where insanity starts, at boot camp.

I didn't think much of it. All I heard was featuring Drew Barrymore, and then I decided I didn't want to spend money on a movie ticket to see her in a leading role, since I hadn't(and still haven't) seen an impressive performance by her. Then, for the last week or so, I began seeing commercials for its airing on TV. At first, I couldn't for the life of me tell the commercials apart from those advertising Home Fries(pregnant Barrymore, dimwitted father, etc). Still, I decided to give it a chance. I think I held out about half an hour, and then the film simply got too boring for me. The plot is good enough, and it develops nicely. The pacing is worse. What really tears this apart is the characters. Beverly comes off as a self-absorbed, pretentious, stubborn woman with the mind of a little girl. It's heavily hinted at that she's very intelligent and an excellent writer(which I understand the real Beverly was), but we are never convinced of this. Barrymore does an awful job of bringing her character to life; I never cared in the least about what happened to her(which may be part of why I only watched with half an eye after the first half hour). James Woods is terribly miscast. Brittany Murphy does a fair job of her character, but she's given far too little to work with. Steve Zahn does a good job, considering this is the first even slightly dramatic role I've seen him in(I don't know if he's actually done any other drama). On the outside, the film looks like it's about Beverly's relationships with men; when you look a little deeper, you'll see it's about choices and consequences. The problem is, it doesn't seem like it. I never felt like Beverly made the wrong choice. I felt like she just had problems, and blamed them on her unwanted son. Obviously, this is not what the director meant... but either she was unable to communicate her point properly, or Barrymore just lacks the capacity to play anything other than an airhead. I'm almost entirely certain that the book is far, far better, but I probably won't read it. After seeing such an embarrassing attempt at bringing it to the silver screen, I doubt I would be able to read it unbiased. Whether this movie was ruined by director Penny Marshal's inability to create something solid or Drew Barrymore's poor acting performance, I'm not sure. But the fact of the matter is, it is ruined. It is just not a very good movie, no matter how you look at it. If you're reading this and you're interested in the story, go read the book. Stay away from this movie. If you've read it and enjoyed it, stay even further away. From what I hear, it's wildly inaccurate. I recommend this only to very big fans of the actors in it.

The movie itself is a technical masterpiece. James Cameron showed things that people had never seen before, such as going down into the actual wreckage with this little machine. The movie came out when I was 12, and since I was one of the millions of girls who were head over heels in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, I went to see it four times in the theater.As I said, technically this movie is just brilliant. Some of the technology is a little bit outdated if you look closely enough, you can pick out the computer images, but I don't think those detract from the visuals. The sets and costumes are absolutely marvelous. The music is also beautiful and haunting, and it's just right for the film's mood. I've always thought that the love theme My Heart Will Go On is cheesy, but effective in conveying the message of the film.Of course the movie is about the Titanic, but that is really the backdrop for the love-across-class-lines story between Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson. When I was 12 of course, this was absolutely fantastic. Now I see it a bit differently, but I do find it appealing nonetheless. The idea is a little bit ludicrous considering how the ship was built and isolated the upper class from those in steerage. A woman being able to break away from that is also pretty doubtful, but nonetheless if you can get over that you can see the love story for what it is, and that its message is love transcends all obstacles. This is a great movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when it's rainy outside and you've got nothing better to do.Aside from the love story you have the entire tragic loss of life from the sinking of the ship. I think this was both well-done by Cameron visually and the viewer sees the absurdity of course in Rose's jumping off the lifeboat to return to Jack. Again though we understand as an audience that we're going to be experiencing the foundering of this ship through the eyes of our two star-cross'd lovers, so the audience just has to roll with the punches here. Some of the shots here are amazing, and it gets a little ghastly when the ship breaks in half and people start falling off and hitting propellers and getting landed on by the stern of the ship.The dialogue in this movie, however, is far from stellar. The worst parts are the modern day pieces with Gloria Stewart and Bill Paxton's acting is as flat as the Great Plains. Again you just have to roll with the punches to get to the good stuff, which is all the material when they're on the Titanic. Billy Zane makes a great villain, and so does Frances Fisher as the mother. Kate Winslet I think did an excellent job given some of her lines are a bit dull, but I think she still pulls it off convincingly. Leonardo DiCaprio is also a good actor, and although some of his lines are terrible, you can see in him the youth and vibrancy that a poor young artist must have when he's gotten the chance of a lifetime.It's interesting to look at the roles of these women too, as Rose is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but more of a young woman who's confused and angry and trapped in her upper class world. While it may sound like a poor little rich girl story, Kate Winslet convinces you that it's not just about her resenting her position in society. If you were Rose, you'd be unhappy too.Overall I still love this movie. It's a great disaster film and has a lot of those classic elements. The direction and the sets and costumes are visually dazzling, and some of the acting is not superb, but overall I still say it's a good movie. It's definitely worth watching once, if only for the sets and the sinking of the ship.

Copyright 2004. All Rights Reserved.The set up is that I'm 18 years old, and about one week after my graduation from High School. I've been having a one year, long distance romance with a girl named Tammy. I've driven 500 miles to surprise her, and here's what we did the first night I arrived&#133; Chapter 11 The Castle Cinema; Olean, New York; Summer 1986 We came back to her place, had dinner with her mom&#151;I don't remember anyone else being there&#151;and Tammy suggested that we see a movie. There was a new film playing in town that she really wanted to see and asked me if I would take her. Of course I would.The local two screen cinema was called The Castle, and my memory tells me that it was&#151;not surprisingly&#151;built like a castle, with spires, and uneven brick around the top like Jack-O-Lantern teeth. She told me the name of the movie and I distinctly remember thinking what a stupid title. It sounded like a cheesy cowboy movie. I had not heard of it&#151;it was very new&#151;and was certain that it was going to suck. I despised westerns. But I would try to suffer through this horrible movie for her sake, knowing full and well that I would hate it.The film was Top Gun.Boy was I wrong.Top Gun was the paradigm of 80's cinema. By that I mean it was a high-octane action\/adventure film with a script filled with campy dialog, and a thin, formulaic plot that was driven by a kick-ass soundtrack. It was common of the motion pictures during that decade for the music to be the star; one long rock video, like the ones we watched on that new network MTV (back when they actually played videos).I'm only a little embarrassed to tell you that Top Gun changed my life. I had already started skydiving by then and the visuals of aviation and the attitude of the pilots drew me in. I saw that movie not less than ten times while it was still playing in theaters, and countless times since on video and DVD. Even now I know every line by heart. It was the script for my generation, introducing such phrases as Talk to me Goose, It's time to buzz the tower, Let's turn and burn, call the ball and I feel the need&#133;the need for speed. Obviously I wasn't the only one infatuated with this movie. Top Gun was the winner of the People's Choice Award for 1986, nominated for four Academy Awards (winning one), catapulting six of its songs to Billboard's Top 10, and, oh yeah, it grossed three-hundred million dollars world-wide. It was a popular film. On a practical note, my repeated viewings of Top Gun in theaters taught me an invaluable lesson about performance.Throughout my time in theater, mostly plays, we were always told that there is no bad audience, only a bad performance. That's a lie.A film doesn't change from performance to performance. Every line is delivered exactly the same way, with the same timing and the same inflection. The performance give by the actors is identical each time it's viewed; exactly as it was the instant it was captured on film. Yet, I noticed that each time I saw Top Gun in a cinema, the audience reacted differently.Sometimes they would laugh at the humorous parts, other times not. A few times they cheered when Maverick shot the last MIG, and once or twice they actually chuckled when Goose hit his head on the canopy, breaking his neck. The live people in the audience never, in fact, responded the same way at any two showings of the film. Now since the movie changed not one iota, I came to the conclusion that there are indeed bad audiences.On occasion, when I have a show that tanks, I reminded myself of the Top Gun rule, and it brings me comfort.Sometimes.

The movie peaks when it delivers funny humor &#150; there's a sequence with Jim Carrey (before he was famous) playing a rock star named Johnny Squares, and the first time we are introduced to his character is during a scene in which he's filming a music video and lip synching to Guns N' Roses' Welcome to the Jungle.

Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is called to the scene of the crime with his new partner, and they soon realize that there is a strange dead pool list floating around San Francisco &#150; begun by an Irish director (Liam Neeson) who was working with Johnny.The list works like this You name a handful of celebrities who you think may die in the coming months, and whoever's list is the most accurate at the end of this time period wins. The irony of all this is that Johnny Squares' name is on the director's list &#150; which implicates him in the crime. Furthermore, Harry himself is included on the dead pool list, which means he could be the next target.The movie has two plots going on at once &#150; one involves the dead pool list (coupled with the mandatory romantic subplot) and the other is about an incarcerated gangster who wants to seek vengeance on the man who locked him up. That man, of course, is Harry.As its runtime progresses The Dead Pool becomes stupider and stupider, until Harry is diving through fire to save suicide victims in slow-motion, impaling baddies with spear guns and so on and so forth. Buddy Van Horn, who's worked with Eastwood many times and was, ironically, a stunt worker on his latest masterpiece, Million Dollar Baby, directed the movie.

Their song plays at least twice in the movie, for a total of over seven minutes.

I have just spent an hour searching for this film (as I'd forgotten the name) just so that I can buy it for myself, and I would recommend it to people. I challenge you not to feel touched by this magical film! The girl (Fiona) is sent to live with her grandparents in a remote part of Ireland, which overlooks the deserted Islad of Roan Inish. There are legends relating to this island which she learns, including the fact that her baby brother disappeared. She see's a small boy on the island, and is sure that the seals are bringing him up as their own. This begins her search for the truth.

The light causes him to fall backwards. He thinks it is strange, but when he tells everyone else they think it's nothing. Over the course of the next few days, car mechanic Geroge Malley becomes increasingly intelligent and can even move things just by thinking about them. He can speed read and thinks of great plans that would be of use in his community. However, word gets out about this strange phenomenon and he is known as 'freak' by some, 'liar' by others. George also tries to get with Lace Pennamin, a pretty women who always seems to ignore him because of the heartbreak she dealt with when she was with her husband who left her. Lace has two children who immediately adore George. This movie is unique and highly entertaining and you may enjoy it, whether you like romance, dramas or even a bit of sci-fi. This movie is fun and has a bittersweet ending. I liked this one and I especially liked the acting of John Travolta, Kyra Sedgwick and Forest Whitaker. I would view it again, 8 out of 10 stars.

At the centre of it is the question that most of us have asked of ourselves at one time or another is the world that we perceive really as we perceive it? Thomas, the photographer (though not identified as Thomas in the film, as far as I can gather) is introduced as being different from how he is perceived. He is not a down-and-out, but he is emerging from a doss-house. Elsewhere in this very dense opening sequence, Antonioni shows us a mixture of the people 'dressed up' - the rag students, nuns, guardsmen. This notion of 'false image' is really what the film is about. Since we are always being given false images, how can we be sure that the way that we interpret them is accurate? And does it matter? In the middle of these glamorous metaphysics, we are treated to one of the cinema's finest sequences. It is one of only a very few sequences in the whole cinema that define the filmmaker's art. As Thomas 'blows up' the reality that he has captured in the park, he defines mise en sc√®ne. He creates the sequence that he would have shot, had he been the director of the film. This is magical cinema that is simply the crowning glory of a film that dares to demand that its audience THINKS. And in the end, when Thomas' faith in the reality that he photographs has been destroyed, he finds an alternative reality, the reality of the mind.

My feeling about this film is that it's very much overrated. For the most part it feels like a travelogue. There are a lot of nice shots of the Gaellic countryside but it just seemed that all the local characters were too lovable and eccentric. I don't think there was a bad one among the locals and none of these secondary characters had any depth at all. In real life, there are always shades of grade and since the director was so enamored with presenting his 'picture postcard', he lost sight of developing much of a story using the supporting cast. The film is incredibly slow paced and very little happens until the 'storm sequence.' It's very frustrating never to get to meet Wendy Hiller's character's fianc√©. I expected a whole story when she gets to the island and ultimately gives up on the fianc√© but we're cheated of any real dramatic resolution here. Most of this film borders of being boring. There's little back story to the personalities of the two leads so we find out little about them. Do they have a life beyond the silly corny romance depicted in this film? It's all so utterly predictable as the two lovers fall for each other at the end. For most of the film, Wendy Hiller plays a real goody-two-shoes but (and suddenly quite inexplicably) morphs into a neurotic narcissistic materialist while she gets upset listening to the locals diss her fianc√© on a train. Of course this is a set-up where she will soon learn 'the error of her ways' and realize that she must re-discover her 'real' self and fall in love with the 'right' man. One should not reject this film just because it's a piece of fluff. One must reject it because it's predictable with a plot that contains few surprises and has no discernible dramatic arc.

And it is tragic that Bela Lugosi's character is almost a cameo since this was the last time Karloff and Lugosi appeared together on the screen. I also agree that Henry Daniell is one of the few actors of the period who could shine in a role opposite Karloff without Karloff running away with the show. I would, however, like to add that the relationship between Karloff and Daniell is a key to the entire movie and Val Lewton knowingly focuses on this part of Robert Louis Stevenson's nightmare tale. There are many stages of our lives that we would like to forget and we don't like living reminders haunting us about those stages. The strange relationship between the doctor and the murderer points clearly that there is a fine line between good and evil and it is very easy to cross that line when we are tempted to do so for fame, fortune, or any other vainglorious desire. The final scene in Body Snatcher is one of the scariest scenes ever captured on film. I won't give it away for those who have not seen the movie. Just get ready to have the coach ride of your life.
