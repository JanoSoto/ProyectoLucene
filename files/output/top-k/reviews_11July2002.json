And I *have* heard of this film by word of mouth previously, though perhaps not as frequently or with as much ubiquity as some of Capra's other films. Compared to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, for example, YCTIWY distinctly has the status of a 'minor classic'. I don't believe this is deserved, even if themes and (co-)stars are shared between these movies YCTIWY should definitely be far better known and remembered than it actually is.First of all, the story-telling is flawless. It very cleverly sets up the two very different families, the Vanderhof\/Sycamores (an offbeat family trading most importantly in happiness) and the Kirbys (a stiff up tight banking family trading mostly in weapons). To complete the biggest deal of his career, Anthony Kirby Sr (Edward Arnold) must buy up the last house in a neighbourhood, and of course, this house belongs to Martin Vanderhof (a delightful Lionel Barrymore). The movie pleasantly surprised me in *not* having young Tony Kirby (James Stewart) be assigned to get Vanderhof to sell his house and thereby falling in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and her zany family. Rather, he was in love with her to begin with, and loved her regardless of what he thought of her family. (Though it would be impossible to hate any of them, I feel!) The story really is simple Tony loves Alice no matter what, and doesn't want her or her family to put on a show to impress his own family. When he surprises her by turning up a day early for a dinner engagement, the Kirbys meet the Vanderhof\/Sycamores for who they truly are, wind up in jail, and along the way, learn a little bit about being real human beings. There are several delightful scenes in the film as well, all beautifully filmed and connected such that the story is a coherent whole. I'm especially partial to practically any scene with James Stewart wooing Jean Arthur (those two, quite seriously, make the cutest couple imaginable)--I love it when he sort of proposes to her. Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal. Or that lovely intimate scene in the park where he directs her to a seat like he would at the ballet, or when they start dancing with the neighbourhood children. The scene in the restaurant was also amusing, when Tony kept warning Alice that there was a scream on the way, building it up so perfectly that *she* wound up screaming before he did. It's hard to beat the scene in night court too, when Capra foreshadows pretty much the exact same scene and sentiment in the forthcoming IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, when all of Vanderhof's friends chip in to pay off his fine. It's sweet, it's real, and it's something you really do wish could still happen in this world. Even the littlest things like Grandpa Vanderhof's dinnertime prayers are enough to remind the viewer of what a world could be like if we kept our values simple, our wants satisfied, and ourselves happy.Second of all, the acting is superlative. How could it *not* be, with a cast like this? Evidently I was completely charmed by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, who are both incredibly believable both as real people and movie stars, and who together make Tony and Alice an utterly credible, true-to-life couple. Edward Arnold was great as the stuffed shirt Anthony Kirby Sr too--his eventual 'thawing' was something that could easily have been played in too exaggerated a fashion, but both the actor and director, I suspect, are too good to have allowed that to happen. I also had great fun watching Ann Miller in her secondary role as Essie Sycamore, Alice's dancing sister. I sincerely hope that every person making this film had just as much fun as I did watching it, because the whole secondary cast was excellent, and I loved all the characters we were introduced to, particularly the entire Sycamore family with their attendant friends (the ex-iceman DePinna, or the toymaker Poppins) and even their servants Rheba and Donald, who were treated almost as much as part of the family as could be expected at that time. But my greatest praise would have to be reserved for Lionel Barrymore as Martin Vanderhof--a sweeter, lovelier old man you just couldn't imagine, and a complete change from his much-better-known Mr. Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. He really does make Grandpa Vanderhof very much a real person, from his reminiscences about Grandma Vanderhof, to his messing around with the IRS agent, to his harmonica-playing and evident love of life and people. I really could not say enough good things about this movie (which I prefer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE). It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and quite frankly, it'll make you glad to be alive. Not many movies can do that. And it's most certainly true that you can't take your money with you... but what you *can* do is take this movie and its message to heart. 10\/10, without a doubt.

And it's not a matter of one knowing one's limitations; rather it is a matter of knowing how to cope with the results, once one has been driven past the breaking point into a world that can no longer be viewed in black and white, but only in shades of gray-- that point beyond right or wrong or what is politically correct; the point at which nothing matters but survival-- how to live in a world that can have so much to offer, while being so relentlessly unmerciful and decidedly unforgiving at the same time.Transplanted from the big city to a farm in Wisconsin, Alice and Howard Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver, David Strathairn) are attempting to make a go of their own dairy business.  But it isn't easy.  Howard is immersed in his work, while Alice, in addition to taking on the full time responsibilities and pressures of raising their two daughters and maintaining the household, also works as a school nurse.  And though Alice likes her life, the constant strain of keeping her own life on task, as well as seemingly everyone else within her sphere of existence, begins to take a toll on her.With no respite from the daily grind, Alice becomes increasingly exhausted and exasperated.  She finds some solace in her close friend, Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore), but what she really needs is some time to herself; some time to clear her head and regroup.  Instead, an unexpected summer tragedy strikes the Goodwin and Collins households, which damages Alice's much needed relationship with Theresa.  And as if that isn't enough, further trials and tribulations are about to descend upon Alice-- one of those curves life has a way of throwing at you when it's least expected, or needed.  And it's something that will test the limits of Alice's capacity to endure, more than ever before.Working from a remarkably insightful screenplay by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt (adapted from the novel by Jane Hamilton), director Elliott presents a genuinely honest film that takes an in-depth look at what it often takes just to `maintain' on a daily basis, and the very real issues and situations that a person like Alice is apt to encounter.  From the very beginning, Elliott establishes the credibility of the film by creating an atmosphere and setting that is entirely real-- so real, in fact, it will be more than a bit disconcerting to many who will so readily be able to identify with Alice and relate to her situation.  And, having effected such realism, Elliott then moves on to deliver a thoroughly engrossing, emotional drama, which he renders with great care and sensitivity.Elliott achieves success with this film through an obviously keen understanding of the material, the story, and the characters and their corresponding attitudes and reactions to given situations.  And he keeps it `real' throughout by eschewing any superfluous melodrama or sub-plots, the likes to which a film like this in lesser hands could easily lend itself. In the final analysis, Elliott knows what he wants to convey, and furthermore, knows how to do it by exacting the kind of performances from his actors that really sells it.As often happens (too often, in fact), the extraordinary performances in this film were inexplicably overlooked (as well as the film itself) and\/or ignored.  Sigourney Weaver gives a commanding performance as Alice, arguably as affecting and effective as the work that earned Hillary Swank the Oscar this year for her portrayal of Brandon Teena in `Boys Don't Cry.'  This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done, and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing, inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey (and does so, successfully) is that we do not, in fact, live in a perfect world. All that aside, this is a memorable portrayal, in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year (Angelina Jolie received the gold for `Girl Interrupted'), but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver, Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and `normal'-- one of those everybody's neighbor or the-clerk-at-the-store type of roles-- that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural, which when successfully effected, makes it all look so `easy.'  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And-- again, like Weaver-- it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say, it's terrific work, and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's self-absorbed husband, Howard, a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here, in fact, can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character, which at times, is quite substantial.The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard (Reverdy), Louise Fletcher (Nellie), Sara Rue (Debbie) Nicole Parker (Sherry) and Aunjanue Ellis (Dyshett).

This is quite simply some of the best work Weaver has ever done, and it's a shame that she has not enjoyed the kind of acclaim that would accompany such an accomplishment in a perfect world.  Which adds some irony to the whole thing, inasmuch as part of what this film is attempting to convey (and does so, successfully) is that we do not, in fact, live in a perfect world. All that aside, this is a memorable portrayal, in which Weaver exhibits a phenomenal depth and range of emotion.The field was strong in the Supporting Actress category this year (Angelina Jolie received the gold for `Girl Interrupted'), but Julianne Moore's performance here stands alongside any of those honored with a nomination for their work.  Like Weaver, Moore faced the challenge of creating a character that is so mainstream and `normal'-- one of those everybody's neighbor or the-clerk-at-the-store type of roles-- that the real difficulty lay in making it look so natural, which when successfully effected, makes it all look so `easy.'  Which is exactly what Moore did with her portrayal of Theresa.  And-- again, like Weaver-- it's a performance for which she has never received the deserved acknowledgement.  Suffice to say, it's terrific work, and a big part of what makes this film so emotionally stirring.Also effective is David Strathairn as Alice's self-absorbed husband, Howard, a man suffering from a terminal case of tunnel vision.  How good he is here, in fact, can be measured by the feelings of disdain he manages to evoke toward his character, which at times, is quite substantial.The supporting cast includes Arliss Howard (Reverdy), Louise Fletcher (Nellie), Sara Rue (Debbie) Nicole Parker (Sherry) and Aunjanue Ellis (Dyshett).  An ardently thought provoking film, `A Map of the World' invites a sense of introspection and reflection; a film that's definitely going to make you do some thinking.  9\/10.

Despite opposition across the aisle (and some quieter opposition from the President's own party), Hansen refuses to answer potentially embarrassing personal questions about her past. These issues are publicized and pushed into the focus by the House panel considering her confirmation, led by Congressman Runyon (Oldman). Despite things looking grim, the President continues his support for Hansen and her decision not to answer these questions.The messages? Women should be treated the same as men (the fact that a man would not be similarly criticized for having several sexual partners is mentioned repeatedly). Personal issues should be off limits. The political game is manipulative. All of these messages have been voiced before, but perhaps not at the same time and certainly not in this manner. All in all, it makes for a good story.

I loved Bad Tastes as a super-indie film, which relied on jokes and gross humor to keep the pace up. It's not for the weak stomached but it is an impressive film none-the-less. Dead Alive I didn't care for on the whole, it was beautifully shot but the story didn't do much for me and neither did the over-all production. But Heavenly Creatures... now here was something that no filmgoer or maker was really expecting.The plot is a little different in and of itself, centering on the infatuation of two young girls for one another. The girls are both brilliantly played and well cast. Kate Winslet (Juliet) in her first big roll is a little off kilter and unstable. Melanie Lynsky (Pauline) is also very subdued and quiet, not the looker that Juliet is but rather something deep and hidden away. Something dangerous.The film plays itself out very slowly which is good because after you've spent much time with the girls it's hard to let them go. It's also hard to not understand a little of what they were going through and at least feel some sympathy for their plight. We travel with the two into their fantasy world (creepily realized by WETA in the form of clay models come to life) and back, having a full understanding that the fantasy world is more real and more of a true home to the girls. As time goes by the film doesn't fail as either a suspense thriller or character study. It is strong on both ends because of a taught script, unfaltering directing, and magnificent acting.  The events near the end of the film are so suspenseful that I still find them hard to watch at times. Jackson builds and builds and builds and keeps building long after I thought there would be anything left to build.The film is an astonishing look at young love and teenage reasoning. It is a sharp, almost painful, reminder of the level at which adolescents (especially the intelligent ones) think and view the world. After Columbine and Santana this film carries more weight than I think Jackson intended. But never the less, it is there. I think it was put together as a cautionary tale in some respects, and it is a caution... even more so now.

I loved Bad Tastes as a super-indie film, which relied on jokes and gross humor to keep the pace up. It's not for the weak stomached but it is an impressive film none-the-less. Dead Alive I didn't care for on the whole, it was beautifully shot but the story didn't do much for me and neither did the over-all production. But Heavenly Creatures... now here was something that no filmgoer or maker was really expecting.The plot is a little different in and of itself, centering on the infatuation of two young girls for one another. The girls are both brilliantly played and well cast. Kate Winslet (Juliet) in her first big roll is a little off kilter and unstable. Melanie Lynsky (Pauline) is also very subdued and quiet, not the looker that Juliet is but rather something deep and hidden away. Something dangerous.The film plays itself out very slowly which is good because after you've spent much time with the girls it's hard to let them go. It's also hard to not understand a little of what they were going through and at least feel some sympathy for their plight. We travel with the two into their fantasy world (creepily realized by WETA in the form of clay models come to life) and back, having a full understanding that the fantasy world is more real and more of a true home to the girls. As time goes by the film doesn't fail as either a suspense thriller or character study. It is strong on both ends because of a taught script, unfaltering directing, and magnificent acting.  The events near the end of the film are so suspenseful that I still find them hard to watch at times.

Casualties of War is based on a book that is based on real events in Vietnam war. The names of the characters were replaced for this film, but that doesn't change the fact this is a depiction of what happened in real life. Michael J. Fox plays private Eriksson, one member in five men's league to go to a mission during Vietnam war and find some enemies and destroy their hiding-places etc. Their patrol is led by sergeant Meserve (Sean Penn) who after losing his friend in battle, begins to feel very severe hate towards all the Vietnamese and decides to kidnap a girl during their patrol in order to rape and abuse her with the other men during their journey. Eriksson cannot accept this and what follows is no less challenging and powerful than what happens in Oliver Stone's masterpiece Platoon.Casualties of War is a depiction of morality in general and individual's morality and values. The film is set in war, but all this could have happened anywhere else, and now that this happens in war, it tells about the war itself at the same time. Meserve and his friends (Eriksson excluded, of course) are the incarnations of evil, something so wicked and rotten that has rarely been depicted this powerfully in mainstream cinema. His character is equally evil but not as symbolic as Tom Berenger's character in Stone's Platoon. Casualties of War is very disturbing exactly due to its characters' wickedness and how they treat that innocent Vietnamese girl they kidnap. The film becomes almost unbearably intense at one point and I felt genuine feelings of sorrow, anxiety and oppression as it seemed that any attempt to commit something good and justice for that girl fail. The ending of this film is incredibly purifying and relieving, but never too traditional or cliche. An ending this powerful was also in Takeshi Kitano's latest, Brother, which I viewed recently. Casualties of War really makes to think what's right and wrong and things definitely are not just that simple. The scene when Eriksson hits Clark to head with a shovel, is one of the most challenging acts of violence I've ever seen in any film. How can it be accepted? The evil is so strong at that point, it seems that by answering to evil with evil, one may be able to fight it that way. Then we must remember what Nietzsche said that by chasing monster, we must beware not becoming monster ourselves.The narration is totally stunning and the last 15 minutes would not be as intensely powerful without the talent of De Palma and his ability to tell his stories this personally. The viewer definitely doesn't have a clue how this film ends since all seem to be just evil and there absolutely aren't any signs of justice happening. By telling how this film ends and what happens to its main characters, the viewing would be spoilt badly and I hope anyone who's reading this hasn't read any spoiling reviews on this film. The conclusion of the film seems to be, that by staying good and believing in ones righteous principles and moral, justice happens finally, if not in our world, then there what's next when we leave this place. The ending can also be seen in the girl's point of view as she is now in peace and never has to face the kind of horror and evil she met in man's world. The ending is especially rewarding for those, who kept believing in good throughout the film and never gave power to evil thoughts and wrong tools of finding justice. The strongest element in this film is the screenplay as the characters are so personal and real and, fortunately, not shallow. They are real to life and represent all the traits we all have, active or un-active. Eriksson's character is as powerful as Charlie Sheen's in Platoon and the incarnations of evil are also equally shocking and gripping. Equally brilliant element in this film is Ennio Morricone's extraordinarily beautiful and sensitive music that really gave the scenes an incredible punch and made the whole film as powerful as possible. The music is perhaps close to Once Upon a Time in America's sensitive and sad score, but Casualties' score lacks all the positive and major segments found in America's score. Morricone's music in Casualties is perhaps his saddest score and that is really saying a lot when considered the incredible talent of Ennio Morricone's.This film is among the few that made me cry. I remember having very strong feelings when watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream and Spielberg's Schindler's List (for the first time), and also after and during Casualties of War, I almost and cried since the power of this unique film is so incredible. Michael J. Fox' acting ability is one reason for the effectiveness since he puts his soul into the role and really acts naturally and feels naturally. It would've been horrible, if this film was ruined by bad acting or, even worse, by shallow and bad screenplay. Sean Penn and his friend corporal Clark are also so bad and repellently wicked, it is even worse to notice that their superiors seem to have same kind of thoughts about life and, in this case, about the girl's case. All these things give the feeling that no one cares and all the attempts Erikkson does are in vain. But fortunately that is not the case when this film approaches its end.Casualties of War is challenging, very disturbing, emotional, rewarding and purifying piece of art, and really De Palma's greatest film, in my opinion. This is important and remarkable film and his gangster films and horror masterpiece Carrie are left behind this stunning work, despite Carrie and gangster films of De Palma's are also great in their own way.

This is one of the fastest action films in a while. The story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists. Some readers at IMDB have compared it to Spy Games, which pales in comparison to this film. That other film had two actors that are an enigma Brad Pitt and Robert Redford! The Bourne Identity gives us another wooden actor Matt Damon, who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections. He's always in the right place at the right time. Mr. Damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in Hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their bills.Take the case of the character actors of this film Chris Cooper, Clive Owens and Brian Cox, to name only 3! They don't have anything to do here. It is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a non-actor.I wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru' and doesn't even get a scratch to his face. I guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is super-human.In the love sequences there are no chemistry between Ms. Potente and Damon. Run Marie, run from this sucker. Make better adult oriented films in Germany or wherever, but never pair against Mr. Damon again.Sorry Mr. Liman, better luck next time and better actors too.

This is one of the fastest action films in a while. The story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists. Some readers at IMDB have compared it to Spy Games, which pales in comparison to this film. That other film had two actors that are an enigma Brad Pitt and Robert Redford! The Bourne Identity gives us another wooden actor Matt Damon, who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections. He's always in the right place at the right time. Mr. Damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in Hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their bills.Take the case of the character actors of this film Chris Cooper, Clive Owens and Brian Cox, to name only 3! They don't have anything to do here. It is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a non-actor.I wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru' and doesn't even get a scratch to his face. I guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is super-human.In the love sequences there are no chemistry between Ms. Potente and Damon. Run Marie, run from this sucker. Make better adult oriented films in Germany or wherever, but never pair against Mr. Damon again.Sorry Mr. Liman, better luck next time and better actors too.

I think Toby Maguire was a GREAT Peter Parker\/Spiderman (Sorry if that's a spoiler, kids, if you didn't know Parker was Spiderman before the movie, go buy a comic or three =), and while Kirsten Dunst isn't my favorite actress by a long shot, she fit with Mary Jane's profile very well. I have to admit out of all the comic books, Spiderman was the one I knew the least about, still do.  However, even for a Spiderman-Stupid person as myself, I was able to quickly fill the gaps of what I knew and what was going on just by watching the film. I think the camera work was fantastic.  Having Willem Dafoe argue with himself using the mirror was a nice touch of cinematography.  Maguire managed to deliver the classic Silly-Spidey lines with just the right intonation and effect. Showing how he was CONSTANTLY looking for work and money to support himself whilst NOT saving MJ gives the story a lot more realism than Batman (Of course Bruce Wayne was filthy rich) or Superman (who, though he worked, didn't seem to really need the money). As for the scenes that show things EVERYone knows about Spiderman - I found myself cringing, wishing Peter Parker would move when the spider was going to bite him.  I found myself wincing when I saw Norman Osborn becoming the Green Goblin in the lab.Overall, this by far gives me a new hope for comic book or even video game to film translations.  Keep up the consistency for Spiderman II! 10\/10, two thumbs up, good work!
