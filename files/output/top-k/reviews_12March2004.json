This film is all about this and more. Indeed is a slow paced movie, indeed the characters are not so great, but even the real life is not perfect, so let's put aside all this, and enjoy it with an open minded. Romance is something that appeals a lot to filmmakers, but again, few of them manage to capture it so nice on the screen.

I loved it because it was so believable and everything that was done was most likely true. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan were excellent in their roles. Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me.In only his third film role of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First Pacino was the war hero, then he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to climb the ladder in the family business.I also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the Godfather series was, the first Godfather could have stood on its own without making sequels. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in.

The plot line of where and how Steel comes to be is a close approximation of what a Superman-less origin might have been.I don't think its a movie that wants to be any more than it is which is a fun little romp in a super hero sort of way. Shaq is fine as Steel which he plays to the best of his ability. Allowing that the character never had much depth the central performance is everything it should be.

He's sad, happy, lonely, funny, and a bit of a pig.  He's full of contradictions when it comes to relationships, including anger at his ex for sleeping with someone else the day after he does the same.  But that's actually why Rob is such a lovable character.  He has flaws, many of them.  He questions everything, and he has an obsessive compulsion with Top 5 lists.  He curses, he smokes, and he flies off the handle amid weird fantasies, but this lets the audience know he's a real person.  He's not some made-up romantic hero.  He's an anti-hero.  He's far from perfect, but we root for him, anyway.Barry, played by Jack Black, is a hilarious, fun-loving rocker.  This film forever establishes Jack Black as Hollywood's hard rock comedian.The role that surprised me most was Todd Louiso as Dick.  Dick is nervous, twitchy, but sensitive and brilliant.  He's basically what chick flicks try to characterize all men as, except that Dick is real, in that he has these qualities, but isn't some ravishing Mel Gibson model actor man.  Combine the three guys, and you have a combination of almost all men.The soundtrack (the backbone of this film about music and love) is simply amazing.

I find the character of Donnie Darko in sync with my own life in which I feel and see and understand at a deeper level than others. Also it shows how others simply do not understand who I really am and as a matter of fact, never will in all ways. And that is actually good. It is what makes me unique and this gives me strength as well in my own heart and life. Most will be lost through the movie because they are expecting something else. Of course that is how most people perceive any movie when they go watch it and that is why they would never understand a movie of this caliber and nature in the first place. Very deep movie and I am glad it was made the way it was. The director and author were not interested in the money issue, but rather they really wanted to show us and create for us. This movie is certainly as a fact not going to be understood or grasped by everyone, but that does not mean it is a bad movie either. 5 stars is not good enough for this movie. Should show how selfish and mean people can be, and Donnie through the looking glass is where most of us miss it. By the way, no one should even think this is anything like American Pie, movies which I totally detest and think are very sick and immature in nature and not meant to have any real meaning of a sensitive nature.

Very deep movie and I am glad it was made the way it was. The director and author were not interested in the money issue, but rather they really wanted to show us and create for us. This movie is certainly as a fact not going to be understood or grasped by everyone, but that does not mean it is a bad movie either. 5 stars is not good enough for this movie. Should show how selfish and mean people can be, and Donnie through the looking glass is where most of us miss it. By the way, no one should even think this is anything like American Pie, movies which I totally detest and think are very sick and immature in nature and not meant to have any real meaning of a sensitive nature. Donnie Darko movie most definitely does.  Way to go!

Sylvester Stallone gives one of his best performances in Daylight leading a group of civilians to safety after a New York tunnel engulfs in flames. Stallone works his magic as a former EMS chief sent in to save these civilians.When I heard Stallone's name mentioned as part of the cast of Daylight, I knew it would be a non-stop thrill ride; however, what I didn't realize it would be a thriller that had depth mixed in with everything else. Daylight is a credit to Stallone's ability and this remains one of his best roles to date.Adding to this awesome film are Stallone's co-stars, which include Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Jay O. Sanders and Stan Shaw. I enjoyed watching this ensemble work together because they seem to need no direction when on screen. It was as if they were really trapped in the tunnel. From the fear to the heroic actions they took, these actors were top notch.Despite most thrillers, Daylight stands out as being the finest assembled film. The casting works like magic, the special effects are magnificent and the script is perfect.I concede that Daylight is predictable. However, I disagree with those who say it hurts the film. My point is it doesn't matter whether a film is predictable, rather how it is presented. Daylight is presented with quite unique special effects, a plot with depth and endearing performances.In addition to the excellent performances, Daylight had some of the best special effects I have seen. The explosion at the beginning of the movie was a work of art. I was in awe of how well the special effects were pulled off because I don't believe that Daylight would have worked as well as it did if they were done with less than 100 percent effort.Daylight will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you holding your breath hoping these citizens come out alive.

The characters were made to be very complex, and they are seen to be intricate as they change and progress through the movie.  Yet the changes they go through often seem rushed and out-of-character.  Plus, the message that each event sends to the viewer often gets lost from the screenplay to the actors to the screen.

Is it our basic human instinct? But one would think that the human race is smarter than that. But obviously we aren't.  Freud would say it IS our instinct. He would say it is penis envy. The idea of penis envy is that males must and will always be jealous of the guy with the bigger thing and he will want to be the guy with the even bigger thing. That is why Freud would have absolutely loved Dr. Strangelove. The movie has many Freudian overtones. Dr. Strangelove is a movie that seems to have good intention of pointing out this ridiculous love people have for the bomb. It could have been done better though. The acting just wasn't all that impressive and neither was the character development, but for a movie like this with the issue it is dealing with, the characters\/acting isn't exactly the most important thing. It is hard to understand the acting and what the characters are saying, but Stanley Kubrick somehow did a good job of getting the message across. Dr. Strangelove has the qualities of a film and a flick. It could be considered a film because of the real issue, and a flick because of the humorous aspect of it. But there are also parts of this film that the average Joe may not understand. One may not understand the Freudian overtones and the dark humor of it all. This movie is accurately put in the dark comedy category because of the satirical way that the very real issue of nuclear weapons is portrayed. It is portrayed so dismissive an un-serious. It is good that there are movies like this that poke fun at how nuts society is. There should be a more modern version of this film released.

Jimmy The Lips Fagin telling Brother Rabbitte what he has achieved, when Jimmy thinks he has achieved Nuttin'.That being said, I am overjoyed at the amount of people giving their wonderful comments about my favorite movie of all time.I can't tell you all the people I've turned on to this movie. I remember I didn't see the movie when it first came out, then they came out with some god-awful TV series kinda based on the movie (Americanized, of course),which,thank god, met a quick & merciful death. I bought the VHS version, then the Laserdisc version, then the DVD, and am now awaiting the 2 disc special DVD, just released, to come in the mail.I have watched this film countless times & never get tired of it. I've even pretty much deciphered the dialogue(try reading the book sometime,if you think the movie is hard to understand!)One of my most prized possessions is a Commitments Promotional kit consisting of a Making of tape and a booklet about the movie in a photo-illustrated 6x15 box that I bought from a long-closed video store about 10 yrs ago. I also found the ellusive Commitments Vol.2 CD in a cut-out bin about the same time.Anyway,I love the movie, and the whole premise of taking a bunch of unknown,talented, singers & musicians,with pretty much no hope of rising above their surroundings individually,and put them together to form The Hardest Working Band in Show Business.To me, the highlight & peak of the band(and movie) was when they played Try a Little Tenderness. It still gives me goosebumps & brings a mist to my eyes,whenever I see it.I'm still in love with Natalie & Imelda!! And Deco(Andrew Strong) only being 16yrs old!!I always hoped there would be a Part 2, but as Joey said to Jimmy(after the band broke up) The success of the band was irrelevent.You raised their expectations of life, you lifted their horizons. Sure, we could have been successful, & made albums & stuff, but that would have been predictable. This way...it's poetry. What a wonderful philosophy. That whole scene will never leave my mind.
