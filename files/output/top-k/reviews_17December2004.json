As Tom Ripley took Mr. Greenleafs offer, he then tracked down Dickie Greenleaf in Italy and befriended him. As Tom realised that there was no chance that he was going to convince Dickie to return to America, he then told Dickie that he was hired by Dickies father to convince him to leave Italy and return to America. Dickie found it quite amusing that his father would go to such extremes to get him back and decided to play his father along by writing him letters saying how great Tom is and that Tom was a good influence in his life, without letting on that he knew that his father hired Tom.This films storyline\/plot is one of the silliest story lines I have ever seen in a movie. First of all, there's no way a man would on the spur of the moment hire a complete stranger that he meets in an airport, to track his son down in Italy, to convince him to move back to America. Second of all, there's no chance that a cool guy like Dickie Greenleaf who has a beautiful girlfriend(Gwyneth Paltrow) would befriend a nerdy guy like Tom Ripley and letting him move into his home and giving everything he wants - it just wouldn't happen. Later on in the film, Tom unplanningly kills Dickie in a row boat and from then on pretended to be Dickie by living in his home and by using his identification. I thought that was quite realistic, as it was the only realistic bit of this film that would happen in real life. However, the whole bit of Tom masquerading to be Dickie, I found took up half the film, for it just dragged on and on, which resulted this film in getting nowhere. One good thing I can say about this film, is that the acting was brilliant, especially by Jude Law(Dickie Greenleaf) for his acquired American accent was quite convincing and his talent of acting emotional was well performed. I wouldn't say that this film was terrible, but I wouldn't call it an average film either. It had its okay moments, but on whole I found this film boring and wouldn't recommend anybody to watch it.

Also the supporting actors were good, though I don't think they match the leading actors' performances.Some shots in the movie are awesome. Just tiny little details and angles make them special.

But then there's the story. Oh yes the story. Written by Stephen King, it's basically very simple at the start and gets more complex and spreads out like a cobweb.

I am eager to hear more, to listen to his words, and be intrigued by how his thoughts are still relevant in today's society. This was a beautiful film made in 1974. The decision by director Bob Fosse to film it completely in black and white was brilliant. Hoffman and Perrine's chemistry is brilliant as well as their performances. The power of this man is vividly demonstrated through this film, leaving you with questions answered as well as a desire to hear more. This was such a captivating feature. From the opening sequence of words spewing from a mouth to the final shot of Lenny Bruce, I was glued to my seat.To begin, the cinematography was better than most feature films. Fosse knew what he was doing and did it with the greatest of ease. His choice to film completely in black and white really helped me hear the words that Bruce spoke instead of just being involved in the colors that surrounded him. The black and white feature gave Hoffman the ability to create a human from his character and take us away from Hoffman and into the mind of comic Lenny Bruce. The shots that Fosse used also assisted with building this compelling story. Every shot is important in this film, and Fosse does a great job of demonstrating and explaining the why and where of a scene. This was his first and only non musical, and he was triumphant. The way that the story works in a pseudo-documentary style was impeccable. While you are never quite told who the person is behind the camera, you do get that raw emotion from the actors as if you were watching a real documentary. There was just so much emotion that Fosse pulled from his troupe in this film that you could only watch in amazement. It also left the door open to the question of who is behind the camera. With the words that Bruce said nightly in his show, I couldn't help but think of the possibility of government conspiracy. Maybe I am way off, but there was that aura of cover-up throughout this film. Even the final sequence gives off that sense.BAM &#150; Powerful cinematography is right in front of you, but whom do we have in the center of the camera? None other than a very young and fresh Dustin Hoffman. This film really showcased his talents. While he had several films before this one that brought him into the spotlight, I thought that he went above and beyond for this film. He really transformed himself into the character. Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial. The vision of defeat was spectacular. You see in this film why Hoffman is considered one of the greats of Hollywood. Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate. Her portrayal of Honey needs to go in the history books. Actresses today could take a moment or two to learn from this dramatic actress. These two actors really brought this film together. They took you deep into the life of this radical thinker and kept you nestled deeply inside of him. They shined greatly, and the Academy saw it too! BAM &#150; Cinematography, BAM &#150; award winning acting, what can be the final BAM? How about Lenny Bruce? Born well after his death, I had never even heard of the man, but the words that I witnessed from this film from his mouth shocked me. Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today. As homosexuality becomes a staple in our community and society, Lenny's comments on the teachers in this film seemed like topics we are still talking about today. He was way ahead of his time, and I think that is why people feared him. Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to real life. I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries. These are sad days that we live in, and if only people could see how powerful words can be in defending yourself and explaining the world, I think we would see a rebirth. If I had the option to fight with a loaded gun or an aggressive dictionary, I think you can see which I would choose.

And by modernized I mean that it has been told through the experiences of a lot of French people who speak English and with British accents. But no matter, I'm willing to accept that everyone in France in 1800 spoke perfect British even if only because of Geoffrey Rush's brilliant performance. With every movie that he comes out with I become more and more convinced that there is nothing he can't do.In order to know virtue, as the Marquis explains, one must first understand vice. In Philip Kaufman's Quills, the focus is on the Marquis de Sade after his writing has taken him beyond the artistic freedom generally accepted in the 18th and 19th centuries, even to elite aristocracy like himself. It is a detailed exploration of the events that led from him being a social elitist to living almost three decades in prison, writing things that caused his keepers to make it so difficult for him to write that he ultimately uses his own blood and excrement for ink, and his clothing, the walls of his cell, and his own skin as parchment.Luckily for the Marquis, at first anyway, is that there is something of an understanding priest in the Abbe du Coulmier, another wonderful performance from Joaquin Phoenix. An intensely religious man, Coulmier believes that the Marquis should be allowed to write, if only to purge himself of the sadism with which his head is filled and which would later be named after him.Kate Winslet plays Madeleine, a laundry maid who smuggles the Marquis' writing out of the asylum so that it can be published, for which many people are not happy, but many others are. The Marquis dips into the extensive world of the forbidden sexual taboos of the 18th and 19th centuries, writing extensively about them without a care in the world for propriety. One may wonder to what extent the Marquis' writings were such a hit because they were forbidden, or because of their lewd content, which may euphemistically be described as guilty pleasures for the masses. Indeed, Larry Flynt was not working, so graphic pornography was something of a rarity.There is a curious relationship between the Marquis and a physician named Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, who is assigned to law down the law with the Marquis and prevent him from writing anymore. The glee with which the Marquis mocks and taunts him are some of the best parts of this outstanding film. There is a great parallel between the two characters, as well. Royer-Collard pretends to be a moral role model, at the same time taking a wife who is young enough to be his daughter, possibly even his granddaughter, and treats the Marquis with exactly the same sadistic (if I can again use the term for the behavior for which the Marquis would later be named) behavior that he condemns that Marquis for writing about. Both men engage in many of the same practices, it's just that the Marquis makes no attempt and has no interest in hiding his interests in the pleasures of the flesh.I think that the most important thing to remember about this movie is that it is able to deal with a person who's beliefs are, I like to think, below the moral compasses of most of the people who will watch the movie, but it's not about what he was writing, it's about the fact that he was writing at all. It's about his defiance in the face of a corrupt moral authority, his insistence on maintaining an artistic expression that was not well received but that was certainly therapeutic to him.

The film starts off with a poorly acted scene that acts as a prologue to the film itself and sets the tone nicely. That means that if you're considering watching this movie, just watch the scene preceding the credits and you can make up your mind on whether or not you want to sit through the rest of this. It acts as a fair warning to even the most overbearing parent. As soon as this scene is over, we get a live-action version of the famous and well-known intro to the TV-series which will make even the most mentally hardened die-hard fan break down in tears and yell Please make it stop! Oh my gosh! at the screen. The film ends with a live-action re-enactment of the end credits sequence of the show as well, which most likely will bring forth the same reaction. I'm not going to lie to you; I didn't pay that much attention to the film. It might have been because I saw it once when I was a kid (almost ten years ago). But, more likely, it was just because it was really dull and downright offensive to anyone who is\/was a fan of the show, even slightly, or anyone who actually does demand just a little quality from a film they watch. It's so tacky and crude. Honestly, I couldn't tell you one single joke or gag from the movie, and I've just seen it.

The characters are cheap clichés and stereotypes, mere cardboard cutouts of their characters from the original TV-series. The special effects are so see-through and poorly done that you have to wonder what the heck the film-makers were thinking... if they were thinking at all. Maybe that's it.

Scarlett's children. I would have liked to have seen her in the early mother role with a son that could barely speak his own name he was so timid of her! Back to the movie...if you are of southern descent and you have not seen this movie, someone should spank you! If you are northern and not seen this movie, then you should so you know how most of the south still feels about you. I have yet to met a northerner that was not 'out of the norm' of this movie. It pegs them to a tee! (And I've met plenty!) A movie with a wonderful story, wonderful scenery and a wonderful cast! I, too, do not believe that there was an American actress at that time that could have surpassed Leigh's performance. She is truly magnificent. My favorite line of her's is when ole Kennedy has died and she has been drinking brandy and Rhett comes to call on her and she see's him out her window and hiccups and say It's Rhett. And then pretties herself up with cologne with Rhett smells right away and says  Scarlett, you should never drink alone, people aways find out and it ruins their reputation! So true and yet so funny!

Although Balzac is often claimed by the French as their greatest novelist, he has not captured the imagination of the Anglo-Saxon reading or cinema-going public in the same way as some of his compatriots such as Hugo, Verne, Flaubert or Dumas. Apart from 'Cousin Bette', I am not aware of any other English-language feature films based on his works.The story is set in the Paris of the 1840s. Bette Fischer is a middle-aged spinster who works as a theatrical costumer. She is not well-off financially and lives in a sparsely-furnished apartment, although she has more elevated social connections; her cousin Adeline, who dies at the beginning of the film, was married to the influential Baron Hulot. Bette, however, had little love for Adeline, as she was jealous of her cousin's beauty and of her marriage to a successful man. She falls in love with Count Wenceslas Steinbock, a young Polish sculptor who lives in the same apartment block, but loses her sweetheart to Adeline's pretty young daughter Hortense. Bette's dislike of the Hulot family now turns to hatred, and she plots her revenge. She forms an alliance with Jenny Cadine, an opera singer-cum-courtesan and a former mistress of the Baron, who has given her up in accordance with his wife's dying wishes. Jenny, with Bette's encouragement, tries to ruin the happiness of the young couple by seducing Wenceslas away from Hortense. Those who are familiar with Balzac's novel will realise from the above summary that the film does not stick closely to its plot. Adeline, for example, dies at the very end of the novel, not at the beginning. The real villainess of the novel is not Jenny (who plays only a minor part) or even Bette (who is portrayed as pitiable as well as spiteful), but Valerie Marneffe, the scheming, hypocritical, gold-digging and thoroughly corrupt middle-class housewife who becomes the mistress of Hulot, Wenceslas and several other men. Valerie does not appear in the film at all; nor do Hulot's other mistresses. The film concentrates on the relationships between Bette, Wenceslas, Hortense and Jenny; Hulot, a major figure in the book, becomes less important in the film. The ending of the film, in particular, seems unsatisfactory. There is a confused attempt to tie the story of the Hulot family in with the revolution of 1848, an event that had not even taken place when the novel was written in 1846. This was probably inspired by the standard school textbook idea that the French Revolution represented a corrupt aristocracy getting its just deserts, but this interpretation seems to confuse the events of 1848 with those of 1789, and it is not one that is likely to have appealed to the conservative monarchist Balzac. The replacement of the constitutional monarchy of the amiable 'Roi Citoyen' Louis-Philippe with the regime of the unscrupulous adventurer Napoleon III was not the most glorious episode in French history.Like some other reviewers, I felt that some of the roles were miscast. Jessica Lange, even in her late forties, was far too attractive for the role of the dried-up, embittered spinster Bette. (Balzac chose the name because of its similarity to the French word 'bete', meaning 'beast'). Bette's driving force is sexual jealousy of the beauty of other women, particularly of Adeline and Hortense, but Miss Lange's character is not a woman who would need to feel jealous of anyone. Kelly Macdonald's Hortense seemed too insipid. Hugh Laurie, in his late thirties at the time the film was made, was far too young for the role of Hulot. The character envisaged by Balzac was probably in his sixties and the father of two adult children. (Hortense has an elder brother, Victorin). Laurie, better known in Britain as a comedian than as an actor, plays Hulot as a largely comic figure, whereas in the novel he is a tragic one, a distinguished public servant ruined by his sexual passions and his financial improvidence. The book forms part of the sequence of novels which Balzac intended as a close examination of French society and to which he gave the title of 'La Comedy Humaine'. Despite this title, most of the individual novels, 'La Cousine Bette' among them, are deeply serious rather than humorous, but the filmmakers here seem to treat the story as a black comedy. On the whole, in fact, this approach works well. The story moves along at a brisk pace, helped on its way by some witty songs. The title of one of these, 'Love is the Master, You are the Slave', is perhaps the best encapsulation one could wish for of the film in a single phrase; most of the characters are enslaved by their sexual desires. Jessica Lange may be physically wrong for the part, but she nevertheless throws herself into her role with gusto and makes a splendidly hissable pantomime villainess. Elisabeth Shue's singing voice is not really strong enough to make her convincing as an opera singer, but she is well able to convey Jenny's seductive charms. Unlike some, I found no difficulty with the fact that Bette and Jenny had American accents; both, after all, were originally peasant girls from Alsace-Lorraine (Bette's surname implies that her native language is probably German rather than French) and would not have spoken French with the Parisian accents of the other characters. There are some good performances in minor roles; Toby Stephens makes a suitably dull and priggish Victorin, a man who is the complete antithesis of his father, and Bob Hoskins is in superb form as the greasy businessman Crevel. The name is derived from 'crever', meaning to burst, and Hoskins's Crevel is a man positively bursting with his own self-importance. The film may take liberties with Balzac, but on the whole it is an enjoyable one which works reasonably well in its own right. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2004","score":"22 out of 24 people found the following review useful","review":" The words 'adapted from a novel by Honore de Balzac' would suggest to most cinema-goers an example of French heritage cinema, like the excellent version of his 'Le Colonel Chabert' made with Gerard Depardieu in the early nineties.

The basic theme is of the rugged genius who is held down by a jealous and\/or suspicious and accusatory &#150; one might say racist, in this case &#150; superior, but who breaks through all of the barriers erected in front of him. Luckily, here we have the addition of the character of a great but lost writer, who wrote a single classic but subsequently disappeared from the public eye, only to have his heart captured by this inner city kid with the gift of a great writing ability.Sean Connery has a difficult time fitting this role, or maybe I just have a hard time seeing him as a great writer, the real talent in this movie is Rob Brown in his film debut playing the part of Jamal Wallace. There is a great scene where his jerk teacher starts reciting quotes from great writers in an effort to show Jamal and the rest of the class how much smarter he is than any of them, and Jamal repeatedly identifies each author after only a few words. It's a great lesson about teaching methods, although I like to think that there are few teachers who deliberately try to make their students feel inferior to themselves, but I know they're out there. I've had a few myself, although I don't think I've had any as bad as this guy. His problem might be that he's teaching at an inner city school, since he is so obviously racist.Sean Connery and Rob Brown work well together, despite their relationship being so contrived. William Forrester is the author of a single classic who apparently has spent the last 40 years or so rarely leaving his apartment and writing masterpieces that he refuses to publish because of a paralyzing fear of being critically misinterpreted, a risk that every artist of any kind in the history of mankind has run by publicizing their work. The ones that never publicized their work are quickly forgotten.Jamal plays basketball with friends near Forrester's apartment, from which he watches them with binoculars, which is creepy indeed. On a dare, Jamal sneaks into his apartment and is scared away by him in such a rush that he leaves his backpack behind with a notebook with some of his writing in it. It's not long before his backpack comes sailing out of Forrester's window with lots of corrections and suggestions in it. This setup for the relationship between Jamal and Forrester is clever, until you realize that this guy has been holed up in that apartment for decades because he doesn't want anyone to read his work.

I suppose schoolboys have a lot of dreams. One of my stranger ones was the wish that I could freeze time and go up and erase everything on the board anytime the teacher wrote something up there.

(My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.As another reviewer has pointed out, 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme, love between people of unequal social standing, which has provided literature with some of its greatest works, both comic and serious, dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady, Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite, the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least $15,000,000 per film, and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie. Although Anna is played by a real-life Hollywood superstar, Julia Roberts, the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters, being a shy, diffident middle-class Englishman, probably public-school and university educated. (Despite this background, he is not particularly wealthy following a divorce from his first wife and is forced to share his lodgings with an eccentric Welsh flatmate, Spike). The humour of the film, particularly the dinner-party banter between William and his friends, is mostly of the typically ironic, self-deprecating variety popular in Britain, especially in middle-class circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike, by contrast, typifies another strand of British humour, the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more working-class background; this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters, although he takes it all in good part. William may be diffident, self-deprecating and unsuccessful, but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful, but underneath it all she is insecure, worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend, Jeff, but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally (and in some cases physically) bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties, it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep; William tries to play down the incident, and Spike finds it hugely amusing, but Anna is horrified. (The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana; this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi, who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death). Like others, I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own; she too has had a number of unhappy relationships. Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella; the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic, down-to-earth counterpart to the fairy-tale romance of William and Anna, helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm, however, lies in the relationship of the two main characters, as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant, 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2004","score":"99 out of 122 people found the following review useful","review":" Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops.

The humour of the film, particularly the dinner-party banter between William and his friends, is mostly of the typically ironic, self-deprecating variety popular in Britain, especially in middle-class circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike, by contrast, typifies another strand of British humour, the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more working-class background; this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters, although he takes it all in good part. William may be diffident, self-deprecating and unsuccessful, but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful, but underneath it all she is insecure, worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend, Jeff, but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally (and in some cases physically) bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties, it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep; William tries to play down the incident, and Spike finds it hugely amusing, but Anna is horrified. (The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana; this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi, who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death). Like others, I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own; she too has had a number of unhappy relationships. Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella; the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic, down-to-earth counterpart to the fairy-tale romance of William and Anna, helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm, however, lies in the relationship of the two main characters, as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant, 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"17 December 2004","score":"99 out of 122 people found the following review useful","review":" Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. (My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.As another reviewer has pointed out, 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme, love between people of unequal social standing, which has provided literature with some of its greatest works, both comic and serious, dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady, Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite, the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least $15,000,000 per film, and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie. Although Anna is played by a real-life Hollywood superstar, Julia Roberts, the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters, being a shy, diffident middle-class Englishman, probably public-school and university educated.

This film thinks it's an intelligent study of sexuality, but really it's little more than an amateur effort at trying to create something hip and original. The plot follows Christina Ricci, a horrid excuse for a human being, who has an argument with her mother and goes to stay with her half brother. While there, she seduces her brother's boyfriend (yes, you heard that right) and gets pregnant, thus affecting the lives of everyone involved. Making the central character impossible to like was a very silly idea (this film has many of those) because it makes the film hard to like right from the word go as it's seen through her eyes. The movie also suffers from a terrible narration courtesy of said character. As we all know, narration is a sign of someone that doesn't know how to write a script good enough to function on it's own, which sums the writer of this film up. The narration is also really stupid, and the way it is presented is an obvious attempt to make the film different and cool, and needless to say; it didn't work.The tagline of this film clearly states that 'you will be offended'. This is very true, as this film continually insults the viewer's intelligence. Stating that 'you will be offended' is a ridiculous claim, and the only people that could possibly come of this film offended are gays, by way of how they're presented in the film; but really, anyone with anything about them would easily be able to laugh off the silly ideas put forward here. As an obvious attempt to mask the lameness of the movie and it's terrible script, Don Roos has put together a cast of TV actors from bad American TV shows. Lisa Kudrow, obviously from that 'Friends' rubbish, sticks out like a sore thumb and is obviously in the movie to try and draw the Friends fans in. Christina Ricci is a fantastically beautiful actress that I've liked in many of the films I've seen her in, but even she cant get past the awful lines she has to deliver, and the awful cast she's acting alongside. There isn't much else to say about this movie as I've nailed all of it's main flaws already, but I'll close by saying this is one of the most limp and pathetic movies ever to insult my television screen. I beg you not to bother with it, and if you don't take my sage advice; you'll be begging for your time back at the end. I don't care if you do love Christina Ricci; this is one to avoid like the plague.

It builds up suspense then at the end just forgets all about it and thats it! It starts off reasonably well, and has very good acting from Cruise and Kidman in the 2 leads, but the story itself doesn't make sense at all. All the movie is really is Tom Cruise wondering around New York having heard his wife had an affair, to meet a grieving woman, a prostitute, an old friend, a costume shop owner, and finally onto an erotic party. He also spends about $1000 in the space of 2 days and doesn't care that much! This whole evening takes up about an hour and a half of the movie and is incredibly slow-moving and annoying as the lines are slow and it moves at a snails pace the entire time. Then its the next day and everything is really weird and by the end of it you're thinking what the hell? There are that many plot-holes and their is no point in the movie at all!In the end this movie left me confused, bored and annoyed. So I advise you to skip this and watch a good move like The Green Mile or Seven.This is a complete waste of time and I give it 3\/10 only for Cruise and Kidman's acting which was good I must say ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2004","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I sat through this long, slow moving movie about a year ago and when it finally ended I couldn't believe that was it and I'd just sat there for nearly 3 hours watching such rubbish.

The main problem with The Basketball Diaries is that viewers of the film are never certain as to exactly what time period this story takes place. If you have read Jim Carrol's staggering memoirs, Basketball Diaries, you will know that he was writing his totally drug-drenched 70's and 80's memoirs.This film version doesn't know quite how to play it. There are times when the characters act like 1990's kids, and other scenes that seem to be stuck in the 60's.As the film opens, Jim (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his best friends are getting plastered by sniffing cleaning fluid. What day and age is this? In the next scene, we see Jim and all of his friends getting prepared for a big game. Mark Wahlberg (formerly Marky Mark) is astonishing as Mickey, Jim's best friend, who provides pills to the team, resulting in a scene that has become a classic...everyone on drugs attempting to play basketball to the tune of The Doors classic The End. What destroys this film is that the script falls apart early on and the characters leap from one personality to another..from one situation to another...with no development.Tons of futile plot twists and confusing musical decades are packed into this film. Neutron (Patrick MacGaw) seems to be the most sensible of the group. He shouts angrily at the ball team for using drugs, YET.. in the scene JUST BEFORE THIS, Neutron is wearing a ski-mask and helps his friends assault an older lady so that they can get cash for heroin. The editing and art direction are deliriously wrong. Before it's all over, Juliette Lewis shows up as a heroin whore, who becomes pure and clean (with no explanation) and tosses pretzels at Leonardo; Ernie Hudson is a black man who plays basketball with Jim, and later tries to come to the rescue when he declares, You were frozen in the snow like a goddamn fuge-sicle! Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos) goes nuts in the few scenes that she is in. She's screaming at Leo about the pills she found in his room. Bracco wails, What are you gonna tell me? That they're VITAMINS??? It all ends with Jim going to prison and learning his lesson. There is nothing really wrong with this movie unless you know the real story. Jim Caroll's stunning memoir, Basketball Diaries, takes you deep into a harrowing world. This movie just barely scratches the surface.
