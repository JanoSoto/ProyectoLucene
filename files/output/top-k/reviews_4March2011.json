I'm not that good of a writer, really. But I had to comment on this film because it was the most special out of all the films. But not in a good way...My summary up there perfectly sums up this film; A film that was doing well, hitting all the right spots, and when it almost ended (the third act) it got wrecked, it blew up - excuse the pun.This has to be one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. I don't hate it, though, but I hate how took the very wrong turn towards the end. I'll soon get to that.The film had a terrific start - loved how they showed the soldier growing up and going to wars in only like, 10 minutes. Mistaken for dead, he gets thrown in a ship that has dead soldiers and trash. That ship throws all the dirty bits into a desolated planet. Then he wakes up, he gets out and meet the natives. So far so good, actually, so great. He gets to know them and all that. The film had amazing visual effects of the planet; I loved the two (or was it, three) suns in the sky and the orang atmosphere.Until the end, the third act, the soldiers and their leader come to the planet - that's probably where Avatar got its ideas from. Still, I was enjoying those bits, even though it was the third act that annoyed me. They kill some of the natives, then the soldier gets ready fight them.That's when I was put off by the ending. Fair enough, you will fight them right, it's self-defence? But the way he fought them, which was of course pretty much the film's creators faults, was way over the top. I mean, it was full on, over the top action with Michael Bay-esque explosions and non-stop shootouts where the genuine sci-fi touch this film had was completely gone. Seriously, and this madness went on for 20 minutes - which will please action fans, but not sci-fans like myself. I actually loved how he was killing them by appearing out of nowhere, that created good suspense. But use of guns and explosions was too damn much. I got very turned off.Granted, he was a soldier so had to make his guns happy. But still, didn't he lose his magic while he was in the planet? I mean, he got tame and all. But still, the ending was too Commando meets Predator with him wearing warrior paint on his face, looking macho and all. That's what disappointed the hell out of me. I was like, I'm watching a sci-fi\/adventure, not some gritty action film. If their weapons were lasers then I actually wouldn't have mind the shootouts - at least that would've given this film a sci-fi feel.When the film almost ended, I got even more disappointed. This time, it wasn't the action. The ending was just lame and cartoonish. Why did they blow up the whole region? I hated how they lame-ised the leader where he literally pisses his pants. There should've also been a fight (not gun\/explosion type) with the leader. I hated how they wimp-ified him. I also preferred the film to end in the planet, not them, with the natives, flying in the ship with an explosion behind them.In brief, this film had an amazing start. I loved how the soldier was hanging around with the natives, how more human he became. Then it all ruined after they made him like the terminator where the ending seemed something from typical action films that made this movie lose its sci-fi touch. Also, how a tough Colonel was made into a scaredy cat. The explosive action was made to show off its effects and attract actions fans.That's what I call bad writing.

This may be because it's the director's most subtle and relaxed movie, and also the only one in which the material he directs isn't his own; instead this is an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. This doesn't mean it's at all bad, and in actual fact it's entertaining to watch Tarantino try something different for a change.Of course, his trademarks are still apparent for the fans. The dialogue is as zippy and frenetic as ever, and the characters the usual bunch of double-crossing low-lifes you'd expect to see in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. There's a huge set-piece late on in which takes place in a shopping mall that manages to be just as entertaining as the chop-em-up showdown of KILL BILL VOLUME 1 even if the on-screen events are more laid back.As with every other Tarantino movie I've seen (all of 'em, with the exception of DEATH PROOF), the cast is remarkable for its breadth and daring. Once again, Tarantino isn't afraid to pick forgotten or non A-list types as central characters. When he incorporates A-listers, like De Niro here, he does an about turn and casts them against type. It pays off. De Niro is hilarious as a no-good hoodlum and seems to be loving the chance to play something other than a slick mob boss.Elsewhere, we get cult favourite Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR) who gives what I think is his best ever performance; Michael Keaton, playing a pretty weird\/wired cop; Bridget Fonda as a stoner; Chris Tucker, not annoying for once; Samuel L. Jackson as a cold-blooded, almost reptilian character and, of course, Pam Grier. While I appreciate Grier's iconic status - I've seen a fair few of the '70s flicks that made her famous - I don't think she's quite the actress that Tarantino hoped for when casting her, but she's adequate at least.

The story is about a teen who loves music and wishes to go to a music college. Yet, oddly, her parents are deaf and cannot really enjoy her music--nor do they really understand why this is important to her. The main themes then are understanding and acceptance.I have a rather unique perspective on Beyond Silence and so how I judge it maybe very different from the average viewer. My daughter is deaf and my wife and I are hard of hearing (mine is minor and began much more recently). So, a film that talks about issues pertaining to a family with deaf and non-deaf family members is naturally something that would appeal to us--and it would have many aspects to it that would be more important to us than the average viewer.Here are some things an American deaf audience would probably like to know about the film. First, the sign language in this film is sometimes pretty easy to understand--German sign language is a but more like American sign language than is the British system. Sure, a few words here and there were different (that's to be expected), but some was identical or very similar and you should be able to follow what they are saying if you know American Sign Language. Plus, the same issues facing the deaf and hearing family members are the same throughout the world, so it won't matter that it takes place in Germany. Second, if you watch the film, select caption option #2--NOT #1. That's because although the German being spoken is translated (as is MOST of the sign language), when in a few tiny cases people speak English, this is NOT captioned if you choose option #1.The film is about a dilemma I know about but have never seen on TV or in film. It's the story of a hearing child who has deaf parents--and there are many complications as a result of this. First, the hearing girl is the window to the world for the parents. This tiny kid ends up translating and even doing very adult conversations for the parents because the parents are not skilled at communicating any way other than sign language. And, at times, the child strongly manipulates her parents--translating thins in a manner that is best for her but not, at times, very accurate (this is a VERY common problem*). It's also a negative for the child, however, as their needs often become secondary and they are forced to give up much of themselves. It's not surprising, then, that Clarissa decides to take up music--something she can have that uniquely hers and separate from her parents. I thought it was fascinating that she chose the clarinet--an instrument deaf parents would have difficulty enjoying (had she chosen the bass or drums, the parents could have readily enjoyed along with her).The film also brings up a lot of practical information that the typical person would not know. The fact that the parents (in their 30s to about 50 in the film) would only use sign language and have VERY limited vocal skills might surprise some. What might be more surprising is that the father's own family never really learned to communicate with him!!

","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2011","score":"","review":" Beyond Silence is a film co-written and directed by Caroline Link--the same lady responsible for Nowhere Out of Africa--a film that won the Best Foreign Language Oscar a few years ago. The story is about a teen who loves music and wishes to go to a music college. Yet, oddly, her parents are deaf and cannot really enjoy her music--nor do they really understand why this is important to her. The main themes then are understanding and acceptance.I have a rather unique perspective on Beyond Silence and so how I judge it maybe very different from the average viewer. My daughter is deaf and my wife and I are hard of hearing (mine is minor and began much more recently). So, a film that talks about issues pertaining to a family with deaf and non-deaf family members is naturally something that would appeal to us--and it would have many aspects to it that would be more important to us than the average viewer.Here are some things an American deaf audience would probably like to know about the film. First, the sign language in this film is sometimes pretty easy to understand--German sign language is a but more like American sign language than is the British system. Sure, a few words here and there were different (that's to be expected), but some was identical or very similar and you should be able to follow what they are saying if you know American Sign Language. Plus, the same issues facing the deaf and hearing family members are the same throughout the world, so it won't matter that it takes place in Germany. Second, if you watch the film, select caption option #2--NOT #1. That's because although the German being spoken is translated (as is MOST of the sign language), when in a few tiny cases people speak English, this is NOT captioned if you choose option #1.The film is about a dilemma I know about but have never seen on TV or in film. It's the story of a hearing child who has deaf parents--and there are many complications as a result of this. First, the hearing girl is the window to the world for the parents. This tiny kid ends up translating and even doing very adult conversations for the parents because the parents are not skilled at communicating any way other than sign language. And, at times, the child strongly manipulates her parents--translating thins in a manner that is best for her but not, at times, very accurate (this is a VERY common problem*). It's also a negative for the child, however, as their needs often become secondary and they are forced to give up much of themselves. It's not surprising, then, that Clarissa decides to take up music--something she can have that uniquely hers and separate from her parents. I thought it was fascinating that she chose the clarinet--an instrument deaf parents would have difficulty enjoying (had she chosen the bass or drums, the parents could have readily enjoyed along with her).The film also brings up a lot of practical information that the typical person would not know. The fact that the parents (in their 30s to about 50 in the film) would only use sign language and have VERY limited vocal skills might surprise some. What might be more surprising is that the father's own family never really learned to communicate with him!!

So much so, after I finished watching it I felt the desperate urge to see something better so I wouldn't to lose my faith in movies; something like Plan 9 From Outer Space or Gigli for ex... I'm not exaggerating. How bad this film is? Well, it's so bad, even true Mexicans here look phony, as if they had been imitating the bad acting of the Americans playing them; especially Chuck, in one of the worst miscasts in film history. And if you consider that even at best of times he isn't a great actor, not even a good one, imagine how bad he can be when playing Mexicans. And his--for the occasion--blackened mug doesn't help either; he looks like having spent the last 24 hours sweeping chimneys, not to mention his phony accent in both languages. When speaking Spanish, or English, he sounds like an American badly impersonating a Mexican badly impersonating an American...you get the picture.For starters, the plot of the movie is amateurish and full of holes; a tenth grader would have done a better job at it. The acting goes from bad to awful and the Mancini score--intrusive & strident at times&#x97;is more a nuisance and a mood killer rather than a mood maker, especially during some crucial scenes, as it distracts you from ongoing events (not that such events are much worth seeing). The only good thing about TOE is the cinematography, which may be useful for film students. The long shot from a craning camera at the beginning is worth mentioning as the series of shots from different angles during the final shootout. Apart from that there's little of value here.Here's a stupid plot, I said, unfolding in an idiotic fashion carried on by dumb characters. I only needed 10 min. to come to that conclusion and I don't need to abound on that, as already many reviewers have delved on it; I'll just state that by that time Vargas & wife have proved to be the dumbest romantic couple ever walking on Earth. Exs. right after a terrorist bombing he sends her away alone in an unknown and hostile land, telling her to go back to her hotel, only to see her almost run over by truck right there--which doesn't bothers him the least anyway. But then she proceeds to show she's even dumber than him when following a total stranger to a place she doesn't even known, only because the guy is holding a paper in which someone has written that he got something which could interest her husband. Aw, what can I lose? She murmurs innocently, before marching on at the heels of the stranger--Your life, dummy! Moments later Wells himself shows up, a caricature of the bad guy in some cheap B movie, displaying his arched brows, his evil stare, driving with a hedge hammer the point that he's the real villain in this film. But all that's topped later by the even dumber shouting match between she--Vargas and Brandi, which brought memories of the original TV Batman series--only that in this case we are supposed to take the confrontation seriously. And that brings me to the subject of the characters themselves.They are not even stereotypical; they are simple cartoons. Caricatures of caricatures. Speedy Gonzalez is a better developed character than Heston's Vargas even if he's just a mouse. And Leigh doesn't fare much better either her she--Vargas here is just a parody of her Psycho's Marion Crane. She may be a great actress but she doesn't have anything to work on, there's no meat in her role, as the film sorely lacks in tension and conflict, simply because the villains here are also caricatures; nothing more than pathetic mock ups of the real stuff&#x97;just think about the current drug war in that same region which has claimed the lives of almost 30.000 people in the last few years, and try to put Brandi and his nephews in that picture. No way. They are simply laughable--so much so even Leigh can shout the clan boss down, even calling him pig in his face, with no unpleasant repercussions. But that's easy for her to do, as Brandi looks and acts more like a watered down, innocuous, version of De Vito's Penguin--rather than a mob boss--and his nephews like rejects from auditions for some Broadway take on West Side Story. While watching them I couldn't help thinking that here's probably where the creators of the orig. Batman TV series got the inspiration for their villains. (See that fight with Vargas in the bar for ex.; the only thing missing there was those familiar Bang! Auch! Slam!) As for Wells, he doesn't even look menacing; only fat, unkempt, even disgusting. (I wouldn't come anywhere near that guy before eating, and neither after). But the worst of them all is that utterly superfluous fruitcake of night motel manager--What is his raison d'etre here anyway? In any film with true villains the atmosphere's set in the beginning in images, scenes that strike the viewer's imagination&#x97;like a horse head in a bed, for ex. or the Spectre minion failing in his mission and then being eaten by sharks. That's cinematographic genius. In TOE instead, Wells uses that same technique to destroy the mood of his movie, to de-construct it. That scene in the lot, when Brandi slaps his nephew, and in response this one gives him a finger, indicates that we'll have no villains here, just a sad lot of clownish punks.

Sadly, this film, with bold aim and a careless hand largely missed the mark.Will Smith displays his best and most studied acting as Muhammad Ali himself, along side other great actors who play titan roles. Jon Voight as sportscaster legend Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X also shine. Still the dramatic potency of the cast is weighed down by the storyline's inertia.Perhaps what doomed the film was that the timeline stuck militantly to Ali's life between the years of 1965 to 1975. Unfortunately, much of what was shown of this decade focused less on boxing and more on personal affairs, as it spent much time on Ali being banned from the sport and scorned by the establishment for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War. And while (in real life) Ali's court case went on for years during his ban from the sport, the film didn't go the route of The People Versus Larry Flint, focusing on intellectual ventures surrounding the legal fight.Besides the great acting, the only high spike in Ali is the scene surrounding the Rumble in the Jungle fight that took place between Ali and George Foreman, in Zaire in 1975. Here, Mann does deserve some credit for transitioning his underlying assertion &#x96;that Ali was a universal and influential American icon&#x97;to the build up and anticipation about this legend challenging and beating the new champ Foreman.Like most sports fans, I wanted to see this charismatic, inspirational man and prolific athlete fight titans in the ring, not fighting sociopolitical causes or punching wind against partisan apparitions.

The acting is equally as hollow and stiff and literal. The plot ends half-way through the film and a new crime plot starts after a STUPID (as in, poorly set up and unmotivated) killing of Paul with a bang of a thin-glass snow globe. That snow globe would more likely shatter not cause such a severe wound, and Paul would not die instantly anyway and would end up with brain damage rather. The rest of the plot is completely unnecessary - who gives a f*** how they deal with it when we know the consequence is that the adultery has scarred their marriage? Especially when in the end it leads to no real resolution (at least in the original plot...) Because of the writing and equally bad acting, I can't identify with any of the characters and hate them all by the end of the film. I'm not jaded by experiences or my values - I understand why Connie would do it, but the way her character is developed makes her just look like a b**** to her husband. And her husband, he comes across as having an inner socio-path. The kid - well he's just so obnoxious and terrible, I want to shoot him by the end of the film. Paul is a more likable character because he isn't lying as much as the rest of them, but then he doesn't respect Connie's wish to end the relationship. Also because of the writing, some of the sex scenes boarder on being almost pornographic and almost rape scenes because they are not supported by motives. Connie says no I don't wanna keep going repeatedly and then she has sex? Or Paul shows up at the café and they have sex in the bathroom while her friends talk about him? That's too close to fantasy.I also find this film has a terribly narrow audience 40+ moms who have been married for a long time and possibly work 9-5 or are housewives and are very traditional, or a variant where the woman already has cheated on her husband or wants to. I can see this film's obvious commercial aim. It's obvious in not only the characters that are created (EXACTLY like their audience) but by making constant outcasting references to family life like tags sticking out of clothes - f***, that's not cinematic!My favourite part of this movie is when Connie almost gets KILLED by the shopping cart blowing down the street at the beginning and my favourite character is her racially discriminated black maid. I laughed most of the time watching this movie, and I could not 'suspend my disbelief'. Especially when the cinematography supported the stupidity of the plot - such as, a fast zoom in while Paul grabs at Connie leaving seductively - that was hilarious! I could not feel any sympathy for the characters because instead of coming across like adults, they handled the whole situation like teenagers and eventually children. It also sucked because at any point, the whole plot could've been smashed to bits easily by Connie or Edward telling the truth. The whole aspect of the plot being *irreversible* actions was non-existent. It could've stopped anywhere - which to me says, this is not a unique enough story. And since this film rips off a French film (that's probably way better), it isn't original. If there wasn't the whole second plot of the crime, this movie would be thinner than air.

In the city of Verona the Montague and Capulet families are mortal enemies. That is until one day Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet meet and fall in love; knowing that their families won't tolerate their relationship they marry in secret. While no one else knows of the union Romeo intervenes in an argument between his friends and Tybalt, one of the Capulets; he refuses to fight even when Tybalt attacks him. Coming to Romeo's defence his friend Mercutio is killed by Tybalt who in tern is slain by Romeo. For this crime Romeo is banished and Juliet's parents arrange for her to be married to another suitor not knowing she is already wed. To solve the problem the priest gives Juliet a drug that will make her appear dead and writes a letter to Romeo explaining the situation. Romeo does not get this letter and when he hears Juliet is dead he returns to Verona and takes poison himself. Juliet wakens as he is taking it but by then it is too late; he is dying, she then takes his gun and shoots herself.Director Baz Luhrmann has brought a new twist to this old story; setting it in the present day. Surprisingly the Shakespearian language doesn't seem out of place, instead it comes across as the local dialect and references to 'swords' continue to work as we are shown that they are makes of guns. Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes are great in the lead roles; there is a real chemistry between their characters. Harold Perrineau is also notable as Mercutio; his opening scene is one that once seen you will never forget&#x85; he is in drag wearing a silver costume, matching wig and bright red lipstick! Forcing school children to study the scripts often spoils Shakespeare; it was always intended to be watched as it is performed; in his day on the stage but now film brings another way to see it. This version might not be the most traditional but I think it could be one of the best ways of introducing somebody to his works.

Really long, really cool, and as inspirational as only the best and cheesiest 80s sports movies can be. Even the inevitable synth pop soundtrack is great in this one. The only part I didn't care about at all in this sequel the drama aspect. Paulie and Adrian were more than tolerable in the earlier ones, but here they're just bland and lame.
