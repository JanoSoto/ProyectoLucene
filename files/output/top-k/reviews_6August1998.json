Such as the Evil Dead  movies, first A Nightmare on Elm St.  The Hills Have Eyes and so on.  It  bothers me that people all of a sudden call themselves horror fans.

Do you wonder how many times Truman has almost  drowned? Always differently, of course, according to the script for that  episode. I'm not a movie critic obviously. I don't like to review movies.  I like to talk about movies, without injecting a great deal of scholarship  into the discussion. I have lots of education; an MBA and everything. But,  some of these plots in new films are quite interesting. Who hasn't had  experiences time that mirror some of these plots?  I myself, have tried my hand at various occupations, like Truman's. I have  been an insurance agent, and a real estate agent. All of us who have worked  at these things know that fellow that gives Truman the seasickness. All of  us no longer able to even eek any more. But there's is prosperity  everywhere! The people are happy! The media is not complaining about  anything! They're all too busy with the presidential scandals I  guess. I wonder where Sylvia will take Truman. May she is going to take him to  school, where they'll be happier in some sort bohemian limbo, not noticing  their squalor. Truman is a bit old for it. I  don't think he'll be happy.   I like Hollywood movies better than ever sometimes. But one has to wonder if  the public understands them. I guess the public has no choice but to accept  and tolerate. I wonder how many Trumans there are. How could Truman become  a member of the tavern? Maybe all he needs to do is pick up a mild  alcoholism habit. Well, at least is nice to know that the people at the  tavern speak up for Truman. Poor Truman! Do you think Mr. Birbank Sr. was  also an actor? Before he became a hobo, that is. Did he join the people at  the tavern or not?  Well if you haven't seen The Truman Show, you are missing out on a much  better movie than Titanic.

As the writer of  the screenplay he's not such a star either, again the beginning is okay,  but the ending seems like a bad headache after a night of partying.
