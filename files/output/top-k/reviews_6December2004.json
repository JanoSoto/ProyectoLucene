I read recently that this movie just about ruined the life of Peter Duchin, Eddy's son. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a character in such a popular film that shows up on AMC just before you play your next gig. George Sidney did a beautiful job of directing, and no expense was spared for this Technicolor movie filmed on location in New York. There are so many great shots of the city -- if you're familiar with New York, watching the movie is all that much more enjoyable. The film appears to follow the structure of Duchin's actual life but how much is fact and how much is fiction is hard to say. What is fact is that Carmen Cavallero does a divine job dubbing the piano, and Tyrone Power's fingerings are excellent. He apparently worked at them night and day, and the result was worth it.There are some wonderful scenes in the film, one of the best being when Duchin talks about his love for Marjorie to Chiquita, who is about to become his new wife. It's such a beautiful monologue about how you can be young and love someone the way he did Marjorie only once, watch your parents age only once etc. - needless to say, hearing that little speech today means more to me now than it did when I was 14. Another great scene is Eddy and a little boy playing chopsticks on a rickety piano in wartime; and, of course, Eddy talking to his son at the playground toward the end of the film.Tyrone Power knew Eddy Duchin personally as he knew just about everyone, and his portrayal is masterful. In the beginning, however, he's the young Eddy and it's obvious that he's way too old to be fresh out of college. Power was 41 at the time of the filming, and it wasn't the 41 of 2006 - it was a 1950s, three-pack-a-day, party all night, I fought in World War II 41 - hello. You would have thought that the lighting man and cameramen would have worked just a tad harder - we're talking about Tyrone Power here, not some nobody. A little star treatment, please. Instead, Power ends up looking younger in the second half of the film. Ridiculous. There are lots of posts about Kim Novak, who is very beautiful though vapid as Marjorie, but not much mention of the beautiful Australian actress, Victoria Shaw, who played Chiquita. Like Power and Duchin, she died young. She does an excellent job in the movie. One of the comments suggested the character of Chiquita is fictional; in fact, Duchin's widow was indeed Chiquita Wynn Duchin, and in 1947, Peter Duchin left the Harrimans to live with his father and his stepmother. Rex Thompson plays the young Peter Duchin and though he makes a game try at hiding his British accent, he sounds British. As a young adult, Thompson was a handsome and fine actor - he worked into his twenties, and then faded from view. In real life, Peter Duchin went on to marry Margaret Sullavan's daughter, Brooke Hayward. It's hard to hold back the tears during The Eddy Duchin Story, so don't try. Enjoy the romance and be enveloped in a more gentile world where people had some class, and listen to that great music.

Sabrina has been in love with playboy brother (of wealthy family) David (Greg Kinnear) all her life, and is dismayed when her father sends her off to Paris to get a new view of the world. However, years later, when she returns as an older woman, David then realizes how 'right' she is for him, even if he's finally setting a date with one of his two-week lovers. Behind this interaction, older brother and businessman Linus (Harrison Ford), whose pleased about David's engagement, seeing that he's marrying the daughter of wealthy business competitor Mr. Tyson, knows that Sabrina just might end the marriage and the merger. To make things work out, Linus pretends to start being interested in her. This is a delightful tale about love with beautiful music and visual shots that will make you very pleased.

The girl who spends most of her time trying to escape the family of crazed maniacs with her life ends up holding the chainsaw herself, swinging it around like a lunatic exactly like Leatherface did at the end of the original film, which led me to believe that it would suggest a general direction that the movies would take in any further sequels. Instead, Texas Chainsaw III, one of the more controversial entries in the series, seems to be unaware of its predecessors.I hesitate to condemn the entire film just because it is seriously lacking in the quality department, if only because I watched the 'Making Of' featurettes on the DVD and found that the cast and crew actually went through some serious trouble getting the thing made, and the cause of a lot of the drops in quality was some things that they had to cut or change in order to get an R rather than X rating. You would think that all they have to do is cut out excessive blood or guts or nudity to tame the rating a bit, but they had to completely change scenes in order for the blasted MPAA to allow them to release it. Wes Craven went through similar troubles in some of his earlier films, like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, and when you learn what they deal with it's not so hard to figure out why the MPAA is not popular with horror filmmakers.(spoilers)One thing that had to be changed, for example, was the ending. This is why you see a character show up grinning at the end of the film, despite the fact that we watched him get his head chainsawed in half earlier in the movie. Before you yank the DVD out of your DVD player and try to stick it in the wall, take a few minutes to watch the making of documentary, which essentially is 30 minutes of the cast and crew trying to explain why the movie was so bad. One verbose reviewer who calls himself Duke De Mondo writes a hilarious review in which he asserts that the Texas Chainsaw sequels all seem to pay homage to the original film as though it were some kind of urban legend, constantly reshuffling everything except Leatherface, the only character who is expected to be in any Texas Chainsaw movie. Hence, in part III, Leatherface is the only returning character, and as the director explains on the accompanying documentary, everyone else is some sort of surrogate family brought together my similar deviations from sanity. Still a pretty weak explanation for the little blonde girl, I should think.Speaking of which, it should be mentioned that at one point in the film, two people get chainsawed to death minutes apart, and it is not until I saw that little girl standing at the top of the stairs that I was even slightly apprehensive. What is it about little kids that makes them so scary? It's the worst when they are dressed in cute little outfits that just clash so strongly with their surroundings, like the little girl in this movie or, probably most famously, the twin girls in The Shining, who I still think are some of the creepiest kids ever captured on film. This girl turns out to be an aspiring member of the family, eager for her turn to put the meat hooks and sledge hammers to good use, and who decorates her room not with flowers or Barbie's or anything even remotely pink, but with human bones and skulls, presumably left over from the original Texas Chainsaw and, subsequently, The Hills Have Eyes. And this is to say nothing of her doll. You know, Jodie Foster had to undergo counseling in preparation for her role as a 12-year-old prostitute in Taxi Driver. I really wonder if there were similar concerns for this girl, whose film-making ordeal can't have been much less damaging.As far as the gore, Texas Chainsaw III is famous for being disappointing, but this is explained by the whole ratings fiasco. On the other hand, there was much talk about death scene of the girl who had already been running from the crazed family for five days or so when this movie started. Supposedly she was sawed in half from the stomach up, but this is simply not true, even in the unrated version that I watched. Yes, there is a vast quantity of blood in the scene, and yes, she does get brutally killed with the saw, but no, she does not get sawed in half and then her body peel off in two directions, having been split down the middle. It just doesn't happen. Nevertheless, I should think there is sufficient gore in the movie to satisfy all but the most depraved horror and Chainsaw fans, especially considering the sledge-hammer scene (which is based on a real police photo of Ed Gein's basement, and is one thing that the movie deserves at least some credit for), the above-mentioned chainsaw scene, and the scene where one character gets his head sawed almost in half at the ear level, although, as we later find out, does not kill him. If this is not enough for you, watch Day of the Dead. And if THAT is not enough for you, watch the news. There are plenty of videos coming from al Qaeda that are truly, truly disturbing.Viggo Mortensen, although he almost didn't get the part because his audition just didn't go very well, was outstanding as Tex, who is essentially the character that Matthew McConaughey plays in Texas Chainsaw 4, which is by leaps and bounds the worst of the series, including the 2003 remake (which I have not seen at the time of this writing, but it is physically impossible that it was worse than that ridiculous mess). There is one scene where Tex nails the heroine's hands to a wooden chair, and then casually asks her how she likes Texas. Pretty disturbing, but it doesn't make you want to slap your forehead, as McConaughey does from start to finish in part 4.Well, I'm sure she's having a blast, although the movie was filmed in California, incidentally about a 30-minute drive from where I live in Los Angeles. That's bike-riding distance for me. I was also impressed with the heroine in the movie, the obligatory girl who is the last to survive running from Leatherface (although this movie makes a slight variation on this trend at the end of the film). She manages to walk the fine line between sufficiently expressing her terror and not screaming mercilessly to the point where you just want her to get killed so she'll shut the hell up, and that is not an easy line to walk. I hope I'm not being misogynistic, but there is nothing worse in a horror film than the hysterical woman who simply screams and moans and won't respond when someone is trying to help her. I hate that. I have to admit that I was disappointed that the fancy new chainsaw, inscribed with the infamous quote 'The Saw is Family' and the most famous thing about this movie, was put to so little use. Not only is it not introduced until the majority of the killings are already done with another, much less shiny and interesting, chainsaw. And to make matters worse, not only is it underwater when it does its flesh-hacking (I guess the ability to run underwater was another of its special features), but the one character that it is allowed to sink its teeth into turns up not dead at the end of the film. Disappointing, true, but I have to say that Texas Chainsaw III is one of the better TCM films. Not as good as the original, but as good as the first sequel and light years better than the third sequel.

Pretty disturbing, but it doesn't make you want to slap your forehead, as McConaughey does from start to finish in part 4.Well, I'm sure she's having a blast, although the movie was filmed in California, incidentally about a 30-minute drive from where I live in Los Angeles. That's bike-riding distance for me. I was also impressed with the heroine in the movie, the obligatory girl who is the last to survive running from Leatherface (although this movie makes a slight variation on this trend at the end of the film). She manages to walk the fine line between sufficiently expressing her terror and not screaming mercilessly to the point where you just want her to get killed so she'll shut the hell up, and that is not an easy line to walk. I hope I'm not being misogynistic, but there is nothing worse in a horror film than the hysterical woman who simply screams and moans and won't respond when someone is trying to help her. I hate that. I have to admit that I was disappointed that the fancy new chainsaw, inscribed with the infamous quote 'The Saw is Family' and the most famous thing about this movie, was put to so little use. Not only is it not introduced until the majority of the killings are already done with another, much less shiny and interesting, chainsaw. And to make matters worse, not only is it underwater when it does its flesh-hacking (I guess the ability to run underwater was another of its special features), but the one character that it is allowed to sink its teeth into turns up not dead at the end of the film. Disappointing, true, but I have to say that Texas Chainsaw III is one of the better TCM films. Not as good as the original, but as good as the first sequel and light years better than the third sequel.

WAYNE BELL who scored the original film, returns here & yet again manages to create a very eerie soundtrack, that is perhaps one of the best scores to ever grace a horror film. KIM HENKEL who co-wrote the original film returns as the director. Sadly Henkel has decided to re-stage several of the original films key moments & elements throughout the film, so much so, that the film comes off at times as almost a remake of the first film & Unlike the three previous films, Part 4's acting troupe is not all that great, In fact the only good actors here are a pre-fame MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY & RENEE ZELLWEGER, the rest of the cast is terrible, with both TYLER CONE & LISA NEWMEYER being the main ones. Newmeyer was clearly hired just for her looks obviously, she looks stunning & sexy, but is unable to convey any emotions of fear, depression, anger, worry etc. playing the air headed girlfriend of Barry (Cone) While Tyler is basically a blank sheet as her cheating, lying & cocky boyfriend. The hit & run victim who escapes the car should also burn his SAG card, as should the actor playing Jenny's date. Zellwager plays the role of Jenny well, a quiet, mousy, nerd girl who gets put down by Barry, the crazed Vilmer (McConaughey) & her lecherous stepfather, before standing up for herself at the end of the film. Henkel's failed attempts at bringing back the crazed characters of the first (the actors all turned him down), obviously never deterred him to change a few lines in the script. JOHN HARRISON plays W.E. (The name the cook character was given in the opening narration in Part 3 where it mentions his execution) the quote spouting loony, which runs the gas station & which Toni Perenski's Darla character keeps referring to as the Old Man & Old Fart which makes no sense, since W.E. is in his late twenties, early thirties. While McConaughey was clearly intended to be the Hitcher & has a remote controlled knee brace with W.E. mentioning how Vilmer was once run over by a truck (The fate the hitcher from the first film suffered) though how he was supposed to have survived after being run over by a transport truck is questionable. A lot of other things don't make sense as well, such as why the stranded teens run after W.E.'s truck after he refuses to stop & give them a ride, nor why they decide to go to his house in the woods. The Grandfather returns, all blue coloured, but the film never does specify on weather or not it's an actor pretending to be an old man, or if he's dead & came back to life, or what, it's just never mentioned. Leatherface this time is played by the late radio jock ROBERT JACKS. Jacks does good, but is unable to convey the powerful sense of dread that GUNNAR HANSEN brought to the role, in the 1974 original. One can't blame him though, since the Leatherface character here is radically different. A screaming, hopping, yelping, transvestite, that wouldn't scare a two year old & what's worse, he spends pretty much the whole movie dressed as woman. The dialogue is really bad & despite the title, no one is killed with a chainsaw. The film also pays tribute to ED GEIN, the psycho from Wisconsin, who inspired the films PSYCHO & the original TCM, when Leatherface puts on a full skin suit, a dress, wig & make-up (something Gein used to do) with a few stuffed corpses added here & there in the house (Another sick thing Gein did to his victims). Look fast for former WWE superstar\/turned action hero, Stone Cold Steve Austin's ex-wife Debra McMichael, playing a cop. In short Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation actually improves with repeated viewings & has many suspenseful moments here & there, but when it's all said & done it goes to show just how good a movie the first actually is. Henkel has some good ideas & I love the cameo's by MARILYN BURNS (Playing a catatonic Sally Hardesty), JIM DUGAN & PAUL PARTAIN, that he provides, but if only he had a better cast & gotten rid of his silly explanation of why the family does what they do & the fact that their not a real backwoods family, but a group of psycho's put there to work for a secret government organization is laughable. But it does explain why the police could never locate the farmhouse or get any key witnesses to back the survivors stories (such as the two truck drivers who save Sally at the end of the first, since one assumes they worked for the secret agency) As it is, it remains an okay horror item, but easily the weakest in the series. Which is a shame since the film has good momentum going in, before falling right apart midway into the film.

Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from The Three Lives of Thomasina) as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, My Fair Lady (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in Camelot on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. But I'm pregnant, she told him. No problem, he replied. I'll wait!And thus a Classic was born!A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her Lady costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.With songs both silly and sublime, seamless intermeshing of live performers and animation as only the Disney studio, at that time, was capable of, and the undeniable magnetism of Andrews and Van Dyke, it is nearly impossible NOT to like Mary Poppins!

I for one had mixed feelings about this movie. The first 15 minutes of film is just Harvey Keitel going around doing bad things. After that the nun is raped. So at this point I am thinking ok we know he is bad, we get the point now a plot will start. But that is exactly what didn't happen. Instead we are forced to carry on watching him do bad things and that is it. Another point is the lack of really bad things he does. All he really does is take drugs and steal things. The worst thing he did in the film was w**k over the two girls who he made to sexual things for him. And whats all this killer thing? At no point in the film does he kill anyone. It also seems (like most of Ferraras films) that keitel is the only character in the film and everyone else has such minor and unimportant roles. The only part the film where a plot was going on is the end in the church and the bus station. The good things about this film is the gritty realism of it. I also think Keitel is great in the role.

The film begins by asking us to care about a group of teens who leave their prom due to a couple having a fight and end up lost in the woods. This mere minutes after having driven away from their high school, which presumably resides in their hometown. Clearly they have not learned their way around much, but no matter. Before too long, they very soon find themselves running for their lives away from the famous freaky family, not only lost in their home town but, before long, also without their car. One of the biggest gripes that people have with this film (which is saying a lot, because there is nothing but stuff to gripe about) is that Leatherface seems to have become a transvestite. You can almost watch the transformation in the film, which seems to me to be sort of the result of trying to make Leatherface too complex. There is a point in the film where the trapped Jenny (Zellweger) tries to get Leatherface to help her escape, talking to him exactly like a psychiatrist would talk to a disturbed child.Come on, we know Leatherface is disturbed; I just don't understand why cross-dressing had to be added to his impressive list of deviations from the pattern of behaviors generally associated with reasonably well-adjusted people. On the other hand, Kim Henkel did co-write the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Tobe Hooper, and has thus been granted at least some right to tamper with the character. What you see in the movie, however, is a lot of tampering gone horribly, horribly wrong. If it ain't broken, as they say, don't fix it. You may end up making it worse.What is amazing to me is how far McConaughey and Zellweger have both come in spite of this film. As I was watching the film, I couldn't believe I was watching the same actor who had turned in such wonderful performances in movies like Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain, as well as another actor who displayed strong acting presence in movies like EdTV and U-571. Why the focus on Leatherface being a transvestite? Leatherface is a side character anyway, it is Vilmer (McConaughey) who is the star, which is sad because he plays such a belligerent, disgusting character. If you don't believe me that he's more the star than Leatherface, count how many people Leatherface, or anyone else, kills with a chainsaw in the movie (hint none).Vilmer is the new head of household in the backwoods family, working as a tow-truck driver\/reckless murderer and who has the fascinating addition of an electric leg that is operated by remote control. At one point, a high school kid pleads for help, then when he realizes Vilmer's one of the bad guys, he runs away from the truck (running straight down the street rather than into the woods to relative safety, of course), Vilmer gleefully chases him down, laughing and hooting and hollering all the while, and then runs him over five or six times before stashing his body on the back of the truck to later taunt one of his little friends with.As is to be expected, there is never any motive given behind any of the random killings, this is all just the sickening actions of an insane family in the woods, evidently comfortably separate from any sort of law enforcement or even the most tenuous interaction with greater civilization, waiting for unsuspecting teenagers to stumble into their midst. Interesting that the movie starts out as such a gigantic horror movie cliché, and still manages to go downhill from there.Horror movie sequels are first faced with the usually daunting task of justifying themselves. A horror movie sequel has to have a premise that gives it a reason for having been made, otherwise it is clearly a cash cow made to cash in on the success of the original film. Texas Chainsaw 4, instead, simply passes itself off as something of a remake of the original, rather than another sequel, and turns from the more plodding and slow-moving original to the mindless, completely over-the-top belligerence that you see here. The scenes at the house are peppered with stupid violence, at one point Vilmer throws Darla to the ground and steps on her neck with his powerful leg, nearly killing her by suffocation or by breaking her neck, clearly not caring which. Naturally, she gets up and complains that she could easily leave him and go back to her husband. Charming. Add cannibalism to the mix and you have a hilariously bad movie. Jenny spends much of the latter half of the movie trying to escape from the hungry hungry hicks, as we are constantly bombarded with the stupid, stupid characters and plot twists that the movie makes as it ineptly tries to combine the horror and comedy that even the most mildly competent horror film can display. This is exactly the kind of thing that really makes me wonder why, every time a new movie comes out in a certain series, I always go back and watch the whole series before watching it. I'm still working on The Friday the 13th movies, the Nightmares on Elm Street, and the Child's Play films, which are decidedly more fun than the Texas Chainsaws. And to make matters worse, I have heard nothing but bad things about the 2003 Texas Chainsaw. And given how right all the bad reviews of this movie are, that is certainly a sinking feeling.
