In Cape Fear Robert De Niro plays an ex-convict who is looking for revenge on the lawyer who could have gotten him out of jail earlier. Cape Fear is a movie that has been spoofed time and time again, most notably The Simpsons, and is a chilling thriller. Nick Nolte plays the lawyer and he struggles with problems in and outside his family while being stalked by his former client. The story is an interesting one as Max Cady, De Niro, is the bad guy but at the same time you sympathize for the guy and don't blame him for wanting revenge. Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, is an anti-hero. Anti-hero may not be the right word but it's the one I am using. In a way he is no better than Cady. He is a shady lawyer, he cheats on his wife, mistreats his daughter, and much more. He is the main character and the story is told from his perspective so you pity the man for being terrorized but at the same time you think he deserves it. It is a nice twist for a movie like this. This could have simply been a stalker movie about a creep harassing a family because he is crazy. Instead we get conflicting emotions for the main hero and villain. Now that is rare.The best part about this movie is its simplicity. If this movie was made today it would have an awful story back behind a lot of CGI and fake blood. This movie was made in 1991 and instead of using special effects to make the movie good it focused on the characters, the story, and the music. The music in this movie is bone chilling. I love the score to this film and it mixes in perfectly with every scene. The blaring trombone or whatever brass instrument was used was perfect. The acting on all parts, even the daughter, was great as well. De Niro was the star performer but everybody involved was fantastic. Robert De Niro is an incredible actor and I think this is one of his most underrated performances. Max Cady is a creepy villain and even his presence is scary. The best scene is with Cady and the fifteen year old Danielle. Danielle is the daughter of Bowden and the entire scene Cady seduces her and it was so believable. It was believable throughout the acting. I was scared sitting in my living room. The way Cady used his words was perfect and my eyes barely blinked until the scene was over. Danielle acted really dumb but watching it again I didn't blame her. This movie is far from perfect but I did enjoy it. There are scenes that are boring and some characters I didn't really care about but overall it was a good movie. I watched this when I was little and I didn't really know or understand what was going on. I watched it again in blu ray and I appreciated it more but I stand by what I originally thought as a kid. This was a very good movie and is underrated, but it is also forgettable. I forgot all about this movie until I saw it in a buy two get one free bin at Best Buy. I liked the movie but it isn't a groundbreaking classic. I walked away entertained and weirded out, but that's really it. I really wish this movie was better but it was missing something. There was a twist or another character missing. I loved the character complexity in almost every character. Cady was written and acted perfectly and I think Nick Nolte did his part as well. The wife bothered me but she wasn't a big part of the movie. She has issues with her husband and there is one intense scene but other than that she was in the background doing nothing. Cady affected each member of the family in some way before the big finale, except for the wife. He has many confrontations with Sam and the one with Danielle but nothing major with the wife. I could think of a few scenes that probably have been cut out and\/or replaced by better ones.Overall, Cape Fear is a very good time. You will walk away from this movie scared and freaked out. When this movie is good, its good, but when its bad, its bad. The movie slows down and is very long. I don't usually complain about length but in this case I was waiting for it to wrap up. I will probably watch this movie again because I do enjoy it but it will sit in my movie collection and be forgotten. It's really a shame because there are so many things I loved about this movie but it had that one missing link. Cape Fear is a solid movie and gets a solid High WillyT Recommendation.

Even when I lie.Brian DePalma's Scarface has become such a classic film over time and its main character (Al Pacino as Scarface) is such an iconic pop cultural figure that few people would believe that he was actually nominated for a Razzie for Worst Director in 1984. Scarface is yet another film that was perhaps misunderstood when it came out, but has built a solid cult following over time (it influenced a lot of rappers and hip hop artists during the 90's) and is recognized by the IMDb as one of the top 250 films. When it comes to gangster films this might not be as perfect as The Godfather I, II, or Goodfellas but it still ranks among the top 10 in the genre and it has become more popular over time. Despite having never seen the film in its entirety before, I was familiar with the ending. Everyone knows where the phrase Say hello to my little friend comes from despite never have seeing this film because the ending of Scarface is perhaps one of the best known scenes in cinema history. Scarface has so many memorable quotes that it's hard to choose one, and that is thanks to the great script written by Oliver Stone who loosely adapted it from a prior film. It is also such a memorable film thanks in most part to Al Pacino's masterful performance as Tony Montana. He has made so many great films in his career, but I think this character will always stand out a bit above the rest. For some critics his performance may be over the top, but I think he nailed it and that is why Montana has become such an iconic figure over time. There is something about him that has transcended time and cultures. It is an epic and ultra violent stylized film and that is why Al Pacino's over the top and loud performance worked so well. Scarface is about 170 minutes long but it never ceases to entertain for a second.During the Mariel harbor opening in Cuba more than 100,000 Cuban refugees were sent to the United States, one of those refugees happened to be communist hating ex military Tony Montana (Al Pacino). He has big dreams and high ambitions but upon his arrival he has to start off low. He and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) begin washing dishes when they are contacted by Omar Suarez (Murray Abraham) to make a business deal with some dangerous Colombians involving some drugs and money. Tony and Manny survive their mission and Omar introduces them to his boss, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), a drug kingpin in Miami, who hires their services. Frank has it all a big mansion, nice cars, and a beautiful wife named Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer); everything that Tony dreams of having in this new country. Tony is convinced that he will not stop until he gets what he wants and in doing so helping his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) with whom he had been separated during his prison stint in Cuba. The only problem is that he will have to make a lot of enemies on the way to the top.I really don't know what DePalma's true intentions were for Scarface. I don't believe he was trying to glorify Scarface because he was portrayed in a dark and negative light, but over time he has become sort of a role model for some people. Perhaps Al Pacino's performance was so strong that it made it easy for audience's to relate to this ambitious character. DePalma was able to make the audience care for this unstable and explosive character. On the one hand he refused to kill women and kids, but on the other he was able to kill his best friend without hesitation. Scarface does seem to walk a fine line between glorifying the character and showing how destructive ambition and excesses can be. This bleak mood set in the film can be seen through Pfeiffer's character, someone who has it all but seems completely unhappy with life. Even Tony himself once he achieves his goals seems to lose himself completely by these excesses. He hates seeing his sister with other men involved in the same business because he knows how ugly this life is. That is why I think DePalma was never trying to portray Scarface in a glorifying light, but over time his character has become admired by worldwide audiences. The film has a lot to say about ambition, loyalty, and betrayal, but above all it is a stylized ultra violent film that lacks the technical achievements that The Godfather had. It still remains as one of the great gangster and immigrant films of the 80's.

Even when I lie.Brian DePalma's Scarface has become such a classic film over time and its main character (Al Pacino as Scarface) is such an iconic pop cultural figure that few people would believe that he was actually nominated for a Razzie for Worst Director in 1984. Scarface is yet another film that was perhaps misunderstood when it came out, but has built a solid cult following over time (it influenced a lot of rappers and hip hop artists during the 90's) and is recognized by the IMDb as one of the top 250 films. When it comes to gangster films this might not be as perfect as The Godfather I, II, or Goodfellas but it still ranks among the top 10 in the genre and it has become more popular over time. Despite having never seen the film in its entirety before, I was familiar with the ending. Everyone knows where the phrase Say hello to my little friend comes from despite never have seeing this film because the ending of Scarface is perhaps one of the best known scenes in cinema history. Scarface has so many memorable quotes that it's hard to choose one, and that is thanks to the great script written by Oliver Stone who loosely adapted it from a prior film. It is also such a memorable film thanks in most part to Al Pacino's masterful performance as Tony Montana. He has made so many great films in his career, but I think this character will always stand out a bit above the rest. For some critics his performance may be over the top, but I think he nailed it and that is why Montana has become such an iconic figure over time. There is something about him that has transcended time and cultures. It is an epic and ultra violent stylized film and that is why Al Pacino's over the top and loud performance worked so well. Scarface is about 170 minutes long but it never ceases to entertain for a second.During the Mariel harbor opening in Cuba more than 100,000 Cuban refugees were sent to the United States, one of those refugees happened to be communist hating ex military Tony Montana (Al Pacino). He has big dreams and high ambitions but upon his arrival he has to start off low. He and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) begin washing dishes when they are contacted by Omar Suarez (Murray Abraham) to make a business deal with some dangerous Colombians involving some drugs and money.

He then gets back at all the people that bullied him, and criminals, for the most part.This film is pretty graphic, you see a lot of peoples organs being torn out, and you hear a lot of crunching noises.

Would I recommend it? Not entirely, because it's very poorly made, but if you want to laugh a little bit, go for it.

But the acting in the movie is great. I have this idea in my head of Al Franken as this gruff, intense comedic force but here he's so soft-spoken and calm so you gotta hand it to him, the guy is COMMITTED. Laura San Giacomo is also excellent and has a heartbreaking little speech. And Vincent D'Onofrio as the pothead slacker brother is good stuff. I don't know. Not sure how I altogether feel about it.
