[{"date":"2 February 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek is one of those movies that looks like just another kids' movie, but is really intended for adults. Shrek has a great cast including Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as Lord Farquad. Shrek has very stunning animation, brilliant humor(even some humor for adults that kids won't pick up on), and an involving storyline. Everything about Shrek is some kind of reference to a fairy tale, but there's also plenty of references to modern day movies that anyone could pick up on. Shrek was a great break through in animated movies.(Spoilers) The story follows an ogre who seems happy with his life, but is really a lonely spirit and is in need of someone to be with him. One day he befriends a chatterbox donkey, who won't leave him alone. That night, a bunch of fairy tale creatures also show up in Shrek's swamp seeking a home and a place to stay, because the evil Lord Farquad forced them there. Shrek goes on a trip to Lord Farquad's castle, along with Donkey as his guide, so that he can make Lord Farquad send the fairy tale creatures go back to their homes. After getting to his castle and getting involved in and winning a WWF type of tournament, Farquad makes a deal with him, and sends Shrek on a quest to save Princess Fiona from a tower guarded by a dragon. If he completes this, he will get his swamp back.This movie takes all of the fairy tale formulas and messes around with them, creating what was described as a fractured fairy tale. There are several references to recent movies, and in some ways, the beginning of the movie reminds me very much of the beginning of The Hobit. Around the middle, the plot reminds me of the plot in The Big Lebowski. And of course, there are several references to Indiana Jones, The Matrix, and I could go on forever, but if you want a better idea, then watch the movie.This looks like a kids movie, but in some ways I think that this was intended more for teens and adults. Kids can still enjoy the bright animation, and there is kid friendly humor. This is what I think of as a real family movies. I think that genre has been defined the wrong way, because every time you see something that is considered to be a family movie, it's intended for kids eight and under. That is what you would call a children's movie, a family movie is something that even the adults and teenagers will be able to watch and enjoy.If you somehow missed this during its years that it has been around for, then see it now. And you can watch it some night, with everyone around the television.
