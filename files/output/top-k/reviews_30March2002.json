Many critics saw it as a film to tare apart the fashion industry and then they thought the film had not accomplished his goal. I think this film is a comedy masterpiece because it has a not very original plot, a simple man destroys an international plot to assassin the prime minister, but its worked out fine. In this movie Ben Stiller plays Zoolander a stupidly goodlooking and stupid male supermodel in the end of his carreer because he s too old (30, lol), and there s a new  male supermodel Hansel( Owen Wilson ) who beats Zoolander not because he is more goodlooking or better model but because in a personal contest he can take out his panties without taking his trousers off and Zoolander cant(who would thought of that? A genius i think). Comedy scenes in this movie are very well inserted in the plot not breaking the movie into pieces.

It got some real bad critics and when I watched Chasing Amy, my thoughts on that one wereMan, he learned something from the bad critics and now he's making some REAL movies! He's gonna be the next Woody Allen!. Next came Dogma. When I first saw it, I found it too trashy and maybe Smith is someone that can't handle big loads of money being available. Then I saw it a second time and...yes, it has a lot of good thoughts on religion and there really is a message in it(though it could be some more subtle).It was not as funny as the other ones, but it had a message, some good ideas and I finally found my idea of what the Kevin-Smith-style is in it. Then I REALLY waited on Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back with pleasant anticipation also because I read how many stars would be in it. The movie started pretty nice with the Randall-and-Dante-insider-jokes but then came Jay's a** and fart. I mean this is not classy, this is not funny at all and somehow it's even a little disgusting. Do you remember the chocolate-covered-bretzel-scene in Mallrats? I really hated this scene! Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back has a whole LOTTA these scenes where it is no longer talked in a funny way about those things but some of it is shown or heard and everybody in the audience is(maybe not even aware) torn between being disgusted and laughing out loudly. In my brain either both sides cancel each other off or I'm disgusted. Maybe this works different with YOUR brain... I have no problems with troma films, they are tasteless because they WANT to be tasteless, but Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back is tasteless because it doesn't know where taste ends and tastelessness begins!!! Another example for Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back crossing the line You can't make a L.A. crack-dealer a good ol' friend of Jay! It's CRACK man, no longer weed, CRACK! This is NOT OK!

I never thought that the original needed remaking, nor that it could be bettered (the twist ending, along with the Usual Suspects, is one of the best I have EVER seen), but nevertheless, I thought that, if anyone, Burton could put his own fresh, dark spin on the idea. However, the whole thing gave an impression of a Burton being constricted by studio bosses hungry to chock up another Summer hit by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink- check out the extras-filled DVD if ya don't believe me.  Nice idea, wrong director. Burton is unparalleled for his alternative-style movies like the classic Edward Scissorhands. Here it felt like he was on a leash, his creativity tragically stunted.The make-up effects weren't much of an improvement on those of 1968, which only serves to highlight the superiority of the original. The acting, well, apart from those who were struggling under their ape-suits(Roth,Bonham-Carter,Clarke-Duncan), was poor- I agree with another reviewer who said that Wahlberg wasn't yet strong enough to carry off an action lead, and as for Estella Warren, well, I think we all know that she was only there to provide some Raquel Welch-style eye candy. The music,from the always dependable Elfman,was superb. The ending lets face it, it was always going to be compared to the original's which, if not impossible, would be pretty damned hard to better. The ending to Burton's felt silly and tacked on,and smacked of  an overall air of please, be shocked! whereas it actually only left punters scratching their heads and looking for refunds.If you're curious, wait until the video rental price drops down. If not a Burton or sci-fi fan steer well clear.

I never thought that the original needed remaking, nor that it could be bettered (the twist ending, along with the Usual Suspects, is one of the best I have EVER seen), but nevertheless, I thought that, if anyone, Burton could put his own fresh, dark spin on the idea. However, the whole thing gave an impression of a Burton being constricted by studio bosses hungry to chock up another Summer hit by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink- check out the extras-filled DVD if ya don't believe me.

I cannot possible imagine how he will ever be able to top this movie.  But, I pray he does. He seems, with every movie he has released, to improved on aspects from the one before. Se7en was much better than Alien3, The Game, though not better in my opinion, showed him experimenting and trying to make it better.  Fight Club was a major improvement cinematography wise(and to some, plot wise) from all predecessor's, and now, Panic Room, in my opinion, has topped them all in every aspect.

In the end, you sense that they are just incoherent and stupid, thus you dislike them. Donnie Darko confused the hell out of me and I loved it! I like the music, the cinematography, the performances, the direction, everything. The movie challenges you and you don't mind, because you know that there is a greater meaning there. Unlike the typical David Lynch garbage.I understand that this was the first film made by this director and I believe that. I have always felt that Directors tend to have all of their heart and soul into that first film, usually because they have been writing and modifying it their whole lives. They hold on to it and refuse to let anybody else have it, like a first child. I know that was true with Singleton's Boyz n the Hood and Anderson's Boogie Nights.Be advised that this film is confusing and you might have to watch it a few times, ala Memento. Moreover, don't be shocked when you find yourself picking up new things each time and enjoying it even more. However, don't think that this will help clarify matters, it hasn't helped me much. But I still love it! Don't get me wrong, I understood about 95% of the film, however the very last 5% just put me in a tailspin.The story deals with every aspect of genre. There is romance, horror, drama, comedy, mystery and science fiction. I guess what I respect so much about the film is just how much thought and effort went in to it. It is a very ambitious movie. Which begs the question, why was it not a bigger hit?I will watch it again and someday, possibly understand it fully. Well, I did understand most of it and then the ending just threw me. Oh well, the answers are out there and I will keep looking for them, and enjoy doing so. **** out of ****.

I like the music, the cinematography, the performances, the direction, everything. The movie challenges you and you don't mind, because you know that there is a greater meaning there. Unlike the typical David Lynch garbage.I understand that this was the first film made by this director and I believe that. I have always felt that Directors tend to have all of their heart and soul into that first film, usually because they have been writing and modifying it their whole lives. They hold on to it and refuse to let anybody else have it, like a first child. I know that was true with Singleton's Boyz n the Hood and Anderson's Boogie Nights.Be advised that this film is confusing and you might have to watch it a few times, ala Memento.
