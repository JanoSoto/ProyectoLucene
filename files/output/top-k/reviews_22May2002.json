Not only had I been entertained but A Clockwork Orange had really given me a lot to think about.I am reluctant to give away too many details about this film. I am sure that a lot of people know the basic story but watch for yourself and you will be watching a cinematic masterpiece. It is very violent at times and very disturbing and I wouldn't recommend it as a film to watch if you're going on a date.(SPOILERS AHEAD)It is a film that really makes you think. Malcom McDowell plays perhaps one of his best parts as Alex, the leader of a psychotic gang who go round committing heinous acts such as sexual assault, murder and violence. In the middle of the film Alex is sent to prison and is subjected to a radical new treatment which rids him of any violent or sexual urges. He leaves prison and finds he cannot integrate into the world he left. He also feels sick whenever he tries to engage in any violent or sexual acts.This is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by viewers but can also give them something to think about. When Alex leaves prison he cannot do what he wants.The treatment he endured in prison has robbed him of one very important thing-freedom. Violence and sexual assault may be wrong and cannot be justified but I think this film is saying that in life people should have the freedom to do what they want-even if it is bad. If a person cannot do what they want-however bad it may be-then really they are not a person. Their humanity is gone and they are reduced to the level of a robot in society. I guess the film is saying that true freedom is being able to choose what you do in life-no matter whether it is good,bad or indifferent.That was my interpretation when I saw the film many years ago. I don't usually analyze a film in the way I have for this movie but it certainly is an intriguing movie. Highly recommended.

For to view Don't Look Now without the context of its shattering, stunning ending is to stop listening to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds before I Just Wasn't Made For These Times and Caroline, No. To bluntly try and explain what sort of film this is, well... let me say that those who have seen The Wicker Man, Picnic at Hanging Rock or Performance will notice, despite the vast differences in social and actual settings, that these four films have in common a mastery of accumulating tension and atmosphere. Performance is indeed partly made by Nic Roeg, the visual genius, some say charlatan (but not me) who directs Don't Look Now. Performance is more consistently visceral in its impact, and the contrast of the two halves is remarkable, but that's another story. Don't Look Now is in many ways a less abstract and visually bombarding picture than Performance, but that's not to say there aren't oblique visual images at many turns. The spectre of Pinter, that interestingly hangs over both halves of Performance, is evident here to some extent. Note the tension of dialogue and body language in the cafe scene here, and also later in the film when Sutherland's John Baxter consults Bruno Cattaneo's odd, inscrutable Detective Sabbione. It is indeed a fine script, brought up to a remarkable level of subtlety by the vivid, artistic direction.I must say the acting is inch perfect here for the film. Donald Sutherland just looks so right for the part, and lets the audience get a very good sense of his emotions. Julie Christie gives an autumnal, particularly nuanced performance that belies those who question her worth as an actress. Perhaps out of the decade where she was an icon, she was able to give more divergent performances. She was fine in Billy Liar! with the role that perhaps established her vivacious, metropolitan type, and while I've heard some of her roles aren't great in other 60s films, Petulia sounds most interesting. Anyway, Christie is Laura Baxter here, a mature married woman, seemingly calm on the surface but inwardly shattered. It is a great tragic role, and she plays on the resignation as much as the logical madness of the character. Plus, of course, she's absolutely beautiful, and not as that Dane Hamlet oddly once said of Ophelia, beautified - her beauty comes across as intensely natural. The two sisters are especially sinister creations, visually unsettling and an odd mix of good old British cup of tea reassurance and something far more ominous and undisclosed.The ending, with the tangible symbolic link to earlier events, is a truly shattering moment, and I must not spoil it in any way. Suffice to say, Roeg makes it synthesize superbly. His direction is a deliberate mixture of abrupt, near subliminal editing and montage, with more slow, stationary ominous shots - for example the scenes centering on the boats. Venice, is as many have said, a character in itself in the film, its beauty inflected by an autumnal decay and deathly stasis. The sex scene between Sutherland and Christie is pure beauty, excellent music and editing; it brilliantly represents what is a loving relationship, and becomes all the more melancholy in contrast to the film's dark events and hints at events. Pino Donaggio's music is fitting overall, really, if not as astounding as the cinematography and direction - perhaps something a little more jarring than the Italianate strings would have proved more apposite, though the music itself is good and fairly fitting.I would have to remark that many may not take to this film; it is far from an easy film to stomach, but making the effort, you can get an extraordinary amount out of it. Certainly a uniquely unsettling, very adult film, imbued with subtle brilliance; likely to stay with you for a long while...Rating- **** 1\/2\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"22 May 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I think the commentator below is being remarkably unfair to this film, considering he\/she readily admits they turned off 3\/4 of the way through.

The movie is about high school students, but aside from a few stereotypes (the popular star athlete, the nerdy bitter kid, etc.) it has more substance than style. In that way, I found it to be a very ambitious film.  What it is trying to accomplish; a well-done Shakespeare update, is a weighty task.  It succeeds in some ways and fails in others, but overall is a movie worth seeing.Josh Hartnett turns in a good performance as Hugo, who is very jealous of the star basketball player preferred by his own father as well as the rest of the school's population, Odin (played well by Mekhi Phifer).  Hugo goes on to easily manipulate others on his way to destroying Odin's world altogether.  The ending is tragic and leaves no main character untouched as it all comes to a climax.The main flaws are the script itself and the length of the film.  Julia Stiles' character (Desi Brable, Odin's girlfriend) is not well-defined, nor is her and Odin's relationship.  We don't get an idea that these two would have such strong feelings for each other.  The movie could have done with more length in this area.  It runs at a paltry 90 minutes, a little extra time building the relationship between Odin and Desi, as well as showing more of Odin's close relationship with the coach (Hugo's father) wouldn't have hurt at all.  Especially considering those two relationships are the basis for the entire story.That said, given that Hugo's whole reason for flipping out like he does is jealousy, much of it over his father's preference for Odin over him, we don't see enough evidence of his father and Odin even having a close relationship to actually make this seem viable.  And when Hugo says later that much of his anger is over him not winning the team's MVP award, it seems ridiculous.  After all, Hugo doesn't come across as crazy, just disturbed and jealous.  And only a crazy person would want to screw up someone's life that badly over a stupid MVP award.The manipulations and the film's stunning conclusion are very well done; but unfortunately they lose weight because we aren't allowed to learn enough about the characters to care, and we don't see exactly why Hugo was so hell-bent on destroying Odin anyway.  Overall it's a film that should be respected for what it tries to do, even though it doesn't totally accomplish it.  7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 May 2002","score":"","review":"  This film, all an updated-for-the-times remake of Shakespeare's Othello, surprised me in that it does not fall into the Teen Movie genre that it appeared it easily could from the trailers I had seen for it.

It succeeds in some ways and fails in others, but overall is a movie worth seeing.Josh Hartnett turns in a good performance as Hugo, who is very jealous of the star basketball player preferred by his own father as well as the rest of the school's population, Odin (played well by Mekhi Phifer).  Hugo goes on to easily manipulate others on his way to destroying Odin's world altogether.  The ending is tragic and leaves no main character untouched as it all comes to a climax.The main flaws are the script itself and the length of the film.  Julia Stiles' character (Desi Brable, Odin's girlfriend) is not well-defined, nor is her and Odin's relationship.  We don't get an idea that these two would have such strong feelings for each other.  The movie could have done with more length in this area.  It runs at a paltry 90 minutes, a little extra time building the relationship between Odin and Desi, as well as showing more of Odin's close relationship with the coach (Hugo's father) wouldn't have hurt at all.  Especially considering those two relationships are the basis for the entire story.That said, given that Hugo's whole reason for flipping out like he does is jealousy, much of it over his father's preference for Odin over him, we don't see enough evidence of his father and Odin even having a close relationship to actually make this seem viable.  And when Hugo says later that much of his anger is over him not winning the team's MVP award, it seems ridiculous.  After all, Hugo doesn't come across as crazy, just disturbed and jealous.  And only a crazy person would want to screw up someone's life that badly over a stupid MVP award.The manipulations and the film's stunning conclusion are very well done; but unfortunately they lose weight because we aren't allowed to learn enough about the characters to care, and we don't see exactly why Hugo was so hell-bent on destroying Odin anyway.  Overall it's a film that should be respected for what it tries to do, even though it doesn't totally accomplish it.  7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"22 May 2002","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers herein.Opening scenes are seductions, promises.

To me the most interesting element in the film was Ryan Gosling and his hypnotic performance; I don't believe I have seen an actor move quite so well since Brad Pitt in Thelma and Louise.  It is obvious how the class nerd would be drawn to him, to want to be like him, and to relish their association beyond the point of all reason.  This is pretty typical high school, popularity stuff, which, I believe, is worth psychologically exploring to the depths, but which was not done here. Fortunately, in real life, this does not routinely lead to grisly murder.  The Sandra Bullock character sub-plot also involved the same issue, where about her ex-husband, she said, He was the most beautiful guy I had ever seen, which explains her own helpless involvement with the dance of a cobra.  Even her male partner contains elements of the treacherous male, as it was made abundantly clear that he had formerly been a vice cop, those members of the police force who use, essentially, their beauty and sexual attractiveness to entrap perpetrators of victimless crimes.  To my reckoning, vice cops are a poison on the police force--whether their target is female prostitutes or male cruisers--a hold-over from more puritan values where the area they infiltrate is none of their business and whose whole operation might be put to better use, if they must, infiltrating organized crime operations al la Donnie Brasco.Perhaps even more interesting than the Michael Pitt character's attraction to the Ryan Gosling character, was the Ryan Gosling character's attraction to the Michael Pitt character, which bordered upon the sexual, although for psychologically stunted characters like these I would never identify them with something as psychologically mature as a sexual orientation.  These people operate in a shadow land of indescriminate physical desires.This film, to be sure, is populated by attractive females, the Sandra Bullock character, of course, and notably, the high school girl Goldilocks whose beauty amazed me and was shown for a disappointingly short period time...but here every female was a victim of her attraction to a poisonous male.  The story is definitely about MALE sexual power, not female, which I think is an interesting twist.All in all, I feel that this film took a step into new ground, which I would expect for a film directed by Barbet Shroeder, a director I admire immensely.

There's the serious critics who scorn it, and the star wars fans who love it. With me being a Star Wars nut I thought i would love it, but couldn't shake off the feeling that it would underwhelm me as Episode One did. Thankfully i thought the film was absolutely brilliant.The best things about it were the supreme special effects, the excellent jedi battle\/war towards the end and Yoda kicking ass. I should also mention John Williams breathtaking score. George Lucas has done a good job of keeping everything tense, with action thankfully breaking up the love scenes between Padme and Anakin.

Not Georges Guetary, who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un-French. Not Leslie Caron, who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me.No, it would definitely be Gene Kelly. There's something about his screen persona that's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in Paris, content to put off facing the critics indefinitely, frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets. That's what made him so effective in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and other movies where he played ambitious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan is in some ways a cousin to Tommy Albright in BRIGADOON, another Lerner story with Kelly miscast as an American at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque European place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues.Except that Jerry isn't as likeable as even poor dazed Tommy. That's another galling thing about this film. Jerry is sometimes a cad to Milo, and even worse to Lise. When he first sees the latter at a club, he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him. When she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number. When he calls her the next day she hangs up on him, which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace. And throughout all this it's obvious she wants NOTHING to do with him. When she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop, it's about as believable as Milo's interest in his paintings. Sure he's good-looking and playful, but why should that sway her when she's got Henri, who seems like a gentleman to boot?Admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress. If a role like Lise was played by, say, Judy Garland, she would shower Jerry with indignant insults and glares. If she was played by Cyd Charisse, one would admire his guts. But when she's played by first-timer Leslie Caron she looks and acts like a shy, vulnerable teenager, and as a result Jerry just seems like a creep. And why DID they choose these other actors (though personally I'd rather they'd solved things by changing the lead) when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people? Not only is Gene Kelly a few years above Guetary and Foch, he's old enough to be Caron's father.In short I think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic-relief type dancer as Jerry, the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles...e.g. Ray MacDonald in GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van in SMALL TOWN GIRL. Maybe not them necessarily but someone LIKE them. Someone who could have chased Lise and made it seem harmlessly playful; someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that Chaplinesque hole-in-the-wall; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with Oscar Levant's sarcastic grumpiness. It probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous. And it might have provided a voice that could sing Gershwin better.All this may give the impression that I don't like Gene Kelly. I do like him. He was terrific in most of his films, just not this one (well, and a few others). I don't despise AAIP itself, either; it has good points, like the art direction. And Leslie Caron, who despite her inexperience is rather charming, and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting. Georges Guetary does a fine job and his Stairway to Paradise is my favorite number in the movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with SOMEBODY. But not Jerry Mulligan.

Being as such, the movie has been unfairly prosecuted by film critics, which in turn has turned into a negative media spin that develops into bias in the subconscious minds of the average moviegoer.There is a definite double standard when it comes to the Star Wars franchise. Most critics are quick to talk about the quality of acting involved. Somewhere along the line, the acting in the original trilogy must have went from mediocre to academy award quality in the minds of movie critics. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, but the quality of acting was never a big selling point on any of the original three movies. However, since Episode I, people have been disappointed with the dialogue and overall tone of the performance by the actors involved. To start with, the dialogue isn't any worse than the words spoken in the original trilogy. And as far as the acting goes, the main characters involved in this movie (as well as Episode I) are Jedi Knights. And if we've learned anything from The Empire Strikes Back, a Jedi is at his best when he or she is without anger, fear or aggression. Since that is the condition that Samuel L. Jackson must shape his performance around, why were people expecting him to be the Jedi version of Jules from Pulp Fiction?As far as Hayden Christiansen's performance goes, I didn't think he was any worse than Mark Hamil in the original Star Wars. Of course he was whiny. He was supposed to be. He plays a 19 year old young man that is beginning to realize his talent and potential; who feels that he is being held back from using his skills. If this were a movie about football or basketball, his character would be a perfect fit. However, since people already know going into the movie that he eventually becomes one of the most ruthless villains on the silver screen, they don't accept this performance as being realistic.Most reviews also harshly criticize the conversion of Yoda from puppet to computer generated character. So, let me get this straight, a static puppet is preferred over the shaven muppet we saw in Episode I? I thought that the digital Yoda was an improvement on the character and it allowed him to be an even bigger part of the action and the story. The facial expressions were more telling and they were able to effectively portray his frustrations with the events surrounding him.As far as everything else goes, this movie was more exciting than The Matrix and more fun that Lord of the Rings. By the way, no one seems to criticize the use of an overabundance special effects in those films (when did people get anti-special effects anyway?). If this is science FICTION then why do people have a problem with Lucas and his digital creations? I could understand if this were Shakespeare In Love Episode II - Attack Of The Bard. There is a difference between a period piece set A Long Time Ago and a fantasy film set A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away (that last part makes a difference).I liked the movie. I had fun. It didn't change my life, but people are acting as if they were expecting to leave the theater and re-evaluate their place in the world. If you haven't seen it yet, go in with an open mind and judge for yourself. It's only a movie. The ticket for Star Wars will be the exact same price as the ticket for Undercover Brother. Please, keep it all in perspective. I don't care if you like it or not. I've already seen it and I enjoyed it. Not everyone will.

For me, I felt the dread and fatigue that was pushing through Al Pacino's character as the film dragged on.

As for Robin William's character, he made me feel like he was an innocent man at times. His explanation about how he had committed murder seemed almost like it really was an accident.

The action scenes were very good and the special affects were first rate.  Everything fit very nicely with the other films.  It was very obvious that Lucas has taken great pains to make sure the film fit with the rest and did not contradict the each other.  This made the film very enjoyable.  If you are a stickler for detail, I would advise that you see all of the other Star War's movies again before you see this one and concentrate on the small things.  There are a lot of little hints here and there that you may not pick up if you don't have the other films fresh in your mind. The acting generally very good.  McGregor was excellent and he looks much older and wiser with the beard.  Portman is also good and she carriers her strong willed character well.  Jackson is very good as the thoughtful and wise Master Windu.  He and Yoda make it very clear they are the primary thinkers and decision makers of the Jedi council.  Christain plays the older and rather wild Skywalker.  He plays the emotional Jedi student well.  The character I was very pleased to see introduced was Lee's character of Count Dooku\/Darth Tyranus.  I really enjoyed his character of the strong and charismatic evil leader.  The only part of the moive I did not like was the writing of the love story.  I know it was required to make this movie fit but I thought it dragged some.WARNING!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!I don't want to give the film away but I will give you a brief summary of what this film does.  Of course, this shows how Skywalker and Amadala fall in love, but it also shows how Skywalker starts down the path to the dark side.  The film also shows the beginnings of a rift between the Jedi council and the Senate.  As I said in the title, there is a historical parallel here.  Well, I did not realize it until the end of the film where it shows how Palpatine starts consolidated his power.  It reminded me of what happened in Germany in the 1930's.  A leader who uses a catalyst to get people to put him in a position of absolute power.

I still remember it, though - it blew me away. Subsequently ESB and ROTJ equally floored me - the gap between ESB and ROTJ felt like the longest three years in history. It was great. Looking back with a critic's eyes, it's easy to see how ESB was possibly the best of the original trilogy and ROTJ the worst, but back then, ROTJ seemed the perfect ending - I was still young, bear in mind.The next 'installment' came as the special editions of this trilogy. Unlike a lot of people, I welcomed these 'improvements'. They didn't detract from the story, and were necessary to fit in with the forthcoming 'new' trilogy. I had high hopes for the future.My anticipation for TPM was very high - unprovoked by any reviews or details about the film, I saw it on it's opening night. It blew me away - certain elements were annoying, but not as many as some people may have thought. They were- Anakin's Yippee in Watto's shop - The old lady (is her name 'Jira'?) who tells Anakin there's a storm coming up - Amidala's 'Queen' voice - Jar Jar BinksNothing more presented itself at the time of the first viewing. True, more criticism over the script emerged, but at this time those were about it.However, the main thing about TPM (and I can now say this after dozens of viewings, is that it felt like a Star Wars film.The same, unfortunately, I will never be able to say about AOTC. I have only seen it once and want to see it at least three times before I reveal my final opinion. The sad truth is, though, that it's unlikely to change. Some of the things I hated about it, is what most of you have said you liked the most, so here goes.- Coruscant speeder chase. Staying withing the speeders would have been good - falling fearless those kinds of distances took any suspension of disbelief out of me. It couldn't be believed, and that was that.- Over extended relationship between Anakin and Padme. No-one apart from a liar can say the acting (and chemistry) between Christiensen and Portman was awful. Not only this, but it was painful to watch. Also, did anyone notice one cut back to the meadow picnic scene - the movement of the camera, the scenery and the mise-en-scene of Padme's dress and composition lent itself exactly to 'The Sound Of Music'. Could it be that I could see that instantly on my first viewing (and never having seen ANY part of 'The Sound Of Music' other than the intro) and yet the entire team at Lucasfilm allowed it to make the final cut.- Pace. Another thing that was immediately apparent was how the pace of the film differed to all four of its predecessors. From this I was able to deduce that it wasn't TPM and AOTC that stood out from the original series, but that AOTC stood out from TPM AND the original series. When Anakin and Padme are about to leave Coruscant, we are also desperate to go. We are so bored of it by the time we go, that we are even more frustrated to find that, now we've left, we want to go back, because what awaits is even more tedious, i.e. Naboo and the aforementioned romance.- Yoda. Everyone who says he looks more realistic\/better is also a liar. If Lucas was going to rejuvinate Yoda, why didn't he do it for TPM. People would have accepted a CGI Yoda then, because of the wait since the original trilogy. But now, a Yoda fitter than ever. A side never seen before, in both the original trilogy NOR TPM. He looked too diferrent to fit in with the other versions of him. And then the worst of it - Yoda fighting.explanation In ESB, Yoda tells Luke For 800 years have I taught Jedi and then in ROTJ, Yoda tells Luke When 900 years you reach, look as good you will not. This proves that Yoda was aged, say, 100 years of age when he began teaching Jedi. If we presume his species decline in faculties between 75% and 90% onwards of their lifetime, then Yoda would have been well into old-age before the events of TPM took place. Bear in mind AOTC is 30 years even further down the time-line. How, then, bar some illness (as we see no sign of injury, and Yoda ALWAYS has his stick) can Yoda be so fit as to be the leader of all Jedi in AOTC yet seemingly lifeless BEFORE and AFTER these events.Getting back to what I was saying, Yoda fighting. Anyone who says it looks anything other than absurd is lying. Special effects are ALWAYS good to watch, but are they always pertinent?- End Battles. What happened to the juxtaposition of different locations so prevelant in the other movies (YES, including TPM)? Earlier on in the film, when Obi-Wan reaches Geonosis, you have simulatenously Anakin searching for his mother on Tattoine with VERY SIMILAR landscapes\/times of day (why must night be night everywhere, when it's different planets we're talking about?). At then end of the movie, though, CGI takes control 100%. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the CGI was the best I've ever seen, anywhere. It will be revered as the 'Jurassic Park' of the 21st Century. But somewhere along the line (a line followed, pretty well, by TPM) Lucas has seemed to have forgotten that these events are meant to have taken place BEFORE the original trilogy. There's little or no evidence of that now, other than the evolution of the Anakin-Vader character. Why, for example, are the Death Star plans 3D, as they were in ROTJ. In ANH they are only shown in monochromatic 2D format. How can technology evolve, de-evolve and then evolve again? The battle sequences, although amazing to behold, serve nothing other than to confuse. Too many things happen at once, and we don't have that expectation of a key scene that we used to look forward to. Even in TPM there are moments of calm within the storm - remember when the Jedis were seperated by the force-walls? Remember when Anakin crashed inside the TF Control Ship? The pause before he destroyed the reactor (which again, a perfect observation, were a miniature version of the kind later to be found in ROTJ). No such observations were to be found in AOTC. The Death Star pay-off was poor at best, and poorly timed also.In short, you will go and see it and remain captivated BECAUSE- It's a STAR WARS movie, at the end of the day. - The CGI is amazing. - You will want to see how the story unfolds.But you SHOULD hate the fact that- The acting is AWFUL. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson (and possibly Ian McDiarmid) are the only ones worth watching. - The pace of the film is AWFUL. - The relationship between Anakin and Padme is TEDIOUS. - A lot of the CGI was UNNECESSARY and seemingly EXPERIMENTAL.I could go on and on. Remember people, it is OUR generation that are the DIE-HARD fans. These newcomers who threaten physical violence, per se, to those who don't believe that AOTC doesn't BATTER the original trilogy, were brought up on Pokemon. They know no better. It's basically how Yoda percieved Luke and vice-versa in ESB. Neither thought the other was 'cool'.

It couldn't be believed, and that was that.- Over extended relationship between Anakin and Padme. No-one apart from a liar can say the acting (and chemistry) between Christiensen and Portman was awful. Not only this, but it was painful to watch. Also, did anyone notice one cut back to the meadow picnic scene - the movement of the camera, the scenery and the mise-en-scene of Padme's dress and composition lent itself exactly to 'The Sound Of Music'. Could it be that I could see that instantly on my first viewing (and never having seen ANY part of 'The Sound Of Music' other than the intro) and yet the entire team at Lucasfilm allowed it to make the final cut.- Pace. Another thing that was immediately apparent was how the pace of the film differed to all four of its predecessors. From this I was able to deduce that it wasn't TPM and AOTC that stood out from the original series, but that AOTC stood out from TPM AND the original series. When Anakin and Padme are about to leave Coruscant, we are also desperate to go. We are so bored of it by the time we go, that we are even more frustrated to find that, now we've left, we want to go back, because what awaits is even more tedious, i.e. Naboo and the aforementioned romance.- Yoda. Everyone who says he looks more realistic\/better is also a liar. If Lucas was going to rejuvinate Yoda, why didn't he do it for TPM. People would have accepted a CGI Yoda then, because of the wait since the original trilogy. But now, a Yoda fitter than ever. A side never seen before, in both the original trilogy NOR TPM. He looked too diferrent to fit in with the other versions of him. And then the worst of it - Yoda fighting.explanation In ESB, Yoda tells Luke For 800 years have I taught Jedi and then in ROTJ, Yoda tells Luke When 900 years you reach, look as good you will not. This proves that Yoda was aged, say, 100 years of age when he began teaching Jedi. If we presume his species decline in faculties between 75% and 90% onwards of their lifetime, then Yoda would have been well into old-age before the events of TPM took place. Bear in mind AOTC is 30 years even further down the time-line. How, then, bar some illness (as we see no sign of injury, and Yoda ALWAYS has his stick) can Yoda be so fit as to be the leader of all Jedi in AOTC yet seemingly lifeless BEFORE and AFTER these events.Getting back to what I was saying, Yoda fighting. Anyone who says it looks anything other than absurd is lying. Special effects are ALWAYS good to watch, but are they always pertinent?- End Battles. What happened to the juxtaposition of different locations so prevelant in the other movies (YES, including TPM)? Earlier on in the film, when Obi-Wan reaches Geonosis, you have simulatenously Anakin searching for his mother on Tattoine with VERY SIMILAR landscapes\/times of day (why must night be night everywhere, when it's different planets we're talking about?). At then end of the movie, though, CGI takes control 100%. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the CGI was the best I've ever seen, anywhere. It will be revered as the 'Jurassic Park' of the 21st Century. But somewhere along the line (a line followed, pretty well, by TPM) Lucas has seemed to have forgotten that these events are meant to have taken place BEFORE the original trilogy. There's little or no evidence of that now, other than the evolution of the Anakin-Vader character. Why, for example, are the Death Star plans 3D, as they were in ROTJ. In ANH they are only shown in monochromatic 2D format. How can technology evolve, de-evolve and then evolve again? The battle sequences, although amazing to behold, serve nothing other than to confuse. Too many things happen at once, and we don't have that expectation of a key scene that we used to look forward to. Even in TPM there are moments of calm within the storm - remember when the Jedis were seperated by the force-walls? Remember when Anakin crashed inside the TF Control Ship? The pause before he destroyed the reactor (which again, a perfect observation, were a miniature version of the kind later to be found in ROTJ). No such observations were to be found in AOTC. The Death Star pay-off was poor at best, and poorly timed also.In short, you will go and see it and remain captivated BECAUSE- It's a STAR WARS movie, at the end of the day. - The CGI is amazing. - You will want to see how the story unfolds.But you SHOULD hate the fact that- The acting is AWFUL. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson (and possibly Ian McDiarmid) are the only ones worth watching. - The pace of the film is AWFUL. - The relationship between Anakin and Padme is TEDIOUS. - A lot of the CGI was UNNECESSARY and seemingly EXPERIMENTAL.I could go on and on. Remember people, it is OUR generation that are the DIE-HARD fans. These newcomers who threaten physical violence, per se, to those who don't believe that AOTC doesn't BATTER the original trilogy, were brought up on Pokemon. They know no better. It's basically how Yoda percieved Luke and vice-versa in ESB. Neither thought the other was 'cool'. Luke thought Yoda was an old-fuddy duddy and Yoda pitied Luke's naivety.And that's how it is with the original trilogy fans and the children of the new trilogy.All I hope is that Lucas leaves the orignal trilogy alone after the next installment. Rumours of things like a photo of Qui-Gon Jinn in Obi Wan's 'hut' leaves me cold.5\/10 - but only because it IS a Star Wars film.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"22 May 2002","score":"","review":"  This is a near-perfect film, in that it not only provides the origin of Spider-Man, balancing the comic origin with film-friendly changes, but it also immediately introduces the Green Goblin as well as other great characters.  I don't know that I've seen many films that could introduce so many characters in 2 hours, and give them some kind of depth and backstory. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie are tremendous.  We meet Mary Jane and get to see the whole story of Peter becoming Spider-Man, testing out his powers (some of the best parts of the movie!) and learning that he needs to use his new abilities wisely.  Then we are thrust full-speed into Spider-Man's conflict with the Green Goblin (played very well by Willem Dafoe), which does not disappoint as well.I was nervous at first about Tobey Maguire being Peter Parker\/Spider-Man, but within the first 10 minutes he proves himself to be ideal for the part. I now could not see anyone else playing Spidey.  He nails not only the nerdy pre-superpowers Peter Parker, but also the confident and determined post-superpowers Parker\/Spider-Man.  He handles the dualities of the character very well...shy but confident, clumsy yet intelligent, meek early on and brave as the story progresses.  Meanwhile, Sam Raimi's direction is excellent.  The CGI'ed scenes are wonderful and the fight scenes not only are exciting but tell the story well.  These are what I think are the three keys to this movie's success.The feel of the movie is perfect.  It's not dark like Batman was, but we understand from the get-go that Peter understands that his newfound powers bring great responsibility.  Raimi did an excellent job of making this movie feel like what a Spider-Man movie should.  He also does the tough job of helping us understand Spidey's powers.  Particularly the Spider-Sense.  In the comics, we see squiggly lines above Spidey's head to show us he knows something will happen.  In the movie, Raimi SHOWS us how Peter can sense things before they happen.  Expertly done.  The direction is just excellent.The acting is between adequate and excellent all around.  Even the small roles, such as J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson, are honest to the comic book characters and done very well without detracting from the realism of the story.  After all, comic characters can get away with things film characters can't.  The pacing of the story is perfect.  I never felt that anything was rushed, nor that anything dragged.  I saw this movie three times in the first week and a half, and it never bored me, and the pacing was the reason. And finally, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were good in their roles as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn.  Dunst didn't get a lot to work with script-wise, as her character wasn't given an enormous amount of depth, but she works with what she was given excellently and at least makes us understand why Peter loves her so much.  Franco does a good job of showing Harry's struggle with his relationship with his father, and in a lot of ways, Harry is the character that develops the most throughout the film.All in all, an excellent film in every way.  It is so good that I can only think of two extremely minor things that I didn't like.  One was after the kiss, where they show Mary Jane in slow motion for a second, looking up. That was tacky and cliche, and it should have gone to the next scene after showing the sky with the rain falling.  The other was when we get a closeup of M.J. swinging with Spidey.  Spidey doesn't move whatsoever as M.J. is looking around, and it looks pretty awkward and fake.  That's a total of about 3 seconds of film.  Pretty minor flaws!  Really close to perfectly done.  A wonderful film.  And as a side note, I can't believe people actually have beef with the organic web-shooters.  Who cares?  The way they happened naturally accounted for some of the funnier parts of the movie, so I've got no problem with it.  And since when did comic book heroes need logic explanations, anyway?  10\/10.
