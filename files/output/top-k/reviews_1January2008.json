If you go to see The Mummy and expect to see The Departed, The Godfather, or Shawshank Redemption then yes, of course you will be disappointed. This is not a drama, it's an action\/adventure movie! Everyone has commented on the fun of this movie, that is what this movie is all about! Personally, I think the story is very good, and interesting. There is a lot to like here it has elements of action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, mythology, horror, and tells a pretty well made tale (seriously, how many movies manage to pull all of these things off? And pull them off well!). And, it manages to do all of this in style, with amazing special effects and action sequences. No, it's not perfect (what movie is?) but this movie kills most movies in the same genre! I have never seen a movie that can contain so many different elements while still being coherent. This movie is a technical marvel is many aspects!Rachel Weisz is great and looks beautiful as well playing as Evelyn. Yes, she is something like a typical damsel in distress, but she brings humor, intelligence, and a strong will to the part. It's hard to integrate so many qualities into a believable character, but she does it well.Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell After seeing him in so many goofy movies, playing an equally goofy character, I thought he was always going to be cast in lame movies such as Encino Man and Monkeybones. He was the reason why I had doubts I would like the movie because I could not picture him being more than a one-dimensional actor (able to pull goofy-charismatic off only). Not only does he act the part with stride, but he nails every aspect of his character He is cool, yet has humor and he really surprised me with how much depth he can add to a role that really doesn't need it! Rick O'Connell wields his dual guns with flair, and I will never doubt Fraser again! I just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this. I was really impressed with him most because he surpassed all expectations!Everyone else did their parts extremely well, they always stay in character, and add to the elements of the story. This movie has a lot to offer, and lots of different ways to get your interest, especially if the Ancient Egyptian mythology fascinates you. This movie does have elements of horror it will most likely scare younger kids more than adults, but putting yourself in the characters places you would be quite afraid. Imhotep is very scary, mostly because of all the different abilities he possesses, as well as forms he can take. I could not recommend this movie enough, especially if you have a HDTV and have the High Definition version, you will be blown away!

Fair enough, and for their very first professional directorial effort, the Coen's put out a nicely packaged product that sometimes thrills, but ultimately winds up with too many elements that defy credibility working against the story. I'm thinking about the number of gun shots fired throughout the picture that didn't attract attention, the incredible good fortune that no one was ever around as Ray (John Getz) tried to cover up Marty's (Dan Hedaya) almost murder, and Abby's (Frances McDormand) sudden burst of bravery in doing the old Luca Brasi trick on the private detective character (M. Emmet Walsh). Carrying things one step further, wouldn't someone eventually have tried to find out why tire tracks led into the middle of a fallow farm field ending in a hand dug grave?I guess all these things can be shrugged off by considering that for a first effort, the whole thing is wrapped up in a darkly entertaining noir style story with a twist involving the doctored photos of Ray and Abby dead. Oddly, the queasiest parts of the story didn't bother me all that much, like Ray trying to clean up all the blood in Marty's office. Marty's burial scene was pretty clever with the shifting mud, nice touch, but you know what the most shocking part of the flick was for me? It was the newspaper hitting the window right after Ray tells Abby that Marty was still alive when he buried him. That was about the best mis-direction I've ever encountered in a movie because you don't see it coming, and never expect it like you do in contemporary horror films.I had read a lot about this film that encouraged me to see it, and now that I've done so, my best take away is that this was a decent but not entirely successful effort by the Coen's. But you have to start somewhere, and for that somewhere, this is probably more accomplished than most first time tries by other writers and film makers. From that perspective, it's a worthwhile viewing that helps one appreciate all the more what came after in the Coen's filmography.

I initially only wanted to watch Dad to see a younger Ethan Hawke. Fifteen minutes into the film, I was bawling my eyes out. This is unusual for me, as I'm not exactly the weepy type and I only usually cry in tearjerkers featuring Old Yeller, Fluke and Free Willy (somehow, animals emote more convincingly).I thought Dad would be a boring, heartwarming drama, but I pleasantly discovered that it had its share of laughs. This movie is excellently cast and well written. It jars the senses long after you've seen it because it forces you to face things you'd rather not deal with, ever, but will inevitably have to losing someone you love.The film opens with a young Jack Lemmon at sunrise, starting work at his ranch with his beautiful, supportive wife and kids. Then, a sequence to establish his present character an old frail man being taken care of by his overbearing wife (convincingly played by Olympia Dukakis), from dressing him up, putting toothpaste on his toothbrush, to buttering his toast. He accompanies his wife, who drives them both to the grocery, where she gets a heart attack. He helplessly looks on.While she is temporarily hospitalized, the children worry about their father. The son (Ted Danson) is a successful corporate type, who quickly flies in to see to it that everything's okay. He is met by his brother-in-law (Kevin Spacey), and his sister (Kathy Baker).The absentee son is shocked to see how much his father has deteriorated, and so spends more time with him out of guilt. He doesn't intend to stay long as he has business to attend to, and so he makes sure that his father can be independent and take care of himself.Pretty soon, Dukakis is back and is surprised to see her husband up and about. All is well till it's his turn to suddenly get hospitalized. The doctor suspects cancer. Soon, he's in a coma, and the son does everything he can to care for his father. Somewhere in the middle of this, his own son (Ethan Hawke), comes in. He is estranged from his father but is apparently very close to his grandfather.After what seems like ages, and now in the hands of a more compassionate, competent doctor, the old man wakes up. He celebrates his new lease on life by being more carefree, lively and spontaneous. He has been diagnosed to be a bit schizophrenic, with the film's opening sequence revealing the dream life he's been living in his head to cope with his problems. His family is astonished, but humors him, except for his wife, who openly shows her displeasure at his apparent craziness.But later on, it is his new zest for life that infects everyone and brings the family together. It helps the old couple open their world to new things and new people at that stage in their life. In the end, cancer does overcome his body, but not his spirit and of those around him.I like how the movie finishes on a positive yet realistic note, without milking the situation with an embarrassing display of melodrama.It's a scary thing to watch someone you've always known as strong slowly wither before you. It must have been excruciating for the son to watch his own father not be able to do the things that he used to do, not even dress himself up. This was also painfully illustrated in one scene where the son, angry at the poor treatment his father endured from the first doctor, carries his dad out of the hospital. The father's body appeared so weak and frail in his son's arms. This role reversal a la Pieta comes as quite a shocker, as it disturbs the equilibrium an awful lot.As the eldest child, I've had the good fortune to enjoy my parents at their prime. I grew up content in the belief that I always had my strong, funny, patient father and my always organized and in-control mother to take care of anything, big or small. And then I aged in years, but still terribly spoiled and immature, while my folks seem to have silently been plateauing.While my folks have not been as terribly sick as in the movie, the threat of it happening is always there. Dad has been a wake-up call for me to reevaluate what matters most in life and to reallocate my time to doing the things that are truly of value.Everyone can relate to this film because everyone has parents, or someone they depend on or are close to. There is no big villain to hate or escape from in this film; no unrealistic and complicated plot twists, telenovela-style. Nothing, that is, except the bigger danger of apathy, the silent killer in each of our relationships. Therein lies the true conflict, and the earlier we choose to recognize it and act on it, the better our relationships can be.Now who would've known such knowledge could stem from a desire to see Ethan Hawke?

All is well till it's his turn to suddenly get hospitalized. The doctor suspects cancer. Soon, he's in a coma, and the son does everything he can to care for his father. Somewhere in the middle of this, his own son (Ethan Hawke), comes in. He is estranged from his father but is apparently very close to his grandfather.After what seems like ages, and now in the hands of a more compassionate, competent doctor, the old man wakes up. He celebrates his new lease on life by being more carefree, lively and spontaneous. He has been diagnosed to be a bit schizophrenic, with the film's opening sequence revealing the dream life he's been living in his head to cope with his problems. His family is astonished, but humors him, except for his wife, who openly shows her displeasure at his apparent craziness.But later on, it is his new zest for life that infects everyone and brings the family together. It helps the old couple open their world to new things and new people at that stage in their life. In the end, cancer does overcome his body, but not his spirit and of those around him.I like how the movie finishes on a positive yet realistic note, without milking the situation with an embarrassing display of melodrama.It's a scary thing to watch someone you've always known as strong slowly wither before you. It must have been excruciating for the son to watch his own father not be able to do the things that he used to do, not even dress himself up. This was also painfully illustrated in one scene where the son, angry at the poor treatment his father endured from the first doctor, carries his dad out of the hospital. The father's body appeared so weak and frail in his son's arms. This role reversal a la Pieta comes as quite a shocker, as it disturbs the equilibrium an awful lot.As the eldest child, I've had the good fortune to enjoy my parents at their prime. I grew up content in the belief that I always had my strong, funny, patient father and my always organized and in-control mother to take care of anything, big or small. And then I aged in years, but still terribly spoiled and immature, while my folks seem to have silently been plateauing.While my folks have not been as terribly sick as in the movie, the threat of it happening is always there. Dad has been a wake-up call for me to reevaluate what matters most in life and to reallocate my time to doing the things that are truly of value.Everyone can relate to this film because everyone has parents, or someone they depend on or are close to. There is no big villain to hate or escape from in this film; no unrealistic and complicated plot twists, telenovela-style. Nothing, that is, except the bigger danger of apathy, the silent killer in each of our relationships. Therein lies the true conflict, and the earlier we choose to recognize it and act on it, the better our relationships can be.Now who would've known such knowledge could stem from a desire to see Ethan Hawke?

I finally picked it up and got a chance to watch it and was not surprisingly blown away by it. In the recent rash of mobster\/gangster flicks like The Departed, and to a lesser extent the terrific We Own The Night, I think Road to Perdition does a fantastic job. The film is gorgeous (well deserving of it's Oscar for cinematography) but how in the hell did this film miss all the other Oscar nominations it should have received? This entire film and everything about it boggles my mind because overall it was received well by critics, it seems to not be a classic film and Tom Hanks is completely overlooked in every discussion and he absolutely takes this movie and his role by the throat and puts everything into it proving once again that he is possibly the greatest, most influential and versatile actor in history. The film is a mobster movie, a coming of age movie, a drama, a dark and gritty crime film...it just encompasses so much. Director Sam Mendes took the exact same gritty style that he gave to Jarhead and translates it to this 1930's mob drama. The story is so captivating and enthralling from beginning to end and will leave you breathless and in tears.Tom Hanks headlines in one of the greatest roles he's ever done. Michael Sullivan is blood thirsty, and determined and brooding, and level headed and he's a father who doesn't quite connect with his eldest son because he sees himself in him. A complex and multi faceted character and Hanks nails it with this eerie subtlety. He was robbed of any and all awards!! The young Tyler Hoechlin is terrific as Hanks' young son who is left in the midst of violence and a life on the run. He is really terrific and shows some real chops up against both Hanks and Newman, and him and Hanks have awesome father\/son chemistry. I have great respect for Paul Newman. He is a terrific actor and an icon to Motion Pictures but this doesn't do anything for him. I thought they would utilize Hanks and Newman and their relationship to the utmost but Newman's role is a cameo at best with no real depth, or importance other than being the figure head to this Irish mob family. His Oscar nomination for the role is ludicrous!! Especially considering it was the only acting nomination and the lead cast blew away their roles and Newman was barely existent save for a few intense moments. In a sadly small role Daniel Craig is terrific as the maniacal and power hungry son of Newman. Craig has this glint of psychosis to his character but it never truly gets explored but still he is terrific in his role...better than Newman's. Jude Law makes a late appearance in the film as a psychotic hit-man that films his dead bodies and he is quiet and brooding and does very well in the role considering how late in the film he comes in. He makes a worthy opponent to Hanks' character.Road to Perdition sends you straight back to the time it takes place and just enthralls you in this story of vengeance and family and growing up and the script is brilliant. Hanks truly does make the film with his character and the story is gripping and important. It doesn't present itself as an epic really but after seeing it and taking it in and thinking about it, it becomes so much more in your mind and really sticks with you because of the performances and story. Road to Perdition seems in every way shape and form to be the kind of film critics salivate over and should have been an Oscar sweep and yet I remember when it came out and thinking that it wasn't really a well talked about film and now that I've seen it I can verify that the film is very under rated and under-appreciated. As I was watching it I am convinced that this is the type of film that will stand the test of time and in 30-40-50 years it will be considered a classic and definitely one of Hanks' best performances. For any fans of the mob film, period pieces or just a deep and intelligent story you must treat yourself to Road To Perdition. 9\/10 PS This is review number 599 for me.

I was a huge fan of the Mortal Kombat video games when they were originally released. I'd spend hours on the Super Nintendo with friends beating the virtual crap out of each other. When this movie was released, I was psyched and I was satisfied when I first saw it. Well, I was young and naive back then, and as I've grown, so have my taste in movies. Now I can't watch this movie without laughing at how terrible it really is.You can tell the writers didn't spend more than 5 minutes working out the story of this movie. I mean, sure, it's based on a fighting game...but come ON. These guys could've at least TRIED. Mortal Kombat is a tournament held every year and if the Outworld (basically another dimension) win ten tournaments in a row, they take control of Earth. Well, it's year ten and the Outworld have had a nice nine year winning streak. The fate of the Earth has fallen into the hands of three people Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage. Kang (Robin Shou) is a member of the White Lotus clan attending the tournament to avenge his brother. Sonya (Bridgette Wilson) is a government agent following a criminal to the tournament to avenge her partner. And Cage is an arrogant movie star attending to improve his image. That's about all the character development we're given; I guess nothing else about these three really matters. The writing overall is pretty bad.Aside from the thin story and shallow characters, the dialogue is laughably bad throughout. Characters generally spout off crappy one-liners and intelligence is minimum. The worst has to have been the evil Outworld sorcerer, Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). Few of his lines were ever more than 3-4 words, and most of them were just sound bites from the game! I swear, the majority of his lines were growling Finish him! or Fatality!. Like I said, these writers didn't even TRY. The only time we get any real dialogue out of Tsung is when he's going off on some Bond-villainesque plot explanation halfway through the movie, basically five minutes of exposition to make sure the viewer understands the situation.I can't comment on this title without mentioning the craptastic special effects. I realize that this movie came out in 1995, but seriously, these effects are even bad by 1995 standards. Prince Goro, an Outworld creature with four arms, looks like a muppet. The powers displayed by Shang Tsung and Rayden look like something from the 1980's. The absolute worst has to have been Reptile. Before he possess a statue and takes human form, Reptile looks like a Saturday morning cartoon! It's horrible, and Scorpion's harpoon isn't much better.

It sure didn't go into production value...With so much negative things to say about this movie, I'm sure there's gotta be SOME good...Well, the fights were halfway decent. The choreography wasn't half bad, especially the final battle. Of course, the fights are missing the one thing that made the Mortal Kombat video games unique...GORE.

Oscar Wilde.It seems people like to label this film 'quirky'; a word that doesn't complement a film and one that doesn't quite criticise it either. In this sense, quirky might be a good adjective to use to describe The Royal Tenenbaums but it's so much more than just that. The film was the third from Wes Anderson; a man who is perhaps rather quickly embedding himself somewhat as an auteur when it comes to film-making &#150; his most recent effort The Darjeeling Limited was also of the 'quirky' and off the wall style. But The Royal Tenenbaums is more than a film merely advertising a director\/writer as the next Kevin Smith; it is a journey down an independent route that although isn't great; is certainly enjoyable and showcases what Anderson likes doing the most playing with conventions most of us will have become accustomed to.Like every film, The Royal Tenenbaums uses its opening twenty-five minutes to set the scene but what a scene to set. I feel most people will either switch off before the opening half an hour; failing to keep their interest levels above a set standard whereas others will let the film roll on, the majority of which will afterwards claim it 'genius'. I appreciate what Anderson is doing here, as I could with The Darjeeling Limited but this is not a great film despite making us think and forcing us to observe everything on screen. The film makes, in my opinion, an early mistake by flashing over past major events in a way that will make us feel sorry for certain characters once the present tense takes over. Another film that made this error was recent Spanish effort 'Volver' which wanted us to feel an emotion within the first thirty minutes or so as characters suffer epiphanies over events that took place before the film's time. The Royal Tenenbaums does this when the narrator exclaims 'everyone was in the same house for the first time in 19 years.' Now, I suppose that's supposed to be a really big deal and it's supposed to make us 'feel' something; because I certainly would if it happened to me in real life, however; when it's just happened to a bunch of film characters I know nothing about then there is no reaction.This is, however; pretty much the only major problem I had with the film. Like Volver, I will remark here that this would've worked brilliantly had we had a film pre-showing these events hence The Royal Tenenbaums would've acted as a fantastic sequel as we would've now known everyone. But the film remains an entertaining and mildly amusing romp that announces itself as independent and never turns back in embarrassment. Anderson spreads his characters around this small filmic space and spends enough time showing us and building up an audience-character relation with each of them; royally shedding any protagonist or antagonist tag a character may inherit. It's worth saying here that the narrator is not in the film; in fact any of the film's character could have easily doubled up as the narrator thus ruining the idea of whose point of view this is told from everything is being said as it happened, by someone neutral. The film is actually told aurally with apparent pages from a book popping up now and again as the film enters a new 'chapter'. This does not drag the film toward any fairytale tag (since often when a narrator tells a story they aren't involved in, it's a fairytale) but complements the film's breakaway approach.Instead, Anderson takes time to develop his characters in a very meaningful and enlightening way. Richie Tenenbaum (L. Wilson) is a disgraced ex-tennis player who obviously fell out of love with the game (yet still wears the tennis gear rather casually); Chas (Stiller) is an overprotective parent to his two sons; Margot (Paltrow) is the secretly disgraced daughter whose reckless life is kept secret and Royal (Hackman) and Etheline (Huston) are the parents whom couldn't quite work it out. Anderson has put a great deal of thought into these characters and not only shows us who's what but subtly tells us through body language and clothing what they're really like. Chaz is always wearing red and thus seems angry most of the time while Richie wears yellow and seems more at ease with everyone since yellow is a very calm colour. Likewise, getting back the apparent tennis equipment 'goof'; Richie only really removes it when he cuts his beard and his hair in an event that will no doubt count as a spoiler. After this very disturbing and well shot scene, the tennis equipment disappears as he has confronted his demons and is now, I suppose, liberated from his giving up of the game.Anderson sets up his compositions well Margot is always in the background, hovering; perhaps detached from everyone else when the entire family is in shot. We discover what we need to know about Etheline's relationship; Royal's condition and Margot's past as well as everything else at preciously the right time in the final third whereas we remain interested up until this point due to good characterisation and that feeling of 'Who the hell are these people, exactly?' Make no mistake, Anderson has made a good film here with enough going on to warrant a watch and with enough brains to keep you perhaps noticing something new each time.

This film is pretty much flawless and it definitely the smartest most stylish (even more than any Tarantino flick) film of the 90's and is probably the memorable for me personally ever.It hinges on the brilliantly crafted script and plot from McQuarrie (something he has never been able to emulate and never will) and the fantastic acting. The cast is superbly picked with all in question on top form. I love the fact the actors in the film are not the strongest in the world, the fact that we see Stephen Baldwin acting superbly is incredible and also i feel it the greatest ever performance from Gabriel Byrne and the same can be said about Chazz Palminteri who is fantastic as Agent Kujan.However the show as usual was stolen by Spacey. This film portrays Spacey's versatility as an actor and is his finest performance to date which earned him the a well-deserved Oscar (all be it in the wrong category.) Spacey's presence is subtle but yet very effective as the entire film really hinges on him and he pulls it off fantastically.

The trash-talking is believable and occasionally funny, although I find it juvenile as a concept (although it reminds you that 2Pac and Shakespeare may be more alike than most would assume).The choice of title is brave, and successful - society has put an inbuilt 'block' on Hoyle, much as it has for non-whites in many areas, and his determination to prove others wrong becomes an undoing. Sexual differences are touched on as well; the film notices the way men are generally more obsessed with victory than women - it is Sidney's wife Rhonda who finds a solution to their initial problems, despite Sidney and Billy's macho attitudes.It all amounts to one of the few quality sport-themed films, a tight but not over-serious look at race in early 90s America.

I saw it again and decided there are some things. This film has deep roots in a rich tradition of reality-as-imagination, as portrayed in French literature and poetry. It evokes the 'impossibile realities' of Andre Breton's romantic surrealist novel 'Nadja', together with its love of the mystery of certain Paris locations. As so much of the film takes place at the Gare de l'Est, which was the favourite haunt of the unique poet and writer of 'glimpses', Leon-Paul Fargue, the film draws much from his eccentric imaginative tradition too. And as anyone knows who has read the magnificent 27 volume novel 'Men of Good Will' by Jules Romains, as I have, that tale recounts the communication between two young lovers by means of signs and messages posted in public places, just as we see in this film. Whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director, is aware of these things consciously in the way that he must be of the many cinematic references he makes, I have no way of knowing. But these things are in the blood and the bone of every Parisian. And although he is a Loire man, Jeunet is a Parisian now. As for the raids which Audrey Tatou makes on Collignon's flat in the film, these are a standard Surrealist activity. I knew well the 'last of the British Surrealists', David Gascoyne (an intimate of Paul Eluard and friend of Breton), as well as his friend Kathleen Raine, a British poetess. Kathleen told me that one time when David was upset with her, he broke into her house in Chelsea and 'staged a Surrealist raid on her home'. He turned all of her furniture upside down and left, - a clear precursor to Audrey Tatou! You breathe these things in the air of Paris, and if you have read any 20th century French literature, these things leap out at you and grab you by your solar plexus until you turn into a Jean-Pierre Jeunet. This film is perfect, everyone in it is perfect, everything about it is perfect, and I won't hear a word or whisper of criticism of it from anyone who doesn't wish a Surrealist raid on his home made in retaliation. Long live the Imagination Liberation Front! Down with the forces of mediocrity and drabness! May there be magic everywhere!

At least the bullies seem to care about each other.The story seems to be supposed to be a growth story, but actual character development is minimal.The movie is set in the 1940s. This is completely arbitrary and actually makes the movie less believable than it would be were it to be set in a more recent time.If you're going to watch this movie, at least be warned You are going to watch an hour and a half of spoiled kids being annoying and their parents being stupid.

I forced myself to sit through this abomination of a movie. The script is horrible, the characters are SUPER annoying and unbelievable. Yeah, it's a kids' movie, but a good kids' movie should at the very least not irritate the brains out of adult watchers.The worst thing about the movie is the way the children are represented.
