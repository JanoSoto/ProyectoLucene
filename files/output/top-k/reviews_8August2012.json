[{"date":"8 August 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow talk about a fast paced movie but this one is fast paced in a good way. With the quick visuals, cinematography and the constant techno music blaring makes this one really exciting to watch. It's just all blended in into a exciting, exhilarating and fun bundle. Just about everything about this movie is obnoxious and crazy but in a good way. The plot is here is very simple, it's about a girl name Lola running all around town in order to find 100,000 dollars for her boyfriend so he wouldn't get killed while time is ticking away. Because the money he owes goes missing. Watching this movie is like watching a cool music video from the 90's that lasts about a hour and 20 minutes. It's like watching a blend of something cartoony and something all over the place, but again in a good way. This movie theme is how even the smallest change in time can make all the difference. It's basically like watching a cool video game to some degree. Cause you try to do things a bit differently after the first run sometimes. Overall this is one of those redo types of movies that I enjoy sometimes done right.7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow talk about a fast paced movie but this one is fast paced in a good way.
