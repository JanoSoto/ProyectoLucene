[{"date":"26 August 2005","score":"17 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy, however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner.

Yet at the same time it's brilliantly made and acted, and doesn't shy away from a very unpleasant issue that some people would rather forget about - or, much like the characters in this film, simply deny the problem exists.The acting is almost second to none. Henry Czerny was especially brilliant as the demented pedophile priest Bro. Lavin. His portrayal of Lavin made the character loathsome and somewhat sympathetic both at the same time, though one couldn't really feel any sympathy for him until he revealed his dark past to a psychiatrist before his trial. Czerny does an excellent job of portraying a sadistic man - revealed when he instructs Bro. Glackin - 20 of the best on each hand, Brother, and a sympathetic family man in Part 2, when it was revealed that Lavin had left the clergy, married and become a father of 2 sons. Greg Thomey - who is known in Canada as a comedian on 'This Hour has 22 minutes' - was also chillingly realistic as the psychopathic, sadistic brother who viciously beat a boy with a belt, then sneers, No tears - I shall have to continue until you show some! This is a role that didn't seem typecast for him but he stepped into it very well. I do not know who the actor was who played the Chief of Police, but he made the role one that the audience could hate almost as much as Bro. Lavin - especially when he orders the detective to bury his original report - 'I won't have this piece of pornography in that file - I want a nice, clean report for the files', and then is seen with psycho-priest Lavin later at a fund-raising ceremony. The child actors playing the abused boys are equally convincing as their adult counterparts - you cannot help but get a sense of their helplessness and abandonment when the Chief of Police, Bro. Lavin, and senior government officials decide to bury the truth. Equally convincing is the actor who played Kevin in part 2, when he is trying to deal with the anguish left behind by the abuse, and trying to start a life with his girlfriend Sheila (Kristine Demers), who is concerned about her boyfriend's violent outburst toward an ex-roommate in a bar, his horrific nightmares - which are invaded by Bro. Lavin - and his fear of having sex with her. Demers is excellent at portraying a sympathetic loved one & confidant of someone who lived through experiences no child should ever have to endure. It was heart-wrenching to watch her start crying uncontrollably as Kevin testified against the former priest who had targeted him for his sick gratification.As another reviewer pointed out, this does not target the Catholic Church as a whole but more the corruption that can - and apparently does - exist within it. More than a decade after this film first appeared on TV, we were learning about more abuse scandals and cover-ups perpetrated by the church in the United States - especially in Massachusetts. I can still remember first hearing about the scandal in Newfoundland, Canada that inspired the film - the Mount Cashel Orphanage, since closed - and the disgusting cover-up of that scandal.It is unfortunate that U.S. censors heavily edited this film before it was shown on American TV. While the images of the abuse are not pornographic - nor should they be - the shots were done in a way that helps tell the story the filmmakers are trying to tell. Although they are disturbing, this is a film about a very disturbing subject.I am pleased to see so many positive reviews for this film. Despite its ugly, sometimes graphic, always disturbing content, it tells a story that needs to be told. As a reviewer about 10 years ago said, 'The Boys of St. Vincent'...deserves to be seen. See it.

Braindead and Bad Taste (1987) is the films I associate with Mr. Jackson. The Fellowship Of The Ring (2001) is one of the best films I've ever seen, but these are the films I love him for.Lionell is a young man who lives with his dominating mother Vera. He has never been with a girl, but one day he meets Paquita, and they fall in love with each other. When this happens, Lionell's mother gets jealous. And while spying at her son during a date with Paquita at the local Zoo, she's being bitten by a rat-monkey from Sumatra. Her wound gets infected by a virus which turns her into a flesh-hungry zombie after a while. Soon the virus is infecting other people and the whole situation is out of control within a few days.Braindead has been called 'every horror-fan's wet dream'. But the funny thing is that it is not a horror-film. To me, it isn't horrifying at all. It is a zombie-film though...and a VERY funny one. It can be called a Zombie-Splatter-Comedy, and I would also call it a gore-fest like no other. I have honestly never seen a film with so much gore. If you don't like films with blood, then Braindead is THE last film you should watch. The first hour of the film may not be the worst you'll see, but after that....and the climax...do I have to mention more than cutting the grass? It's hard to believe that this film is made by the same man who would later make The Lord Of The Rings. It is loaded with scenes and moments that's sick, twisted and some even disgusting and perverse. But even though I, with a smile, keep asking the question what kind of sick person would make something like this?, I notice that everything is given to me in a way that's quickly making me laugh. And through all the insanity, it is possible to spot a genius that would later be able to make something as masterful as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.The actors and the plot is not exactly the main focus in a film like this. The plot is only giving the scenes a little boost, and the love-part of the story, for example, is so stupid and silly that it's embarrassing to watch at times. The cast is pleasing though. Timothy Balme is funny to watch in his role as Lionell, and Elizabeth is also doing a good job as Lionell's mother Vera. But Diana Peñalver who plays Paquita is so terrible that I start wondering if she's supposed to be that bad. Other memorable characters is Ian Watkin's Uncle Les and Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie), who plays the leading part in a famous graveyard scene.Gore-fans from all over the world has embraced this film as one of the best Zombie-movies ever made, and out of Peter Jackson's three cult-films (Meet The Feebles (1989) and Bad Taste (1987) is the two others), Braindead is probably the most popular and respected one. Leave your brain and rationality somewhere else when you're going to watch this film, and you'll have a good laugh while experiencing the work of a man who seems like a genius and a maniac, at the same time.8.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Who is Peter Jackson?

Other memorable characters is Ian Watkin's Uncle Les and Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie), who plays the leading part in a famous graveyard scene.Gore-fans from all over the world has embraced this film as one of the best Zombie-movies ever made, and out of Peter Jackson's three cult-films (Meet The Feebles (1989) and Bad Taste (1987) is the two others), Braindead is probably the most popular and respected one. Leave your brain and rationality somewhere else when you're going to watch this film, and you'll have a good laugh while experiencing the work of a man who seems like a genius and a maniac, at the same time.8.5 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"26 August 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Entertainment is what it delivers.

Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible, and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones; it's absolutely amazing, watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses, what happens? They casually go about their normal routine, taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor, sitting around chatting, basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid, it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place, but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy, but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them, Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out, he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichés mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville, all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough, Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.

I don't understand all the discussion and constant mention of this being a sequel to the original Wizard of Oz?? This film is made in it's own right based on a series of books which happen to be the second and third books in the series. The film makers obviously knew that everyone already knew the story of The Wizard of Oz and therefore didn't need to go back and cover that aspect of it but instead created a film after those events. There is nothing in Return to Oz that even hints at this being a sequel. Return to Oz is EVERYTHING Wizard of Oz wasn't. It's dark, very dark, creepy, no singing whatsoever, very defined different look in each Oz character. Also when Dorothy first returns to Oz she makes it known that the desert surrounding Oz is the deadly desert which she is well aware of, something that certainly was not in the original. Sure there are some similarities and recreations taken from the first. Dorothy's character except being much younger (as she was in the books), has some very similar qualities to Judy Garland's Dorothy and even seems to have some of the same mannerisms and voice tones. The ruby slippers which were created exclusively for the original film make a reappearance BUT they are such a common staple to the story now that it's necessity to have them.If this film had been released nowadays it would have been turned into some sort of multi billion dollar franchise which would be great!! One of the only downsides to this deliciously dark creation is it's too short and misses out on some great points. The young Fairuza Balk is perfect casting as Dorothy Gale. She is mentally disturbed by the events that previously happened in Oz and her family believes her to need Psychiatric treatment. Enter the terrifying Psyciatric hospital. This film begins it's dark and at times terrifying vision of psychiatry treatment with the mysterious girl who saves Dorothy. The quality of this film is to watch everything you know about Oz and return there yourself to discover the ruins and what has happened to all the familiar characters. On top of that director Walter Murch who has since this film done some incredible work, gives new characters life such as Jack Pumpkinhead, Tik Tok, The Gump, and terrifying evil doers that makes the wicked witch look like Glenda. The Nome King played by veteran actor Nicol Williamson, and more importantly the horrifically evil Mombi played by a variety of actresses depending on what head she was wearing...yes the interchangeable heads which also makes for one of the most terrifying moment in movie history when Dorothy steals the powder of life and the heads begin to scream at her. Plenty of special effects, although a little outdated and corny at times, still beautiful setting, familiar characters, good triumphing over evil...everything that makes a classic!! Just be careful about young kids because it has that dark streak.

I don't understand all the discussion and constant mention of this being a sequel to the original Wizard of Oz?? This film is made in it's own right based on a series of books which happen to be the second and third books in the series. The film makers obviously knew that everyone already knew the story of The Wizard of Oz and therefore didn't need to go back and cover that aspect of it but instead created a film after those events. There is nothing in Return to Oz that even hints at this being a sequel. Return to Oz is EVERYTHING Wizard of Oz wasn't. It's dark, very dark, creepy, no singing whatsoever, very defined different look in each Oz character. Also when Dorothy first returns to Oz she makes it known that the desert surrounding Oz is the deadly desert which she is well aware of, something that certainly was not in the original. Sure there are some similarities and recreations taken from the first. Dorothy's character except being much younger (as she was in the books), has some very similar qualities to Judy Garland's Dorothy and even seems to have some of the same mannerisms and voice tones. The ruby slippers which were created exclusively for the original film make a reappearance BUT they are such a common staple to the story now that it's necessity to have them.If this film had been released nowadays it would have been turned into some sort of multi billion dollar franchise which would be great!! One of the only downsides to this deliciously dark creation is it's too short and misses out on some great points. The young Fairuza Balk is perfect casting as Dorothy Gale. She is mentally disturbed by the events that previously happened in Oz and her family believes her to need Psychiatric treatment. Enter the terrifying Psyciatric hospital. This film begins it's dark and at times terrifying vision of psychiatry treatment with the mysterious girl who saves Dorothy. The quality of this film is to watch everything you know about Oz and return there yourself to discover the ruins and what has happened to all the familiar characters. On top of that director Walter Murch who has since this film done some incredible work, gives new characters life such as Jack Pumpkinhead, Tik Tok, The Gump, and terrifying evil doers that makes the wicked witch look like Glenda.

Somewhere out in the vast cosmos are a few people who have viewed The New Guy and found it amusing, almost everyone else who watches will wonder how a comedy can so totally fail at being funny or even mildly entertaining. So if you are thinking of viewing The New Guy you should ask yourself whether one minute of Eliza Dushku trying on swim suits is worth 89 minutes of your time plus the rental fee\/purchase cost. As this is the only thing worth watching (it is truly outstanding), you may want to join me in petitioning for requiring the inclusion of at least one minute of Eliza trying on swim suits in all feature films.I am not sure about the agenda of the shills are who have posted positive comments about The New Guy but maintaining a healthy skepticism about them is a good idea. On close examination, their analysis and writing style may remind you of the essays written by that guy in fifth grade who still needed the teacher's help for shoelace tying.And don't let the presence of several cast members who are normally very funny\/entertaining, like Zooey Deschanel, Illeana Douglas, and the already mentioned Eliza Dushku fool you into thinking this is worth viewing. There have been some bad teen comedies but you have to go all the way back to the Annette and Frankie beach movies to find anything this bad and those things had a certain charm and a much higher level of sophistication. In fact, you could make a good case for not even classifying The New Guy as a teen comedy, maybe it was originally intended as a device to the torture terrorists in Cuba. The New Guy suffers even more than most from the teen comedy curse of a cast too old to be portraying high school kids. Sunny Mabrey plays Courtney, who is simply the sleaziest looking high school cheerleader in cinema history. Mabrey did not look quite this sleazy in high school, but she graduated 1993, the nine years since were not kind. While this explains why she looks so used up, it doesn't explain why they gave the role to someone who should be driving a SUV full of her own kids to soccer practice. The New Guy wants to be a spoof of Not Another Teen Movie, an uneven spoof of the teen movie genre but something that is cutting edge in comparison. Most of the blame has to go to the writer David Kendall who is no Cameron Crowe. Kendall is an obvious hack whose only writing credits are episodes of Growing Pains and Just the 10 of Us.

The acting is pretty good by the likable cast & I actually wanted most of them to live, Betty White as the foul mouthed Dolores Bickerman is very funny & gets some good lines. I really liked Lake Placid, my friend Kelly liked it so I didn't think I would as we don't normally share the same taste in films but this is one occasion where she is right, for a change (sorry Kelly only joking!). All that is left to be said is if Lake Placid is good enough for Kelly, who's always right according to her, then it's certainly good enough for anyone else. Recommended & definitely worth a watch.

I remember enjoying the film as a kid, but now i wanted to go back and view it as an adult, and as a future film maker. I remember as a kid, liking the visuals, but never paying attention to the story. I was like this with all films and usually if the film looked cool or had cool moments in it, i loved it. Now as an adult, story and plot take front row to cool looking visual effects without context. Surprisingly, superman 3 had SOME.Now, this film is by far, not a classic. It has its flaws, and many of them, but the overall experience is fun and entertaining, more so then the current version of superman 2 and the god awful waste of film that was superman 4. If any complaints, its mostly the over the top comedy. It plays off more like a 3, or in this case 4, stooges movie with superman guest staring, then an actual superman film, but then again, the comedy for the most part is funny if not overkill. As for the story, its almost scary how it shows the world to become. Computer hackers robbing everything in sight, oil trouble, freak storms, etc. It seems a little less like science fiction and more like dated science fact almost, if you take away the superman.In all, the film isn't that bad as i was expecting. Its handled well, has funny moments, stumbles a bit towards the middle, but, manages to pick itself up. Sadly though, like ALL of the current superman films, it is dated, and the special effects are almost laughable when compared to todays super photo realistic effects, but then again the great chris reeves, god rest his soul, was the superman of 1978-1986, and the best man for the job at the time. Lets hope routh manages to do the same thing.If your a superman or a comic book fan, check it out for a few laughs. Don't expect a spiderman 2 or xmen though. Its good, not Great!

The character of Morrison was one of the main factors that drew me to The Doors in the first place.Morrison was as previously stated, a genius.

In the early scenes of the film, We see the rising young, talented and self taught philosopher, discussing with his future keyboardist his visions of putting his deep and powerful messages to music...to reach the masses, and as the film progresses we slowly see the light of that glowing mind get dimmer and dimmer as it slowly suffocates under the pressures of his fame, and the sedative influence of his increasing substance abuse forcing his talent, his music and his life to spiral irreparably out of control.It amazes me how one person with such an incredible intelligence could have destroyed himself so stupidly and needlessly. He was however a product of a difficult time in history, which I suppose must have played a big part in shaping Jim into the kind of person he eventually became.One of the best Biopics I have have ever seen on any subject and one served up with a big slice of gritty realism that only Oliver Stone truly knows how to prepare.

This is a sign that he was already cooking something in his brains but during the film he did not show any finding until its end. So this final part of the film is not illogic as some may believe. Talking concretely about the film I found that Bogart was the right choice of Huston to play the role of Spade. Before making the film the proposed actor was George Raft, but Huston never agreed having him for the role of Spade. Another important finding was the inclusion of Sidney Greenstreet for the first time in a big screen. Certainly he played very well the role of selfish and arrogant Kasper Gutman. The other components, Mary Astor and Peter Lorre did what was required from them. This is probably the first film noir and due to its quality one can see it from time to time repeatedly.

While Animal House may have been what set off the boom, MASH created the formula for the cadet\/frat comedies like Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, Stripes, and Police Academy. The essential elements of the formula are all here - a bunch of buddies hell-bent on having a good time and getting laid get into conflict with strict, arrogant but inept authority figures and their henchmen; the buddies play various pranks against the scheming henchmen and eventually triumph over them, getting the girls, showing up the henchmen's incompetence and demonstrating the buddies' hitherto unappreciated but substantial talents. Maybe Sgt Bilko and Hogan's Heroes once attempted to cover similar comedic ground, but MASH introduced the frat boy elements of erectile tissue, hazing, drinking, partying, sport and pranks.For some reason this film is often described as an anti-war film. That might have been the intention of the director and the once-blacklisted writer, I'm not sure, but the film itself is nothing of the sort. The war never intrudes on MASH life except for the gory surgical scenes with unconscious soldiers. You never see any suffering from the war itself, and you are never introduced to the patients as individual people. Far from making war look like hell, it looks like a never-ending frat party, with only a few surgical operations and a couple of easily-pranked tight-asses interrupting the fun. Just because it is set in a war situation without having the usual war film heroics doesn't make it an anti-war film. Perhaps because of the film's year of release, it seems that the sort of humourless tight-asses that this film mocks insist on reading into this comedy a serious content that isn't there.No, this film is very much a comedy, and a truly hilarious one whose belly laugh hilarity hasn't dated.

Sandra plays her role so well that on many times you feel the joy, sorrow, pain and enjoyment she feels. The story about a lonely girl in a ticket box at the station. Silently in love with a man that comes by each and every day, without seeing her. When she saves the man from a deadly fall for the train, the man gets into a coma. In order to see the man in hospital, she poses as his fiancée. That works, but then she meets the family of the man who never seen his fiancée and instantly believe she is his fiancée. From that moment her life starts turning in many directions and she falls from one (hilarious) situation into the other. The story line and the hilarious situations are always unexpected, but never cheap or dull. A film to see a dozen times!

Every character completely contrived and unrealized. Plus the obvious inconsistencies were so annoying. Case in point - one moment the twins can knock off nine mobsters hanging from a rope upside down and the next they can't hit the broadside of a barn in the shootout with Il Duce. Then Il Duce turns out to be daddy! And the way the director condescends to his audience is a joke. Wanna see how all of the dead bodies got to be that way? Wait a minute and I will will show you. Can't come up with any original dialog? No problem. Use the F-word 200+ times. Dreadful.
