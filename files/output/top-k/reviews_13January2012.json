Basically at a suburban high school in Omaha, Nebraska is overachieving senior student Tracy Flick (Golden Globe Reese Witherspoon) who may be beautiful, but does have a vindictive and sexual side, she was caught having an affair with teacher Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik), but while he was fired and divorced by wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) she did not get any punishment. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the Social Studies teacher at the high school with a good attitude on the surface, but he has hidden frustrations, and this includes in some ways towards Tracy. He is especially horrified that she is running for the upcoming student body president election, and deciding that she needs to be taught a lesson he decides to get a student to campaign against her. He chooses simple and sometimes slow but polite and popular football player student Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who has been getting over his depression, having a broken leg that stops him playing, but this president idea has given him a sense of purpose. Paul's younger sister, lesbian Tammy (Jessica Campbell) has been dumped by her sweetheart Lisa Flanagan (Frankie Ingrassia), who said they were only experimenting together, and wanting to stay heterosexual she quickly hooks up with her own brother. Tammy becomes mad with this recent breakup and her brother's actions, so she decides to register for the election herself, but she is going with the point of view that the whole thing is a sham that will not amount to anything. It comes to the assembly to hear the three campaigns, Tracy gives a confident speech that gets a polite applause, Paul although rushed with a written speech gets a good reaction, but Tammy steals the show with her defiant speech saying that the election will not change things, no matter who is voted, and that there is no point to it, and this gets a rapturous standing ovation from the students. Tammy is soon suspended and ejected from the election, with fears that the school would lose its integrity and if she was elected she would bring down the student government body, and Tracy meanwhile tears all the posters campaigning for Paul in a moment of rage, Tammy sees her trying to dispose of them. Jim confronts Tracy after this happens and accuses her of tearing the posters down, but strangely Tammy takes the blame for it, and she is transferred to a parochial school for girls, this being her intention of the fake confession. Jim meanwhile is married to Diane (Molly Hagan), but is secretly attracted to Linda, as he has been helping her, and after kissing she asks him to rent a motel to get closer, and he quickly dashes, giving his class a pop quiz, to prepare the room ready for her arrival. After his class he goes to pick her up, but she is not at her house, so he waits a while at the motel, and then he finally decides to go home, and that is when he spots Linda talking to Diane, he realises he has been found out. During his attempt at sleeping with Linda, Jim got a bee sting on the eye in the process, and the next day he has to oversee the election vote results, and when the ballot is totalled one of the students counting says that Tracy has won amazingly by just one vote, this being Paul's honest vote not for himself but for her. She sees the reaction from the counting student and knows that she has won, but Jim spots her doing this, and when it is his turn to count the ballots he deliberately deducts two papers from Tracy's vote, and Paul is named the winner. Paul is ecstatic and excited to become the new student body president with some ideas for events and stuff, while Tracy is extremely distraught after thinking that she was going to win but didn't, however this may change after the janitor discovered the two missing ballot papers. With the Principal and other teachers and election staff knowing his deception, Jim resigns from his job, he also gets divorced and humiliated, but he bounces back after leaving Nebraska for a new life in New York, with a smaller and expensive apartment, and working at the American Museum of Natural History as a tour guide. We also see that Tracy was accepted into Georgetown University, Paul went on to the University of Nebraska, Tammy stayed at her school with a new girlfriend, and Jim recounts the last time he see his nemesis Tracy, and he may have a new irritant in the form of an overeager little girl asking and answering questions in his tour. Also starring Phil Reeves as Walt Hendricks, Matt Malloy as Vice-Principal Ron Bell, Donnie Darko's Holmes Osborne as Dick Metzler and Jeanine Jackson as Jo Metzler. Broderick, who keep in mind famously played high school rascal Ferris Bueller, does a great job playing the teacher with his own ideas of morals and standards, Witherspoon is also inspired as the student who thinks she can get everything and anything, and Klein is a good giggle as the nice guy student going against her. This is not only a great near teen movie and high school movie, but it serves as a fantastic insight into how election campaigns (for anything) go down, we can relate to the situations seen here, such as the system of voting, how results can be altered, and how many times there is no point or good result to them, whether the voter gets what they want or not, a very insightful, very funny and highly watchable satirical comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Very good!

It was the early 70's, he had been deeply affected by Antonioni, and it was the time when the American narrative had turned bitter and paranoid, a tab of acid slowly dissolving in the public mind. The time was perfect for film noir and Pakula grasped this, since noir was a paranoid type of film for a new type of paranoid life in the big city.So even though we have come to know these films as 'conspiracy thrillers', that is only a noir offshoot, one of many. The basic idea is that we find ourselves caught in some inexplicable part of the world - aren't we all? - and begin to look for the mechanisms that move us and that world. Our insight, if we're fortunate to be at the hands of an adept filmmaker, is something that we'll be able to align around the life we know.Why do we act a part? Why do we keep looking? Who is casting reflections that we see around us? This is the exercise here. Our man is a private investigator looking for missing persons. He finds her, a talented actress who only allows herself to touch the world from inside an illusion she can manipulate. She controls sex, and that lets her anonymously penetrate others from the safety of fantasy. He enters the illusion eager, fresh in the big city and his first-time doing this, so everything is coated with danger and mysterious allure. New York has scarcely looked as elusive as we have here. She's been there all her life, is weary and looking for someone to wrestle that control and mask away. Meanwhile she has woven another illusion around her where she is victim with the world out to get her, this is another part that we'll have to discern whether or not it's an act.So one layer of the abstraction is that he comes to know that he's really looking for her. From her end, that she's the one gone missing. Our primary text here is not hardboiled noir but L'Avventura, the disappearance being only our premise for connection.It makes sense then that the actual investigation would seem aimless and frustrating. It's meant to be a little mundane as we snoop around, a part of routine. It's meant to involve us simply watching, looking to see will the world unveil itself. Unveil some part that is missing and throws the whole off balance. Remember the first part of Vertigo? We had to be the shadow for a while before anything could be outlined.The second layer involves a conversation caught on tape. It plays for the first time over the opening credits and missing bits are added over the course of the film that we didn't know were missing. We listen a bit earlier. We listen at the other side of the conversation. The twist, as we come to know it; our actress speaks of letting everything out in the open as the only means of achieving happiness. Of couse nothing is let out and everything is kept in. An ongoing conversation with a therapist played over intimate but wordless bits back home underscores this.So when these two layers are made to spin together, we have a delicate caress in the dark between souls. Butterfies in the stomach. The effort is for shedding the self that clings to the controls of life, desperate to steer somewhere. We let the other person have it, trusting he will set controls for the heart of our being. Isn't this what love is all about? I don't know of a more urgent and poignant depiction of love in the movies.There is another layer about political conspiracy half-heartedly woven throughout and most prominent at the last moment, but that is not the point here. It's nothing, and if we apply an investigative eye we'll be able to easily sweep off the picture. Watching here also reveals the actual context of the subsequent Parallax View, on the surface a film more alarmingly about shady powers controlling the plot.In both cases, the 'parallax' is our displacement from the status of observer into the place where observations are assembled into a view.

The accompanying caption read One hasn't got a heart; the other hasn't got a brain. Unfortunately, they appear to have forgotten that Dorothy had three companions, not two, and it was quickly suggested by both Conservative and Labour supporters that the SDP leader Roy Jenkins- a politician often accused by his opponents of lacking any convictions to have the courage of- must therefore be the Cowardly Lion.I mention this story because it shows how deeply this film has become a part of popular culture, so much so that a reference to it was readily understood by voters at an election more than forty years after it was made. If anything, the story is even more familiar today than it was in 1983, following repeated television showings (normally during the Christmas holidays) and the opening of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on it. In Britain at least, its fame has eclipsed that of the novel on which it is based. The story is so well-known that I won't try to summarise it here, except to say that, like Alice in Wonderland, it deals with the adventures of a young girl in a bizarre fantasy world.The film is not only well-known, it is also highly regarded; it frequently features in lists of the 100 Greatest Movies Ever Made. (Sometimes even the 10 Greatest Movies Ever Made). Certainly, it has its good points. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow, Jack Haley's Tin Man and Bert Lahr's camp Lion are all inspired comic creations, as is Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West, although several of her scenes were cut because the studio thought that they would frighten young children. There is some imaginative use of colour- the bright, vivid colours during the Oz scenes would doubtless seem unbearably hectic and strident in any realistic film, but in a film set in a fantasy world they fit in with the strange, dreamlike mood. The use of monochrome for the real world and colour for imaginary ones became something of a cliché in fantasy movies after this, although Michael Powell was to reverse this convention to brilliant effect in A Matter of Life and Death.The casting of the teenaged Judy Garland as Dorothy (supposedly a nine-year-old) made sense from a musical point of view, as she copes far better with the demands of the film's numerous songs than any child actress could have done, but children in the audience might have found it easier to identify with the character had she been played by someone closer to their own age. (Shirley Temple, six years younger than Garland, was at one time considered for the part). As an actor, as opposed to a singer, Garland's performance in this film is nothing special, but that may have more to do with the way her character is written. Dorothy is essentially a passive character who acts as straight woman to a series of comic ones. Some of the other acting contributions are not very good, particularly Billie Burke's rather wooden Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Given that Glinda is supposed to be young and beautiful, it seemed rather odd to cast an actress in her fifties in this particular role.The film was originally intended as a children's movie, although I don't think it works very well as one. This may have been the reason why it was a box office failure in 1939; its subsequent fame has been due to repeated broadcasts on television and its taking on the status of an adult cult. When we were taken to see it as children, my younger sister was terrified by the witch and I was bored, especially during those sepia-and-white scenes in Kansas. Some of the songs, such as Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead and We're Off to See the Wizard are jolly enough to appeal to children, but Over the Rainbow, sentimental corn-syrup in its purest form, has always struck me, both as a child and as an adult, as one of the most over-rated songs ever written.Most children's films from this period had to have an improving moral, and The Wizard of Oz has two. The first- that one must look inside oneself for qualities such as intelligence, kindliness and courage- is unexceptionable, but the other, There's no place like home, seems rather parochial, even un-American, given that America is a country of immigrants, most of whom moved to the New World precisely because they couldn't, for one reason or another, find their heart's desire in their original homelands.I must confess that I am not really a Friend of Dorothy. It is not that I hate the film, or even seriously dislike it. It is simply that, like another reviewer, I cannot understand why it is so often mentioned in the same breath as genuinely great films like Gone with the Wind, Casablanca or Citizen Kane. I am prepared to accept The Wizard of Oz as a colourful, imaginative and at times enjoyable piece of fantasy. I just can't see it as one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2012","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" During the British general election of 1983, the centrist Social Democratic Party mocked their political rivals by depicting Margaret Thatcher as the Tin Man and Labour leader Michael Foot as the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.

Ray Bolger's Scarecrow, Jack Haley's Tin Man and Bert Lahr's camp Lion are all inspired comic creations, as is Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West, although several of her scenes were cut because the studio thought that they would frighten young children. There is some imaginative use of colour- the bright, vivid colours during the Oz scenes would doubtless seem unbearably hectic and strident in any realistic film, but in a film set in a fantasy world they fit in with the strange, dreamlike mood. The use of monochrome for the real world and colour for imaginary ones became something of a cliché in fantasy movies after this, although Michael Powell was to reverse this convention to brilliant effect in A Matter of Life and Death.The casting of the teenaged Judy Garland as Dorothy (supposedly a nine-year-old) made sense from a musical point of view, as she copes far better with the demands of the film's numerous songs than any child actress could have done, but children in the audience might have found it easier to identify with the character had she been played by someone closer to their own age. (Shirley Temple, six years younger than Garland, was at one time considered for the part). As an actor, as opposed to a singer, Garland's performance in this film is nothing special, but that may have more to do with the way her character is written. Dorothy is essentially a passive character who acts as straight woman to a series of comic ones. Some of the other acting contributions are not very good, particularly Billie Burke's rather wooden Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Given that Glinda is supposed to be young and beautiful, it seemed rather odd to cast an actress in her fifties in this particular role.The film was originally intended as a children's movie, although I don't think it works very well as one. This may have been the reason why it was a box office failure in 1939; its subsequent fame has been due to repeated broadcasts on television and its taking on the status of an adult cult. When we were taken to see it as children, my younger sister was terrified by the witch and I was bored, especially during those sepia-and-white scenes in Kansas. Some of the songs, such as Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead and We're Off to See the Wizard are jolly enough to appeal to children, but Over the Rainbow, sentimental corn-syrup in its purest form, has always struck me, both as a child and as an adult, as one of the most over-rated songs ever written.Most children's films from this period had to have an improving moral, and The Wizard of Oz has two. The first- that one must look inside oneself for qualities such as intelligence, kindliness and courage- is unexceptionable, but the other, There's no place like home, seems rather parochial, even un-American, given that America is a country of immigrants, most of whom moved to the New World precisely because they couldn't, for one reason or another, find their heart's desire in their original homelands.I must confess that I am not really a Friend of Dorothy. It is not that I hate the film, or even seriously dislike it. It is simply that, like another reviewer, I cannot understand why it is so often mentioned in the same breath as genuinely great films like Gone with the Wind, Casablanca or Citizen Kane. I am prepared to accept The Wizard of Oz as a colourful, imaginative and at times enjoyable piece of fantasy.

The accompanying caption read One hasn't got a heart; the other hasn't got a brain. Unfortunately, they appear to have forgotten that Dorothy had three companions, not two, and it was quickly suggested by both Conservative and Labour supporters that the SDP leader Roy Jenkins- a politician often accused by his opponents of lacking any convictions to have the courage of- must therefore be the Cowardly Lion.I mention this story because it shows how deeply this film has become a part of popular culture, so much so that a reference to it was readily understood by voters at an election more than forty years after it was made. If anything, the story is even more familiar today than it was in 1983, following repeated television showings (normally during the Christmas holidays) and the opening of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on it. In Britain at least, its fame has eclipsed that of the novel on which it is based.

There since has been an American remake with the very famous George Clooney, although I find Tarkovsky's to be in a whole other league of films. Like many of his films, Solaris without ever saying to much, can really make you think and dive deep into the story. It is extremely easy to get lost into the story and I found myself many times trying to answer the questions that are brought up in this film.I have heard many describe Solaris as a close relative to Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey, but in the Criterion version of Solaris, Akira Kurosawa states that Tarkovsky found 2001 to be cold and sterile. Even though 2001 is a wonderful film, Solaris is filled with so much more human emotion, grief, love, hate, etc, where as for me, 2001 concentrated more on the hard science aspect of the film. I wonder if this could be the reason Tarkovsky wanted to make Solaris, because he wanted to do a science fiction film correct in his eyes? Regardless of why he did it, Tarkovsky himself ended up not enjoying it, and became his least favorite film to make.Much like Stalker (1979), this film is not filled with much hope. From the moment the film begins in the prologue, we see that our protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is upset and filled with grief. It seems as if his trip to the Solaris station is more of an escape rather than a mission for his work. Kris wanting to leave earth is the main reason why some of the scenes in the opening of the film might feel like they drag on, but that was done for a reason. It is Kris' final day on earth, and this could very possibly be his last. Tarkovsky was showing off nature to the viewers as if it was our last day here. He was wanting us to take in every leaf blown in the wind, every cloud in the sky, and even when Kris arrives at the Solaris station, the other Solaris' most missed possession is the wind.As the film progresses Kris begins to learn that the reason he was sent here is not so far fetched after all. The planet they are orbiting is known to harbor some sort of intelligent life, whether it be physical or just biological. The intelligent life somehow can understand what is in your deepest part of your conscious and actually reveal that to you. The intelligent life teaches us that the reason Kris is filled with so much grief is because the loss of his wife. So of course the second day that Kris is on the Solaris station, the intelligent life brings to him his wife. To some this may seem like a miracle, but as Kris slowly finds out, it is only going to bring him more grief. Kris' wife, Hari, still remembers everything, including her suicide. She wrestles with the idea that she is not the real Hari, but a duplicate created by Kris' imagination.Solaris has one of the most conflict filled love stories, and is told so well through the experiences that each of the characters go through while on the Solaris station. Kris has to constantly struggle whether to leave the station forever and never see Hari again, or to forever stay there and live with the phenomenon Hari, because the moment they live the orbit of that planet the scientific phenomenon vanishes. My favorite line from this movie, and one of my favorite quotes of all time is said by Dr. Snaut on the station when talking about what is actually going on in the planets space ocean.We don't know what to do with other worlds. We don't need other worlds. We need a mirror. We struggle to make contact, but we'll never achieve it. We are in a ridiculous predicament of man pursuing a goal that he fears and that he really does not need. Man needs man! Dr. Snaut is trying to tell Kris, that even though there is something mysterious and powerful going on in this planet, we do not need it. We were put here on earth to discover other humans, to get to know our fellow species better. We do not need clones of the ones we used to love to make us happy, that is why we have memories. Dr. Snaut is telling Kris to go back to earth, back to his family, and try and get to know new people, that is what will relieve Kris of his grief.For those who have not seen this film, you must. If films like 2001 bore you, than I guess watch the remake because it is a much shorter film, but there is a reason for that. It leaves out a lot of really great scenes between Kris and Hari, and from what I recall the ending is nowhere near the same. The ending to Tarkovsky's Solaris is one of my favorite endings, it stunned me the first time I saw it. I honestly don't think I have ever been disappointed by a Tarkovsky film, but Solaris is my favorite from him.

Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth.The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart.Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park.Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2012","score":"","review":" Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise.

Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth.The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple.

This in fact happened in 1494, with the Treaty of Tordesillas, mediated by the Vatican, in which Portugal and Spain, then world empires, agreed to split the newly discovered territories outside Europe along a line of longitude. This treaty gave Spain control of most of South America, with the exception of Brazil, which Portugal kept. Then in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, Spain agreed to give Portugal the territories west of Brazil, encompassing what is today the country's territory. With two world empires deciding the fate of colonies as if they were lifeless pieces on a chessboard, it's no surprise that a lot of people ended up suffering the consequences. The Mission is the movie about those people.The movie follows the lives of three people Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary who goes to live with the Guaraní tribes in the Amazonian jungles to convert them to Christianity but defends their right to self-rule; Rodrigo Mendonza (Robert DeNiro), a slave trader in search of redemption for the murder of his brother; and Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally), a Vatican envoy. He comes when Father Gabriel asks the Vatican to protect the Spanish missions established in the territories. These missions have prospered and are examples of Christian communities. Transferring them to Portuguese territories would destroy them, since under Portuguese law slavery was allowed and the Guaraní would serve as a cheap labour force. Altamirano, although humbled and marvelled by the achievements of the converted Guaraní, who have constructed churches capable of competing with their European cousins, is forced by duty to decide in favour of the Portuguese, in the name of the good relationships between the Vatican and the European powers. The film concludes with a dramatisation of the Guaraní War, in which the tribes resisted the invaders until joint Spanish-Portuguese forces crushed them in a bloody massacre.If for nothing else, I love this for having given Ennio Morricone the opportunity to compose the most beautiful film score in the history of cinema. Is it strange to admit I only saw this movie because of the score? The truth is, many movies I only watch to listen to their scores. As an avid film score collector, I listen to most scores well in advance of watching the movies. Every once in a while I listen to one that makes me think, Well, this is really great! Let's see how it works in context. Maybe the movie didn't butcher it too much. Well, the movie didn't butcher this one. Maybe the score is just too magnificent for that. In any case, the moment the first notes of Falls are heard, in tandem with the crushing sound of an Amazonian waterfall, it becomes obvious Roland Joffé understood how to put the score at the service of the story.This interest in the music isn't redundant. The Mission is a movie driven by sounds, music and images. It's not a traditional movie driven by plot or even characters, although I find the trio well developed, especially where their moral consciousnesses are concerned. Robert Bolt, the two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter of Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and A Man for all Seasons, wrote the screenplay, his final one. Bolt, a renowned playwright in his own right, at the age of 61, was still experimenting with his style. Sergio Leone-like minimalist dialogues is not something one associates with the poetic, fast-paced witty dialogues of Lawrence and Seasons, but Bolt managed to write a very visual screenplay, very different from his previous masterpieces, where actions define characters more than witty words.Consider for instance the character of Rodrigo Mendoza. Catching his brother with his wife, he kills him in a fit of rage. Then he delivers himself to the authorities. When Father Gabriel meets him in prison, he's a dejected, broken human being. Gabriel offers him the possibility of atonement, to work with him in the missions, where he can help those he once exploited. How does Rodrigo show his penance? Well, the easy way out would be for a tear-jerking speech full of wise, clichéd truths (and if someone could pull that off, that person would be Bolt). In the movie, however, Rodrigo travels with Gabriel back to the mission. It's a journey that takes weeks, through thick jungles, mountainous terrain, and up waterfalls. Rodrigo has tied around his waist a net containing his heavy armour, symbol of his former live. It's the burden he carries. It delays everyone, but he stubbornly pushes it after him. It falls, he goes back for it. And when he arrives, at the end of this unforgettable sequence, at the mission, an Indian cuts off the rope and throws it into a river. Then Rodrigo breaks down crying in a mixture of sadness, relief and joy his new life beginning.Wordless sequences such as this wouldn't be half as powerful, however, without seasoned director of photography Chris Menges helming the camera. For his work on the movie, he won an Oscar. He had previously won one for The Killing Fields.Back in the '80s, The Mission was part of a short-termed interest in South America the interference of the US government in the continent, reflected on its open support for dictatorships, was becoming more and more evident. However, whereas most movies, like Salvador and Under Fire, dealt with contemporary events, few tried to show the origins of these conflicts in their historical context as the results of centuries of European colonialism. Only The Mission and Alex Cox's Walker took a different path, exploring the past to better explain what was going on in the present.

Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life.I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive.Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.

While teens flock to the latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. But there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can say I've joined that rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see.There's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. You probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. But if you haven't, read on! There are better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40's. The film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he doesn't care for any of that he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny. At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop.There's a reason the Blu Ray box says Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP. His performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like the loving father who liked to touch her, the men who dressed up like ghosts and other such things the audience understands. And the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated.But Hanks isn't the only great the film is host to a group of great characters. There's Jenny, Forrest's childhood friend and love interest. Bubba, Forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education.There's a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'Nam, the hurricane, and the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm.A note to those who saw Zumeckis' first great film, Back to the Future. Do not expect more of that. 'Future' was a comedy with drama added, Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene. I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, Forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific such events as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in that fruit company make for some historically accurate humour, one of Gump's greatest strengths.One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question if he's smart. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn't see it at first. The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin' President JFK? The effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. I still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen.On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a tonic of the weary in spirit. That's the perfect description. Forrest Gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt.

It comes to the point when Steve finds the substantial evidence that proves Beechum is indeed innocent, because of missed witnesses or something, and he races to stop the execution as it is about to happen, and in the end thankfully he stopped it just in time.

It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence.The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the Cèsar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994.

It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence.The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993.Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece.

In other words, great and beautiful cinematography. When people first judge this movie they will probably see it as just your normal sports movie and in this case its golf. I am a golfer but you can absolutely hate golf and still enjoy this movie. Being a golfer really only helps with the technicalities of the sport, which the movie minimally shows. The movie is just one big metaphor for someone who is need of faith. In this movie that person is Junah, played by Matt Damon (whos performance is excellent), Junah was one of the highest praised upcoming golfers in the 1920s but after serving in WWI and becoming a war hero, he suffers from memories of battle and has lost his faith in just about anything from his old girlfriend, Adele, played by Charlize Theron (another great performance), his faith in talents, and especially his faith in life, which the movie centers on. Just when Junah's faith is nearly gone for good while horribly swing golf balls in his backyard, Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith, (greatest actor today and a legendary performance), comes out of nowhere, like an angel(WINK WINK) and immediately tries helping Junah. This movie is just one big metaphor of an angel who is disguised as a golf caddy and is uplifting the faith of a person in need. Golf is just the format or stage they use to translate this message in a different way. You know Bagger is an angel because he never receives nearly any of the rewards he should receive after all the help he has given Junah, his spiritually perfect advice (like an angels would be), and at the end there is a clear give away when Hardy(the little boy, the narrator, and the old man in the beginning and end of the film) dies from a heart attack on the golf course and wakes up in heaven(which is still the golf course he was playing on) to see Bagger waving to him in his ageless form. This is also showing that the movie suggest heaven isn't this big epic white scenery of clouds but instead a place that you are the most happy.

At the time the Vietnam War was still going on, Cambodia was a strategic territory for the American army and the country was full of journalists. The basis of the movie's story comes from the lives of two of them New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Dith Pran, Cambodian photojournalist and interpreter who coined the term Killing Fields. Written by Bruce Robinson based on their writings, the movie follows in fact two stories one is the fall of Phnom Penh, the capital, and the evacuation of the international embassies, as witnessed by Sydney and Pran, and Sydney's return to the USA; and the second, more radical narrative, shows the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as witnessed by Pran after he's captured and sent to work in a Killing Field, and his epic escape to freedom.From Phnom Penh Sydney and Pran report the events of the civil war between the government and the Khmer Rouge, with the revolutionaries clearly gaining control of the country. The international embassies start evacuating their personnel. Sydney and Pran opt to remain, although Pran sends his wife and family away. As the Khmer Rouge revolutionaries enter the city, they're initially received with joy and prospects of peace, everyone tired of the war. Even Pran joins the festivities. However the Khmer Rouge, split in different factions due to internal power struggles, continue to fight in the capital. Sydney and Pran find refuge in the French embassy, until it's also evacuated and all Cambodians hiding there are turned over to the revolutionaries.For the time, the movie was quite revolutionary in casting a non-amateur actor in the role of Dith Pran. They found Haing Somnang Ngor, a doctor living in the USA, to portray Pran. Like Pran, Ngor had also spent four years in the killing fields before escaping. He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1985 for this role. He played the role with naturalism and lightness, displaying a restraint in emotions in situations where an actor would typically go into melodramatic mode. The choice of Ngor is ahead of its time for another reason. Anglo-American movies tend to work on the logic that audiences can only care for the plight of foreign countries if the experiences are mediated through a character from their culture; that's why war correspondents are usually the main characters in such movies. Although now thanks to movies like Letters from Iwo Jima and Hotel Rwanda this is changing, casting a Cambodian actor to tell the story of a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge was audacious then.Sam Waterston also delivers a powerful performance as Sydney, an authoritarian boss who blames himself for having used Pran to further his career only to abandon him. Back in New York he starts an international campaign to find his friend, always wondering whether he's doing enough for him. The movie is also helped with performances from John Malkovich and Julian Sands as two other journalists, Craig T. Nelson as the US Army officer in charge of the American evacuation, and Spalding Gray as the morally-torn American Consul, wary of abandoning the country to the revolutionaries.The scenes in the Killing Fields still have, decades later and after graphic violence has become generalised, the power to affect because of how the movie shows the psychological roots of the crimes. It's not that the images are excessively violent, it's that the movie depicts a philosophy of inhumanity. Regimes don't just producer horror for its own sake, the violence is just a tool to implement ideas. Rather than just showing the horrors, the movie shows the philosophy which the violence was used to enforce the viewer is taken into the classrooms where children are being taught to hate the concept of family and any personal relationships that may threaten blind loyalty to the party; children are given power over life and death; intellectuals, teachers, journalists are executed for their skills; people are forbidden from growing crops, because that's a sign of free initiative, even though thousands are starving to death The movie confronts us with those ideas and we can't help but ask, How the hell did anyone ever think these ideas could work in a society? Not everything holds up as well in the movie. Many good scenes are ruined by Mike Oldfield's intrusive cacophony of synthesizer noises. Nowadays, when we listen to electronic scores with less patience than our ancestors did back in the '80s, a lot of this music sounds horrible. Oldfield, one of my favourite living musicians, is by no means an inept film composer, however half the score, when he turns to traditional orchestration, is majestic. Pran's Theme and its variations are appropriately elegiac, and Requim for a City, with its chorus of grieving voices, is a haunting attempt at showing through music the misery of the one million Cambodians forced by the Khmer Rouge to abandon the capital in a forced march to the countryside to work on the Killing Fields.Twenty-seven years later what the movie has to say about the darkness in the human soul, and the determination to overcome it, remains fresh.

From anger, to joy, to laughter, to happiness, to sympathy, to empathy, to tears, and to, finally, satisfaction as the final scene fades into credits. This is De Niro's directorial debut and he handles the challenge exquisitely. Complimented by Chazz Palminteri's slick and fearless writing that documents the struggles, the gangs, and the racism of the Bronx streets with no sugarcoating and no easy ways out.Adapted from its stage play counterpart, A Bronx Tale focuses on the famous area in New York where little nine year old Calogero (played by Francis Capra during his tender years) is growing up on the unapologetic streets with his bus driver father Lorenzo (De Niro) and his nervous mother. Lorenzo frequently warns Calogero that the saddest thing in life is a wasted talent, hoping that his son will take the path of untold success later in life.One day, while sitting idly on his stoop with his buddies, Calogero witnesses a murder. The murder was made by the area mafia boss Sonny (Palminteri). Him and his crew are respected, at the same time feared for their unpredictable actions and their checkered history. When called back to the scene by detectives looking for the murderer, young Calogero lies and refuses to confess. His father is subtly proud, but warns his son that he has just done a good thing for a bad person. The good news is their family won't be on the hit list. The bad news is their family is now on the suspicious list.Eight years later, Calogero, now played by Lillo Brancato Jr., is nicknamed C by Sonny and has become his main-man. His second son as well as his partner in crime. His father is somewhat oblivious to what his son has been up to recently, but he believes he can take care of himself, while still nudging him in the right direction.Sonny's philosophy is greatly different from Lorenzo's. It's nobody really cares. When the chips are down, who's there to care? Nobody. You're a worthless human. The brutally honest, shameless half of the glass. Sonny's philosophy sticks with Calogero, but he also keeps his father's in mind. Do the two connect? Maybe in some ambiguous, unorthodox way, but it just seems they are two contradicting ways of life. Here's a film that also shows us that if we're lucky, we get two different outlooks on life from two very different people. A man who works in a town and a man who owns it.De Niro was in a very rough position when it came time to grab a hold of the camera for this film. He could either take the easy way out and make a Goodfellas-style mobster flick or mimic his stellar character's lifestyle in Raging Bull. But he doesn't. He most likely was the go-to guy for help with the script and offered Palminteri advice, but in no way is this another mafia film. It's a unique kind of mafia film. It shows the long-lasting and life changing effects it has on a youth growing up on the wrong side of the streets.This greatly reminds me of a phenomenal film from the eighties that tackles the same sort of subject. The film was John Singleton's Boyz N The Hood, setting its sights on three troubled youths growing up in the hood and getting caught in the mix of crime, drugs, and racism. The film was Singleton's directorial debut as well, featured stellar performances from every actor in it, a genius script, and some fantastic honesty about the life of the hood. A Bronx Tale does the same, but centers its story around the mafia. Not glorifying the violence, not acting pretentious over other classics of the same genre, but taking a cliché and turning it into a gritty reality.What is important to learn from A Bronx Tale is that it's a movie with values. It believes that beliefs and values should be the first thing someone should consider when in a serious situation. Sometimes we don't think about the consequences and dive right into what we think will satisfy ourselves and turn out the way we want in no time. It too forms the question; is it better to be universally loved or feared? I'd rather be a little bit of both with a strong blend of respect.Starring Lillo Brancato, Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Robert De Niro, Taral Hicks, Francis Capra, Kathrine Narducci, Clem Caserta, and Joe Pesci.

It believes that beliefs and values should be the first thing someone should consider when in a serious situation. Sometimes we don't think about the consequences and dive right into what we think will satisfy ourselves and turn out the way we want in no time. It too forms the question; is it better to be universally loved or feared? I'd rather be a little bit of both with a strong blend of respect.Starring Lillo Brancato, Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Robert De Niro, Taral Hicks, Francis Capra, Kathrine Narducci, Clem Caserta, and Joe Pesci. Directed by Robert De Niro. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 January 2012","score":"","review":" A Bronx Tale successfully brings out every emotion your system can handle. From anger, to joy, to laughter, to happiness, to sympathy, to empathy, to tears, and to, finally, satisfaction as the final scene fades into credits. This is De Niro's directorial debut and he handles the challenge exquisitely. Complimented by Chazz Palminteri's slick and fearless writing that documents the struggles, the gangs, and the racism of the Bronx streets with no sugarcoating and no easy ways out.Adapted from its stage play counterpart, A Bronx Tale focuses on the famous area in New York where little nine year old Calogero (played by Francis Capra during his tender years) is growing up on the unapologetic streets with his bus driver father Lorenzo (De Niro) and his nervous mother. Lorenzo frequently warns Calogero that the saddest thing in life is a wasted talent, hoping that his son will take the path of untold success later in life.One day, while sitting idly on his stoop with his buddies, Calogero witnesses a murder. The murder was made by the area mafia boss Sonny (Palminteri). Him and his crew are respected, at the same time feared for their unpredictable actions and their checkered history. When called back to the scene by detectives looking for the murderer, young Calogero lies and refuses to confess. His father is subtly proud, but warns his son that he has just done a good thing for a bad person. The good news is their family won't be on the hit list. The bad news is their family is now on the suspicious list.Eight years later, Calogero, now played by Lillo Brancato Jr., is nicknamed C by Sonny and has become his main-man. His second son as well as his partner in crime. His father is somewhat oblivious to what his son has been up to recently, but he believes he can take care of himself, while still nudging him in the right direction.Sonny's philosophy is greatly different from Lorenzo's. It's nobody really cares. When the chips are down, who's there to care? Nobody. You're a worthless human. The brutally honest, shameless half of the glass. Sonny's philosophy sticks with Calogero, but he also keeps his father's in mind. Do the two connect? Maybe in some ambiguous, unorthodox way, but it just seems they are two contradicting ways of life. Here's a film that also shows us that if we're lucky, we get two different outlooks on life from two very different people. A man who works in a town and a man who owns it.De Niro was in a very rough position when it came time to grab a hold of the camera for this film. He could either take the easy way out and make a Goodfellas-style mobster flick or mimic his stellar character's lifestyle in Raging Bull. But he doesn't. He most likely was the go-to guy for help with the script and offered Palminteri advice, but in no way is this another mafia film. It's a unique kind of mafia film. It shows the long-lasting and life changing effects it has on a youth growing up on the wrong side of the streets.This greatly reminds me of a phenomenal film from the eighties that tackles the same sort of subject. The film was John Singleton's Boyz N The Hood, setting its sights on three troubled youths growing up in the hood and getting caught in the mix of crime, drugs, and racism. The film was Singleton's directorial debut as well, featured stellar performances from every actor in it, a genius script, and some fantastic honesty about the life of the hood. A Bronx Tale does the same, but centers its story around the mafia. Not glorifying the violence, not acting pretentious over other classics of the same genre, but taking a cliché and turning it into a gritty reality.What is important to learn from A Bronx Tale is that it's a movie with values.

This movie is no worse than Repo Man with Emilio Estevez that's considered a cult classic and has a much higher status. Regardless, I know what people think. Even my father and older brother laugh at me when I watch this movie, not because it's bad but because they say I burned them out on it when I was about 7 and they knew it line for line. Im 26 now, and this movie is still just as good! People tend to get too hung up or in-depth as to reasons why the machines become homicidal. Instead - just go with the flow and enjoy. Even though a reason is offered the first 20 seconds of the movie, people still want a logical explanation. King should be proud so many people love this movie and have such fond memories of it. Have you ever seen a lot of directorial debut efforts? Most come from director's that are fresh out of film school. Considering King jumped from author to director, he didn't do too bad at all - cocaine fueled duration or not.A group of people are stuck at a desolate truck stop, being held hostage by a mob of homicidal 18 wheelers that operate themselves and are thirsty for human blood. How can you not like the Green Goblin truck who is obviously the leader? It's not often you get to see semi's with trailers running over people at high speeds, steam rollers crushing kids, bulldozers, vending machines, electric knives, and more operating themselves in such a fun manner.Granted this isn't King's typical character driven, suspenseful plot - it's just plain fun. The cast is great. Emilio Estevez (after The Outsiders & Repo Man, before Wisdom), Pat Hingle (the asshole boss we all want to die with tons of one liners), & Yeardley Smith aka Lisa Simpson herself. The cast has a lot of inner turmoil, but in my opinion take a backseat to the machines who are the real stars.Regardless, this has been beaten to death in reviews and argued about, it all boils down to opinion, most say it's a guilty pleasure - I say it's a childhood gem that still holds up to this day!

The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo&#x9A; Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt, and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell, and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky, where he made extra money for his dirt-poor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed, into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business, the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways he meets Althea, an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life, and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser, less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse, Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However, while plenty of people are buying Hustler, there are also plenty of people who don't care for it, including Charles Keating, leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine, one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman, Flynt's lawyer, debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile, Flynt makes a fortune, loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper, embraces and than abandons Christianity, and eventually loses Althea, who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs.A brave, spectacularly entertaining -- and unexpectedly stirring -- account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue.But still,the movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But still,it is a good movie to watch.

Stand By Me touched me in a way that I have never been touched before. It was an iconic, moving, intelligent picture than gave all four of its characters a believable history and insane likability. Not to mention, everything was raw, realistic, funny, touching, and sincere. It seems The Goonies borrows a few of the characters from the film, like Chunk who is clearly a lot like Jerry O'Connell's Vern in Stand By Me, but it makes them a lot more relatable for the youngsters and a lot cleaner and brighter in their personalities.The film centers around many, many kids that nickname themselves The Goonies who live in the Goon Docks of Arizona. Because of a growing country club, the house they all live in is heading towards foreclosure. The gang, made up of an optimistic asthmatic, a chubby coward, a mouthy youth, an Asian inventor, an older brother, a cheerleader, and a geeky female adolescent, discovers a map in one of their friends attic which tells the story of One-Eyed Willy and his untold amounts of treasure. The crew sets out to find the map and have one last Goonie adventure before they are separated.One of the many problems with this adventure are The Goonies themselves are being hunted by the Fratelli family, a group of thieves that are looking to steal treasure. The mother, or the boss, of the group is played by Anne Ramsey, an amazing and underrated character actor. She plays one of the creepiest, most taunting villains I can remember from a kids movie.It may sound like the teens are a bunch of caricatures, waiting to evolve into something bigger, badder, and more film-sustainable. But the characters are draw to look like mannequins, when in reality, they are portrayed effectively by great child character actors like Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, and Corey Feldman. I think my favorite character was the lead, Mikey (Astin). His optimism reminded me of my own - as a young kid of course - and his overall cheery nature made him a very efficient protagonist.Obviously, the film is trying to mirror and duplicate the Indiana Jones for a younger, more pint-sized audience. It succeeds. There's enough wit, soul, and entertainment in the script and in the antics to keep fresh, while at the same time pay a thrilling homage. The sequences of peril are excellent, and the music always excites and compliments the scenes in true, Spielbergian style.The scene that has the best music is late in the film when the gang is sliding down a long water-slide that's not meant for sliding. It's complimented with exciting music, but also captures the innocence of doing something so bad then so good. It's difficult to explain, but you might realize it when you see it. Think of doing something bad, then doing something very fun, exciting, and somewhat dangerous. Like after you break something, you dart up the stairs jumping over obstacles and dodging everything like a stuntman.The Goonies is nothing but a fun, Spielberg adventure of epic proportions. This is also one of the coming of age films that furthers my sadness of the fact I have not had anywhere close to an adventure like this, nor have I had the loyal friends of this caliber. I believe that's because my life isn't a nostalgic eighties film.Starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and Anne Ramsey.
