Director Stanley Kubrick did a very good job directing this (the atmosphere was very creepy), and Jack Nicholson is excellent in his role. Shelley Duvall I find less good. She acts well, but screams too much, certainly near the end of the film. The music is very good and this movie contains some excellent cinematic shots.

However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi\/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.However, its still a damn entertaining film. There is a large ensemble cast of good actors, some in career best roles. Will Smith was really launched as a movie star by this film and he has some very funny lines. Jeff Goldblum actually looks nerdy-cool as a scientist who likes to play chess in the park. And Bill Pullman is the clean-cut American President who proclaims that July 4 will no longer be an American holiday, but a world holiday! The rest of the ensemble cast includes small but meaty roles for Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Vivica Fox. Harry Connick Jr. has a small part but blows it completely.The things that make ID4 watching is that something is always going on. There are plenty of one-liners and the one-dimensional character all have their peculiar personality traits and quirks. The action scenes are impressive and in fact this film has the largest number of miniatures ever built. That record will probably never be broken because digital technology is limiting the use of miniatures. If you can let your hair loose and just want to enjoy a light movie without letting the America is Great propaganda get to you, ID4 is for you.

This movie gave me many things to analyze where the plot was going, what the plot meant, what the characters were trying to express beneath what they were saying and doing. the thing that everybody should know when watching The Breakfast Club is that all of the students are from different cliques, so of course they don't know each other, trust each other, and have never spoken a word to each other. The best actor in this movie is probably Judd Nelson. Follows next are  Molly Ringwald, Anthony Micheal Hall, Emilio Estevez, Aly Sheedy. Nelson plays a bully who we then find out has a 'troubled life' that he never talks about until he gets detention with 4 other teenagers who, after getting stoned with them, he feels are the only people he can talk to, even though he has just met them. He first comes off as well, a jackass, but as the story unravels, and the feelings get heavier, you start to see the insecure, scared and unhappy abused child within. While watching, some may see that it is a story about a group of 5 high school students stuck in a detention together that get high together and spill their guts. I did not see this side of the movie. I noticed that every single child in there seemed like a rec-loose, a criminal, a spoiled brat, or a nerd, (very different things), but they all had one very important thing in common they hated their parents. That is the heart of the story; that the children do not want to end up like their parents, a problem that every person deals with at some time or another. It's inevitable, becoming like you're parents, which comes to the sad side. Not all parents are abusers, some ignore their child, the other's push them, and then they last pair of parents spoil their kid while being spoiled and pushed to do your best may seem great, it scares the child, no matter how old. The movie ends with a kiss, and you turn off the television and think to yourself wow.

Unfortunately the owner of Quitter's Inc. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) has some rather radical methods to help his clients, he warns Richard that if he dares light up again his wife & young daughter will suffer...The cat then finds himself in the middle of a macabre bet, millionaire businessman Cressner (Kenneth McMillan) discovers ex-tennis star Johnny Norris (Robert Hays) is having an affair with his wife so he kidnaps Johnny & says if he can walk around the thin ledge around his penthouse apartment he can have his wife...A young girl named Amanda (Drew Barrymore) befriends the cat & persuades her mom & dad to let her keep it, however there is something in Amanda's bedroom that isn't very nice...Directed by Lewis Teague I thought Cat's Eye was a decent little horror anthology. The script was written by Stephen King & he turns in three effective tales although the connecting segments with the cat aren't great & there's no real connection between the stories & the reappearing ghost of Drew Barrymore is never explained to any real satisfaction. The first story 'Quitter's Inc.', which was based on a short story by King in his Night Shift collection, is the second best tale & goes for dark humour more than horror although the only down side to this story is the weak ending after a good build up. The second story 'The Ledge' is again based on a story by King this time in Penthouse & is easily the best segment, there's something very watchable about this story & again it has a dark sense of humour to it, it's the best flowing story & it has that crucial twist end to round the things off nicely. The third & final story 'The General' is the one original story not based on any other work & is easily the worst of the three tales, I didn't think much of the story which is dull & a bit predictable, nothing is explained that well & as a whole I just didn't like it. So in conclusion there's a couple of good stories & one bad one, generally speaking I liked it but I've always liked these horror anthology films.Director Teague does OK, the second story 'The Ledge' has a great atmosphere & some decent tension as well, 'Quitter's Inc.' is pretty dark & funny while 'The General' has a great battle between a Goblin & a cat complete with a cool over-sized set & nice special effects. The film lacks any real gore except for a quick flash of a decapitated head. There are also plenty of cool references to other works by King to spot, during the opening credits the cat is chased by a big slobbering St. Bernard dog straight out of Cujo (1983) another King adapted film directed by Teague, a car has a Christine (1983) sticker on it which again is a horror film adapted from a novel by King, a clip from The Dead Zone (1983) is shown which was also based on a book by King, there is a scene where a character is reading the book Pet Semetary written by King & I'm sure there are a few more in here as well.With a supposed budget of $7,000,000 Cat's Eye sounds like a well funded film, it's well made with good special effects & nice production values. The acting was good, I liked James Woods in the first story in particular.Cat's Eye isn't the best horror anthology out there but it's far from the worst & I liked it if just for the first two stories, I think it's well worth a watch for those who like some humour with their horror.

In Texas, they find work at the harvest on a wheat ranch and when the rich but dying farmer expresses his love for the woman, the man encourages her to respond to him. When the two are married and the farmer invites them all to live with him, inevitable resentment and jealousy surface ...Although they've made a lot of westerns and costume-dramas, the Americans don't make many films about their own history which feel real and authentic - the style is often deliberately overdone (as in Jezebel or Gone With The Wind) and there are only a few movies where the filmmakers really try to capture the period (say, The Grapes Of Wrath or Matewan). Days Of Heaven is the best example I've seen of this latter style and an astonishingly unique and haunting film. The simple story is really just a framework with which Malick paints extraordinary landscapes and evocative themes - in every sense this is a timeless picture. If ever there was a showcase of how to photograph a film well, this is it; director of photography Nestor Almendros - with additional shooting by Haskell Wexler (the Chicago scenes) - creates astonishing images of the endless wheatfields and the lonely farmhouse, with incredible use of available light and colour and no diffusion filters or staged lighting. Uniquely, the filmmakers deliberately did not shoot during the normal day, but filmed mainly during the dusk magic-hour, which results in an amazing ghostly ambient feel to the visuals (for more on this, see the excellent American Film Institute documentary Visions Of Light). The long locust invasion \/ forest fire sequence is one of the most intense and incredible set-pieces ever put on film and my mind boggles as to how they pulled it off (nowadays of course it would all be done with computer opticals). This is one of very few movies where you can literally take any still at all and the lighting, framing and composition are just breathtaking. I'll admit I'm a photography junkie - to me, movies are about images - but if you've never really thought about how a movie is physically shot before, please watch this amazing picture. The other outstanding element of the film is the music; it is bookended by Camille Saint-Saens spine-tingling Aquarium theme from his Le Carnaval Des Animaux, but the rest is awash in a fabulous string\/woodwind score by the great Ennio Morricone, one of his very best.

After making this fabulous movie, writer-director Malick took a twenty-year break from cinema and moved to France to teach.

When the two are married and the farmer invites them all to live with him, inevitable resentment and jealousy surface ...Although they've made a lot of westerns and costume-dramas, the Americans don't make many films about their own history which feel real and authentic - the style is often deliberately overdone (as in Jezebel or Gone With The Wind) and there are only a few movies where the filmmakers really try to capture the period (say, The Grapes Of Wrath or Matewan). Days Of Heaven is the best example I've seen of this latter style and an astonishingly unique and haunting film. The simple story is really just a framework with which Malick paints extraordinary landscapes and evocative themes - in every sense this is a timeless picture. If ever there was a showcase of how to photograph a film well, this is it; director of photography Nestor Almendros - with additional shooting by Haskell Wexler (the Chicago scenes) - creates astonishing images of the endless wheatfields and the lonely farmhouse, with incredible use of available light and colour and no diffusion filters or staged lighting. Uniquely, the filmmakers deliberately did not shoot during the normal day, but filmed mainly during the dusk magic-hour, which results in an amazing ghostly ambient feel to the visuals (for more on this, see the excellent American Film Institute documentary Visions Of Light). The long locust invasion \/ forest fire sequence is one of the most intense and incredible set-pieces ever put on film and my mind boggles as to how they pulled it off (nowadays of course it would all be done with computer opticals). This is one of very few movies where you can literally take any still at all and the lighting, framing and composition are just breathtaking.

But let me explain how this film got a high and an above average 7 out of ten.This is what I felt for the first say, 1hour 45 minutes. I felt this movie was one of the most thrilling, exciting, sad, brilliant movies of the decade. And I don't throw compliments like that around often. Hayley Joel Osmont played a stunning, captivating role that is Oscar worthy and Jude Law did a mighty fine job also. In fact, the acting all round was quite impressive. Visually, well, it was flawless. The directing, the lighting, the special effects, the robots, all perfect, the music was moving and atmospheric and intertwined with the movies disturbing and oddball theme and it never failed to offer heart-wrenching moments and tense, unnerving scenes. The movie went along at a fast enough pace, jumping quickly from one section to another perfectly and hit all the right emotions that made you actually feel for the robots. Very symbolic in places, especially the FLESH FAIR which was a direct hint towards the holocaust. The future was predicted well, quite possible in fact and it wasn't too ridiculous to be imaginable. The settings, scenery and ambiance was just advanced enough to have a futuristic tone, but restricted enough to be possible. In a nutshell, this film is pretty hard to criticize. Well, this is what I thought, until after the scene that changed everything.*spoiler warning* I remember the start of the movie had an introductory narrative, explaining the worlds conditions and such and how the story would begin. Much, much later in the movie the voice returned, whilst David is submerged under water and pleading with blue fairy statue to make him a real boy. The voice returned in a fashion that the movie would end. The voice explains how David kept pleading and how did so for over 2000 years. At this point I thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorites, the perfect ending to the movie and a really moving and exceptionally thought provoking ending to AI. But no, Spielberg had to give us more. And a really awful ending entails.In short, it shows David breaking out of the ice 2000 years later and meeting up with a group of badly designed, unimaginative aliens that would let him see his mother for one more day. At this point, all the humans have become extinct and therefore, of course, his mother has died. But somehow these aliens manage to use bits of people to recreate the humans perfectly for one more day. An over-sentimental, over-emotional and a particularly Disney scene follows, that is dragged out, embarrassing, out of context with the rest of the movie, sickeningly happy and downright awful. This movie was always disturbing and off-the-wall and this ending is just a complete contrast that just does not fit. It literally ruined a movie that had the full potential to be a classic, yet the last 15 minutes, Spielberg did a fairy-tale ending on it and ruined it. I can't explain how utterly crap it is and I actually felt angry and depressed that something as simple as a conclusion can ruin a spectacular experience. A dark ending to a dark movie was the way to go, was the way to create a masterpiece, but Stephen Spielberg obviously had his way and destroyed.I strongly urge people to watch this movie, but I also strongly suggest you stop it after the second narrative kicks in. Until then, I would've given it a perfect 10 out of ten, but nothing denies that Spielberg made a fatal mistake.What a pity.

Glenn Gould was a Canadian concert pianist. When he was thirty-two he announced he would no longer perform live concerts. Instead he would record and broadcast only, as he saw the performance hall as an elitist and obsolete means of presenting music. He was the first noted classical performer to abandon formal performance attire, something radical at the time, opting for a business suit rather the traditional black tie and tails. But his ideas extended beyond performance sites and attire to the very nature of art, challenging the hierarchical distinction between artist and audience. He wanted creative listening as well as creative performing. And like many geniuses he was full of peculiarities and paradoxes.He would usually grant interviews only over the phone, and as Yehudi Menuhin said, created his own life and led it to the exclusion of the rest of the world, doing nothing but applying himself to his physical and intellectual work. He was a perfectionist in his recording and his music, yet would hum as he played and record with little regard for things like a squeaky chair or pianos with noisy works. He was a man who cherished solitude, but would talk for hours on the phone and is remembered as a kind and compassionate man. He disdained violence and competition. As a child he serenaded cows in a pasture; upon his death he left half his estate to the SPCA, the other half to the Salvation Army.One of the many things this movie does well is to integrate actors portraying people, incidents and possibilities with real people speaking their own thoughts. A piano tuner, a chambermaid, an agent, cousin Jessie Norman and others talk about Glenn Gould. In one segment we see the depiction of the final moments before his last concert. Immediately following, Yehudi Menuhin speaks insightfully about Gould's reasoning behind discontinuing public concerts and elaborates on Gould's mindset. Menuhin's appearance makes the previous dramatization seem as real as cinema verité.A Sociologist recalled being interviewed on the Canadian radio system by Glenn Gould. It was a very penetrating interview, the most intelligent questions I think I've heard about the North, from experts, laymen, or anything else ... questions that required rather long answers and as I would start to speak or make a point, he would register his feelings not by voice, but by a smile ... All the time he was using his hands and conducting. And this was perhaps slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts, because I had no idea what this was all about. He was continuously waving his hands, sort of as if to bring up this idea or so on ... I was his orchestra for that hour. And throughout the 32 Films, we see that conducting the sound in his world is no affectation, but an indication of how deeply attentive Gould's perceptions and musical sensibilities run.In Truck Stop we witness Glenn Gould listening in on ambient conversations at the diner, subtly and almost surreptitiously moving a forefinger in concert with a conversation as it swells, subsides and blends with the other conversations and sounds throughout the highway restaurant. Such is just one example of the film's subtle yet magnificently effective structure, linking several of the short films, in this case by displaying Glenn Gould's compulsion to conduct sound, whether while listening to an interviewee, a Beethoven sonata, or to the conversations at a truck stop.Glenn Gould seemed to focus on sound as intently as a Zen monk would attend to his breath during meditating. As a child he listened voraciously to the radio. As an adult he played the radio even while he slept; in fact he could not sleep without the radio turned on. He was always listening. We know that sound conveyed extra meaning to Glenn Gould. After watching this movie it seems to me that he heard so much, he was compelled to organize it into music at least in part because he could not ignore it. He seemed to hear no sound in isolation. I have to believe he could hear no silence.One of Gould's driving passions was solitude. He considered it to be a necessary element in the human equation and an important condition for nurturing the creative process. He linked the idea of solitude with the far North and explored it in an innovative radio format, a sound documentary, called, The Idea of North. In the movie, the short film The Idea of North immediately follows Truck Stop, showing us some of the inspirational link to the radio production. As in Truck Stop, we first hear a single voice talking, which is then joined by other voices that mingle and intertwine as musically as a string quintet of voices.This movie may not change your life, but it made me more elated and optimistic about the world than any movie I can remember. It woke up some of my curiosities and gave me a renewed shot of vitality. It made me think about how a person can use his capabilities and ingenuity to a creative purpose and how much better we all are for it. It reminded me that solitude need not be dark and lonely but can be fodder for the joy of creative imagination; that we need not have the artistic genius of a Glenn Gould to justify our efforts, nor a Bach cantata every Sunday morning to hear music. We have our own eyes and ears to use and our own curiosity to explore. Many drops make an ocean, and as Shakespeare said, Sweet are the uses of adversity.

Menuhin's appearance makes the previous dramatization seem as real as cinema verité.A Sociologist recalled being interviewed on the Canadian radio system by Glenn Gould. It was a very penetrating interview, the most intelligent questions I think I've heard about the North, from experts, laymen, or anything else ... questions that required rather long answers and as I would start to speak or make a point, he would register his feelings not by voice, but by a smile ... All the time he was using his hands and conducting. And this was perhaps slightly off-putting when you're trying to think deep thoughts, because I had no idea what this was all about. He was continuously waving his hands, sort of as if to bring up this idea or so on ... I was his orchestra for that hour. And throughout the 32 Films, we see that conducting the sound in his world is no affectation, but an indication of how deeply attentive Gould's perceptions and musical sensibilities run.In Truck Stop we witness Glenn Gould listening in on ambient conversations at the diner, subtly and almost surreptitiously moving a forefinger in concert with a conversation as it swells, subsides and blends with the other conversations and sounds throughout the highway restaurant. Such is just one example of the film's subtle yet magnificently effective structure, linking several of the short films, in this case by displaying Glenn Gould's compulsion to conduct sound, whether while listening to an interviewee, a Beethoven sonata, or to the conversations at a truck stop.Glenn Gould seemed to focus on sound as intently as a Zen monk would attend to his breath during meditating. As a child he listened voraciously to the radio. As an adult he played the radio even while he slept; in fact he could not sleep without the radio turned on. He was always listening. We know that sound conveyed extra meaning to Glenn Gould. After watching this movie it seems to me that he heard so much, he was compelled to organize it into music at least in part because he could not ignore it. He seemed to hear no sound in isolation. I have to believe he could hear no silence.One of Gould's driving passions was solitude. He considered it to be a necessary element in the human equation and an important condition for nurturing the creative process. He linked the idea of solitude with the far North and explored it in an innovative radio format, a sound documentary, called, The Idea of North. In the movie, the short film The Idea of North immediately follows Truck Stop, showing us some of the inspirational link to the radio production. As in Truck Stop, we first hear a single voice talking, which is then joined by other voices that mingle and intertwine as musically as a string quintet of voices.This movie may not change your life, but it made me more elated and optimistic about the world than any movie I can remember. It woke up some of my curiosities and gave me a renewed shot of vitality. It made me think about how a person can use his capabilities and ingenuity to a creative purpose and how much better we all are for it. It reminded me that solitude need not be dark and lonely but can be fodder for the joy of creative imagination; that we need not have the artistic genius of a Glenn Gould to justify our efforts, nor a Bach cantata every Sunday morning to hear music. We have our own eyes and ears to use and our own curiosity to explore. Many drops make an ocean, and as Shakespeare said, Sweet are the uses of adversity.

It might not sound like the most entertaining movie to watch, but for me its very enjoyable. It has lots and lots of talk, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, but its also a refreshing change from so many movies which bang you over the head with loudness, violence and graphic sex. And many of its characters are very likable. People like me whose idea of a good time includes an evening with friends playing board games would feel a close kinship with the kids portrayed here.One of Whit Stillman's many strengths is that he goes against today's Hollywood stereotype of showing all rich people as evil, idiotic or guilt-ridden. From what I've read about him, he is very familiar with the world of the American wealthy, and so he knows what he's talking about. More importantly, he's also very good at showing human nature in general. In his movies, people with lots of money include nice people and jerks, and that's how it is, of course, in all classes of people.One funny segment shows the big hurdles that the characters Tom and Charley have to overcome when they try to drive from Manhattan to Long Island--most of us wouldn't have as much trouble, but because of Tom and Charley's privileged background they don't have an easy time of it. Yet Stillman doesn't belittle them or turn them into caricatures. They come across as fully human and people with whom we can empathize.Stillman also includes moral messages in his movies, but thankfully they are unlike the heavy-handed, politically-correct and dreary messages in so many other movies. I don't know if he is a Christian or not, but he shows subtle respect in all three movies for Christian values, which has been a rarity during the past few decades in Hollywood. I doubt, though, whether Pat Robertson would be likely to recommend his films, as they show a wide variety of human virtues and vices without simple black-and-white messages.In addition to a sort of mini-epic storyline involving Tom, Charley and Audrey, there are several little entertaining side-shows throughout the movie, often consisting of get-togethers amongst a circle of friends. The slightly eccentric character of Nick is especially funny and appealing throughout, and helps tie things together. Charley, Tom and Audrey are good portrayals of nice, bright but awkward adolescents, and although they move in rich Manhattan circles, they go through much of the teenage angst that other less fortunate kids experience, and they serve as sort of Everyman characters.Metropolitan isn't as polished as Stillman's other two excellent movies, Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco, but its my favorite of the three because of its characters. There is humor throughout, and lots of poignancy.

And it doesn't overstay it's welcome at a short hour-and-a- half.There are some stunning action scenes with cars hitting people, cars hitting cars and a long, wild car chase through a parade in San Francisco's Chinatown.My only complaint is the normal Liberal in-your-face bias that Hollywood always seems to show. They just can't help giving you their pro-Democrat, anti- Catholic, anti-authority bias. Early scenes provide some cheap shots on Nixon and Reagan and later we see the film's two male starts talking irreverently in church. The governor is a sleaze in the story and the cops are corrupt. I've just come to except these modern-day film clichés and not let it interfere with my enjoyment of the film.Speaking of actors and characters, David Caruso and Chazz Palminteri are the two male leads I referred to in the previous paragraph. They are both good. Why Caruso didn't make it in the movies must have been due to the roles he took, not his acting. Linda Fiorentino does what she does best - plays a whore. There isn't a moral person in here, at least with the lead actors. That's no surprise since sleaze king Joe Eszterhas wrote the script. Nonetheless, those three actors are very good with Caruso, as the cop, the best. It's a crude story at times (there was a NC-version available of this, as well), but it's very interesting start-to-finish, has some memorable scenes, nice San Francisco scenery and a nice soundtrack from Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt.

They are both good. Why Caruso didn't make it in the movies must have been due to the roles he took, not his acting. Linda Fiorentino does what she does best - plays a whore. There isn't a moral person in here, at least with the lead actors. That's no surprise since sleaze king Joe Eszterhas wrote the script. Nonetheless, those three actors are very good with Caruso, as the cop, the best. It's a crude story at times (there was a NC-version available of this, as well), but it's very interesting start-to-finish, has some memorable scenes, nice San Francisco scenery and a nice soundtrack from Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt.

I have found it fascinating the three times I've watched it and look forward to seeing it again. It surprises me each time, being better than I remembered. It's nicely photographed, too. Why I can't get a widescreen DVD of this, I don't know, but all that seems to be available is full screen.William Friedkin directed this which usually means (1) a riveting story; (2) stylish cinematography. That's the case here. I rate this movie so high mainly because it's so entertaining. And it doesn't overstay it's welcome at a short hour-and-a- half.There are some stunning action scenes with cars hitting people, cars hitting cars and a long, wild car chase through a parade in San Francisco's Chinatown.My only complaint is the normal Liberal in-your-face bias that Hollywood always seems to show. They just can't help giving you their pro-Democrat, anti- Catholic, anti-authority bias.

The whole series is great. The first time I was about to watch Scream 3, I thought it was going to be bad. Turns out, very good for a third slasher flick ending the trilogy. I thought it was going to be terrible, just awful, boy was I wrong! Usually the third movie in a series is just plain bad, but this is pretty good. Not very scary, but still entertaining. Even if it's the worst one in the series it is still fairly average. Some parts are really dumb, and this one even has some comedy in it, but a slasher flick can definitely have some humor in it. No damage done. I knew it was going to be the worst one, but I didn't think it would be even average. It was a little above average to me.

I read the beginning credits that it was the restored version as Orson Welles had intended it, remembered the reputation of Welles as a Director (say it with me, Rosebud) and the opening scene enthralled me. This is what movie making was supposed to be! But suddenly, horribly, it degraded terribly. Charlton Heston playing a confused Mexican who lapses in and out of bad English and ignorance of all things American one minute and being a savvy lawyer the next, sworn to protect his wife yet leaving her alone in a strange land he knows she's terrified of, with no idea of where she is, Janet Leigh who is constantly in peril allowing herself to be put in more and more jeopardy when she is supposed to be terrified...(Seeing her in a sweater in profiles in all her black and white glory was the only...pardon me for saying it...high point...of the film.) Just strange plot holes all over the place large enough for Orson Welles to fall into. (And it's to his credit that Welles allows himself to be filmed looking, as apparently he was made up to look, so bad.) Nice surprises here and there, as in cameo appearances. But overall, I think you'll be disappointed as I was at what seems to be on a par to those awful spaghetti westerns and dubbed Hercules movies of the 50s. Keep your spaghetti on your plate and avoid the bad taste here.

From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? Well, Moon Over Parador does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. It just goes to show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing.

They stop at a highway rest stop for gas and when Saskia goes to get some drinks... she never returns. This leads Rex to literally bury himself in an obsessive search to find out what happened to Saskia. Then one day he is contacted by a man who claims to be responsible for her disappearance.Like many movies produced outside of Hollywood this is a thriller that almost wholly abandons sensationalism. There is almost no violence, save for one fight scene. The depiction of obsession is very down to earth - no alcoholism, bizarre hallucinations - and surprisingly the cinematography is also not very thriller-esque for lack of a better word. There are nicely lit sunny days and restrained thriller music, yet the tension remains due to the good performances. For instance, the depiction of the sociopath is one of the most chilling due its overt harmlessness. Hollywood tends to straight out vilify the bad guys with messy appearances, bad childhoods, and so on. But this film shows the bad guy as a mild-mannered family man who works as a chemistry teacher and certain events in his life, shown through flashback, led him to become curious about several things, namely murder.With the overall normal and everyday look and feel to the film, many people will be able to relate to the settings, but after watching this film you'll definitely think about just what could happen from stopping at a service station or sitting in a café. It's down to Earth, but in the end, creepy like few other movie's on the shelf next to it. 9\/10Not rated, but contains mature themes.
