Jay and Silent Bob rule in this film... 3rd fav Kevin Smith film, just behind Chasing Amy and Dogma.. Plus, it has Eliza Dushka.. and if she isn't reason enough, I don't know what is..It's one of those films you just got to loosen up and have fun with, because clearly the cast is having a blast. The dialogue has several self made 'classic' lines that are delivered to perfection, Will Ferill, who I'd only seen in Austin Powers, I finally see the appeal of his humour in the way he brings it to the screen.. More cameos than you can shake a boot at, and even more people that wanted 'in' but never got that chance... maybe next time.. Smith seems to be a cool director to work for, and I hope some day I'll get the chance.DVD If the film and commentary weren't enough, it's got tons of extra features including deleted\/extended scenes, each with introductions.. couple music videos (though I'm not particular to the kicking ass song.. it was appropriate for the end of the film.. the other video, however has a hilarious song..).. still gallery\/story boards\/and the numerous designs for the Jay and Silent Bob poster (I could have sworn there were like 20+).. Also, bios on the cast and crew, and an article about Morris Day and the Time...

But ask ten people what they think is going on in Mulholland Drive and you'll likely get ten different answers.  I don't necessarily want the plot outcome handed to me on a silver platter, but neither do I want to walk away wondering if there even was a plot at all.I suppose, if you're a Lynch fan, nothing I am going to say will stop you from seeing it.

When Sullivan's son, Mike, hides in Sullivan's car to find out what he actually does for Rooney he finds that his father is a hired gun, a gangster if you will.  Mike sees his father and Rooney's son Connor kill three men.  Connor begins to suspect that Mike could tell someone and thus expose that Connor is stealing his father's money and goes to kill the family.  His attempt on Mike and Sullivan fails but his wife and other son are dead.  Sullivan and his son take to the road, with Sullivan's desire for his son's safety only slightly behind his desire for revenge on Connor.I have a problem with modern films.  No.  I have a problem with how modern films are hyped.  Can't anything just be good anymore?  It seems everything either has to be rubbish or a masterpiece.  Look how many films jump straight into high positions in the imdb 250 list to see what I mean.  But on top of that films are advertised as being amazing etc rather than slightly more subdued messages.Here we have the `best gangster film ever made' and  `better than the Godfather'. Neither of these statements are true but that's not to say that it is rubbish.  It's a good, often wonderful film that is as good in some ways as it is poor in others.  I was lucky to approach it with not having read reviews and mostly managing to miss the `epic' trailers that are everywhere &#150; and I was the better for it, with no expectation then you can't be let down!The plot is a little predictable in how it develops and where it ends, but it's still enjoyable.  The weakness of it however is the use (or misuse) or the parental theme.  Where was it?  The foundations were laid with Sullivan and his son, Rooney with his son and a father\/son thing between Sullivan and Rooney.  But what was done with it?  Very little &#150; apart from some minor bonding between the two Michaels.  It felt like there was more there that either wasn't or didn't come out.  The story felt heavy at points too, the relationship between the two Michaels didn't flow and there were too many scenes which felt ponderous.  I didn't want more action but I wanted it tighter or at least with a bit more soul behind the dialogue and the characters.The cast is like a heavy weight boxer and therefore I did expect it to hit harder.  To be blunt &#150; Hanks is not right for this role.  A lot was made out of him being a `bad guy' but was he really playing a bad guy?  He tries hard to not overplay it and lose the audience but I felt the film was trying to give him as much moral leeway as possible.  The majority of his killings are in the name of revenge which, in film morals, is fine.  The only killing before the death of his family we don't see him do, and we have him say `we're just going to talk?' before hand and then shout at his partner for putting him in a killing situation.  Compare this to Leon (aka The Professional) &#150; he is cold and ruthless and we love him more for his emotional growth and love.  Here Hanks only really shines when being friendly or in the rare comedy moments.  I felt he laced the ability, the desire or maybe the audience acceptance to be able to play `bad' and take his character beyond it into a development.Newman is good in a few scenes but isn't working too hard for his money.  His role is good but it's at his tiredest when he does well.  Law is excellent despite his cartoon villain character &#150; he is best in his early scenes and his first meeting with Sullivan is good.  Tucci is good and Leigh is good for all she has to do.  Craig is good value and is very well cast.  Hoechlin is very good and deserves the Oscar nomination that he will no doubt get for supporting actor.  But none of these were the powerhouse performances I had hoped for with such a top class cast available.The star of the film is Mendes himself.  People were surprised by how well he directed in his debut and if he got an Oscar for that then he simply must have one for this.  Ignoring the weaknesses in plot, pacing and some of the performances, visually this is stunning.  Normal shots from cars and of snow are really well set up and shot, while the tour de force is a shoot out in the silence, in the rain where the camera's focus is on one man's resignation and almost ignores the carnage all around.  The clichés of the plot and the slight ponderous feel of the beast may distract but I found myself admiring the shots and noticing the imagination Mendes showed in his direction.  There are so many well directed or clever scenes in this that I almost forgot that this was not the norm for films.Overall it isn't rubbish and it isn't the best gangster film ever made&#153;.  Instead it is a good film about parental relationships and revenge that doesn't really address either.  Instead it feels sluggish at times and could have had more spark from a talented and deep cast. But Mendes makes everything feel and look clever and makes the film better.  `A really good multiplex experience despite the failings' &#150; put that one your poster!

This is not an ACTION film!!!!  There is very little 'action' in the literal sense and you should not go into the theatre expecting it, or you will be disappointed.  Many people complain that the film doesn't have as much action or violence as they expected, when the problem was that they were expecting any at all.  I would even go so far as to object to the 'thriller' label... much of the movie is not 'thrilling' but rather suspenseful and sad.There are 3 emotions on prominent display here, and Williams portrays them both very well loneliness, sadness and anger. Throughout the course of the movie we watch Sy progress through these three states, and it is such a natural progression that it alone is what makes the film stand out.  Williams does an EXCEPTIONAL job in this role, which is fortunate because he gets most of the screen time.  People who didn't like his performance I think misread the role.  He does not (nor is he supposed to) have a crazy serial killer personality.  He is a repressed man - that is the reason for his sometimes stifled actions and emotions. I could picture myself in his shoes easily, and I didn't find myself yelling 'No don't do that you idiot!' at the screen as I am often known to do.  Audience members are able to closely identify with his emotions and that is what creates the suspense - because you know what you might think of doing if you were him - and these possibilities are unpleasant.  When you see Sy begin to act these things out it is really uncomfortable.A few more brief things I should mention..  the ending is NOT anti-climatic, when you consider the rest of the film and the character. The photography is quite good (no pun intended), and the music fits very well (sorry, didn't see the similarity to American Beauty...).

The screenplay was definitely written by amateurs, packing as much melodrama into the storyline as possible.  First we introduce the character of Jada Pinkett's brother.  She's like a mother figure to him, since their parents are dead.  He's a nice guy, gets into a fight with his sister and flees the house.  It's no surprise when he turns out dead two scenes later.  Then Kimberly Elise's child accidentally swallows some household substances and the custody of the kid is handed over to child services.  We have Vivica A. Fox who got fired from her job at the bank and Queen Latifah who's just plain crazy.  Basically, the character motivations seem ripped from a soap opera.  The film is predictable from the get-go, so just strap in for the ride.  Don't expect high-class writing and high-class direction, especially from the guy who made Friday.  Don't get me wrong, that was a good movie, but like Set it Off it's only valuable as lightweight entertainment. One thing I have to say is this is one black movie that didn't go for the humdrum white people bad, black people good premise.  I assumed that was the direction the film was going after watching the first scene in which the white bank manager fires Vivica for not following procedure, totally ignoring the fact that she was at gunpoint, along with everyone else in the bank.  But then we get introduced to the other two managers, who are both black and both sleazy.  Not to say that black people are sleazy; it's just good knowing that the writers weren't associating the term white with sleazy and didn't see the characters in terms of color.  Even the John C. McGinley character, the detective who is out to get the four women, isn't entirely sadistic.  **************SPOILERS AHEAD************There are a few moments that are just too silly for their own good.  Are you telling me two cops are gonna be so distracted by an obnoxious vagrant that they'll totally disregard a bank robbery (literally) taking place right behind them?  As I said, you can tell this was written by amateurs.  And then we have Queen Latifah driving through the bank in a minivan, which is stupid in the first place and shown simply for cinematic pretentiousness, and the four women drive out, still not being actively pursued by the cops.  Latifah makes one turn and suddenly she loses the cops altogether?  That's too much disbelief to suspend.  And of course, in the usual cinematic tradition, the minor characters have to die first.  Kimberly Elise dies in standard operatic fashion--in someone's arms, saying her last words.  Only in the movies can someone die like that 90 % of the time.The acting is pretty good, though sometimes hammy.  When Jada sees her brother dead on the street, screaming and crying out, Whyyyyy!!!!

Gary Gray weren't so dependent on melodrama and big action spectacles to create tension, this wouldn't been a much more compelling film.  Maybe someone like John Singleton or the Hughes Brothers could've made this a more powerful film.  Just don't set your expectations too high and you should have a good time.

I would like to apologize to Miramax and of course mostly to Mr. Smith. I'm deeply sorry, but I can assure you all, that I did not copy the film, that I did not multiply it and sell it and that I do now have it on my hard drive anymore (so I cannot be arrested for copyright violations). Anyway, so there I had this black and white film, that was about 8 years old and I watched it on a 15 inch monitor. Was it any good??? Well if you really want to know, keep on reading!Actually this film was pretty good and a lot like I'd imagined Kevin Smith's first film would be like. Despite the fact that this is a cheap film, it is definitely a Kevin Smith film. Jay and Silent Bob are on the same trip they always are, Jay is annoying and lashes out with a lot of explicit language while Silent Bob holds his tongue. But when he speaks it is words of wisdom and meaning. The laughs in this film are mostly generated by Randal (Jeff Anderson), who seems to be very individualistic and does not give a f..k about anyone else. He and his friend Dante (Brian O'Halloran), who is (I hope) not having a normal day, are the center of this film, which features a lot of talk about sex, girls and nasty stories.Despite all of this, the film is not really good although it still entertains. The fact that the film was almost shot at one singular location 'The store', is not working in the films favor, nor are the scenes, which appear every now and then and gave me the feel there was no story there. It was kind of disturbing the dialogue, hopping from one conversation to the next.

That's why I'm writing now-I represent the minority because, I did.  I admit, I went to see the movie because I am very impressed with Ryan Gosling's compelling abilities, and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible.  He is an amazing actor. That aside, I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me... why?  Because it's a whodunit where you know `whodunit' from the start, and that's kind of unusual.As the plot goes, two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free-the uninhibited, and let's remember, guiltless, acting out of one's will.  The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, hinted at homosexuality, and was brilliantly acted by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt.  Gosling was the manipulating, controlling smooth-talker, and Pitt was the extremely book-smart, socially awkward outcast.  Enter Sandra Bullock's character, who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate.  I think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self-glorification thing.  I didn't see that as the case here.  Without Cassie's personal history about the ex-husband that nearly killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, she never would have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard.  The case was seemingly airtight against Ray, the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys.  Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither Bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and the vomit Justin left at the sight.  Therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing, the guiltless acting out of will as `true freedom,' ended up working against Justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site).  Without that crucial piece of evidence, they almost had a murder by numbers.  And to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as I have, I looked in to it and found that something done by numbers (such as a painting) suggests careful and critical planning and exacting.

Like it or not, her history does play an important role in this movie because without it, she would likely have never followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of the cliche `women scorned, woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot, but I think without the depth of Cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers, and they just may have gotten away with it.  There's no movie there.And to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning, can I remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed, and totally traceable shoe prints.  The boys wanted to be involved-it was a game.  They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth.  What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side. A little unbelievable?  Maybe.  But many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts.

It was very well acted, although I would have given Ben Chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he's a good actor) and maybe pared down Bullock's character a smidgen.I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning, it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end.  I think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout, slow revelation of the different character dynamics, and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt.

I just don't think it's worth going nuts over, as many seem to have. 6\/10. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"}]
