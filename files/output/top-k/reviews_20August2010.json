To me it was obvious that these guys had only a limited script when filming this movie. The charm, and I do mean charm of Up in Smoke is so not evident here. It was almost like these guys said, We'll do a scene with two hot girls in a car and a 600 pound dad, and it will be funny. We'll go to a pot farm where the owner is wonderfully bizarre and it will be funny. We'll film two helicopters over nude sunbathers, and it will be funny. One reviewer said he thought that the main characters were high when they made this movie. I don't think that, I just think they got lazy. Great comedy is hard work. It is OK to be spontaneous, but it is really easy to fall into a trap. The trap is, we've made people laugh in the past, everything we do is funny, so we don't need to work.Strangely enough, the best scene in the movie is when they break into the insane asylum and wake up with the crazy inmates in their faces. The people in the asylum genuinely freak both Cheech and Chong out. The inmates looked real and filming with a fish-eye lens adds to the effect.The scene with Timothy Leary makes no sense to a modern audience. It's just not funny, and strangely sad. Did he need the paycheck? The scene in the restaurant is terrible. One gripe. The women in girl band are a bunch of hounds. These guys were millionaires when they filmed the movie. Why didn't they cast smoking hot girls in their films by then? I mean hasn't anybody heard of a casting couch? But I digress.Another Gripe. Pee-Wee Herman (Pre-Pee) reminded me of why I hate him. Either you think he's funny or isn't. I never got him.The ending was terrible. It was like OK - we got the money back, but we're Stoners so we lose it and now we'll be male strippers and that will be funny? The only reason I can't give this movie a 1 is the Kafka-esquire scenes. The lizard\/Sergeant scenes, and the nut-house scenes make this worth a view on a bad movie night at your house. I got this tape for 10c at a garage sale. I wouldn't pay more than a quarter for the movie, but if you can get it for that, go for it.

So it took me no less than two months to think the thing over and compose this review.A lot is quite certain about SL - for example, it's an exceedingly good movie, well-made and harmonious. There are people saying that Spielberg is a professional, he knows how to influence his audience, that's why you like his movies. I can't say whether it's true or not, since the only other Spielberg movie I've seen is one of the films about Indiana Jones and it's impossible to compare these two genres. So I just enjoyed (as much as it's possible to enjoy a movie about the Holocaust) the film; it didn't seem repulsive to me or too distressing - it didn't even make me cry. I thought the topic to be well-told, all major parts wonderfully performed and the right conclusions made in the end.But 'something was missing', as Schindler himself says in one of the episodes - though in this case it's neither war nor luck. Something that stayed my hand when it moved to give SL 10\/10 on IMDb. Something that made me re-watch the film and separate episodes all over again. Something that excludes all possibility of blind, excited praise-singing.Later I gave SL 10 points nonetheless but only because in me it evoked an interest in the Holocaust, WWII and everything connected with them. I no longer tried to avoid this subject and understood that without any knowledge about this dreadful catastrophe there's no understanding of History. That's all very well but it doesn't free SL of certain drawbacks.Generally, they all are about character study. With Oscar Schindler it's OK. It's a Nazi that shifts from blind money-making and using cheap labor of the Jews to the true understanding of the situation, to compassion and at last to saving over 1000 human beings from certain and cruel death. Liam Neeson's performance was good though not exceptional (there's Ralph Fiennes to compare him with). We see what he was at the beginning - through his manners, style, conversation. He changes gradually, and it's not true with Goeth. What a shame - such amazing a performance and such shallow a look at human psychology. Yesterday Goeth shot people from his balcony without breaking a sweat, today he decides to become 'a good emperor' and pardons everybody he happens to meet. Then, he looks at his nails and all of a sudden he's the main villain again. I love this scene though - the look in Goeth's eyes changes dramatically and betrays his true nature at once - that's more than professional acting. But all the same such a quick and shallow change couldn't befall a personality like this.That's what concerns the main counterparts of SL - Schindler and Goeth. They represent two chief lines of behavior and world-view in the movie. They are friends and enemies at the same time. One is the savior, the other is the torturer. One is capable of compassion and understanding, the other does his bloody duty without questions and his sole attempt to act otherwise is a failure. But who are they saving and killing? To whom the movie is dedicated? Where are the Jews? You can say - here they are, Stern, Helen Hirsch, Poldek and Mila, the Rosners, the Dresners... Yes, they are here, all of them with their own names and destinies - but at the same moment they are absent. No Jew could become a main character in a movie about Oscar Schindler, for the latter would overshadow him; there had to be a good Nazi and a bad Nazi and a humble mass of people they are struggling over. But who if not a Jew should be the main hero of a Holocaust movie? You can say - what about Stern? Isn't he the third point of view, the third power, so to speak, equal to those of Schindler's and Goeth's? Well, he's surely a very significant character, but he is not shown and told about as deliberately as Schindler, for instance. Izhak Stern is not much looked into. The viewer can't penetrate into his inner nature and personal life. He's just the chief representative of the Jews, who - especially nearer to the end of the movie - become just examples, not characters, even Helen Hirsch. While Stern is reserved and strong, Helen is weak and tortured but that's all we can say about her. If the film had been based upon the opposition Goeth-Helen there would have been the possibility of telling about what were her losses, what were her hopes and and thoughts. Unfortunately or not, that's not the case. Helen too remains an example.The main hero is Schindler and this determines the specificity of the film. This also makes the phrase 'In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered' a bit illogical. It is clear that the line should be 'In memory of Oscar Schindler, a Nazy who found strength and will to oppose the killings and saved more than one thousand Jews'.

What I liked best, though, was that Clint set things right in terms of the stranger's relationship with the child. Shane had no interest in the mom, Jean Arthur, and director George Stevens focused on a creepy homo erotic relationship with a young boy. The Preacher, on the other hand, rejects an understandable crush by a pubescent girl and sleeps with her mom instead. - Nice Shane copycat location shoot. The Idaho mountains in the movie look eerily like the Grand Tetons from Shane.- The central henchman, John Russell, is very effective, along with his six deputies. Again note the similarity between the murder of the miner in the street and the murder of Elisha Cook by Jack Palance in Shane.Now here's what kept the movie from being better - I liked the idea of remaking Shane. It really needed to be remade. But High Plains Drifter? OK, movie, but I think one was enough.- I didn't get Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgrass in this.

Brought to you by Gregg Araki. The Doom Generation is a gritty, super-dismal, often hilarious tale of murder, betrayal, and sleaziness. We begin with a young couple, hanging out at a club, Amy Blue (meth-head), and Jordan White (pot-head). Amy is a vindictive little nightmare, who's just looking for an argument. And Jordan, well, Jordan doesn't do a whole lot of thinking, but is a good guy, who loves Amy, despite her personality issues. Amy and Jordan take it to the car, so they can lose their virginity, but are soon interrupted...Meet Xavier Red (killer), X for short.Xavier rudely enters Amy's car, rudely demanding she start driving so that he may live, rudely insulting her, subtly insulting Jordan, but he doesn't mind. Amy on the other hand, is about to blow her top, but at least she has someone to argue with now... no wait, he just went too far. Alright guy!! Out of the car.Later in the evening, the teenage, odd couple are rescued by their new pal, X from a trigger-happy, convenience store clerk. after X literally blows the mans head off. They all 3, right then and there, decide to take a road trip together, leaving behind everything. The night sure is going to hell, but at least Amy has someone to argue with again, that's what's important. It doesn't take Xavier long to make his intentions clear, with Amy, and despite the fact that she despises him, she's all for it. They don't try all that hard to hide this from Jordan, but it's cool, Jordan doesn't mind, X seems like a nice guy. Amy doesn't mind Xavier's insults, Jordan doesn't mind that the man is sleeping with his girlfriend, and no one seems to be all that bothered by the fact that X kills someone every time they stop somewhere.The Doom Generation is harsh, and mean-spirited, and can be ugly, at times, just a swell movie, probably Araki's best. The religious, and apocalyptic metaphors won't go unnoticed, and neither will Rose McGowan, as a foul-mouthed teenager, with a chip on her shoulder, with James Duval's performance making her seem even worse. Some things occur, seemingly with the intention of confusing us, but that's OK, confusion only makes this seem more like exploitation from decades past.

Brought to you by Gregg Araki. The Doom Generation is a gritty, super-dismal, often hilarious tale of murder, betrayal, and sleaziness. We begin with a young couple, hanging out at a club, Amy Blue (meth-head), and Jordan White (pot-head). Amy is a vindictive little nightmare, who's just looking for an argument. And Jordan, well, Jordan doesn't do a whole lot of thinking, but is a good guy, who loves Amy, despite her personality issues. Amy and Jordan take it to the car, so they can lose their virginity, but are soon interrupted...Meet Xavier Red (killer), X for short.Xavier rudely enters Amy's car, rudely demanding she start driving so that he may live, rudely insulting her, subtly insulting Jordan, but he doesn't mind. Amy on the other hand, is about to blow her top, but at least she has someone to argue with now... no wait, he just went too far. Alright guy!! Out of the car.Later in the evening, the teenage, odd couple are rescued by their new pal, X from a trigger-happy, convenience store clerk. after X literally blows the mans head off. They all 3, right then and there, decide to take a road trip together, leaving behind everything. The night sure is going to hell, but at least Amy has someone to argue with again, that's what's important. It doesn't take Xavier long to make his intentions clear, with Amy, and despite the fact that she despises him, she's all for it. They don't try all that hard to hide this from Jordan, but it's cool, Jordan doesn't mind, X seems like a nice guy. Amy doesn't mind Xavier's insults, Jordan doesn't mind that the man is sleeping with his girlfriend, and no one seems to be all that bothered by the fact that X kills someone every time they stop somewhere.The Doom Generation is harsh, and mean-spirited, and can be ugly, at times, just a swell movie, probably Araki's best. The religious, and apocalyptic metaphors won't go unnoticed, and neither will Rose McGowan, as a foul-mouthed teenager, with a chip on her shoulder, with James Duval's performance making her seem even worse. Some things occur, seemingly with the intention of confusing us, but that's OK, confusion only makes this seem more like exploitation from decades past.
