The reality is very different.This movie is a statement about two fundamental human values survival and revenge. In Western society, we can hardly appreciate these values, because we hardly ever need to worry about survival, and with the State taking care of justice, we feel little need for revenge. By watching this movie, we get a different perspective. Of course, not everybody will like this movie I have actually met people who don't. I put it down to people not appreciating how important survival was to our ancestors.Sword-and-sorcery movies, such as Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, and The Scorpion King, have nothing to say about survival and revenge they are too light-hearted (but at the same time their attempts at humor are too coarse). Conan the Barbarian is closer in feel to The Road Warrior, or Escape from New York, two other movies set in worlds where survival and the rule of law cannot be taken for granted.Another relevant comparison is with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here the difference is that The Lord of the Rings is a struggle between Good and Evil, while Conan the Barbarian is a struggle for survival (and revenge).While the movie is not very realistic, it feels much more real than the sequel. Apart from a bit of sorcery, which does not affect the plot, there is nothing glamorous about the life story of Conan. It seems strange that somebody who grows up pushing a wheel ends up with a well-proportioned Schwarzenegger physique how can you develop your biceps muscles if you always push? However, I was not too bothered by this flaw.Arnold's acting is (to put it mildly) less than brilliant. Still, this is not a drawback how articulate do you expect Conan to be, when he grew up as a slave? Speaking of which, R.H. Howard purists often complain that the real Conan would never be a slave. However, the movie would be much poorer if Conan did not have some real hardship to take revenge for.There is no question that visuals and music play a big role in this movie. I have been listening to the soundtrack a few times a week for nine years, and it is better than Prozac.Yet dialog (or rather, monologue) also has its moments. There are a couple of intriguing speeches, by Conan's father and by Thulsa Doom; but the most stirring monologue is Conan's first and only prayer, delivered just before the crucial Battle of the Mounds. The philosophy that transpires from this prayer is pretty straightforward nobody will remember if we were good men or bad, but people will remember if we were brave; revenge is what Conan most cares about; and if his gods won't help him, then he'll help himself.

Considering the central figure in the film is pretty much always drunk or stoned or both the entire plot seems to unfold in a bit of a haze. Those watching the film may come away feeling a little stoned themselves. Yet through the drug and alcohol-fueled haze this film does have a lot to recommend it. Most notably it has one of the most stunningly brilliant acting performances you could ever hope to see. Val Kilmer, playing Jim Morrison, is simply perfect in the role. It sounds clichéd but Kilmer really seems to become Morrison. The physical resemblance is eerie and their voices are so similar it is fairly impossible when listening to the film's soundtrack to figure out when exactly you're hearing Morrison and when you're hearing Kilmer. Tracing Morrison's journey from shy, reserved youth to manic, drugged-out rock god the performance by Kilmer is mesmerizing throughout.As good as Kilmer is you can't help but feel that his performance deserved to be surrounded by a better film. The film might as well have been titled Morrison because it is much more the story of one man than it is the story of his band. And therein lies much of the problem because while Kilmer is undeniably terrific, Morrison, at least as he is portrayed in this film, is not a very sympathetic character. That shy, quiet guy we see on the beach at the film's beginning becomes a bit of a monster, at times almost completely unlikable. And since the film revolves entirely around Morrison it makes the film often hard to embrace. Many would argue that Morrison was unfairly portrayed here, not nearly as mean-spirited and hot-tempered as we are led to believe. The truth probably lies somewhere in between but the fact remains that in this film it is very hard to embrace Jim Morrison and as such it is very hard to completely embrace the film.With the focus almost completely on Kilmer's Morrison the rest of the cast comes off as little more than bit players. Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek has the most to do amongst the remaining band members and his performance is fine but it really gets swallowed up by the ever-present and always center stage Morrison. Meg Ryan, playing Morrison's longtime companion Pamela Courson, is allowed only to react to Morrison's antics and never establishes a character and identity of her own. Even when stoned out of her mind, as everybody in this film always seems to be, Pamela comes across as the wholesome girl next door who is, well, rather dull. Kathleen Quinlan has a more memorable turn as another woman in Morrison's life, Patricia Kennealy, who is anything but dull. But again her character is there only to serve Jim. It's always about Jim. Nobody could deny that Jim Morrison was the most captivating figure in The Doors. But as the film unfolds and you watch Morrison stumble from one stupor to the next you'll probably wish we could have spent a little more time with some of the other characters. This film version of Jim Morrison is a hard guy to love.So in the end what are we left with? You get one awe-inspiring, magnificent performance but that performance overshadows everything else going on in the film. You get a fascinating life story but one that unfortunately proceeds mostly in a frustrating drug-induced haze. You certainly get a tremendous soundtrack with all of The Doors' most notable songs. Well, most of them anyway. There seems to be a real yin and yang with this movie. There is plenty that is very good about it, but all that is good seems to be balanced out by something which frustrates. Jim Morrison led an extraordinary life but this film which tells his tale ends up being rather ordinary.

Or rather, the reactions he provokes are interesting. There are those who love him and those who scratch their heads wondering why he has achieved such extraordinary success in his career. He is after all quite 'ordinary.' He is not a great actor, though not a particularly bad one. His main claim to fame seems to be his unfailing ability to generate sympathy from the audience for the characters he plays. You always 'like' Hanks in his film roles. Varied as they are, that's quite an achievement. And it is based on that very ordinariness that many of us seem to find perplexing.Cast Away is a very good example of this. Hanks has to hold the attention of the audience for the bulk of the film, as he is the only human character on screen. The vast, inescapable power of the ocean and the primitive beauty of the island vie with him for that attention, but come off worst. He is certainly not the only actor who could pull this off, but it is still a neat trick and there were certainly many who felt in the run-up to the launch of the film that this would be the one that finally found him out as a rather average talent. It does no such thing.He slowly draws you into the predicament of his character and persuades you to suspend the cynicism that might make you question a number of the events in the plot. And, true to form, he has you firmly on his side at all the most critical moments. The direction and photography both help to sustain the illusion of what you are seeing, and the plot - though faintly ridiculous - has enough meat in it to allow the drama to play out.Though the period of isolation on the island is the main body of this film, one of the more interesting aspects for me was the way the character inter-acted with the real world. Without giving anything away, there is a deeply emotional thread to this story about an intense personal relationship that is destroyed by cruel events and this, I found to my surprise, provided some of the most impressive scenes towards the end of the film.Rating Cast Away was for me a decision between 7 and 8. I went for 8 in the end, perhaps generously, because it is basically a feel-good movie which works. You should not watch it expecting much more than that. Few deep human questions are asked here, and when reviewing the plot after the film has finished you conclude that - even as it held your attention at the time - it was in fact quite formulaic.Nevertheless it is, as I said, another classic Tom Hanks movie. And these have become almost a genre in themselves.

As a film fan and student I try to make it my job to catch up.And maybe it's me but Caddyshack is, by no means, a classic or even a good film. If you're into modern comedy and thought Ghostbusters was OK (btw, for the record, I love GBs) you might as well just forget you even heard of Caddyshack.The film has no identifiable lead role, discomfortingly swapping stations between dryish Chevy Chase and very dry Bill Murray, who between them hog all the decent lines - few though they are - offencive loudmouth Rodney Dangerfield, stuck up Ted Knight and typical teenager Michael O'Keefe. Who's story is this film telling?It isn't long before the film becomes predictable with Knight stating gambling is illegal and Chase saying he doesn't gamble for money. With Knight's and Dangerfield's conflict the only real substantial one, I found myself simply waiting for the final one round big-money gamble.

In the short story, there is much less character development, and the Daniel character is allowed to dominate; in the movie, the two main characters get a fairly balanced exposure.The result is one of the great adventure stories, and at the same time a great Shakespearean tragedy. In this respect, it can be compared to that other Huston masterpiece The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.Yet, even this high praise does not do full justice to the movie, because I have not yet mentioned the scenery, the music, and, most important, the two unforgettable main characters. Daniel and Peachy are crooks and megalomaniacs, but, on the whole, it is hard not to sympathize with them because it's only a movie, of course, but also because of their quiet self-confidence and dry sense of humor; because they do not lose dignity in failure; and because, for all their flaws, one can sense that they have lived interesting lives, and wishes to hear them tell their stories.Sometimes Daniel and Peachy treat the natives pretty shabbily, but only on one occasion I thought that they would behave differently to a white man. This occasion, unfortunately, is at the very beginning of the movie, in the train scene. You should not let this scene alienate you from the Peachy character, because you won't see him behave like that again.There are a few remarks that might offend the overly sensitive, such as (we are) not gods, but Englishmen, which is the next best thing!. (Incidentally, this might have been inspired by Cecil Rhodes.) But this remark should be seen in its context. It is pretty clear that Daniel and Peachy believe themselves to be close to gods, not because they are British, but because they are Daniel and Peachy. They are quite happy to make fun of their fellow Britons and of the entire colonial enterprise witness lines such as It was detriment like us that built this bloody Empire! or We are going to teach you (...) to slaughter your enemies like civilized men.From their talk to Kipling and to the District Commissioner, one gets pretty soon the picture of the individualistic, libertarian philosophy of Daniel and Peachy. Perhaps this is best encapsulated in their conversation when they are trapped at high altitude and expect to die from exposure. They consider whether their lives have been wasted, and decide that they would not go back even on the point of dying, if that means giving up on their memories. Without giving anything away, I can say that their best memories were yet to come.

(This is obviously less of a problem after Pulp Fiction and Sin City.) Speaking for myself, I find this to be only a minor problem.My main problem is different the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner. The issue is whether something like the Ludovico treatment, if feasible, would be ethical. For those who have not yet seen the movie, the Ludovico treatment is a (fictional) conditioning process, by which a violent criminal comes to associate the sight of violence with strong nausea. The purpose is to make the criminal practically unable to use violence ever again.Presumably, the Prison Chaplain speaks for Burgess and Kubrick when he complains that the Ludovico treatment is unethical because it robs the patient of his free will the patient avoids violence because he fears nausea, not because he has changed his ethical outlook.What the Chaplain says is well phrased, as can be seen in the memorable quotes section. It is also very silly. It is silly because it assumes that people who try to avoid nausea have lost their free will.Imagine a criminal who has been to jail and has abandoned crime because he fears going back to jail does this mean that the threat of jail deprives people of their free will? Imagine also a man who experiences nausea after tasting Bearnaise sauce in a restaurant this man is unlikely to eat Bearnaise sauce again, but can he sue the restaurant for depriving him of his free will (as opposed to suing for food poisoning)? If the answer to both questions is no, then a man who abandons crime because he fears nausea has not lost his free will, either.On the other hand, if the answer to either question is yes, that means that people lose their free will when they have to suffer the consequences of their actions. So this is what the Chaplain's tirade amounts to there is no free will if people suffer any consequences from their actions; and therefore there is no free will in the real world. It sounds absurd if put in these words, but this is the only way I can make sense of what the Chaplain says.It might be argued that there is a qualitative difference between fear of prison and nausea the two emotions activate different brain pathways, for instance. There can be reasonable disagreement on the differences between the Ludovico treatment and prison, and there is plenty of room for debate on this issue. The fact is that the movie does not even begin to address the issue! The Chaplain does not explain why he is opposed to the Ludovico treatment, but not to prison. Nothing in the movie suggests any reason to prefer prison to the Ludovico treatment; if anything, the Ludovico treatment is portrayed as faster and more effective in reducing crime. This brings me back full circle to my starting point the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner.In spite of all this, I was entertained by the movie there is an interesting story and stylish cinematography, as one would expect from Kubrick. The violence is unpleasant, but it is not gratuitous it shows what kind of person the main character is, and what kind of people he hangs around with. But at the end of the movie, what remains in my mind, and sticks in my throat, is the Chaplain's speech. I perceive it as an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Should I be more disturbed by the violence? I don't think so, because the violence is fictional, while the silly ideas that the Chaplain is advocating can do serious damage to an impressionable mind.

I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in 'Thirteen Days,' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don't. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama, I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.A second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.Highly recommended.

Bonnie and Clyde is one. Taxi Driver is another. These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned. Add Sunset Boulevard to that list.Boulevard represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish, but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining (and even quite funny at times) rather than unbearably depressing.There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill, and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark, film-noirish exterior. I think that ultimately Sunset Boulevard is about the love of movies. You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond, played brilliantly (and I don't toss that word around lightly) by Gloria Swanson. But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business, and that's what he sets out to expose in his film. Movies get made and stars are born, but for every birth there's a death.I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself. If you allow yourself to think about it too long, Wilder's use of her is almost cruel, as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress. The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way--it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause. But the film stops just short of cruelty, because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film, and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved, and who can't relate to that? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one. But I don't think it is an easy role. Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma--he's the moral conscience of the film, and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp.There are so many quotable lines in this film, I don't know where to begin. Imagine this film and All About Eve coming out in the same year. It's a movie quote fan's wet dream.In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia, apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film, starring herself. (She might even have gotten as far as completing it). Of course nothing ever came of it, and Swanson sunk quickly back into obscurity. But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear, courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" On the one hand, it seems pointless to add yet one more comment to the numerous comments already here testifying to the greatness of this film, but I love this movie so much that it seems just wrong to not have it included in my index of reviews.There are only a few movies I've seen that I would be tempted to label perfect.

But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear, courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film.Grade A+ ","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"30 May 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" On the one hand, it seems pointless to add yet one more comment to the numerous comments already here testifying to the greatness of this film, but I love this movie so much that it seems just wrong to not have it included in my index of reviews.There are only a few movies I've seen that I would be tempted to label perfect. Bonnie and Clyde is one. Taxi Driver is another. These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned. Add Sunset Boulevard to that list.Boulevard represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish, but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining (and even quite funny at times) rather than unbearably depressing.There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill, and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark, film-noirish exterior. I think that ultimately Sunset Boulevard is about the love of movies. You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond, played brilliantly (and I don't toss that word around lightly) by Gloria Swanson. But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business, and that's what he sets out to expose in his film. Movies get made and stars are born, but for every birth there's a death.I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself. If you allow yourself to think about it too long, Wilder's use of her is almost cruel, as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress. The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way--it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause. But the film stops just short of cruelty, because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film, and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved, and who can't relate to that? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one. But I don't think it is an easy role. Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma--he's the moral conscience of the film, and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp.There are so many quotable lines in this film, I don't know where to begin. Imagine this film and All About Eve coming out in the same year. It's a movie quote fan's wet dream.In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia, apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film, starring herself.

So Joseph turns to Jimmy for advice on the matter and Jimmy gladly lends a helping hand.Now, The Spanish Prisoner has got to be one of the most undeservedly, overlooked small-scale thrillers of the last decade. The only reason I can think why; is because it's really a glum and quite subdue film that relies on a well-written story to keep you mesmerized and rather bamboozled. There's nothing overly stylish about it, but it's such an elegant and easy going exercise that's professionally handled all round, despite the elementary factors. So don't be expecting a pot-boiler with plenty of fast-paced thrills from this one. For me it's up there with another under-appreciated 90s thriller Arlington Road. These were two films I knew nothing about, but when I accidentally came across them I was more than impressed in what I saw.The shady, paranoid premise is standard stuff for films of this ilk with it being cluttered with the usual cunning double crossings and misleading revelations.

It has a great story, some great acting, and I thought it was pretty scary. But you have to like ghost stories to enjoy this. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a mother who lives in a dark, old island mansion in the 1940's, with her two children, Anne and Nicholas, who are allergic to the sunlight. After some servants arrive to their darkened home, strange events begin to plague Grace and her children. As things get stranger and stranger, Grace becomes convinced that her home is haunted, and she begins to suspect something strange about the servants. Is the house really haunted? Or is there something even more disturbing going on? Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar brings this delightfully eerie ghost picture to the screen, in the vein of Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller, The Innocents, and Robert Wise's The Haunting. The story is nicely crafted here, and while the similarities between this and The Innocents are obvious, The Others is definitely it's own movie. Fans of slow-going, old-fashioned horror films will love this, because of the steady pacing that still manages to send chills up the spine. It's a bit of a slow film in the beginning, but things do pick up, and there is plenty going on in the meantime to keep the audience intrigued. The entire movie is done in the style of those classic haunted house stories we know. A very dark and Gothic atmosphere is prevalent as well, and director Amenabar captures some very eerie images and some excellently-constructed scare sequences. As for the twist-ending, I have to give some major credit for it. I never saw it coming, and it fit the story perfectly, completely reversing whatever ideas you had about the film. The acting is also great, Nicole Kidman plays her role as the eccentric mother perfectly, and Fionnula Flanagan plays one of the kindly new servants to the household nicely, as do the rest of them. And the children playing Kidman's son and daughter were also very remarkable in their roles.Overall, The Others is a classy and Gothic ghost story, reminiscent of those haunted-house classics we all remember. This film sets up an intense atmosphere - very dark, subtle, and old-fashioned. I enjoyed it. If you like this kind of movie, surely see it, you won't be disappointed.

Up until lately, I agreed with most other people that Steven Spielberg's film was more more appealing than this Terrence Malick movie....but now I am not so sure. I find both of them fascinating.It took me a long time to come around to liking this film. One problem was I expected more since I had to wait 20 years for another Malick film after his fantastic Days Of Heaven. always one of my all-time favorite movies. I appreciated that Malick, in his two previous films, wasn't just a visual genius but had characters that expressed themselves without a ton of crudeness or profanity. In this film, Nick Nolte, ended that verbal romance with an assault of GDs that rattled off like a machine gun. That, and narration that sounded like some stoned-out New Age-guru or some '60s freak, , turned me and millions of other viewers off, most of whom could make no sense of the almost incoherent ramblings.Well, that narration, as I have since discovered - especially by putting the English subtitles on - is not what I thought and Nolte I can just do the opposite hit the mute when he starts another of his obscene tirades. Now, the film is what I'd hoped it would be! It only took four viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Hey, some of us are slow learners, I guess.The narration, to the best of my assumptions, is simply the anguish several of the soldiers feel as - in the middle of a horrific war - they try to make sense of life, death, suffering, war and spiritual matters in general. They agonize over loneliness of being separated from their wives and family, or they compare two extremes in civilizations as they now exist in one that is far removed in one they came from. Spiritual matters are discussed by Believers and non- believers, optimists and cynics. Seeing the narration on screen in the form of subtitles helped make me appreciate and make sense out of them. It's pretty heady stuff, as it turns out. Some may still think it's pure nonsense, but I'm willing to give Malick the benefit of the doubt.Meanwhile, the action scenes are excellent. In Ryan, they centered more in bombed-out cities, but here the fighting takes place in a remote jungle. This really is the story of Guadalcanal. The scenery, much of it filmed in either Australia or the Solomon Islands, is just gorgeous, just the kind Malick loves. A true lover of nature, Malick gives us one spectacular scene after another with all the greens of grasses, tress and leaves you'd ever want to see, complemented by an assortment of exotic birds and reptiles. It's just stunning in parts. If you ever call a war movie arty, this is it, with the great nature shots and reflective narration. They both provide needed relief from the intense action\/profanity\/suspense which occurs in the middle of the film as the Americans attempt to secure the top of a hill fortified by Japanese troops. The action scenes are realistic, have wonderful sound and well-filmed. The soundtrack also is very nice.As stated earlier, my only complaint was Nolte's character, Lt. Col. Tall. who is the Hollywood stereotype of a gung-ho military officer they don't like (and they don't like many). He's constantly screaming and is so abrasive he almost ruins the film. Actor-wise, what's interesting is that a number of these stars in here were relative unknowns when this came out in 1998 - men such as Jim Caveziel, Adrien Body, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas - and now they are established actors whom most of us are familiar with. Despite the other big names you see advertised here, the stars of this film are Caveziel, Koteas, Nolte and Sean Penn. Many of the names, such as John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack, etc., have only very minor or cameo roles.Anyway, if this movie turned you off when you first saw it, please consider giving it another shot.

It's just stunning in parts. If you ever call a war movie arty, this is it, with the great nature shots and reflective narration. They both provide needed relief from the intense action\/profanity\/suspense which occurs in the middle of the film as the Americans attempt to secure the top of a hill fortified by Japanese troops. The action scenes are realistic, have wonderful sound and well-filmed. The soundtrack also is very nice.As stated earlier, my only complaint was Nolte's character, Lt. Col. Tall. who is the Hollywood stereotype of a gung-ho military officer they don't like (and they don't like many). He's constantly screaming and is so abrasive he almost ruins the film. Actor-wise, what's interesting is that a number of these stars in here were relative unknowns when this came out in 1998 - men such as Jim Caveziel, Adrien Body, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas - and now they are established actors whom most of us are familiar with. Despite the other big names you see advertised here, the stars of this film are Caveziel, Koteas, Nolte and Sean Penn. Many of the names, such as John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack, etc., have only very minor or cameo roles.Anyway, if this movie turned you off when you first saw it, please consider giving it another shot. You might be pleasant surprised. It's better than what first meets the eye! ","genre":"Drama, War"}]
