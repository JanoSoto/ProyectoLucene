[{"date":"16 July 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" David Zucker + Trey Parker\/Matt Stone = Hysterically funny Airplane-style comedy from the master of the genre. BASEketball is easily one of David Zucker's most underrated films. I've seen this movie many MANY times, and I still can't figure out what there isn't to like about it. My friends all loved it, and I showed it to my parents who hated it. Ironically, the adults I've watched this with all LOVE Airplane and The Naked Gun, and I have no idea what's so different. This film has the exact same kind of humor as the previously mentioned films. So why is it that they love the other films and all have the same reaction to this film STUPID. So what if it isn't as deadpan as the others, I can't really find anything to dislike about the film.The film's plot revolves around two best friends Joseph Coop Cooper (Trey Parker), and Doug Remer (Matt Stone), who had big dreams as kids, but for some unspecified reason, became loser , time-wasting slackers who are always late at paying bills. Anyway, when the two guys are challenged to a basketball game by a couple of jocks, they make up a game called BASEketball, which obviously is a hybrid of basketball and baseball. The game soon becomes a national pastime, and recruiting their friend\/perpetual victim, Kenny Squeak Scolari (Dian Bachar) also known as Little Bitch, the trio become big sports stars, and face the temptation and corruption that occurs behind the game, putting the friendships to the test.The plot is merely a setup for a constant stream of jokes and gags. Almost, not all, but almost every frame in the movie has a sight gag of some kind, and any plot or logic is simply lost among them, as we spend most of our time watching the background for something randomly hilarious, which almost always shows up. Some of the best gags involve people such as news reporters, and Robert Stack on Unsolved Mysteries, saying words on TV that can't be said on TV. There is a gratuitous, and joyously offensive subplot about a terminally ill kid, who is a fan of the character's BASEketball team. When he comes into play, many brutal slapstick jokes ensue at his expense. The psyche- out rule (players can do whatever they want to make the opposing player miss their shot) was a genius addition to the script, as they allowed endless gag possibilities, which while hit- and-miss, were usually very funny. Of course, my personal favorite gags were at the expense of Squeak Little Bitch, who was the butt of nearly a third of the jokes in the movie. These are all hits. You both feel sorry for Squeak, and yet you want to join in in endlessly ridiculing him. I nearly laughed myself into asthma attacks on more than one occasion, as did my friends who all want to buy the movie on DVD now. The film should be required viewing for (younger) fans of the earlier spoof films. I'm coming to a conclusion that this movie was made for the new generation of silly gag-a-minute comedies, and adults who were alive during the release of the older films of the genre will ultimately dislike it. One good thing about the film, is that unlike most films of the genre, the film isn't really a spoof, and the little plot there is, is actually quite original (I'm referring to the idea of the game of course). The fact that they don't have to set up the gags around the setting from another movie gives it a fresh and free feeling. The film has no target of parody, and instead of mooching off the plot for another movie for jokes, it uses a simple, ridiculous premise for that kind of humor. And it works well.South Park fans will be pleased to see Trey Parker and Matt Stone in starring roles, which they actually do really good in. I truly think that they should do more movies of this genre when they aren't busy with the hilarious South Park. Their line delivery is as good as I've seen it (Trey Parker gives one of the best-delivered s-words I've ever heard), and their slapstick humor is totally brilliant. The way they react to much of the situations, and their treatment of many of the best lines with dead seriousness (sometimes) is absolutely priceless. These two should really get more acting jobs. Nobody could have played their characters better than they did.Being a fan of South Park and David Zucker, I was thoroughly satisfied with this film. I can only guess the reason why adults hate it so much is the fact that the movie practically wallows in bad taste, and features some of the most offensive (hilarious) jokes ever put to film, many of which involve young kids who are crippled and\/or terminally ill. But I don't care. I highly enjoy this film, and am always sad when the end credits roll, knowing that due to the box-office failure of it, there will never be a sequel. I had a great time with the characters in the film. I recommend the film to those who are open minded or who have a sense of humor and just want something silly. In the words of a talking pineapple (don't ask) towards the end of the movie, Isn't this game just about getting together with your friends and having a good time? That applies to the movie perfectly. BASEketball is one of the most flat-out enjoyable comedies I've ever seen. 8\/10.BASEketball is happily rated R for Strong Language and Crude Sex-Related Humor.

The story is a classic, David Niven does his usual ultra-British character (and he is good at it) and Cantinflas makes a great Passpartout, but the movie has a very low pace.We already know the whole story (right?) so what can the movie give us? I guess it can be watched like we watch Lord of the rings to get a stunning visual representation of the book. Around the World in Eighty Days doesn't fail in that respect.Scenery is generally great, acting is generally not. Except for Cantinflas (who, again, is superb, although somewhat over-used, like the tedious bullfighting), the only actors who do their roles well are the straight British, Niven, club members, servants. In other parts of the movies, many actors perform poorly.The movie has many great stars (some now forgotten), including Buster Keaton and Frank Sinatra. That is usually a bad sign, and indeed they add little to the movie, but are rather distractions. Sinatras appearance is a pure cameo appearance, while Buster Keaton does a Train Conductor, stone-faced as he should, but he isn't funny. A very young Shirley McLaine is almost impossible to recognize until rather late, but I'm not sure if she was considered a star at the time. That made her the most enjoyable and challenging star-spotting. Spotting her is easy, actually recognizing is harder.If you don't mind the slow pace with many way too long scenes, the movie delivers much beauty as well as some dry British style. I understand that that can be appreciated. I could not keep up my interest for quite that long. With some shortening (not that much really) it would win much.

I had a lot of stuff to do today, and there were a lot of factors that contributed to my turning it off, but mostly it was because the movie was completely uninteresting. I'm all for beautiful cinematography, and poetry, etc etc (for example, I recently enjoyed The New World, which was very similar in that it consisted mostly of beautiful scenery and poetic, inner thoughts), but it really wasn't working for me here. First off...why was every single person in Berlin so damn depressed? Honestly? ...and why would an angel have any desire to become human after listening to all those depressed (and ridiculously 'philosophic') inner-thoughts all day? It was turning out to be this quasi-intellectual, 'art' film that I've come to despise. I love art. Yeay art! ...but when it comes to film as art, the artistic vision needs to blend with something called...a story; and ideally, an interesting one...perhaps, with dialogue, or at least some rational, 'normal' people inner thoughts (the inner-thoughts of David Spritz in The Weather Man, for example). Grrr, I don't know...I'm angry by the fact that so many people find a movie like this good just because it is 'artsy'. Anybody can make a really pretty, 'intellectual' movie...just spend all your time framing nice shots, lighting the set just right, and adding giving your characters dialogue straight out of a philosophy book...nevermind the plot, or acting, or, dare I say it...entertainment value?

It is arguably Otto Preminger's best directing job; it has the added feature of having only six persons with featured roles, to which were added dozens of uncredited minor or supporting parts. The result in this B\/W dense and shadow-haunted succession of interiors and offices is I argue an unusual and much-copied look-and a very focused mystery whose creators use their seven featured performers wisely. In assessing the film's quality, one must perhaps turn first to its artistry by understatement, suggestion and sublimated seeming lack of emotionality; David Raksin's famous song and score is universally regarded as one of the film's chief assets. Writing credit for the adaptation of Vera Caspary's apparently partly- autobiographical story goes to Jay Dratler,, Samuel Hoffenstein, Betty Reinhardt and Ring Lardner, Jr. Joseph LaShelle's cinematography added to the art direction of Leland Fuller and Lyle Wheeler are more than adequate in every respect. Thomas Liitle's set decorations are unusually good, and Bonnie Cashin's costumes enhance the desired effects. One of the opening narration's line compares the sun memorably to a burning lens; the film seems to spare no one as that magnifying glass's lens is focused on their foibles, ways and values. The famous plot line involves a lovely young woman who has been murdered in New York and the heroic detective who finds himself falling in love with her as he probes deeper into the crime and into her life's history. As the girl, Laura, Gene Tierney is pretty, bright and quite inadequate both in accent, age and training to play a brilliant female creator; playing her as a very young woman however mitigates the typical Hollywood miscasting for looks, not talent. As her micro-controlling mentor, Waldo Lydecker, Clifton Webb is both powerful and interesting throughout a long role. Dana Andrews as Mark McPherson, the smitten detective, does more with an underwritten role than can be expected or perhaps imagined; in the other featured roles, Vincent Price and Judith Anderson are asked to suggest weakness, whereas their usual forte was strength, and Price is superb. Dorothy Adams as Laura's loyal maid has her best film role here. The director does more than keep the story moving; I argue that he sustains a mood and a pace that sharpens every detail and makes every moment memorable. The storyline is frankly a bit obvious from the first; but the production is so good that the stunning climax and ending lose none of their potential power. A B\/W detection classic without being noir at all, I consider this seminal work 1944 film-making at its best.
