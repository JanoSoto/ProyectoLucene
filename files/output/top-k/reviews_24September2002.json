No, can't happen, especially at Mr. Adams' age.  How is the university with the top medical teaching in the country supposed to accept Adams just out of the blue?  Wait, doesn't Adams have to go through community college first?  Yes, then a four year college, THEN University of Virginia medical school.  But NO, the film never explains the progress.  It automatically assumes Adams was so successful that it didn't need to be explained how he got accepted into University of Virginia.  2) How are we supposed to believe laughter is the true key to medicine when it seems every patients can be cured by laughter.  WHAT?!  What kinds of patients are these?  Probably just ones with physical injuries.  I know that for a fact that autistic children wouldn't respond to Robin Williams' Patch Adams.  It's just not possible.  The patients just get instantly cured by Williams' pranks.  How is this possible?  Nothing is ever explained, it just happens.  God, Steve Oedekerk is a terrible writer.3) Why is Patch Adams in such an opposition in this film to doctors?  What from his mental institution experience with doctors?  Bah.  The fact is, you need a doctor who can treat you with the right prescription medicine and treatments.  You DON'T need the fictionalized loony Patch Adams in the film.  Stay AWAY from him as far away as you can.  Now there is a Patch Adams in real life.  I'd rather be interested in hearing about how he was able to do his laughter for medicine in his patients versus this film.  As a film based on real life, it's the worst ever made.

After seeing him in so many great films like Insomnia and One Hour Photo and watching his numerous hilarious talk show appearances, I've become even more curious about checking out the movies on his filmography that I have yet to see.  Well, this is more than just a Robin Williams vehicle.  Paul Mazursky cleverly combines comedy and drama, and expresses some good morals.  He accurately portrays an immigrant's journey to America, and how he\/she expects that America is a beautiful place where everyone can run free without any set limitations.  It starts out as a fish-out-of-water comedy in which Russian immigrant Williams (who decides he wants to become an American citizen) explores the oddities of New York City and revels in its ambience, no matter how rough the neighborhoods are, no matter how many wackos are running around.  Then he slowly learns that freedom has a price.  America may be a free country, but that doesn't stop him from getting mugged and having his upstairs neighbors constantly complain about him playing his saxophone.  One thing that impressed me was rather than have a bunch of American actors don Russian accents, Mazursky actually has the actors speaking Russian to each other.  Now, there are certain movies like Schindler's List and K-19  The Widowmaker in which we do see American actors speaking English and putting on foreign accents and still prove to be good movies, but it's always more engaging to see characters from a certain country speaking their native language.  I mean, what if Russia were to make a movie set in America, where all the American characters were speaking Russian in American accents?  How goofy would that look?  I'm guessing that Williams was the only American actor in the cast, and the rest are actual Russians.  I don't speak Russian, so I can't tell whether or not Williams was actually speaking Russian, but it looked convincing to me.  But since mainstream American audiences have grown to hate reading subtitles, you probably won't see a movie like this released nationwide.  Robin Williams gives a terrific performance, totally disappearing into character.  I was actually convinced he was a foreigner, as he speaks just like a Russian immigrant, in broken English, not articulating his words one bit.  There was no sign of Robin Williams the Comedian in his character.  Whenever he gets a laugh, he gets a laugh as Vladimir and not as Robin.  Besides, this is one of his more serious roles and he never really plays it for laughs.  Maria Conchita Alonso still sounds Cuban, as her Italian character, but she still gives a fine performance.  Since I haven't seen her in any recent movies, it's nice to see her pretty face again.  She was like the Salma Hayek of the 80's.  Williams and Alonso have a good on-screen chemistry.  The friendship between Williams and his African-American friend, who goes as far as letting him move in with his family, is very touching.  Working as a security guard at Bloomingdale's and seeing Williams wreaking havoc around the store, he starts out hating his guts.  Before you know it, they're best buddies.  The most touching scene is the one in which Williams leaves a jazz club, depressed after being told by a well-known jazz musician that he needs practice.  He decides to throw his saxophone away and forget about being a musician altogether.  His friend relates to his problem and gives him plenty of encouragement in pursuing his dream of playing the saxophone, as they get drunk and laugh their heads off.  The movie stresses the outburst of immigrants in New York City, which is a melting pot society.  Almost every character Williams comes in contact with is either a foreigner or a minority.  Strange but undoubtedly true, if you were to examine the streets of New York.  It's not unlikely to walk across a whole city block, where not one person speaks English.  The movie has no real plot structure, as it is mainly character-driven.  The comedy is subtle, and arises naturally.  My favorite quote from the film is when Williams says, I bought my first pair of American shoes.  They were made in Italy.  That is a sample of the kind of humor in this film.

It could have been written by Rod Serling while possessed by a Dybbuk. It has touches of A Short Walk and A Stop in Willoughby in it. But Serling, brought up in Binghamton, New York, usually saw the past as something regrettably lost. A kind of cultural childhood, a Golden Age, a period of innocence, rather like Spielberg. What are we to make of the clash of values that Bud and Mary Sue bring back to 1958 with them? Bud is happy enough to be in the black and white world of stability. (Stability? I mean obsessive-compulsive rigidity.) But Mary Sue runs around like a warthog in heat with nothing in her head except whatever impinges on her body sheath. And then there's this colorization gimmick. People change colors as they, well, evolve maybe. The kids' mother has her first orgasm (self induced) and a tree on the lawn bursts into colorful flame. She turns colored. Mary Sue begins to wonder, since she's been rutting with all the young studs in town, why she remains black and white, and Bud suggests that maybe it's not just the sex. Well then what IS it? It's not simply the capacity for change because Bud's already got his dose. At one point Bud tells a townsman that people get colorized because of something human inside them, something trying to get out, and he demonstrates his point by enraging the mayor (great performance by J. T. Walsh). But something has been trying to get out of the local soda fountain manager, Jeff Daniels, for a long time -- the desire to paint modern pictures a la Picasso -- and it finally does, but he remains black and white for a long time afterward. Cars turn color too, although something has been getting out of them fairly often. I'm stumped. Some of the incidents seem no more than arbitrary.The clash of cultures is interesting though. It's easy to make fun of the 1950s from our current perspective and this movie, unlike Twilight Zone, milks it for laughs. Married couples sleep in separate twin beds and never have sex. (They pollinate, I suppose.) Young couples go to Lover's Lane -- to hold hands. The books in the library are all blank because nobody reads or knows anything about life outside of Pleasantville. That last is a cheap shot, and untrue. Mary Sue, of all people, introduces them to reading and studying, and the books magically fill up with text and engravings. And it's a weak argument that claims we read more now than in 1958.Well, the two kids wind up colorizing everything and everybody and practically wrecking the town in the process. It's supposed to be an improvement, but is it? The black and white townsfolk were dumb but happy. Now they get into fights, insult one another, trash art works they don't like. They screw like minks before they're married. One can imagine what this does to the crime rate and the teenage pregnancy rate -- and taxes. (Is this what been trying to get out of them?) Sure, it was oppressive in the 1950s. We can see that now -- all that conformism and complacency. Is it less oppressive now? Perhaps not. Perhaps we don't recognize the strictures we live under because we take them for granted. We may be in the same position as the guy Mark Twain mentioned who suddenly realized he'd been speaking prose all his life. From inside the box, the commonly accepted assumptions, we seem to have a good deal of freedom to do what we want. The good folk of Pleasantville felt the same way -- and this movie treat them as airheads.I want to mention something about the score. It insinuates anachronistically Dave Brubeck's Take Five into one of the scenes, rather prominently. This is followed, again anachronistically, by a piece from an album I revere, Miles Davis's So What. I'm glad that it wasn't drilled into the viewers' ears in 1958 because it's unforgettable. How easily it could have become a stock piece, like R. Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra from 2001 A Space Odyssey, or the last movement from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I can almost hear it now, playing over and over and over on all kinds of TV commercials for shampoo, kitchen cleansers, pimple removers, and condoms. It may be hard to tell but I kind of enjoyed the movie, although it left me as much puzzled as satisfied. Joan Allen's performance is the only one with true depth; Macy is always interesting but his part gives him less to do. The kids are routine, except for the momentous 1950s bosom Reese Witherspoon has to strap on. Jeff Daniels fits his role as a reasonable but timid person very well.

What are we to make of the clash of values that Bud and Mary Sue bring back to 1958 with them? Bud is happy enough to be in the black and white world of stability. (Stability?

That last is a cheap shot, and untrue. Mary Sue, of all people, introduces them to reading and studying, and the books magically fill up with text and engravings. And it's a weak argument that claims we read more now than in 1958.Well, the two kids wind up colorizing everything and everybody and practically wrecking the town in the process. It's supposed to be an improvement, but is it? The black and white townsfolk were dumb but happy. Now they get into fights, insult one another, trash art works they don't like. They screw like minks before they're married. One can imagine what this does to the crime rate and the teenage pregnancy rate -- and taxes. (Is this what been trying to get out of them?) Sure, it was oppressive in the 1950s. We can see that now -- all that conformism and complacency. Is it less oppressive now? Perhaps not. Perhaps we don't recognize the strictures we live under because we take them for granted. We may be in the same position as the guy Mark Twain mentioned who suddenly realized he'd been speaking prose all his life. From inside the box, the commonly accepted assumptions, we seem to have a good deal of freedom to do what we want. The good folk of Pleasantville felt the same way -- and this movie treat them as airheads.I want to mention something about the score. It insinuates anachronistically Dave Brubeck's Take Five into one of the scenes, rather prominently. This is followed, again anachronistically, by a piece from an album I revere, Miles Davis's So What. I'm glad that it wasn't drilled into the viewers' ears in 1958 because it's unforgettable. How easily it could have become a stock piece, like R. Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra from 2001 A Space Odyssey, or the last movement from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I can almost hear it now, playing over and over and over on all kinds of TV commercials for shampoo, kitchen cleansers, pimple removers, and condoms. It may be hard to tell but I kind of enjoyed the movie, although it left me as much puzzled as satisfied. Joan Allen's performance is the only one with true depth; Macy is always interesting but his part gives him less to do. The kids are routine, except for the momentous 1950s bosom Reese Witherspoon has to strap on. Jeff Daniels fits his role as a reasonable but timid person very well.

Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the American innocence he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to be.In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary on the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good hearted young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at great speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny (who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK. Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench awaiting a bus.This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's graces.The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places, particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and Robin Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother (who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a 'normal' school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a sense of self.But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating it.Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than people who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something.  Forrest continually comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that invites to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments. One such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness in her voice Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over. Everybody gets a second chance...........Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With his much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny I'm not a smart man.  But I know what love is, meeting his five year old son for the first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.Whilst Pulp Fiction, released at the same time and contrasted with this film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of American life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm sentiment in Forrest Gump.

As one who realizes that the original 1963 version is THE most frightening movie ever made, I knew an FX-laden new version would be unlikely to hold a candle.  But I went anyway, hoping for a pleasant surprise, hoping I'd see a movie which--even if I didn't like it AS much as the original--I could like in a different way, for different reasons, and on its own terms.  No such luck. It was far worse than I'd anticipated.The Haunting '99 is the antithesis of The Blair Witch Project of the same year BWP is a no-budget, no-stars, no-FX project that (for those of us who get it) delivers an emotional impact that transcends scary into such territory as panic, dread and despair.  H'99 is a slick, big-budget, star-studded, FX-burdened product typical of the sort of horror movies made by people who have no idea what a horror movie is.  Director Jan De Bont, whose oeuvre includes such other empty exercises as Twister, Speed, and Speed 2, has joined my short list of directors to avoid.Not content with cluttering up the story with CGI effects (virtually all of which are telegraphed by the previews), this version also completely bastardizes the story (i.e., Shirley Jackson's).  Instead of a straightforward paranormal investigation, we get a study of fear (why?) masquerading as a study of sleep disorders (why?).  The investigator's wife, who plays such an important part in the novel as a New Age flake who wants to communicate with the spirits, and in the '63 movie as a total skeptic, is completely absent here!  The psychological tensions of the original book and film are gutted in favor of too-literal CGI FX for the cast to yell at, plus a cause-and-effect karma that make this more of a remake of Poltergeist.Seems Hugh Crain, the builder of Hill House, was an EEEEEEEE-ville capitalist who--when he got tired of working children to death in his sweat shops--would abduct them to Hill House and not let them leave... not even now, years after his and their deaths.  As if this metaphysical meditation on the Marxist view of capital as dead labor weren't bad enough, it's worsened by another of those heretofore-unknown, gee-that-explains-everything family relationships that were such unconvincing afterthoughts in the sequels to Halloween and the first Star Wars.  Shirley Jackson's estate should have pulled her name off this piece of... work.All the very finest moments from the first film--the perilous spiral staircase, the eerie suggestion of a face in the wallpaper, the heart-stopping scene of the whatnot on the other side of the door, the chilling question Whose hand was I holding?--are tossed off and trivialized here.  The fine cast deserves better  Liam Neeson, as the investigator, is mostly wasted.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is ideal as the wicked, impish, arty, sexually ambiguous Theo; if only she'd been allowed to play the role in a better film.  Owen Wilson, whose best work is in comedies, plays Luke with his perpetual pucker.  And Lili Taylor, always interesting, never cast in a stable role, is the perfect choice to play Eleanor; she's the main reason I decided to give this movie a chance.  So it's disheartening to see her reduced to facing off against the ghost of Hugh Crain (a dead ringer for the Emperor in the Star Wars series) and mouthing such ridiculous dialogue as, It's all about family!  Well, I'M family, Grandpa!  And I'm home now!  While it's good to see Bruce Dern is still alive, he, too, is wasted in a tiny role, but not one so brief as to be spared inane dialogue.Boring, silly, and trivial, not for one second frightening, made by people so out of touch with their source material that they thought a gratuitous decapitation was a good idea, The Haunting '99 succeeds only in making the original film--and Shirley Jackson's novel--AND The Blair Witch Project--AND Attack of the Killer Tomatoes--look better by comparison.

After all this film did change my life when I saw it at the age of eleven, running half as fast again as it should, cut to an hour plus and backed with canned music and football crowd effects.Kill crazy robot runs amok! I was hit by what I now realise was culture shock. If you were unfortunate enough to spend your teens in Australia, movies were a big deal, the most involving thing happening and here was a film that was clearly a front runner though it was old, funny looking and rather morbid. It took me about ten days to decide I liked it and years to track down other films by it's makers.Now twenty viewings on about five ever extending versions later (METROPOLIS must have taken over NAPOLÉON as the most restored movie) I have and run my own copy for classes and the fascination never goes away. Indeed, seeing the new version I'm struck by things I'd taken for granted - sixteen year old Brigitte Helm differentiating the two Marias (that's her in the robot suit too.) The cut between evil Brigitte's eyes opening and naked, nice Brigitte's head slumping sideways on the mad scientist's bench or the mob chasing the pair of them.

The inimitable Klaus Kinski delivers one of his most inspired performances as the eccentric Irishman who strikes out into a cloying world of García Márquez-ian lushness and magic. The Jivero Indians believe that everyday life is only an illusion behind which lies the reality of dreams. They see Fitzcarraldo's gigantic steamboat as the means to soothe the angry gods who have chosen to leave their world unfinished.  For Herzog's script to remain true to his personal vision, he actually had to drag the ship over a mountain. The painstaking process encountered every disaster possible, including tribal and cast revolts, droughts, and floods. Herzog somehow pulled the boat and everyone else along with his own dream, to create one of the truest representations of the primordial and one of finest examples of the transcendent nature of film. Greater ordeals were in store with the making of the formidable Fitzcarraldo, about a man soobsessed with bringing opera to the backwaters of the Amazon that he pulls a 340-ton ship over  the mountains. The film was plagued with disasters of all sorts including two plane crashes, a border  war between Peru and Ecuador, and two crew members shot with arrows, necessitating  kitchen-table surgery.  The film, which took three years of preparation and nine months of shooting, featured 5,000 extras,  required building a jungle camp, and had a crew of only 14 or 16, which Herzog claimed to be his  largest crew yet. Jason Robards, originally cast in the title role, became so ill he was flown out of  the jungle and forbidden by doctors to return. The volatile Kinski was recruited to replace him.  The Indians were scared of this mad man. At the end of shooting one day, one came up to me and said, 'Shall we shoot him for you?' They said they weren't afraid of this screaming mad man, they  were afraid of me because I was so silent.  His experiences making the film prompted the exasperated Herzog to say in a documentary,  Burden of Dreams, I shouldn't make movies anymore. I should go to a lunatic asylum.  Linking all his films, he said, is the desire to understand the human condition, to look deep inside the  unexplained mysteries of our existence and ask who we are. A deep glimpse inside of our heart is  important. At the same time I try to articulate new images. We are surrounded by worn out images.

The deal is made at Winkie's, Sunset Blvd. She hands over the money, and when the deed is done she will receive a blue key. After having received the key, Diane hides at home in deep despair. She tries to sleep and forget it all, but instead she dreams up the twisted soap-paradise that forms much of the movies first 110 (!) minutes.

But despite signs of danger and dead, all is as she wanted it to be.

Diane rushes home in tears.     Somewhat later Diane decides to hire a man to kill Camilla. 'This is the girl,' she tells him, showing Camilla's photograph. The deal is made at Winkie's, Sunset Blvd. She hands over the money, and when the deed is done she will receive a blue key. After having received the key, Diane hides at home in deep despair. She tries to sleep and forget it all, but instead she dreams up the twisted soap-paradise that forms much of the movies first 110 (!) minutes. (Dreaming is marked more by an audible than a visual clue the monotonous dark sounds.)     Diane's dream uses elements from the most depressing time of her life; Winkie's, 'This is the girl.', blue key, among other things. But despite signs of danger and dead, all is as she wanted it to be. Just arrived in Hollywood, under the name of 'Betty Elms', she promises to become a successful actress, as even Bob Rooker has to acknowledge. Camilla suffers from loss of memory caused by a car-accident that she survived. She finds shelter in the apartment of Betty's aunt, where Betty is also going to stay. Camilla now calls herself Rita, after a film poster reading &#145;There <i>never<\/i> was a woman like &#133; Rita Hayworth'. Although starting a new career, Betty still finds time to help Rita trying to overcome her amnesia, a fate she shares with all dead people. It makes Rita highly dependent on Betty, especially in their fruitless search for Rita's true identity. Is she Diane Selwyn? When Betty and Rita find Diane dead in her apartment, Rita decides to adopt a new identity, very similar to Betty's. That night Betty and Rita undouble in bed and, even in appearance, in the mysterious club Silencio.     In reality, Diane has not been seen for three weeks when an old friend (a once lover left for Camilla) visits her to collect some of her belongings. She tells Diane that two detectives have been at her door. As soon as the woman has left, Diane resumes brooding over the blue key. Then, she hears knocking at her door&#133; These harsh knocks push Diane over her limit. Surrounded by distorted images of her youth and later, she runs to her sleeping room and kills herself. Over her bed there is the same cloudy smoke as over the car-accident that killed Camilla.Silencio...*It's a stroke of genius to show the wrecked life of a girl striving for fame in moviedom as a distracted chromium plated dream. But the chromium used here can not allude to the dark, even the blackest tones shine. As a consequence, a powerful idea tends to reduce to a cryptogrammatical postmodern twist, a mannerism to sell true human misery in Hollywood. Mulholland Drive may well continue to impress those who strongly believe in form, but as far as I am concerned Hail, Kieslowsky! Hail, Mendes! Hail, Interiors!Mulholland Drive is dedicated to Jennifer Syme (1972--2001).

Robert Walker is almost impossibly good - a perfect combination of menace, charm, and anarchic energy.  Walker's dark hints and endless enthusiasm for murder propel the scenes he's in.  The scene with his mother and the disaster when he crashes the Senator's party are so good that pretty much all the other characters are colorless and boring.I know this is part of the design - that Guy is doing his level best to set up a boring, ordered life that's above reproach.  He's ditching one of the only other colorful characters in the film (Miriam,) marrying the boss's daughter and intends to retire from sport to pursue politics.  Bruno's lifestyle of precarious idleness, weird family and utter disregard for appearances are supposed to upstage Guy, but I was actually really bored when Walker wasn't on the screen.  Ruth Roman spends the whole film looking concerned about information she's digesting.  I kept wanting to stop the film and check the IMDB to see if Patricia Hitchcock played the same character in `Shadow of a Doubt.'  (nope, it was Edna May Walcott)  The cops were so generic that I was baffled why Hitchcock bothered giving them names. And *yawn* Farley Granger?The movie is beautifully shot in spots - the murder in the lens, Bruno's lank shadowlike presence, Bruno emerging from the dark when he flips on the light, Guy self-consciously stepping behind bars, the bizarre merry-go-round and so on.  The dialogue, particularly Bruno's opaque staccato probing, is excellent sometimes.  The plot is only held together passably well.  It sorta kinda almost makes sense that Guy wouldn't go to the cops - he's obsessed with appearances and all.  When Bruno makes it completely clear at the party that he's not exactly the sort of conspirator you can really count on to keep his mouth shut, Guy finally does commit to doing SOMETHING about his situation.  The last half of the movie tends to drag because the plot is so thin (and it's a pretty short film).  The parallels between the strangers never really stands up cuz Granger's plot is so thoroughly overshadowed that I forgot about him.It's not Hitchcock's worst film, but it's way way down the list.  It's really worth catching for Robert Walker.
