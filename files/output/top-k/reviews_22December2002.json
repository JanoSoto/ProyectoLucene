[{"date":"22 December 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am reading all these scathing reviewsm and I just don't get it!  I am a horror movie fan.  I LOVE a good thriller.  I am also an a overall movie lover of all genres.  Additionally, I am a film maker. That said, this movie is one of the freakiest, scariest, well-acted, well-directed, well-produced horror movies of all time.  Do people just have this need to bash things?  Ever heard about if you don't have something nice to say . . . Whether these things in the movie really occurred to the Lutz family or was just a hoax, the movie itself is definitely scary - especially so if you think it might be real.  The music is so chilling, it gives me goosebumps to this day.  Margot Kidder is one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the screen. And, by the way, Rod Steiger was AMAZING!  This is a truly great actor. People say he overdid the church scene.  NOOO!!!  He was acting like a priest who knew something evil was in that house, and none of his superiors would believe him.  He was pleading to God with all of his might and every ounce of his faith to help that family get out before it was too late. People just don't get the fact that actors are supposed to act as though they are really in that situation.  And, if you were a priest - a man who devoted your entire life to serving God - and you went to bless a friend's house, and the house felt evil and you became violently ill, and every time you tried to warn them, something would happen to stop you.  On top of that, a young man had murdered his entire family in the same house a year earlier, AND a voice in the house had told you to GET OUT!!!  Then, your superiots think you are crazy, and no one will help this family.  It is your JOB as a servant of the Lord to pray for these people - to pray for mercy upon them, to pray for them to have the strength and the faith to save themselves. Additionally, the woman was a friend of his, so there was apersonal connection.  Considering all these factors, how exactly should one act when praying in the church?  I suppose they should be calm and collected?  Or maybe he should've just toned it down a bit?  I don't think so!  If you were really in that situation, then you could make a better assessment.  Until then, get over yourselves. What is it that you people don't like?  Was there not enough blood (until the very end)?  Did you need to actually see a killer to be scared? What makes this movie so scary to me is that you can't see what's doing this to them.  You can't even be sure if it is really happenning.  I'm sure this is how the characters felt. If anyone has ever been exposed to the paranormal, you know there are things in the universe we cannot explain.  And, sometimes there are malevolent spirits.  One thing we do know is that kid really did kill his entire family in that house.  And the real-life George Lutz really did have an uncanny resemblance to the kid. Whether it happened or not, I just like to watch the movie and imagine that it did.  That's why I watch movies - to pretend that what I am seeing is real.  I think this movie did an exemplary job.  And, it does rank alongside classics like The Omen.  In fact, I can't even think of an example of a better horror film.

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"22 December 2002","score":"","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       Our story begins in London where we meet our storyteller, Charles Dickens (Gonzo) and his pal, Rizzo the Rat. They tell the story of 'A Christmas Carol', although Gonzo wasn't really Charles Dickens, he knew the story like the back of his hand. And so it begins with the dark figure of Ebenezer Scrooge coming around the corner. Scrooge was a greedy, heartless old miser with no feeling for anyone or anything. At his office, his employees Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and some rats request some coal for the fire and Scrooge denies it. In comes Scrooge's nephew Fred who invites Scrooge to Christmas dinner. He rejects the invitation and then in come two collectors for the poor (Bunsen and Beaker). Scrooge wished to donate nothing and kicked them out. He then reluctantly gave Cratchit and the rats Christmas day off.       That night, Scrooge trudged home and settled in his house for the night. Dickens and Rizzo watched through the window. All of a sudden, Scrooge was visited by the ghosts of his former partners Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf). They were bound in chains, for they were being punished for all the heartless deeds they performed in life. They told Scrooge he was in for the same fate unless he changed his ways. Three spirits would visit him that night to help him. The first would come at 100. Scrooge just shook it off, but at 100 A.M., the Ghost of Christmas Past showed up. She showed Scrooge his past himself as a lad at boarding school, then he watched himself grow up, graduate and become an apprentice to Mr. Fozziewig (Fozzie Bear) who owned a rubber chicken factory in town and it was at Fozziewig's Christmas party that Scrooge met the love of his life Belle. The two just hit it off, but after some time had passed, Scrooge's love for money replaced his love for Belle and he lost her. Present Scrooge was devastated and returned home, only to be visited next by the giant, jolly Ghost of Christmas Present who shows Scrooge his nephew Fred's family celebrating Christmas and speaking ill of Scrooge. Next to Bob Cratchit's house. Wife Emily (Miss Piggy) was cooking the meager dinner and the children helped. Then in came Bob and Tiny Tim (Robin). Tim was on crutches and quite ill. The spirit told Scrooge that if these shadows remained unaltered by the future, he saw a vacant seat where Tiny Tim once sat.       Then the spirit's time was up. He vanished and was replaced by the tall, mysterious Ghost of Christmas Future. Dickens and Rizzo backed out because this scene was too scary. The ghost showed Scrooge that Tiny Tim had died, so had someone else in town that nobody showed any sympathy for. Scrooge found out who the deceased was himself! He was terrified and vowed to make up for his sins. He then awakened in his own room on Christmas day! He immediately began spreading Christmas cheer around town, including his nephew Fred's house. He then visited the Cratchit's home and brought a large turkey. He gave Cratchit a raise, donated to the poor, and everything was A-OKAY! And Tiny Tim, who did not die, found a second father in Scrooge, and he observed, God bless us, Everyone.       Pretty good adaption of A Christmas Carol! Sadly, Jim Henson and Richard Hunt died before this began production. That's very tragic! Henson and Hunt used to do Statler and Waldorf, among many other Muppets and their replacements sound nothing like them! Michael Caine was good. He's a very good actor so he was a good Scrooge. Gonzo and Rizzo keep us updated on all that's happening. So this Christmas, I recommend The Muppet Christmas Carol! And, as Gonzo and Rizzo point out, if you liked this, you should read the book.
