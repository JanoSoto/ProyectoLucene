John Malkovich plays a man who is determined to assassinate the current president and once he finds out Eastwood's character was one of the men who was with JFK during his assassination he begins taunting Eastwood's character. Rather good movie, though it is made much better thanks to Eastwood and Malkovich's presence in the film. There is a bit of action in this one and some humor as well. The movie at times moves a bit slowly though, but it is nothing that is really going to detract from the movie a whole lot. Rene Russo also stars in this one and plays a love interest for Clint and plays an agent also looking out for the president, her and Clint's scene where they try to get intimate is one of the more humorous parts in the movie. There is also an interesting scene in which Malkovich makes a rather unique gun capable of evading detection and it all leads up to a rather thrilling conclusion. A very good end to the film to say the least. Malkovich was up for an academy award for his role as the would be assailant, but the award ended up going to Tommy Lee Jones for his role in the Fugitive. I have to give a slight edge to Tommy, this role is one that really does not differ all that much from Malkovich's usual role.

The first being the multi acclaimed Silence of the Lambs and the third being Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer.Se7en is the kind of movie you can't stop watching. Since the opening sequence you know you are into a slick, atmospheric experience that is backed up by excellent acting, a solid plot, great dialogs, and suspense.You won't get a more interesting plot in a serial killer film. But it's not everything about the killer known as John Doe. The story behind the life of the rookie detective and his relationship with the veteran cop that is about to retire is excellent. They make the perfect on-screen duo of the 90's Horror\/Thriller genre.I enjoyed big time the accurate Criminology and Criminlastic facts such as techniques, theories, and more detailed situations.We have the chance to experience the film through the killer's eyes and understand his bizarre motives. Sure, the whole serial killer investigation is interesting enough to keep you watching, but also the personal situation between the young couple is what carries the film on it's back.The movie is not for those who have a weak stomach as the killer's motives are very explicit when shown. We have access to them via post-murder scenes when our heroes investigate them.The Direction is excellent. The movie is atmospheric but elegant at the same time. When big budgets are squeezed, you get great movies like this. The cinematography and art direction are outstanding and truly create an insecure place where you can actually feel there's a serial killer on the loose. The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman is one of those versatile actors who can master emotions and control the pace of the whole film. He's great and delivers plenty of emotions. Brad Pitt demonstrates he's not only a good looking guy but also a fine actor. Gwyneth Paltrow convinced me as the tender young wife who supports her husband's dangerous work. R. Lee Ermey is always a delight to watch!The ending is truly shocking. It will leave you sad, mad, shocked, and probably scared.I will remember Se7en for these scenes The opening murder scenario, when both detectives meet on a rainy day, the shocking ending, Paltrow's conversation in the cafeteria with Freeman, John Doe's introduction in the police station, the shaking apartment, etc.This is one of the best 90's movies.

In my review of that film, I talked about my experience seeing most of it probably not long after its video release in 1993. Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco must have been new (or fairly new) to the VHS format when I saw it for the first time in 1996. I was around ten years old when that happened, and can't remember much from my first viewing, but I do remember liking the film. After finally watching its predecessor from start to finish earlier this week, leaving me with mixed feelings, I watched this 1996 sequel for the first time in nearly fourteen years, and this time, I basically thought it was average.Chance, Shadow, and Sassy are still living with the same family, but the troublemaking Chance isn't sure if his young owner, Jamie Seaver, wants him around anymore. The family decides to go on a trip to Canada and take the pets with them. However, at the airport in San Francisco, when the three animals are in carriers about to be put in the cargo hold of the plane, Chance panics and the three of them escape! The plane takes of with the humans on board, who don't know that they are leaving their pets behind. The naïve young Bulldog, wise old Golden Retriever, and arrogant Himalayan cat find themselves lost again, this time not in the wilderness, but on the streets of San Francisco! While walking through the city, they meet many stray dogs, some good and some bad, and Chance even falls in love with one of the good ones, a Kuvasz named Delilah. The animals have to try and stay away from two cruel dogcatchers who drive around in search of dogs to capture and take to a laboratory! One thing that is meant for laughs in the first Homeward Bound film is the rivalry between Chance and Sassy, which continues here, and unfortunately, it's not that funny in either film. I once again didn't usually find either of these two characters funny, and was once again not that impressed with the voice-overs provided by Michael J. Fox and Sally Field. Just like in the first film, the humour in this sequel rarely works. There were times when I smiled, and I couldn't help but laugh a little when Chance runs off with a baseball player's catcher's mitt near the beginning, but this was not enough, and most of the dogs introduced in this sequel don't tend to help much. When I recently watched Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, I found that it was dull for a while but then improved when the big adventure began. However, while watching this sequel, I found that it basically continued to be dull when the adventure began, and stayed this way for most of the film. The adventure of the three pets here takes place in a very different setting, and we don't get the nice scenery. There is SOME suspense here, especially towards the end, but definitely less than there is in the 1993 release. I almost forgot to mention that the dog romance here also wasn't done do well, and it's something the original Homeward Bound doesn't have.Since I only found Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey to be barely above average when I saw it this month, I may not have ended up watching this unsurprisingly inferior sequel if I had never seen it before, but since I had previously seen Homeward Bound II Lost in San Francisco and remembered thinking it was good (better than the original at the time), I intended to watch it again and review it. Well, some movies one enjoys in their childhood can still be entertaining in adulthood, and some of them can't, and for me, this is one of the latter. I first watched it around the same time I first watched Jumanji, and I've seen that film again twice in the past few years and it hasn't disappointed me, but that didn't turn out to be the case with this Homeward Bound sequel. It seems to be considerably less popular than its predecessor, as sequels often are, and even though I'm certainly not as big a fan of the 1993 film as many clearly are, I think I can understand why, at least somewhat.

Really bad. Very unexciting, predictable, acting and lines make one cringe sometimes, plot that we saw 100 times and very shallow characters.Let's look at itThere is this shy, good girl Janey whose dream is to dance. To get to this dream she has to overcome obstacles like her very strict dad who didn't realize that his daughter isn't 7 anymore and a concurrence which is a spoiled, rich girl Natalie. All this time she has her friend on her side Lynne, who was described on the DVD cover as a cool rock chick. seriously? This is what teens in 80's saw as a cool rock chick? She came over more like a little preppy brat who thought that wearing a fun hat would make her a cool rock chick. And then there is of course a bad boy. Well, he is a bad boy because he wears a tank top....Horrible, just horrible. The only thing good about it are the fun clothes. And to see the actresses when they were young. Sarah Jessica Parker was pretty cute in it, can't say much against her. Helen Hunt has certainly improved in acting since then, I didn't just dislike her character but also the way she acted. I am also amazed by the fact that her looks never changed, she looks now the same as she did when she was 22. Pretty cool for her! Shannon Doherty wasn't much on screen, good for her.But yes, I can't imagine how people can like this movie u unless they are 10 year old girls or were 10 year old girls when this movie came out and want to be a little nostalgic.

The fifties and sixties were littered with movies where teenagers cruised around, got into trouble, and it culminated in some kind of an action-packed final confrontation, often enough it was a climactic drag race as in Graffiti. Most of these movies were pretty terrible and remembered only because they were mercilessly mocked in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.Graffiti though, despite having a capsule plot that is indistinguishable from those clunkers, is one of the great achievements in film history. What exactly makes this movie so good, then? I have to say it's because we very quickly care about the characters. This is accomplished simply enough - they are archetypes, familiar types of people we can all relate to, sometimes quite personally. There are the two guys heading off to college and a bright future. Steve seems happy with the decision, and is so ready to move on that he tells his hometown girlfriend they should date other people. Curt is ambivalent and leaning towards staying home, despite not seeming to have any particular reason to remain, as Steve does. John is the popular, savvy drag race king who is bitterly aware that he's being left behind as high school is over and he isn't heading to college. Terry is the geeky loser whose friends look out for him, and although the role starts out one-dimensional, depth is happily added as the movie progresses. There's a beautiful simplicity in the way we know these character's life stories and can relate to them within a minute of their appearance on screen. Part of it is the acting, part of it is the naturalistic yet poignant writing. The bottom line is that George Lucas makes us care about these guys, whereas with most movies like this from a decade before, we just felt like laughing at the leads. Once we care about the characters, Lucas is careful to give them a night full of amusing adventures and misadventures. Their experiences are triumphant and awkward at the same time, which is just perfect. The movie takes place over the span of one night at a crossroads in the lives of 4 young men. It's only right that things are exciting yet confusing, because that's just how life is when you're 18.The movie also has a great deal of nostalgic appeal, of course, and although for me, the answer to the movie's tag-line Where were you in '62? is not even born yet, I still love the ambiance, the time capsule quality of the movie. Of course, the music is a big part of this, but there's also the cars, the goofy slang words (this is boss!) and just that general nostalgia for the time period that pervades the whole movie.For me, American Graffiti compares well to its contemporary Mean Streets which is similar in feel in many ways but lacks Graffiti's intentional nostalgia and tidy package of an ending. Graffiti also stacks up well against its 70s nostalgia counterpart, Dazed and Confused. It's not that one is any better than the other, they're just both great nostalgia pieces on the time period they fixate on. If you've liked one you should like the other, I think.Graffiti is at its best when you feel like (or wish you were) in the car with the kids. It's all stuff you more or less went through if you had a typical suburban upbringing in America at some point in the last 50 years, and the movie does an exceptional job of capturing that. Although it all takes place on one night in 1962, it's surprisingly relevant today, and more modern viewers should track this one down. It's a lot more than just some movie George Lucas made before Star Wars. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 April 2010","score":"","review":" American Graffiti is, in a sense, not a new concept.

Renny Harlin follows John McTiernan's original with the same action packed spirit.Willis is again on witty top form and the story quite meaty for an action, wisely based on Walter Wager's novel 58 Minutes giving it a back bone. A team of terrorists is holding the entire airport hostage, as they plan to liberate a drug lord. Its an adventure with a a nice little twist.

The background score is haunting, stirring and graceful. A car is approaching towards what would be a mental hospital. It contains a dangerous man, R.P. McMurphy who has been sent to the mental hospital by the police. He had raped a 15 year old girl (I still can't believe how anybody could do that to a child. Come on people, be kind and civilized. Women aren't just objects to satisfy your needs. Don't be cruel animals.) and gotten into lots of fights at the prison, which thereby was concluded by the prison officials to send him into a mental hospital for clarification on whether he was really crazy or just pretending. He meets the head nurse Ratched (funny name) in the weekly routine therapeutic sessions with the other crazy people. She is controlling and everything proceeds as she wishes. He befriends the other people in the ward and they look up to him as their hero when he does everything he can to irritate Nurse Ratched. In due course of time, he even manages to be friends with the Chief Bromden (no, no. He's also a patient), who is a huge native American and apparently can't talk or hear. But, he confesses to McMurphy later in the movie that he is just pretending. The performance of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy is really haunting. This film has won 5 major Oscars - Best Film, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (adapted), only 2 others have managed that feat. Danny Devito's debut performance is heartwarming and the stammering boy, Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) gave such an outstanding performance that the climax will be remembered by everyone who has ever seen this movie. The professor in Back To The Future movies also does a good job here. Everybody in the film give awesome performances. But, I am still wondering, did Louise Fletcher really deserve that Oscar? I mean she played her role really well, but that is what all nurses do. They don't give free rein to the patients and take the hard decisions. The one scene I liked was when Billy commits suicide and both Ratched and McMurphy seem to be thinking that it is their fault for his death and McMurphy tries to strangle Ratched, which eventually leads to a procedure called Lobotomy to be done on McMurphy and he is brain-dead after that. In the beginning, I knew McMurphy was just pretending to be crazy. But, during his time in the hospital we can see the subtle changes in him. How could he allow his lover to sleep with someone else? (maybe she was a hooker, I don't know) And nobody seems to be commenting on Candy (Marya Small) who gave such a sweet portrayal of a woman who likes a bad person, but even then continues to give into his every demands. I liked her very much. The Chief didn't want McMurphy, who wanted to get out more than anything else, to live on like that. So, he strangled him to death and in truly symbolic reference lifted the water basin or something and threw it through the windows and escaped into the bleak Oregon morning. I thought McMurphy was the one who would fly out of the cuckoo's nest, but it wasn't the case. If McMurphy had lived and escaped, this wouldn't be a great classic and it wouldn't have been remembered still today. Director Milos Forman, pat yourself on the back for this amazing gem. Three brilliant moments in the film are 1. the fishing trip 2. the party in the mental hospital. 3. The jaw-dropping ending. This and the very real performances by the actors as mental patients made the film excellent for me. I am only glad that today's mental institutions don't resemble the prison-like hospitals back then. This also represents the society's attitude towards mentally challenged people. There is a scene where McMurphy tells the patients that they are no more crazy than the average goon out there in the streets, that was a brilliant scene. And the shock that flits over McMurphy's face when he finds out that most of them have come into the mental hospital voluntarily and he is one of the very few committed persons in there is awesome. The dialogue after this revelation in which he says to Billy that he should go out there and be in a convertible, bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver is supremely spectacular.

The score is soothing, relaxing and somewhat nostalgic and the well told story, about a man who hears a voice and turns the field his family adores into a baseball pitch, displays the themes of family, redemption and following your dreams. The script is like the film, honest, well crafted and has some delightfully poignant moments. And the acting is great, as he epitomises determination in a very dignified way Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances, and Amy Madigan is touching as his loyal wife.

Mr. Cruise was at the height of his career when this was made, and the audience is treated to virtual tour de force of Tom Cruise Movie Clichés, his rippling muscles, his abilities to outfight any physical superior and instantly master any required skill, and the volatile-but-misunderstood protagonist.

Particularly egregious is the sequence wherein our hero, never having ridden a horse prior, is able to suddenly master the meanest, most buckingest bronco EVER, within the context of an unfolding Land Rush and to overtake thousands of other more competent riders with trained steeds.This cloying and sophomoric script is overladen with schmaltz and sentimentality. Cruise and Kidmann are unlikable from the start and grow more so throughout the film. There are no characters anywhere of sufficient plausibility upon which the viewer may anchor his suspension of belief.This film contains every type of flaw characteristic of the early Ron Howard films, amplified and exaggerated, with none of the redeeming traits.
