[{"date":"21 April 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Driven is possibly the worst film ever made by Sly Stallone. There are so many things wrong with this film that its difficult to know where to start. Sly wants us to believe that Driven is depicting Formula One, yet it is painfully obvious to anybody with even a remote knowledge of motorsport that the single seaters in this flick are Champ Cars! Also, since when did Formula One cars start racing round ovals Sly? Can you answer that? No of course you can't, because the only Formula One oval action comes at the final turn of the Indianapolis circuit! The standards of acting in this film are beyond embarrassing, they are utterly imbecilic! Sly is as wooden as mahogany, whilst Burt Reynolds does an extremely poor Frank Williams impression. Oh what Sly? Was that supposed to be convincing. The film has no credibility at all! This film is so unbelievable it is annoying! The scene in which Sly and his team-mate race Champ Cars around the streets AT NIGHT IN FULL TRAFFIC WITHOUT HELMETS is so absurd that some kind of fine needs to be imposed! Firstly, it is impossible to start a Champ Car without electronic help and a team of mechanics, secondly your face would be blown apart even at low speed in a Champ Car minus helmet and thirdly, the bumps and potholes of an unprepared street would probably destroy the suspension! Come on Sly, how on earth did you think you could get away with that one? The acting is appalling, nobody shines in any way. The lines couldn't be more clichéd. The racing scenes look less convincing that some cheap old computer game. The storyline is dire and couldn't be more predictable if it got down on its knees and begged! The ending defies belief and is possibly the most contrived conclusion I have ever seen! Sly what were you thinking? This is junk! This is filth! This is beyond terrible! I cannot express how completely rubbish Driven is! Sly has starred in many great movies, Rambo and Copland springing to mind, but with this tepid offering he gives massive ammunition to his critics! In fact he gives them a nuclear bomb!!!!!!!!! Driven is one of those films that should never have been made! Sly we know you wanted to make Rocky on wheels, but with this you have tarnished your entire career!!! This film should win awards for how unbelievably bad it is! Worth seeing if only to marvel at how wrong Sly got it.

Man has walked on the moon, Concorde was able to break the speed of sound and the car has brought greater degrees of mobility to billions. How then can mankind have conspired to produce this film. It is so unforgivably tedious that those responsible for it should be charged with crimes against humanity. It's that bad! The endless song and dance routines sap the very life out of you. So over-the-top is the acting that one feels urges to unleash shotgun justice on all the participants immediately. All of the major characters are outrageously annoying, all of the minor characters invite your derision. The songs are appalling, but in the worst possible way. They stay in your mind and poison your sleep. You hum the tunes for days afterwards vainly hoping to forget their sheer banality! I cannot emphasise enough how bad this film is. Jim Broadbent is a fine actor, but he should hang his head in shame for starring in this sorry rubbish. To anybody with even an ounce of common sense regarding their film tastes, do not watch this movie! It will haunt you for days! This film has probably driven fathers to drink, their marriages have collapsed, their kids have turned to crime, people have been murdered and all because of this horrific offering. Moulin Rouge is probably the worst film ever made in terms of how much it will bore you to tears. Avoid it like the plague.

But the mayor of Amity refuses to close the beaches due to loss of profit, especially since they are right in the midst of the July 4th weekend, but when the rogue 25 foot great white shark makes a smörgåsbord out of the many tourists & townsfolk swimming in the lake one afternoon, Brody hires shark hunter Quint & shark expert Matt Hooper to help him in his quest to take down the beast, but as they soon find out, planning to capture the shark is very easy, but pulling it off will be anything but!JAWS is such a tremendously good film! The acting is so good! Not only are the characters very well written & well developed, but the it's almost hard to imagine anyone else playing these roles, even the smallest, least important bit part is strongly acted, which is a rarity in filmdom. STEVEN SPIELBERG'S direction is so indescribably awesome, that it helps elevate JAWS into an utter masterpiece! The film is nerve shreddingly suspenseful, with many jump out of you're seat moments & enough fake jump scares, that it will give even the most strongest of wills a jolt! The opening scene where the shark devours it's first victim in the waters of Amity at night, is still one of the scariest & best opening scenes ever to grace a thriller as tight as this one! The frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark, actually managed to work to Spielberg's advantage, the shark is never seen during a good portion of the films first half, instead we see the unseen monster burrowing under the seemingly safe waters of Amity Long Island. The first half of the film plays more like a pure suspense horror thriller, while the last half focuses on QUINT (ROBERT SHAW) MATT HOOPER (RICHARD DREYFUSS) & CHIEF BRODY (ROY SCHEIDER) sailing in the ocean trying to catch the carnivorous beast, while trying to sort out their own differences & strengths when it turns out that the shark they are trying to capture will be anything but easy, as the beast turns out to be a lot smarter than they ever thought it would be, in what turns out to be an pure adventure film. But for me, no matter how awesome JAWS is, I honestly don't think the film would have even achieved half it's success without JOHN WILLIAMS haunting & to this day, terrifying musical score, that is still recognized as being one of the best & most influential, well known scores to ever grace a suspense horror thriller, next to BERNARD HERMANN'S PSYCHO score, it also serves as a catalyst for the shark, signalling it's presence when it is not seen on screen, but trust me, when you hear that infamous score, you know the shark is in the midst! In fact, JAWS is one of the rarest movies that actually winds up being far superior than it's own novel on which it is based! The film notably drops several subplots from the book, the most recognizable one, was Brody's wife having affair with Hooper, while this may have proved a hindrance to most films when a few of it's subplots are dropped, JAWS actually benefits from it. Director Spielberg later admitted that he faked JAWS, that the film was not true to his own sensibilities, since it lacks the emotional manipulation that trademarks pretty much all his works to follow afterwards. Quint's monologue on the boat, where he tells both Brody & Hooper about the real life attack on the U.S.S. Indianapolis that he was on & wading in the waters while sharks made frequent visits to pick off his team, is so dramatic, captivating & so driving, that you can't help but not be carried along with it weather you want to or not. There is some gore involved, although nothing to heavy, we see a severed head, arm, leg & head, but JAWS doesn't focus on the gore, it's a pure suspense driven machine!Highly influential, often imitated but never duplicated. A series of rip-off's & imitators followed in it's wake, including PIRANHA, GRIZZLY & MAKO THE JAWS OF DEATH (which despite claims to the contrary, was actually written before this film) & a slew of others, with it's plot & characters still being ripped off today, in many killer shark movies. Based somewhat on a real life shark attack that occurred decades earlier in a small New England town. Look for PETER BENCHLEY as a reporter on a beach (he also co-wrote the film with CARL GOTTLIEB, based on Benchley's novel). All in all, JAWS is an absolute must see & easily one of the top ten best horror thrillers ever made! One of my all time favourite movies & deserves every bit of it's good word of mouth. A near perfect white knuckle thriller! Followed by three increasingly inferior sequels, starting with JAWS 2***** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"21 April 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After a female victim turns up on the shores on Amity, police chief Martin Brody determines the predator is not a serial killer, but a killer shark & asks that the beaches be closed down until they can bring down the carnivorous beast.
