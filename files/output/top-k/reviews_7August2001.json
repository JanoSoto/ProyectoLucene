I had very high expectations for the film, because I know how popular Tomb Raider (and, probably even more, Lara Croft) is, and because I know that a tremendous amount of preparation went into the making of the film. And besides that, Angelina Jolie stars as Lara Croft, and she pulls off the physical aspect of that role (face it, Lara Croft's body is even more well known than the game itself) with stunning closeness.There is a mediocre story in the film involving Croft's search for an artifact that carries with it tremendous power, including the ability to control time, if I remember correctly. Fueling Croft's efforts to achieve the artifact is her determination to live up to the legacy of her late father, played with a little tongue in cheek by her real life father, John Voigt.The story of Tomb Raider was not too impressive to begin with, and Angelina can barely pull off the fake accent (I shudder every time I anticipate Original Sin), but this is not what ultimately brings the movie down. Normally I try not to pick movies apart, but there was so much unnecessary stuff thrown in here that it makes you wonder what people were doing for all of the years that this movie was in production. It seems weird that no one noticed how weird it is to have Lara's father looking at the movie camera and talking, as though to her, while she reads a letter that her wrote her before he died. And also, whose idiot idea was it to have her do things like punch a guy in the head with the back tire of a motorcycle while she speeds by on the front wheel?! What a joke.On the other hand, every scene in which Lara handles guns is incredibly well done. I think that, for the most part, this is because Angelina just looks good pointing two guns and firing them that fast. The beginning action scene was pretty impressive for this reason. The action in the film was mostly pretty good, but there were several instances where it went over the top, as in the above-mentioned motorcycle scene. This is the same problem that we saw in Mission Impossible II, which could otherwise have been a good action movie, as Tomb Raider could also have been.I don't know enough about the game to comment on how well it was translated to the screen, but I do know from pictures of Lara Croft that Angelina did an excellent job in the role. There can be no mistake that the movie is directed at a younger audience (which makes you wonder about that brief half-nude scene), which probably accounts for most of the goofy action sequences, so be advised of a certain inherent immaturity before you watch it. It's an entertaining enough movie, but be warned.

I started to read the book, but unfortunately, I never got past the first few pages.  I just put it down and for some reason I never picked it back up.  Oh well.  I loved The Silence of the Lambs.  I think that Anthony Hopkins portrayed pure evil.  Really, I have never seen pure evil on screen.  Just looking at him in that movie made me shudder.  Not to mention that Ridley Scott directed it.  He's not one of my favorite directors, but he does show some potential.  I thought that the movie wouldn't be as good as the last, but I thought it would be better than this.First of all, Hannibal is beautiful.  It's a shame this wasn't nominated for Best Cinematography.  I swear, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Kudos to who ever is responsible.Second, Julianne Moore is, in my opinion, better at playing Starling than Jodie Foster.  I love Foster.  She's one of the best actresses out there.  But her fake Southern accent always bugged me.  It just sounds fake.  Not `Nicholas Cage in Con Air' fake, but I never thought it sounded right.  Being a born and breed Southerner, I can tell a fake accent when I hear one.

No one may be able to recognize him, but he does a great job.Now, let me get to the bad stuff.  The movie is nothing like Silence for several reasons.  The biggest one is that all of the characters have changed.  It's ten years later from Silence.  Hannibal has ceased to be the creepy psychopath from Silence and has become more of a philosopher.  Starling is no longer the idealistic FBI rookie, but is now a worn out veteran.  None of this is bad.  But, what made Silence of the Lambs so creepy was that Lector was behind bars.  He was down right evil.  In this movie he is free and he is no longer evil.  Well, he is, but he isn't the same kind of psychological evil from Silence.Another bad point of the movie is Ray Liotta.  He was good in Heartbreakers (shoot me, I liked it) but he is TERRIBLE in this.  Egad.Another bad point is that the movie's ending (I won't give it away) is rather stupid and convenient.  This is the second movie I've seen in a row where Anthony Hopkins has cut off his own hand.My finale complant is the editing.  I loved Gladiator, but I hated the way it was edited.  Well, Ridley Scott does it again.  I hate it when directors cut movies real quick with close ups.  I like the camera to be further away from ther action and I like long takes.  Shoot me, that's the way I like it.  Why?  Because when they shoot action scenes real fast (or slow motion), with a million cuts for one scene, where the camera is in the action, it's damn hard to see what's going on.  Not to mention it's easy to fake.  I love action scenes that are one take long where the camera is back far enough so I can see what the hell is happening.  That was a problem with Gladiator and that is a problem with Hannibal.In conclusion, Hannibal isn't a bad movie, but it isn't great.  Like I said, it's a beautiful film with great sets and gorgeous cinematography.  It is not as gross or nasty as some people have made it out to be (but it's still rated R, so why the hell do you parents persist in BRINGING YOUR BABIES WITH YOU!  FIND A BABY SITTER OR JUST DON'T COME!).  Ridley Scott directed the movie well, but it is horribly edited.  The story is rather weak.  The movie is worth the money but it does not meet the sheer brilliance of Silence.  Silence shocked you mentally.  Hannibal tries to shock you with blood and guts.  It's still a good movie, though it isn't good enough for me to want to see it again.

She is obnoxious, stuck on herself, lude, crude, cruel, obnoxious, contemptuous, transparent and as fragile as a mirror being carried across the street in a car chase scene in an action film.   But the question that I kept asking myself in this film was, Is this what the majority of Hollywood starlets are like or this just an abberation?  Hollywood does a masterful job of marketing their stars so that you see just what they want you to see.  But what are they really like?  I was once on the set of FX 2 in Woodstock Ontario.  I somehow managed to sneak onto the set and I was in awe watching Bryan Brown and Rachael Ticotin go to work.  When the cameras stopped rolling, Brown sat in his chair alone, and read the paper.  I meekishly sauntered over to him and upon seeing me, he put down his paper and smiled at me.  I proceeded to have a very cordial and pleasant five minute conversation with him about Bryan Dennehy, the first F\/X film and whether or not he thought this one would do brisk business.  All throughout, he was very pleasant and didn't once seem act as though I was a burden.  I have met some famous actors since, but none have been more accomodating than he was.This is a film written by Billy Crystal and directed by studio head Joe Roth.  I'm sure they have plenty of information to go on here, and have personally seen many know it all's come and go.  And for that reason alone, I think this was a great film.  Robert Altman is known for his smart takes about Hollywood in films like The Player and even in an inferior film like Pret A Porter, but this film, I'd have to say is one of the better ones I've seen.  Crystal offers a harsh look at what goes on behind closed doors or when the cameras stop rolling and it is not a flattering picture.  There is also some wicked humour in here and some of it is at the expense of some of the bigger names in Hollywood.  In one small scene that had me in stitches, Lee Philips, played by Billy Crystal, tries to get Gwen, played by Zeta Jones ( who is married to Michael Douglas) to come to a party to meet promote a film that her and her former husband did together.  Gwen's new Spanish squeeze with a speech impediment, played hilariously by Hank Azaria comes in and Phillips cordially says hi and reassures Hector that he is just there for business, not to hit on Gwen.  Hector replies that he is not threatened by Phillips, he is much too old for Gwen.  Given the fact that Zeta Jones is married to Douglas, this was a very well written line and it is observations like this one that I applaud the film for.  Another astute one is where everyone calls each other by their first names except when the studio head walk in, then it is Mr Kingman, not just Dave.America's Sweethearts is a fantastic film.  It is quite funny and it is littered with witty dialogue, excellent performances, and one of the best comeuppances that one character has received in film.  There are films like Pulp Fiction and Rambo and such where the character that you hate gets paid back by acts of violence.  But in a film like this one, they get it back in much worse terms.  The ending of this reminded me of Pret A Porter, where at the end of Robert Altman's film, the fashion industry is first shocked and then like sheep, overjoyed at the simplicity of the new fashion statement that the designer has created.  Only in this film, the actress is not all too joyed to be publicly exposed for who she really is.I recommend America's Sweethearts for all that it is.  The studio was smart to market this as a Julia Roberts film, but it is much more than that. Crystal and Roth should be lauded for making a candid film like this and Catherine Zeta Jones was quite a good sport to play the role that she did. After all, maybe Julia Roberts could have switched roles with her.I also have to mention John Cusack.  He has been a favourite of mine since doing The Sure Thing in 1985.  He has grown into an impressive actor with a versatile resume and this will probably be his biggest hit of his career. I would like to see him and Julia Roberts do more films together because I think they have a real chemistry together.9 out of 10-- One of the better films to come out in the summer of Apes, Fast Cars, Green monsters and Dinosaurs.

Species is a terrific example of a trailer flick.  Lots of action, lots of science fiction technobabble, alien monster designs by H.R. Giger (of Alien), good actors, a drop-dead gorgeous, sexy babe to play a sex-crazed alien . . . what more could a filmgoer (or, at least a sci-fi filmgeek) want?  As it turns out, quite a lot, actually. Like a plot.  Or a sense of direction.  Or an ounce of common sense.  Or a clue.   Species features none of these commodities, which makes it unappealing for the vast majority of filmgoers; it also features precious few moments of excitement, gratuitous violence, and gratuitous nudity, which makes it unappealing for the teenaged male filmgeek audience.  Either way, the movie is pure garbage, little more than a Friday the 13th, Part 5 film with a sci-fi label slapped on its side.The convoluted mess that passes itself off as a story in Species actually starts off with a slightly interesting premise Radio telescopes pick up signals from deep space that, when translated properly, reveal a formula for an alien DNA string that can be combined with human DNA. This DNA combination, in theory, should produce a hybrid creature that has both human and alien characteristics, allowing humans to learn about this alien species in a manner that is at least slightly familiar ground.  The premise, though, quickly devolves into schlock as the alien hybrid -- named Sil (Natasha Henstridge) -- quickly develops and matures into a blonde bombshell capable of posing as a Penthouse centerfold.  She also develops a need to breed with human males -- turns out that her progeny, of course, will turn into vicious alien killers that want to destroy humankind.  Scientists figure out a little too late that Sil is basically bad news for mankind, so she is able to escape from them without much difficulty, and it is left up to Professor Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) and his motley crew of scientists and soldier to either capture or destroy Sil before she can mutate into her true, disgusting, alien form &#150; and is able to set in motion the destruction of the Earth . . .Species is predictable to a fault, and offers no insight into any of the potential (and few) interesting ideas it offers.  Who are the alien beings? Where do they come from?  Why do they care about humanity at all, and why do they want the human race wiped out of existence?  Because alien beings are bad -- at least that's the only explanation offered.  Sil, the alien hybrid, also offers some true glimmers of interest.  At one point in the film, when confronted with her destructive nature, she asks her creators What am I? in a somewhat pitiful manner -- her need to mate and destroy is driven by instinct, not by conscious thought, and even she recognizes the horror lurking inside her.  A savvier film would've explored this idea further; Species instead chooses to focus on deep, insightful things like Sil removing her bra in slow motion, blood, and big explosions.  By the time our supposedly smart heroes are chasing Sil through a dark labyrinth of sewers, it's obvious that Species has nothing to offer apart from the message offered in the first ten minutes -- alien beings are bad.The direction of Species is obscenely lazy -- most of the supposed thrills generated by the film involve Sil jumping out of the darkness and attacking things.   This works maybe once or twice, but after the first dozen or so times, it stops being even remotely scary.  Director Roger Donaldson's solution to this problem is so simply start adding blood and gore to these scenes, which again works once or twice . . . and then gets boring fast. Unfortunately, everything gets permanently boring somewhere around the halfway mark of the film.  Species is a film that thinks it's enough to just show up with cool-looking monsters and special effects . . . wrong. It's called suspense, and it's sorely missing from this film.  You'd think that a film borrowing from the look and designs of Alien would at least have the decency to check out how Ridley Scott made Alien a masterpiece of suspense.The acting?  Not much can be said about it, apart from it's mediocre at best, awful at worst.   It's hard to knock Natasha Henstridge for a role that merely asks that she become eye candy for the first half of the film -- she does exactly that, and nothing more.  I hope she was paid well. As for Ben Kingsley . . . I'm a big fan of his in other films, but he simply mails in a performance here.  He actually looks bored in his scenes.  I can't say I blame him, given how bad this flick is, but still, c'mon, a little effort, please?  The rest of the cast is completely forgettable, which is probably a good thing.  I wouldn't want to be remembered as a featured actor in Species, either.Species is a film that aspires for big-budget greatness.  Unfortunately, it's crap that even Roger Corman wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. There's worse sci-fi films than Species -- namely, Species 2 -- but not many.
