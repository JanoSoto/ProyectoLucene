[{"date":"25 February 2002","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  A high school comedy for adults. In an institution as authoritarian as the average American high school, elections for the student body are exercises in tokenism. This doesn't stop one Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon)  from putting her all into getting elected president. She has some competition from a dim jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who is put up to it by teacher Jim Macalister (Matthew Broderick). Macalister wants to revenge his former colleague Novotny who fell foul of Tracey's charms and was dismissed but instead he gets himself into lots of trouble.Good dialogue, a fast pace and a cynical attitude help to make this an effective satire. Political correctness is seen as just another way of keeping people in line, and when it is incovenient it is ignored.

Now, I understand its intention. It's supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek action-comedy that requires you to check your brain at the door.  So it's a trashy film.  There's fun trash and there's dull trash.  This is dull trash.There's lots of humor, lots of high-energy action.  But neither works out. The humor is so low-brow, awfully timed and delivered.  The action sequences seem straight out of a video game.  As Roger Ebert said, This is the kind of flick where the bullets have read the screenplay.  The only ones who get shot are the ones who HAVE to get shot.  Mark Wahlberg busts in, in the first sequence, facing an army of baddies--every one armed--yet he manages to nail every one of these b*****ds with his magic machine gun.  Not once does a bullet even brush through his hair.  The action is so stylized it's like a ballet.  I'm waiting for MarkyMark to get into his tutu and do a couple of pirhouettes, as he flamboyantly fires bullets left and right.The storyline doesn't make a bit of sense, and if this were an entertaining action piece I would excuse the weak storyline.  People come back to life after getting caught in the midst of massive explosions.  I've seen tons of action and horror flicks where people come back to life after being virtually mutilated, but this movie takes the cake.The characters are completely one-dimensional, and not the least bit interesting.  Wahlberg is a mild-mannered hitman (what a cool oxymoron!) who just wants to be liked.  Awwww, such pity.  Lou Diamond Phillips is a trash-talker who will do anything for the buck.  Bokeem Woodbine is a chronic masturbator (yes, you heard right) who's addicted to smut.  And there's another dude who's...an utter dumbass who can never get his words right.  Christina Applegate plays the stereotypical Jewish girl with stereotypical Jewish parents (Elliott Gould and Lainie Kazan).  But Lainie Kazan, as the mother who bashes his daughter for dating a non-Jew, has some amusing moments and I actually got some chuckles.  You seem like a good...German-Catholic fellow, she says sarcastically in the middle of a card game.  And Gould has some funny moments as the alcoholic father. Sure, the two characters are alarmingly one-note, but at this point I don't care about artistic integrity.  I just want to be entertained!Mark Wahlberg is not EXACTLY a terrible actor.  I thought he was good in Fear and fairly good in Boogie Nights, though I can't understand why he was even considered for an Oscar nomination.  In this movie, he has absolutely NO expression whatsoever!!!  A piece of cardboard could've played this role better than him.  I've seen Wahlberg in interviews and he seems to have virtually no personality.  I think he should've stuck to being a rapper\/underwear model.  If he didn't have the looks and the body, he would've been tossed out the movie biz in an instant.  He could easily be replaced by any other young, good-looking actor--with more talent.  Lou Diamond Phillips has showed off his talent in several early films including LaBamba where the played rocker Richie Valens.  But recently, he's sunk into the direct-to-video circuit.  And he lets his talent be even lesser known in this hammy performance.  Avery Brooks is also extremely hammy as the villain Paris.You can say this is a guy flick, but the chicks will probably love it too and overlook all its flaws as the sight of the gratuitous male locker room nudity takes over their psyche.  Yes, women will probably appreciate this flick because there's no female nudity.  So there ya go, chicks.  You got your wish.Even the soundtrack is lame.  I was wondering why I saw the soundtrack for this movie on the discount rack, selling for $3.99.  The title song is I'm the Man in which that's the only lyric you hear.  It's goes like I'm the man, man, man, man, man, man!  The man, man, man, man, man!  You think with a big-budget like this they could afford some real artists.No, I didn't take this movie seriously.  But I wasn't laughing either. It's just stupid, stupid, stupid.  The kind of film that caters to the lowest common denonimator of movie audiences.  If you're under the age of 17, ignore my comments.  But if you have a shred of maturity, please avoid this clunker at all costs!My score  3 (out of 10)              ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2002","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie gets dumber by the nanosecond!

I thought he was good in Fear and fairly good in Boogie Nights, though I can't understand why he was even considered for an Oscar nomination.  In this movie, he has absolutely NO expression whatsoever!!!  A piece of cardboard could've played this role better than him.  I've seen Wahlberg in interviews and he seems to have virtually no personality.  I think he should've stuck to being a rapper\/underwear model.  If he didn't have the looks and the body, he would've been tossed out the movie biz in an instant.  He could easily be replaced by any other young, good-looking actor--with more talent.  Lou Diamond Phillips has showed off his talent in several early films including LaBamba where the played rocker Richie Valens.  But recently, he's sunk into the direct-to-video circuit.  And he lets his talent be even lesser known in this hammy performance.  Avery Brooks is also extremely hammy as the villain Paris.You can say this is a guy flick, but the chicks will probably love it too and overlook all its flaws as the sight of the gratuitous male locker room nudity takes over their psyche.  Yes, women will probably appreciate this flick because there's no female nudity.  So there ya go, chicks.  You got your wish.Even the soundtrack is lame.

Now, I understand its intention. It's supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek action-comedy that requires you to check your brain at the door.  So it's a trashy film.  There's fun trash and there's dull trash.  This is dull trash.There's lots of humor, lots of high-energy action.  But neither works out. The humor is so low-brow, awfully timed and delivered.  The action sequences seem straight out of a video game.  As Roger Ebert said, This is the kind of flick where the bullets have read the screenplay.  The only ones who get shot are the ones who HAVE to get shot.  Mark Wahlberg busts in, in the first sequence, facing an army of baddies--every one armed--yet he manages to nail every one of these b*****ds with his magic machine gun.  Not once does a bullet even brush through his hair.  The action is so stylized it's like a ballet.  I'm waiting for MarkyMark to get into his tutu and do a couple of pirhouettes, as he flamboyantly fires bullets left and right.The storyline doesn't make a bit of sense, and if this were an entertaining action piece I would excuse the weak storyline.  People come back to life after getting caught in the midst of massive explosions.  I've seen tons of action and horror flicks where people come back to life after being virtually mutilated, but this movie takes the cake.The characters are completely one-dimensional, and not the least bit interesting.  Wahlberg is a mild-mannered hitman (what a cool oxymoron!) who just wants to be liked.  Awwww, such pity.  Lou Diamond Phillips is a trash-talker who will do anything for the buck.  Bokeem Woodbine is a chronic masturbator (yes, you heard right) who's addicted to smut.  And there's another dude who's...an utter dumbass who can never get his words right.  Christina Applegate plays the stereotypical Jewish girl with stereotypical Jewish parents (Elliott Gould and Lainie Kazan).  But Lainie Kazan, as the mother who bashes his daughter for dating a non-Jew, has some amusing moments and I actually got some chuckles.

She spends most of the movie with a vacant expression on her face that gives way to unprovoked screaming fits.  Her character starts the film as a jerk who treats people badly and end the film as a jerk who treats people badly.  The plot, in fact, has no effect on her personality.  This is amazing, cuz the plot is such a lame moralistic fable to begin with.  Innocent girl (from NY City?) makes it to the big city, works her way up and finally succeeds by sinking to the depths of the people around her.  This makes her want to leave, cuz, you know, she's become everything she's ever hated or something.  The problem with this story is that Nomi STARTS OUT as an awful jerk who would push a colleague down some stairs to get ahead - she just hasn't thought of it yet.  So the story, which anyone over the age of four has seen before, is pointless.The dialogue is atrocious - it's Penthouse Letters stuff.  It's how horny old men think young women talk when they're in the bathroom.  That said, there's a lot dialogue in this movie that is unforgettable in the same way that Battlefield Earth makes variations on `I have leverage' unforgettable.Kyle MacLachlan spends the whole movie with a stupid stoner smirk plastered on his face.The sex&#133; ohmygod the sex.  The simulated sex scenes in this movie are comic gold.  At least twice that I remember Nomi mounts the MacLachlan character and does this move on him that looks kinda like a fish out of water.  Her spine&#133; it sorta whips up and down so that her torso is flipping in mid air. The hilarious part is that one of the sex scenes is in a hot tub and when Nomi does her thing, her body slaps and plops the water.  Besides being unerotic, the sex scenes go on forever.I have never, ever, before in my life, wanted women in movies to put some clothes on.  I admit it - I'm disgusting.  When the sex scene got started in Muholland Dr., the thought going through my mind was `THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!'  But Showgirls takes the juvenile male urge to stare at boobies and pummels it.  About half way through the film all I could think about the all those breasts is that support is a matter of comfort.  It just seemed merciless to depict a world where there are apparently so few bras.Anyway, that's the funny stuff.  Now for the awfulness.  Black people are nurturing.  There are two characters for Nomi to crap on, despite their best efforts to help her out.  Glenn Plummer plays a dancer who wants to help Nomi perfect her absolutely jaw-dropping dancing talent and Gina Rivera plays a sweet person who takes Nomi in when she arrives in Vegas.  When Rivera's character, Molly, first meets Nomi, Nomi is attacking Molly's car cuz her luggage was stolen and the car was nearby when she needed to hit something.  Instead of beating Nomi senseless, Molly buys her some food, offers to be her roommate and help finding a job.  And it goes on like that. Nomi is basically infantalized during scenes with Molly.  This is true of Glenn Plummer's character as well, who spends most of his screen time chastising Nomi like a parent about wasting her talent.  Of course, in the dark world of Showgirls, nice people can't exist.  Plummer's character turns out to be a guy who says that every girl is a dancer of extraordinary talent to sleep with them (but with Nomi, he really means it) and after mothering Nomi for half the movie, Molly gets gang raped cuz&#133; I dunno, victims are always asking for jerks to be nice to them and that's what she gets or something equally insightful.Everyone in the film keeps talking about how Nomi is a phenomenal dancer. I didn't see anything to justify this.  Actually, they labored the point so much that it invites scrutiny that her dancing can't live up to.  It's kinda cruel really.  What if someone made a movie with Steve Buscemi where everyone marvels at how handsome he is?  I don't think there's anything wrong with his appearance, but if you spent two hours being asked to look at him and admire his features...Anyway, this movie is bad in so many ways, but it's memorable.  It's like watching Plan 9 for the laughs, but different.  It played recently at the Midnight Mass in SF - a venue that plays camp classics like early John Waters and the Mommy Dearest.  Verhoeven and Eszthehas set out to make a naughty, dark movie.  Instead they made a crude, incompetent and disgusting film.

He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as Goodfellas is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in Casino, Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in Goodfellas. It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than Goodfellas, but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of copying himself. (How can a filmmaker copy himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob skimmed all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam Ace Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp \/ boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods).  Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's nice-and-neat policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride & greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as Casino. Longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer Robert Richardson gives Scorsese's Las Vegas a polished, glossy look; bathed in neons, pastels and solids of every color imaginable. God's gifts to Editors - that being Scorsese's number-one partner in crime, Thelma Schoonmaker, creates a smooth but frenetic pacing in Scorsese's storytelling. The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on Ace Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of Casino could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor\/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to Goodfellas need only regard this - Casino is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in Goodfellas had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like Casino, because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece.

The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on Ace Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of Casino could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor\/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to Goodfellas need only regard this - Casino is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in Goodfellas had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like Casino, because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"25 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Like Oliver Stone's JFK and Tim Burton's Ed Wood, Scorsese had created a bit of monster for himself when he released Goodfellas in 1990. He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as Goodfellas is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in Casino, Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in Goodfellas. It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than Goodfellas, but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of copying himself. (How can a filmmaker copy himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob skimmed all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam Ace Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp \/ boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods).  Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's nice-and-neat policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride & greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as Casino.

That may not be true for some of the greats ( Spielberg comes to mind, he was just brilliant from the beginning ) but for the Coen's, it is quite evident in their work.  My favourite Coen films are O Brother...., The Big Lebowski and Fargo.  These films appear to be the work of film makers that have developed their craft.  Their is a maturity in the writing and a head first slide into the bizaare.  And that is what has given the Coen's the reputation that follows them around now.  They are known as film makers that can give us something that we have never seen before.  If nothing else, when watching a Coen film, you know you're about to see something original.  The Coen's are pariahs of sorts but they are pariahs whom everyone wants to work with.  So give them credit for not being exactly like the next guy in Hollywood.  For the most part I enjoy Michael Bay films and Jerry Bruckheimer and some of the others that come along and make cookie cutter films, it is however refreshing to see film makers that have their own ideas and don't follow conventional paradigms.  The Coen's are their own creation and that is what makes them so revered.Now having said all that, let me just say that Blood Simple suffers from inexperience.  If you compare their latter films to this film made some 18 years ago, you will see a true progression in everything they do.  The writing is sharper, the characters are multi layered and the direction is a little more risky.  Blood Simple is an intriguing enough story, it's just that it suffers from characters that behave as though they are in a Saturday Night Live skit.  These are the type of characters that should be in a comedy that depends on people mistaking what's going on because no one talks to each other.  No one explains what they just did or what is happening, so they decide to act on what they think they know.  This kind of plot device was made famous in Three's Company.  For anyone who remembers that show, think of how many times someone was hiding in closet so they couldn't see what was taking place, all they could do was hear what was happening.  If you hear something without the benefit of the visual stimulus that goes with it, you can easily mistake someone taking out the garbage to someone having kinky sex.  This is what Blood Simple suffers from.  No one talks to each other here, and if they did, then perhaps there would be no movie and maybe that should tell you something right there.  To me, that means that the script needs some fine tuning.A fairly wealthy bar owner feels that his wife is having an affair with one of his bartenders.  He hires a private investigator to follow them.  When he gets the pictures proving his suspicions he gets to be little bit beyond reproach.  Not only is he hurt that his wife did this to him but he feels as though he was played for a fool.  So this being a Coen film, he has to do the worst possible thing imaginable.  He hires that same Private Dick to murder them.  One thing leads to another and now each member involved becomes entangled in a twisted imbroglio where no one seems innocent, except for maybe the wife that cheated on him in the first place.  She may have cheated but she sure doesn't want anyone dead, she just wants to get on with her life, without her husband.  Soon, people begin to turn up dead and everyone thinks the next person had something to do with it.  And this is where the film takes the wrong turn.  Instead of explaining what each of them did, like perhaps most normal people would do, everyone looks at each other like a deer caught in headlights.  This causes everyone to be left in the dark and wondering what just happened.  And this becomes frustrating because you want to shout at those involved.  You want to tell them to just open their mouths and tell each other what happened.  But instead of that we get the Three Company scenario and no one knows what the hell is going on.An example would be something like this(Man returning from killing someone) It's done.(Woman he is talking to) What is?(Man) I don't feel to well, I don't know how you can ( he says this, thinking that she was the one that shot him in the first place).(Woman with slightly confused tone in her voice ). Honey are you okay?  You don't look too well.(Man, with confused look on his face) You want me to leave don't you?(Woman with a slight confused laugh ) Honeeey!?(Man with a somber look ) Okay, I get it, I'll go.This is the kind of banter that goes on in this film.  People don't explain themselves and instead of opening their mouths to tell each other how they are feeling, they assume how someone else is feeling and thus they act accordingly.  Of course, this dilemma could be solved if someone would just say what is on their mind, but no one does.Blood Simple has an intriguing enough story, it's just too bad that the characters don't justify the story.

The location of the hidden money is very clever, all the more so for being right under everyone's nose all along (including the audience).  In addition to an intriguing story filled with colorful characters, this film is also packed with terrific dialogue of the witty banter variety.  This contributes enormously to the film's charm, which, other than its stars, is its most bankable asset.  No wonder it is so well-regarded.I'm frankly puzzled by people who seem to resent the fact that this film is compared to Hitchcock.  As though anyone attempting to imitate Hitchcock must be, by definition, a fawning little hack.  Stanley Donen is no hack, and he wasn't fawning.  He realized that Hitchcock was monopolizing a genre he didn't invent, and thought Why should he be the only person allowed to make such films?  Now, Donen doesn't have the reputation Hitchcock has, which is understandable enough.  When compared to films like Rear Window or Vertigo, Charade looks rather slight and unimportant.  But it stands toe-to-toe with a film like North by Northwest, and is stronger, I'd say, than Notorious or Strangers on a Train, just to pick out a few examples.  The blending of comedy, romance, and suspense is a difficult one to pull off, and Hitchcock didn't always get it right.  Charade does. The only complaint I have is a small plot detail.  Granted that Cruikshank must adopt a false identity for the purpose of a) deceiving the Marx brothers and b) finding out whether or not Reggie is involved, he gives Reggie one or two more false identities than he has to.  He tells her he's Peter Joshua, then that he's Alexander Dyle, fine.  But by the time his Dyle persona is blown apart, she already trusts him for the most part (as evidenced by the ease with which she accepts his rather thin story about being a thief), so why not just tell her the truth?  But it's a small flaw, and it doesn't do anything at all to undermine the enjoyment one takes in this lovely and endlessly watchable film.

As though anyone attempting to imitate Hitchcock must be, by definition, a fawning little hack.  Stanley Donen is no hack, and he wasn't fawning.  He realized that Hitchcock was monopolizing a genre he didn't invent, and thought Why should he be the only person allowed to make such films?  Now, Donen doesn't have the reputation Hitchcock has, which is understandable enough.  When compared to films like Rear Window or Vertigo, Charade looks rather slight and unimportant.  But it stands toe-to-toe with a film like North by Northwest, and is stronger, I'd say, than Notorious or Strangers on a Train, just to pick out a few examples.  The blending of comedy, romance, and suspense is a difficult one to pull off, and Hitchcock didn't always get it right.  Charade does. The only complaint I have is a small plot detail.  Granted that Cruikshank must adopt a false identity for the purpose of a) deceiving the Marx brothers and b) finding out whether or not Reggie is involved, he gives Reggie one or two more false identities than he has to.  He tells her he's Peter Joshua, then that he's Alexander Dyle, fine.  But by the time his Dyle persona is blown apart, she already trusts him for the most part (as evidenced by the ease with which she accepts his rather thin story about being a thief), so why not just tell her the truth?  But it's a small flaw, and it doesn't do anything at all to undermine the enjoyment one takes in this lovely and endlessly watchable film.

Enough already.The story of this film is wonderful.  Sure, while everybody gets distracted by watching Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn cavorting happily through Paris (and very distracting they are), the story of this film really deserves more credit than it gets.  The location of the hidden money is very clever, all the more so for being right under everyone's nose all along (including the audience).  In addition to an intriguing story filled with colorful characters, this film is also packed with terrific dialogue of the witty banter variety.

Of course, the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner, who was established as a loose cannon.  But as the series continued, he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett, cracking jokes left and right.  Needless to say, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best on-screen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites, but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats, yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director, and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. And each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver  You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much.  That's a priceless line!  OK, so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining, yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz, adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough, and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast, to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls, there's always a sexy love interest in the Lethal Weapon movies.  In the second movie, there was Patsy Kensit. And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks he's getting too old for this s**t and is about to retire.  He's suffering a severe middle-age crisis and to add to his problems, he ends up killing one of his son's friends--which he did out of self-defense.  Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy action\/comedy, he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  Lethal Weapon 3 again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.

Other than that, this is pretty empty.  Plus we get not one, but two dramatic chases in the film, which is where it could've nearly saved itself a little.  I actually sat up in suspense wondering if one of the characters was about to be killed.  Wow, a tragic ending!  I didn't expect it!  But, nope, you're standard reuniting and hug.  Even Dave Grusin, one of my favorite composers, delivers a totally out of place tv commercial-type score.  Way too upbeat.  I'm so surprised at all the good reaction here on IMBD.

How can you not succeed with maybe the best male and female actors of our time, a forbidden romance and a great locale?  Well, they manage to do it here.  Big problem number one neither is involved in a bad marriage.  Maybe it's ordinary, but it's not bad.  Therefore their spouses are giving them no reason to stray, which makes Streep and De Niro look hurtful.  Big problem number 2 this is one of the most uneventful and worthless romances ever entered into on film.  They both exceedingly behave like a couple of grade schoolers having their first crush.  Absolutely nothing to talk about, dull lunches and phone calls, no spark!  You can see them finding each other interesting, but it's not enough to warrant the making of a movie.

The story is absolutely incredible and the special effects are top-notch.  The look of the futuristic world is incredible and the look of the 1950's is also great!  There really isn't enough good things I can say about this movie!  It's absolutely incredible.SPOILERS AHEADThere is one complaint\/question I have though, if Biff got a hold of the Almanac and Time Machine in 2015, went back to 1955 to give himself the Almanac, and then went back to 2015 to return the time machine to Marty and Doc Brown...wouldn't he be in a different 2015?  I guess it can be argued that Marty, Jennifer and Doc would still be at their future house regardless of the world changing around them due to Biff's traveling through time, but I don't know, I guess it just didn't sit right with me.  I hope what I'm trying to say makes sense.  Time travel is such an unstable subject, there are so many paradox's that can occur.  But anyhow, I'm not going to let this one little plot point ruin the whole movie for me.  It's still a great movie and should definitely be seen.One other thing I'd like to say is that the ending of this film is without a doubt my favorite ending of any movie I've ever seen.  What I mean by this is when Marty is in 1955 and finds out that the 'Doc' is still alive in the 1855 and realizes that he knows exactly where the 1955 Doc is, he goes to ask for his help.  The actual scene in particular that I'm talking about is when Doc sends Marty into the future due to the lightning storm and then Marty comes running down the street and says that he needs his help again.  I just LOVE that scene, I think it's such a cool scene and leaves you dying to see Part III.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go see it, and if you haven't seen the first in the series, then see that first.

Basil is a perfect portrayal of Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and many don't know that it was based off a book about a mouse who lived the life of his idol, none other than Sherlock Holmes.Personally, I love this movie because it has a colorful, developed cast of characters.Basil is not your average Disney hero, having no love interest at any point in the movie; he is also a super-intelligent character and often bursts into fits of scientific observation.  His facial expressions are timed well and are very well done, as well as his general movement.  He is very excitable and you can tell he adores working on cases.  He doesn't really like children, as you can see from the way he treats Olivia in the beginning. You really get a feel for Basil when watching him, and he's not easy to forget.  Kids may not understand half of the things he's saying, but it's fun to watch.Olivia is the little heroine mouse who starts Basil on his case, losing her father to a mysterious peg-legged bat of whom Basil is aware of.  She is extremely plain-drawn and has no emphasis on her gender really, save for the bow in her hair and her voice, making her very realistic.  She also acts alot like a realistic little girl, in her laugh, in the way she reacts to things, even in the way she exclaims father! when reunited with her toymaker father.  Her curiosity is classic, and she has a high adoration for Basil, though he doesn't appreciate her at the start of the story.Dawson is the elder mouse who finds Olivia looking for Basil of Baker Street.  He isn't sure of who Basil is, but they end up finding him together.  Dawson is, of course, Watson in mouse form, and helps Basil in his first case, being this movie.Ratigan is the villain played by the late horror film star Vincent Price, and quite well in my opinion.  He has the likeness of Mr. Price in the way he moves and acts.  Of course, nothing is weirder than hearing him sing, but it happens twice in the movie-- The World's Greatest Criminal Mind and Goodbye, So Soon were both written specifically for Price.  He is not one of the more frightening villains as far as his looks, and is unique in that up until the climax he uses his intelligence to battle Basil, instead of the strength he obviously posesses.  On a special note, Ratigan dislikes being called a rat for some reason, though I cannot remember why.Fidget is probably one of the darkest villain henchmen in a Disney movie. He is frightening to children in appearance and voice, and the music accompanying him adds a comical aura.  Fidget is by far my favorite Disney henchman, just because he's funny.  The one thing that bothers me, though, is that a few times in the movie, his peg leg switches from right to left. I think it was just for the reuniting scene in which Olivia steps on his only foot, so it was switched.The movie has many fast-paced scenes, including Investigation At The Toy Shop and Big Ben Chase, among others.  My personal favorite is Big Ben Chase, because it is one of the longest Disney climaxes and it is a very unlikely setting.  The movie itself is about Olivia's toymaker father being kidnapped by Fidget, and her turning to Basil for help.  Basil's nemesis, Ratigan, is linked to the bat, and Basil, who was reluctant and annoyed by Olivia's protest at first, jumps at the oppertunity to see if he can finally defeat Ratigan.  The movie goes from there with its many twists and turns, to quote Basil.If you want a fun-filled, unpredictable adventure, The Great Mouse Detective is your best bet.  Especially if you're a Sherlockian or Eve Titus fan who has yet to see this exiciting portrayal of Basil of Baker Street.
